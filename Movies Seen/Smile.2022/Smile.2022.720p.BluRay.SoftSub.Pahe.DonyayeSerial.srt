1
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,045
Dr. Cotter.

2
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,297
He's gonna die. She's gonna die.
Mom's gonna die.

3
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,007
I'm gonna die. Everybody dies.

4
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,217
I don't wanna... I'm gonna...

5
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,679
I haven't been able to get him to talk...

6
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,097
respond to me, nothing.

7
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,142
Just this.

8
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,227
Yeah. I got it.

9
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,229
Thanks, Dan.

10
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,441
She's gonna die. Mom's gonna die.
I'm gonna die. Everyone dies.

11
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:33,528
Nobody matters. She doesn't matter.
He doesn't matter. Mom doesn't matter.

12
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,657
I don't matter.
Nothing ever matters. I don't matter.

13
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,618
I don't matter.
He's gonna die. She's gonna die.

14
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,162
He's gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Everyone dies.

15
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,082
Nobody matters. She doesn't matter.
He doesn't matter.

16
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,376
Everyone dies. I'm gonna die.
Nobody matters.

17
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,503
She doesn't matter. He doesn't matter.

18
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,506
Mom doesn't matter.
Nothing ever matters. I don't matter.

19
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,676
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

20
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,720
She's gonna... she's gonna...
Everyone... I'm gonna...

21
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,931
I don't matter. I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

22
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,021
Hi, Carl.

23
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,692
What's going on today?

24
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,362
I'm dying.

25
00:03:15,386 --> 00:03:17,386
No.

26
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,032
I don't think so.

27
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,079
I think you're having
another manic episode.

28
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,205
Don't...

29
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,249
Don't you tell me.

30
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,710
You don't know.

31
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:33,630
I feel it all around me, squeezing.

32
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,803
I'm scared.

33
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:45,642
Carl, I know that
what you're experiencing feels real,

34
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,769
but it can't hurt you.

35
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,692
I promise.

36
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,904
He's gonna die. She's gonna die.
Mom's gonna die. I'm gonna die.

37
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,407
Everyone dies.
Nobody matters. She doesn't matter.

38
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,616
Hey, Wanda.

39
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,203
I'm gonna put Carl Renken into observation
for a few days. He's harmless.

40
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,748
Just make sure someone checks on him
every couple hours.

41
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,374
- You got it.
- Thanks.

42
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,626
Hey, Dr. Desai was looking for you.

43
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,794
Thank you.

44
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,018
No! No! Please!

45
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,062
Please! You don't understand!
I can't go in there! No!

46
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:34,441
No! No! Please!

47
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,797
Come in.

48
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:02,010
Hey, did you send a patient named, uh,

49
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,679
Sarah Marquet over to residency yesterday?

50
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,682
Yes. She has a history
with drug abuse and mania,

51
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,702
and she's been in and out of our unit
a few times.

52
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,978
Rose, she has no insurance.

53
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,605
Okay, but she needs treatment.

54
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,808
The board is down my throat
about paying out of pocket

55
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,526
for another bed in the residency program.

56
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:22,155
The board should try giving a shit about
the point of our job here once in a while.

57
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,742
I'm not questioning your judgment.

58
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,387
Okay, I just need you to come to me first
so I can get ahead of it next time.

59
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,621
- All right?
- Yes.

60
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,040
Okay. I'm sorry.

61
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,876
Hey, you haven't been here
since the late shift last night, have you?

62
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,204
Dr. Cotter.

63
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,040
Laura Weaver, 26. She's a grad student.

64
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,209
Police were called on her
for public disturbance.

65
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,253
- EMS brought her in.
- Got any psych history?

66
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,297
Nothing on file,
but the police sent over a report

67
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,674
for a different incident
she was involved in last week.

68
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,634
And what was that one about?

69
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,804
A professor at her school
bludgeoned himself to death with a hammer.

70
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,056
She was interviewed as the only witness.

71
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,433
A hammer?

72
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:43,378
Hi.

73
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,529
Laura?

74
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,286
My name is Dr. Cotter. I'm a therapist.

75
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,704
Do you wanna sit down?

76
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,083
-[Gasps] - Okay.

77
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,629
I know you're nervous.

78
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,172
That's okay.

79
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,550
I just wanna have a chat.

80
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,761
I promise this is a safe place.

81
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,305
Not for me.

82
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,558
Why do you say that?

83
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,274
Come on. Let's sit.

84
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,991
Please.

85
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,220
Okay. I'm gonna have to ask you
a couple of questions

86
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,763
that might sound stupid.

87
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,185
What day of the week is it?

88
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,145
Thursday.

89
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,398
And the month?

90
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,983
October. I'm not crazy.

91
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,735
- Nobody's saying that.
- No, but I need you to understand.

92
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,780
I'm a PhD candidate.
I'm not some lunatic. Okay?

93
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:13,743
Let's just take a breath,
and you can just tell me what's going on.

94
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,714
I'm seeing something.

95
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,385
Something no one else can see
except for me.

96
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,889
I know how insane that sounds. I do.

97
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,309
But it's... this thing, I can't explain it.

98
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,312
What is it you're seeing?

99
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,357
It looks like people,

100
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,067
but it's... it's not a person.

101
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,237
I'm not sure I understand.

102
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,614
It looks like people.
It looks like different people.

103
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,325
Sometimes it pretends
to be someone that I know.

104
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,078
Sometimes it's a random stranger.
Sometimes...

105
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,748
Sometimes it looks like my grandfather

106
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,167
who died in front of me when I was seven.

107
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,088
But it's all the same thing. It...

108
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,426
It's... it's like...

109
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:17,098
It's... it's like it wears people's faces
like... like masks.

110
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,976
Okay.

111
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,103
Do you see it right now, here?

112
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,068
What happens when you do see it?

113
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,490
It's smiling at me.

114
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,367
But not a friendly smile.

115
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,453
It's the worst smile
I've ever seen in my life.

116
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,956
And whenever I see it,
I just get this god-awful feeling

117
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,168
like something really terrible
is gonna happen.

118
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,089
I've never felt scared
like I do when I see it.

119
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,551
Laura, have you
or anyone else in your family

120
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,970
ever experienced hallucinations?

121
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,931
It's not a hallucination, no. It's real.

122
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,016
You don't get it. It does things to me.

123
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,143
It causes shit to happen around me.

124
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,814
It's taken over my whole life
and my mind and...

125
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,817
it tells me things.

126
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,488
It told me that to...
today... today's the...

127
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,991
Today's the day that I'm... I'm gonna...

128
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,660
Okay. That's okay.

129
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,828
That's okay.

130
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:26,793
I know that what you're experiencing
feels incredibly real.

131
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,754
Sometimes, when we get
emotionally overwhelmed,

132
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:33,424
or experience an intense trauma,
our minds tend to...

133
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,884
You're not listening to me.

134
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,678
Oh, my god.

135
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,266
I'm gonna fucking die,
and no one will listen to me.

136
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,767
Okay. Laura, it's okay.

137
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,186
Oh, god.

138
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,939
Hey, it's okay. Laura.

139
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,066
Hey, c-can you look at me, please?

140
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,610
It's okay.

141
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:54,862
Look at me.

142
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,788
Oh, my god. No!

143
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,165
No! It's here!

144
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,583
- Please!
- Hey. It's okay.

145
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,852
- It's just us.
- Get away! Please!

146
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,156
- There's nobody else here.
- No!

147
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,139
Oh, my god.

148
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,854
I... I have a patient emergency in eval 2.
I need staff here now.

149
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:28,938
Hurry.

150
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,002
Laura?

151
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,742
Had Ms. Weaver
ever been a patient here before?

152
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,767
No.

153
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,853
Would you say she was typical
of the patients you see here?

154
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,981
This is an emergency psychiatric unit.

155
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,109
Typical is not really a thing here.

156
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,236
Right. But she was a head case, yeah?

157
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,405
I'm sorry, a head case?

158
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,497
I think we're just trying to get
your opinion of her mental state.

159
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,253
She could've been suffering from...
Acute post-trauma psychosis.

160
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,425
She was having paranoid delusions.

161
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,260
What kind of delusions?

162
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:52,350
She was convinced that some...
sort of evil presence was haunting her.

163
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,477
Yikes.

164
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,190
It's just, we're gonna have to contact
Ms. Weaver's family

165
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,234
and attempt to explain what happened.

166
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:05,238
So we're looking for anything
that might make some sense of all this.

167
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:09,200
If there's anything else you can tell us,
that... that might help.

168
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:22,422
Uh, before she died...

169
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,010
she was... smiling.

170
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,597
Yeah, she sounds fucking crazy to me.

171
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,050
- Rose.
- [Gasps]

172
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:15,677
Whoa.

173
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,099
My bad. Did I scare you?

174
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,892
I didn't hear you come in. Shit.

175
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,769
- Hi.
- Hi.

176
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:25,793
Hi.

177
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:27,773
What's up?

178
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,151
Nothing. Sorry.

179
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,862
Something's wrong.

180
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,159
A patient died today.

181
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,785
My patient.

182
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:41,346
Ah.

183
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,830
Hey, come here.

184
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,124
I'm sorry.

185
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,419
It happened right in front of me.

186
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,379
It was awful.

187
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,507
I'm so sorry. What can I do?

188
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,055
This is a nice start.

189
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:07,730
Maybe we should bail on dinner tonight.

190
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,693
We can't.

191
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,364
Holly hired a sitter,

192
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,325
and it's just gonna be a bigger headache
if we don't go.

193
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,535
No way. Holly turning into a headache?

194
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,081
Hey.

195
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,779
I'm sorry, you wanna talk to
me about being tired?

196
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:43,099
Now that Jackson's in the first grade,
I'm literally up at 6:00 a.m. every day

197
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,476
to make him breakfast and pack him lunch.

198
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,271
God knows what kind of non-organic garbage
that cafeteria is even serving.

199
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,874
Then I have to drive him to school,

200
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,942
barely have any time
to run my own errands.

201
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,628
Like, I haven't been to Pilates in weeks.

202
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,362
- Okay, my body is so fucked.
- Not true.

203
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,239
Then I have to go back to school,
pick him up,

204
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,282
then I have to take him
to either soccer practice,

205
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,034
swim lessons, karate, theater...

206
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,078
Oh, and he just started taking Spanish.

207
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,289
I mean, my weekdays
are literally impossible.

208
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,752
Mmm. You are coming Saturday, right?

209
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,004
What?

210
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,091
Uh, sorry, what's Saturday?

211
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,051
- I'm sorry, is that a joke?
- Wow.

212
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,345
- Rose, Jackson's seventh birthday party.
- Wow.

213
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,264
I've told you, like, five times.

214
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,640
I can't. I have work.

215
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,518
What do you mean work? It's Saturday.

216
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,602
I work Saturday.

217
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,689
See, this is exactly why you have to
get out of that gross hospital

218
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,733
- and into a private practice...
- Gross?

219
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,943
- It is not gross.
- ...where you're actually working normal-people hours.

220
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,821
Rose, there have to be
plenty of crazies out there

221
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,656
who will actually pay you for your time.

222
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,242
Thank you so much for your input, Greg.

223
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,326
That's very sweet.

224
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,328
I'm just saying, why become a doctor

225
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,456
if you can't get disgustingly rich?

226
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,819
You're kidding, right?

227
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,710
Rose loves being a doctor.
She'd do it for free.

228
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,754
What...

229
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,924
Well, on the subject
of wasted earning potentials,

230
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,568
- we could always sell the fucking house.
- Can we not right now, please?

231
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,596
I just... I don't understand you.
It's just sitting there.

232
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,514
We grew up in that house.

233
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,476
Rose, it's a total teardown.
Why not just get the money for the land?

234
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,269
Can you guys just shut the fuck up?

235
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:12,772
Wow.

236
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,816
Thank you.

237
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,234
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

238
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,155
I've been looking forward to this.

239
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,356
You okay?

240
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,941
Yeah.

241
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,001
Morning, doc.

242
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,422
Morning.

243
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,601
Hey. Yesterday,
that patient, Laura Weaver...

244
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,145
The police had sent a report
about a different incident

245
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,564
that she was involved in.

246
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,316
- Can you get that forwarded to me?
- You got it, Doc.

247
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,027
Also, I was supposed to have
a session with Jane Park.

248
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,530
Oh, yeah. She pulled out
a bunch of her hair overnight

249
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,948
and swallowed it all.

250
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,534
They took her down to medicine
to have her stomach pumped.

251
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,744
Shit.

252
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,080
Uh, Rose.

253
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,712
- What... what are you...
- I was on a... I was on a call nearby,

254
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,338
and I just thought I would...

255
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:08,679
We didn't really get to talk yesterday,
other than the whole... whole thing.

256
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,724
And I just wanted you to know
that when the call came in,

257
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,226
I had no idea it was gonna be you.

258
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,936
So, I'm sorry if that was weird.

259
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,813
It's your job. I get it.

260
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,691
How you been?

261
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,735
Joel, why are you here?

262
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,488
Like I said,
I was on a call nearby, and I just...

263
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,990
I thought I would...

264
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,161
come check on you.

265
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,831
You know after everything that happened yesterday,
that's... that's not an easy thing.

266
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,251
Okay. I appreciate it,
but I don't need you to check on me.

267
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,466
Right.

268
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,260
No, yeah, I mean... sorry.

269
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,263
I have to get back to work.

270
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,807
- Yeah.
- See you around.

271
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,566
You do know she's engaged, right?

272
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,528
Yeah.

273
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,240
I'm single.

274
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,112
- Hello.
- Hi.

275
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,823
Um, look, I just wanted to say sorry
about last night, okay?

276
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,909
I shouldn't have
kept going at you like that.

277
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,369
Uh, no, I...

278
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,663
I should apologize.

279
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,791
I've been just dealing with some stuff.

280
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,460
I wasn't being very good company.

281
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,171
Okay. If you can't make it to
your nephew's party tomorrow,

282
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,590
you could at least get him a present.

283
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,885
If you need an idea,
he's really into electric model trains.

284
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,470
Uh-huh.

285
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,848
You sound weird. Are you okay?

286
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,975
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

287
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,002
Hey, Carl.

288
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,589
How you feeling today?

289
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,476
Carl.

290
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:06,982
Carl?

291
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,616
She's gonna die. I'm gonna die.

292
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,451
- Everybody dies.
- Carl, look at me.

293
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,369
You're going to die.

294
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,080
You're going to die.

295
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,831
You're going to die.

296
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:26,376
You're going to die. You're going to die.

297
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,630
You're going to die. You're going to die.

298
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,381
- You're going to die.
- Help!

299
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,675
Help! This patient is 5150!

300
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,594
- He needs to be restrained!
- Go, go, go!

301
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,847
No! No!

302
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:40,700
No!

303
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:44,686
No! No! No! No!

304
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,814
No! No!

305
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,483
No! No!

306
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,507
No!

307
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,997
He was aggressive.

308
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,000
Acting psychotic.

309
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,711
Carl Renken has been
in and out of here a dozen times

310
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:13,006
and has never exhibited behavior
even remotely aggressive.

311
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,259
- Do you think I'm making it up?
- Of course not.

312
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,678
But yesterday, a patient in your care

313
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,222
killed herself brutally in front of you.

314
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,100
Is it possible, when you presumed

315
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,060
that Carl Renken was a danger to himself,

316
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,396
that that's what your mind
was reacting to?

317
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:34,653
I suppose I could've misinterpreted
the situation and overreacted.

318
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,532
Okay.

319
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,326
So, here's what's gonna happen.

320
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,580
You're gonna take a paid week off.

321
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,415
Morgan, that's really not necessary.

322
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,877
You've been working 80-hour weeks
for months.

323
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,754
I'm concerned
that you haven't been sleeping.

324
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,592
We can't help these patients unless
we have our own mental health in check.

325
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,468
And it's in the unit's best interest

326
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,679
if you just take a week
and clear your head.

327
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,891
Just do what you gotta do
and come back focused, okay?

328
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,251
Fuck!

329
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,482
[Gasps]

330
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,700
- Hello?
- This is First Line Security.

331
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,035
May I have your name and the passcode?

332
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,079
Uh, Rose Cotter.

333
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,539
Um, "Acapulco."

334
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,458
Ma'am, we've detected a door alarm.

335
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:43,336
Yeah, uh, the b... the back door
of my house is open.

336
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,172
Are you alone in the house, ma'am?

337
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,007
Yes.

338
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,383
Are you sure?

339
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,011
What?

340
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,097
Are you sure you haven't
let something inside, Rose?

341
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,435
Look behind you.

342
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,370
[Gasps]

343
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,091
Shit.

344
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,142
Hello?

345
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,769
This is First Line Security.

346
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,896
May I have your name and the passcode?

347
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,253
We did a full sweep inside and out.
It's all clear.

348
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,422
Um, what about the back door?

349
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:12,551
Is it possible it wasn't fully latched
last time it was closed?

350
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,346
I... I don't know. Maybe.

351
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,681
Hey, I wouldn't worry about it.

352
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,350
These false alarms happen all the time.

353
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,894
If anything else comes up,
you can give us a call.

354
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,896
Okay.

355
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,315
Evening, sir.

356
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,901
Um, evening.

357
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:34,906
What happened?

358
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,661
Mustache?

359
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,206
Mustache.

360
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,710
So, is there a reason you set the alarm?

361
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,463
I literally don't remember doing it.

362
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,550
I must have just, like,
set it by accident or something.

363
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,595
By accident?

364
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,639
Sorry. Sorry.

365
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:04,769
My head has just been in this, like,
foggy, creepy, spacey place all day.

366
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,814
And there was this weird incident at work,
and then...

367
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,108
And then my boss is making me take a...

368
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,489
Sorry.

369
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:19,534
- Everything's okay.
- Are you sure?

370
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,495
No, I'm fine. I was just venting.

371
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,749
Okay.

372
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,547
Can you see if you can find Mustache?

373
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,507
I haven't seen him anywhere at all.

374
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:35,717
Yeah.

375
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,517
Rose, did you break another glass?

376
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,607
Mustache?

377
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,487
Come on, kitty.

378
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,200
Please. Please.

379
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,372
Mustache.

380
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,739
It looks like people.
It looks like different people.

381
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,266
Sometimes it pretends
to be someone that I know.

382
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,144
Sometimes it's a random stranger.
Sometimes...

383
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,771
Sometimes it looks like my grandfather

384
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,649
who died in front of me when I was seven.

385
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,235
But it's all the same thing. It...

386
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,988
It's smiling at me,
but not a friendly smile.

387
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,240
It's the worst smile
I've ever seen in my life.

388
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:25,034
Whenever I see it,
I just get this god-awful feeling

389
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,288
like something really terrible
is gonna happen.

390
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,417
Oh, my god! No! No!

391
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,253
No! It's here! Please!

392
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:38,131
Get away! Please! No!

393
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,885
I have a patient emergency in eval 2.

394
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,721
I need staff here now. Hurry.

395
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:47,766
Laura?

396
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,861
Laura?

397
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,916
Laura?

398
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,126
Rose.

399
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,552
Laura?

400
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,979
Rose!

401
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,408
Rose?

402
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,328
Whoa! Oh, my god! Rose! Rose! Whoa, whoa!

403
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,789
What the fuck? Rose, put the knife down!

404
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,043
Rose!

405
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,605
Hi.

406
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,650
Rose?

407
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,736
This is a surprise.

408
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,200
It wasn't so much the blood.

409
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,493
It was, um...

410
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,538
her face.

411
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,415
The look that she had.

412
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,917
How did it make you feel?

413
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,089
Terrified, obviously.

414
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,845
Vulnerable.

415
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:50,722
Guilty.

416
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,223
Guilty?

417
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,851
Well, she was my patient.

418
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:59,063
She was a disturbed young woman
you only met for ten minutes.

419
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,024
Yeah. I just...

420
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,319
I just feel like I've gotten stuck on it.

421
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,821
I can't, you know, get it out of my head.

422
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:10,617
Have you considered
the reason you feel stuck

423
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,328
could actually be more about
your mother's suicide?

424
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,043
Do you still blame yourself?

425
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,630
That...

426
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,381
I'm really not trying to relitigate

427
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,259
that part of my life right now. So...

428
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,888
What would you like to talk about?

429
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:38,978
I was hoping that I could get
a script for Risperdal.

430
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,611
Ever since that...

431
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,406
Patient, I've been, um...

432
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,077
Seeing things

433
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,829
and hearing things.

434
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:01,167
I'm sure it's just a symptom
of post-trauma.

435
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,670
Let's avoid any self-diagnosis.

436
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,548
What is it you've been seeing and hearing?

437
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,097
Echoes of what happened with my patient.

438
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,683
You know, just fleeting moments

439
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,977
of stress-induced hallucinations.

440
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,357
But when they're happening, they feel so...

441
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:29,487
corporeal and unsettling.

442
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:35,076
Rose, from where I'm sitting, you don't
seem delusional or disordered to me.

443
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,954
And certainly not psychotic.

444
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,832
It's my impression
this experience with your patient

445
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,752
triggered old anxieties compounded
with too much stress, not enough sleep.

446
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,506
You have wounds
that have never fully healed.

447
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:53,886
And it is possible they never will completely.
That's the nature of trauma.

448
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:57,306
But you can learn to get control over it.

449
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,811
Have you been continuing to see patients

450
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,646
while you've been coping with all this?

451
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,525
- No. I'm just taking a short hiatus.
- Good.

452
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,653
If you want my advice,

453
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,405
use this time to do something different.

454
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,782
Anything that will take your mind off

455
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,076
the triggers that are causing you stress.

456
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,621
I also think it would be helpful

457
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,208
if we resumed our regular sessions again.

458
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,506
Sure.

459
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:38,347
And what about the Risperdal?
Just... you know.

460
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:42,018
Let's talk again next week
before we consider any medication.

461
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,439
In the meantime, you can always call me.

462
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,486
Sure.

463
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,913
No, I asked you for a white wine spritzer.

464
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,313
Geez.

465
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,942
- Oh, my god. You made it.
- Hi. Surprise.

466
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,443
- Come on in. Come on in.
- Oh.

467
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,363
I thought you had to work?

468
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,949
- Oh, I decided to take the afternoon...
- I'll take that.

469
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,700
Hey, Greg. What are you doing?

470
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,120
- I told you not to take those out yet.
- Mmm, mmm.

471
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,496
Geez.

472
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,706
Uh, ladies, I have to go corral
my dipshit husband.

473
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,501
Would one of you please show my sister
to the adult refreshments?

474
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,003
Sure. We have a stash
in the kitchen. Come on.

475
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,172
Wait. You're that therapist, right?

476
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:54,298
Yes, I... I am.

477
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,300
Oh! Fantastic. Can I ask for advice?

478
00:43:56,384 --> 00:44:02,265
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

479
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:07,520
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

480
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,648
♪ Happy birthday... ♪

481
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,386
So cool.

482
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,598
Gracias, Harper. Gracias, Harper's mom.

483
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,479
Ooh, that one's from Aunt Rose.

484
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,525
Open it!

485
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,028
Rip it open!

486
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,753
What'd you get, sweetheart?

487
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,019
No. No.

488
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:33,481
- Oh, my god.
- No, no. Mustache.

489
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,819
What the hell is wrong with you?

490
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,404
This can't be happening.

491
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,913
No. No, no.
No, I promise you, this wasn't me.

492
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:52,333
It wasn't. It wasn't me, I swear.

493
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,461
You have to...
You guys have to believe me, please.

494
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,547
Somebody please fucking believe me.

495
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:11,519
What the fuck are you?
Leave me the fuck alone!

496
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,730
You see her. You have to see her.

497
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,733
Please, Holly,
tell me that you see somebody.

498
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:18,859
Please.

499
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,929
- [Oh, my god.
- [Guest 2] Oh, god.

500
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,059
Hey, Rose.

501
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:53,893
Fuck.

502
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,064
I heard you were brought into the ER.

503
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,066
I wanted to come check on you.
How're you doing?

504
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,569
Fine.

505
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,405
It was just an accident. Thank you.

506
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:08,659
Yeah. They... they said that you had
had an anxiety attack.

507
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,079
Rose, I'll be honest with you,
I'm... I'm concerned.

508
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,603
And I... I mean this as your friend,

509
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,875
but I really think
you should speak to someone.

510
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,210
Are you seeing anybody
professionally right now?

511
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,093
Rose, are you listening?

512
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:51,911
Wait.

513
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,830
I need to tell you something,

514
00:47:54,914 --> 00:48:00,628
and I need you to know
that I'm not crazy, okay?

515
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,380
Okay.

516
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,506
Okay.

517
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:10,971
Something is happening to me.

518
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,770
And it's gonna be really hard
for you to believe.

519
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,900
Maybe we should just go inside.

520
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:26,028
No, wait. Just listen to me! Sorry. Sorry.

521
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,322
I'm really sorry.

522
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,241
Okay, um...

523
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,953
Something is threatening me.

524
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:40,418
Some kind of a evil spirit, or energy.

525
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:45,131
I... I don't really know what it is, but...

526
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:48,634
But I think that it...
It killed my patient.

527
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:53,139
Because she described experiencing
the same thing before she died.

528
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:56,976
And now it's somehow
attached itself to me.

529
00:48:58,561 --> 00:48:59,603
And...

530
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,189
I'm just really scared

531
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,859
that something bad is going to happen.

532
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,200
I really need you to say something.

533
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,078
What do you want me to say?

534
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,084
I want you to believe me.

535
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:24,295
Rose, you're talking about
a fucking ghost.

536
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,338
No, no, no. It's not...

537
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:27,715
It's not a ghost.

538
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,426
It's something else.

539
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,719
Okay.

540
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:36,849
I'm sorry.

541
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,101
I can't.

542
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,854
I cannot fucking do this right now.

543
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,439
No. Trevor.

544
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,649
Whoa, wait. No, no, no. Don't walk away.

545
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,737
I need you...
You're not listening to what I am saying.

546
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,363
Okay, Rose.

547
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:55,951
What the fuck am I supposed to say
to respond to this right now?

548
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,537
Do you hear yourself?
I mean, Jesus Christ. You sound crazy.

549
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,331
I am not crazy!

550
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,249
Sorry. Sorry.

551
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,919
But it's genetic, isn't it?

552
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,296
What?

553
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:09,965
Mental illness.

554
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:13,052
You can inherit it from a parent.

555
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,136
I looked it up.

556
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,638
Why would you look that up?

557
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,432
Because...

558
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:22,603
I wanted to know what I was
potentially hitching my entire life to.

559
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,814
Is that so fucking unfair?

560
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,110
I'm going in the house.

561
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,488
No, no, no. Please, Trevor. I'm in danger!

562
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,614
Rose.

563
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,575
- Did you kill Mustache?
- N... no!

564
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:40,329
No! That was not... that was not me.

565
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:43,499
Then tell me, what happened to him?

566
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,461
It was the... thing.

567
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,673
Trevor, please.

568
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,466
Please. Please.

569
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,803
Please. Please.

570
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,129
- Rose.
- [Gasps]

571
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,556
Come here.

572
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,337
Rose.

573
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:57,591
Baby...

574
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:01,470
Please. Help me.

575
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,933
- Mommy made a mistake.
- No, no, no.

576
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:09,978
No, no, no.

577
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,501
Rose!

578
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:15,710
Hey! Look where you're going!

579
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,028
- Are you crazy?
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

580
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,094
Mrs. Munoz?

581
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:48,934
At first,
I noticed small changes in him.

582
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:54,148
Then it all happened so fast.

583
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,609
He was on edge.

584
00:53:58,527 --> 00:53:59,862
Paranoid.

585
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:04,867
He would wake up
in the middle of the night, screaming.

586
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:09,288
I'd never heard him scream before.

587
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,752
Then he just stopped sleeping altogether.

588
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:21,300
I would catch him having
these conversations with himself.

589
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,885
He was seeing things.

590
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:27,347
Doing strange things
that he didn't even seem to remember.

591
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,975
Then one morning he was gone.

592
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:35,647
That night, the police called
and told me he was dead.

593
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,195
They asked me to identify his body.

594
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:44,448
His face.

595
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:48,911
Twenty-five years of marriage,

596
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,789
and that's what I have left
to remember him.

597
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,503
I'm so sorry.

598
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:13,602
Did Gabriel ever describe
the things that he was seeing?

599
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,525
I'll show you.

600
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,288
I should take it all down,

601
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,291
but I can't stand being in here.

602
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,813
This is what Gabriel said he saw.

603
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:10,158
He kept saying it was trying
to get inside of him.

604
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,414
That is Gabriel's brother.

605
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:19,042
He died in an accident 20 years ago.

606
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:22,129
Gabriel never got over it.

607
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,006
How long had this been going on?

608
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,090
Ever since he got back

609
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,551
from that damn conference
he would go to every year.

610
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:32,639
It was because he saw
that awful woman kill herself.

611
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,101
But no one reports on that.

612
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,523
He watched someone die by suicide?

613
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,234
Yes.

614
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,028
I assumed you knew this.

615
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,404
What was her name?

616
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,158
I don't remember. I'd have to find it.

617
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,041
Did... did he ever, um...

618
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,086
say why all of this was happening?

619
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,506
Did he find any explanation
in all of this?

620
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:10,093
What kind of reporter are you?

621
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:14,640
Mrs. Munoz, your husband was not insane.

622
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:18,185
The things that he was seeing,
they're real. I've seen them.

623
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,104
What are you, a fucking nutcase?

624
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,773
- What?
- Some kind of morbid fanatic?

625
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,566
How fucking dare you?

626
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,026
No, please. Please.

627
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,820
What happened to your husband
is happening to me.

628
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:31,031
Out of my house.
I want you out of my house, now.

629
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,468
Just please give me the name.
Please, just give me the name!

630
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,911
Get the fuck out of my house!

631
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,615
Oh, fuck. Shit.

632
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,629
Yeah?

633
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,303
Hey.

634
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,395
Come on in.

635
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:00,662
Finally got rid of that ugly yellow couch.

636
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,165
Uh-huh.

637
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,959
So, uh, what's up?

638
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,087
I assume you're not here to catch up

639
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:12,090
considering the cold shoulder
the other day.

640
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:16,303
I need a favor.

641
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,638
I need you to not ask
any questions about it.

642
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:21,516
Terrific. Yeah, let's hear that.

643
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,435
Uh, so, nine days ago,

644
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:27,022
a man named Gabriel Munoz killed himself.

645
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:32,819
I need to know if he had been involved in
any other recent police reports.

646
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,447
Can you find that out? Here, for me.

647
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,240
Come on. Are you serious?

648
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:41,495
This is my one day off. Go to the station.

649
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,913
Joel, please?

650
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:50,837
Fine.

651
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,173
Goddamn it.

652
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,554
All right, what was his name again?

653
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,932
Gabriel Munoz.

654
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,984
All right. I see the report on his death.

655
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,237
Yeah. There's another incident report here

656
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,781
from a week earlier,
from a precinct upstate.

657
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,909
- What was it for?
- He gave a witness statement.

658
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,620
He was staying at a hotel
where a woman committed suicide.

659
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,456
Okay, um... and what was her name?
The woman?

660
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,005
Angela Powell.

661
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,590
She's a real estate agent.

662
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:36,758
What is this?

663
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,971
- Fuck.
- What? What is it?

664
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,557
It's a picture from the scene.

665
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,600
- Let me see it.
- No.

666
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:47,060
- Let me see it.
- No, no.

667
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:49,330
Look, you don't wanna see this.
This is, like, evidence.

668
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,523
Or, just, you know, have at it.

669
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,153
Holy shit.

670
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,489
Told you it was gross.

671
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:02,742
Okay, um...

672
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,913
Okay, uh, I need you to do
the same search again,

673
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:07,998
but this time on her.

674
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,291
The woman, Angela.

675
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:11,209
Can you please tell me
what this is all about?

676
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:14,296
Joel, you said you weren't
gonna ask me any questions.

677
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,464
No. You said I wouldn't ask you
any questions.

678
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:18,425
Joel, I need your help.

679
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:20,677
Okay?

680
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,098
Please?

681
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,201
Hmm.

682
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:45,827
There was a previous report

683
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:48,288
filed four days before her death.

684
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,291
That's a weird coincidence.

685
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,585
She was also interviewed about a suicide.

686
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,847
What is this? Is that a video file?

687
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,728
It's, um, security camera footage.

688
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,814
- Put it... put it on.
- Just... it's... it's loading.

689
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,576
What the fuck is this?

690
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:01,069
You know, my day was going just fine.

691
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,196
- Can you rewind it?
- Really?

692
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,823
Rewind it, Joel.

693
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,328
Okay, stop.

694
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:19,546
Is he smiling?

695
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,682
Rose, who are these people?

696
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,442
I have to go.

697
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,694
Where are you going?

698
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,449
Rose, where are you going?
What is going on here?

699
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,992
I'm so confused right now.

700
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,577
Can you do me one more favor?

701
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:52,746
Do you have a printer?

702
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,079
Trevor. Trevor, you here?

703
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:36,539
Hey.

704
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:37,999
Hi, Rose.

705
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,670
What is this? What is she doing here?

706
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:44,547
I wanted to see how you were doing.

707
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,466
I was talking to my fiancé.

708
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,218
I called her.

709
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:52,429
Why?

710
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:58,603
Because you've been acting
completely unhinged.

711
01:04:58,686 --> 01:04:59,687
I... I don't...

712
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:01,648
And I... I didn't know what else to do.

713
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,316
Are you fucking kidding me?

714
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:08,321
I came to you, the person
I'm supposed to trust most in the world,

715
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:12,409
and I... I confided
that I was scared to death.

716
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,703
That I needed you.

717
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,624
And you didn't listen
to a word I was saying.

718
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:22,210
No. Why do you think I even called her?

719
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,504
All I'm trying to do here is help you.

720
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,507
No! All you're trying to do is make it
so you don't have to deal with it.

721
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:31,219
You're fine as long as everything
is easy and agreeable,

722
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,763
but god forbid anything become real,

723
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,598
or even a tiny bit difficult.

724
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,434
And... and you just...

725
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:41,479
You think about how it's gonna fuck up
your whole little perfect life plan.

726
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:44,441
- Whoa! Are you serious right now?
- Yeah.

727
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:46,901
If that's how you feel,
then why are we even together?

728
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,446
Maybe I just don't know.

729
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:50,965
Why don't we all just take a breath...

730
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:53,992
Why don't you just
fucking make yourself at home!

731
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,744
Rose, are you actually leaving right now?

732
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,633
- Greg.
- Rose, what are you doing here?

733
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:13,761
- Is Holly here? I need to talk to her.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

734
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:15,889
Greg, let me talk to my fucking sister,
okay? Holly!

735
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,533
You're gonna come
and talk to me like that?

736
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,267
Holly, can I talk to you,
just for one sec?

737
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,036
- No, I don't think...
- Can I please talk to you?

738
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,812
I don't think this is a good idea.
Honestly.

739
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,647
- Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.
- Holly.

740
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:27,609
- Just go the fuck inside.
- I don't think... all right. Fine.

741
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,944
Jesus.

742
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,572
Okay, okay, okay.

743
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,409
How are you?

744
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,830
My eyes are open now.

745
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:44,876
I have been cursed.

746
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:46,461
Okay, uh...

747
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:48,588
Or somehow wrapped up in a curse.

748
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,548
I... I got it from my patient.

749
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:54,385
She was cursed, and then when she died,
she... she transferred it to me.

750
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:59,849
And now I'm being threatened
by this... this entity.

751
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,227
- By an entity?
- No, no.

752
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,686
It... it's what killed mustache.

753
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:07,357
It was at the party yesterday,
but you couldn't see it.

754
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,859
Nobody else can see it, except for me.

755
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:11,486
Jesus Christ.

756
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:12,737
No, look, Holly,

757
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,864
I know it's so hard to believe,

758
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,534
and it was difficult for me
to believe it at first either.

759
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,369
But look... look at this. Look.

760
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:22,830
Oh, my god. Rose.
Why the fuck do you have that?

761
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:24,666
Because this has happened to other people.

762
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,167
- And they're all dead.
- Rose.

763
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:27,669
And I... Holly, I'm gonna be next!

764
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:30,004
Rose, curses are not real.

765
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,090
Okay? You are having some sort of a...

766
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,510
a breakdown.

767
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:38,221
What? No, no. Holly.

768
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,390
You're not hearing me.

769
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:43,268
- You are not hearing me.
- Rose.

770
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:46,020
This is exactly what happened to mom.

771
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:52,944
You sound just like her.

772
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,201
How the fuck would you know that?

773
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:01,953
I'm sorry, what?

774
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:03,955
You were never around when mom got bad.

775
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,707
Where the fuck were you when she died?

776
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,459
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

777
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:11,337
Okay? Because I was older,
I got the worst of mom's insanity.

778
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,006
I had to fucking leave the house.

779
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,800
That was the only way I... I could survive.

780
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,429
And I'm... I'm sorry

781
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,726
that I left you alone and that
you had to be the one to find her.

782
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:26,936
I know that that fucked you up, and...

783
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,522
And I know that that's not fair.

784
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,086
I wish I could do something about it,

785
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:33,693
but, Rose, I have tried so hard
to move on with my life,

786
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,820
to leave all of that shit behind me, okay?

787
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:38,114
You, it's like, you can't accept the fact

788
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,450
that mom lost her mind
and fucking killed herself.

789
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:42,093
And you let it define your entire life,

790
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,911
and you punish me because I don't want to.

791
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:46,706
Well, I'm sorry that I'm actually
trying to help people

792
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:50,418
instead of being some fucking
stay-at-home PTA housewife,

793
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:54,714
who lives in her own self-centered,
smug little bubble!

794
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,471
- Okay.
- I don't know why I said that.

795
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:07,018
You know what, I'm... I'm not doing this.
I'm not doing this with you.

796
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,312
You've completely
traumatized Jackson, okay?

797
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,274
I can't have you around
when you're like this.

798
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:25,995
Fuck.

799
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:28,581
Fuck.

800
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:59,320
Holly?

801
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:13,459
Fuck! Fuck!

802
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,715
Fuck!

803
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:21,092
Motherfucker!

804
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:29,660
Joel?

805
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:33,664
Why didn't you tell me about
your patient's connection to the others?

806
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:35,428
- Wha...
- After you left, I kept digging.

807
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,251
These cases?

808
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:39,045
This same pattern. It goes back further.

809
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,964
So far, I've found 20 cases
involving 19 suicide victims

810
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:44,050
with a direct line
linking them all together.

811
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,969
And the things these people
are doing to themselves, Rose.

812
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,304
Holy shit.

813
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:52,099
Wait, you said, um, 20 cases,
but only 19 suicides.

814
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:53,810
One of the cases mixes up the pattern.

815
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:55,603
Some accountant, Robert Talley.

816
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:58,189
His business partner commits suicide
right in front of him,

817
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,690
and four days later, Talley goes

818
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:01,734
and fucking murders a woman
he's never met before,

819
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,110
completely out of the blue.

820
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,404
But get this, a week later,

821
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,240
the key eyewitness to the murder

822
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,325
also commits suicide.

823
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:10,701
Pattern resumes.

824
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:12,745
- So, he's alive?
- Yeah.

825
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:14,288
He's sitting in holding in Altoona.

826
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,415
Joel, I gotta talk to him.

827
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:45,671
I'm gonna need you to say something.

828
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,280
Yeah, I... I will.

829
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,031
Just... just...

830
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,702
Give me a second. I mean, Jesus...

831
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:55,162
I thought you were gonna say
this was some kind of, like,

832
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:57,790
crazy suicide cult, or blackmail scheme.

833
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,501
- I mean, this? This is... this? This is...
- Hey, Joel.

834
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:03,796
Okay.

835
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,340
Let's just put aside the possibility

836
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:09,510
that some sort of evil,
extraordinary force could even exist.

837
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:14,140
What you're saying
is that this thing is jumping around

838
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,433
from person to person,

839
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,977
and it is causing them to kill themselves?

840
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,313
Okay, but maybe it's not suicide.

841
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,606
What do you mean?

842
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:24,108
Okay. So, my patient, she was terrified,

843
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:25,860
but she was not suicidal.

844
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:29,113
And then at... at the end,
everything about her changed.

845
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:34,660
It was like the person I had
been talking to was gone.

846
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:39,957
And something else had taken over.

847
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,713
So, it's k... it's kind of
like the... the guy...

848
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:47,590
- Yes.
- On the security camera footage?

849
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,634
Yes. Yes. Exactly like that.

850
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:52,428
Oh, my god. What the fuck?

851
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:00,895
In the cases that you found, um...

852
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:06,609
how long was it
between each victim's death?

853
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:12,907
None of them survived longer than a week.

854
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:20,247
Some of them didn't even
make it past four days.

855
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,672
Today was my fourth day.

856
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:30,800
Hey.

857
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,536
Whatever happened to those people,

858
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,388
it's not gonna happen to you.

859
01:14:38,265 --> 01:14:39,350
I promise.

860
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:02,206
Transfer guard to gate three.

861
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,125
Transfer guard to gate three.

862
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,209
Thank you.

863
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:06,752
Give them a buzz through.

864
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,921
They're clear.

865
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,465
I owe you one for this, Doug.

866
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:15,511
You're just lucky that he fired
every lawyer he was assigned.

867
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,930
You do know what this guy did, right?

868
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:20,182
Well, Dr. Cotter's building
a psychological profile

869
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:21,892
on a similar case for us.

870
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:24,854
Well, Talley's a whole box of fruit loops.

871
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,480
So, good luck.

872
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:28,524
Look, you only got
ten minutes with him, okay?

873
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:30,735
It's the best I could do
without a court order.

874
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:32,445
Well, I appreciate it.

875
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:10,524
Mr. Talley, my name is Dr. Rose Cotter,

876
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:16,322
and, um, I was hoping you'd be willing
to answer some questions about...

877
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,824
I'm done answering questions. I confessed.

878
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:22,328
I actually don't care about
what you were accused of.

879
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:25,498
What I need to know
is what you experienced

880
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,625
in the days leading up to it.

881
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:34,590
I have a patient,

882
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:37,009
a young woman.

883
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,012
Four days ago,

884
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,973
a man killed himself
right in front of her.

885
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:48,395
And ever since then,
she has been seeing something.

886
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:53,984
Something that pretends
to be other people.

887
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:57,905
The man that she saw kill himself,

888
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:02,118
he claimed that he was seeing
the exact same thing.

889
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,453
What the fuck do you want from me, huh?

890
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:06,747
- What is it?
- I don't know.

891
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,083
I don't know.

892
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,501
Why is it that everybody else

893
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:13,379
who's seen it is dead and you're alive?

894
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:14,797
Why? Please.

895
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,049
Mr. Talley, you can help her. Okay?

896
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:18,759
Please.

897
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,557
Make the cop leave.

898
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:28,269
Not gonna happen, pal.

899
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:31,856
Make him leave,
and I'll tell you what I know.

900
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:36,569
Joel, please.

901
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:43,951
I'll be outside, all right?

902
01:17:57,006 --> 01:18:00,426
I tried to research anything
and everything I could about this thing.

903
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,803
There's been other chains in the past.

904
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:05,598
Found one that was in Brazil
a few years ago.

905
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:11,145
A man there escaped that chain

906
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,941
by killing his neighbor
and passing it to his neighbor's wife.

907
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:20,112
Your patient is going to die

908
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:22,573
unless she kills someone.

909
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:25,034
That's the only way you can get rid of it.

910
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,286
The only way.

911
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:30,039
She has to make sure there's
a witness for it to pass to,

912
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,166
'cause this thing needs trauma to spread.

913
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:35,878
That's what gives it power. Trauma.

914
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,672
Your patient has to make it count.

915
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:41,258
Tell her to use some kind of weapon.

916
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:43,427
Make the biggest mess she can...

917
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:46,222
I can't kill someone!

918
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:48,766
You?

919
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:51,685
You have it?

920
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:56,899
No, no, no.
Why the fuck did you come here?

921
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:58,692
You're not giving it back to me.

922
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,778
- Get out of here!
- I'm sorry.

923
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,071
Get out of here!

924
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:03,989
Get her away from me!

925
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,492
Get her away from me!

926
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,661
Get her away from me!

927
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,454
Get her away from me!

928
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:18,879
Hey.

929
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:21,548
Hey! Wait.

930
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:25,469
- What happened in there?
- Nothing.

931
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:27,596
What'd he say?

932
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:30,474
Nothing.

933
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,227
Nothing?

934
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,145
He's out of his fucking mind, Joel.

935
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:21,001
Ah, fuck.

936
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:17,933
What are you doing here?

937
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,852
I apologize
if you felt ambushed yesterday.

938
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,645
That was the wrong approach.

939
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:22,813
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

940
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:25,190
- I think you should go.
- Rose.

941
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:28,110
We both know I have a responsibility
to notify the authorities

942
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,571
if you're a danger to yourself or others.

943
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:33,365
I need you to help convince me
you're not a danger.

944
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,755
Trevor mentioned there had been
talk of ghosts.

945
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,092
I never used the word "ghosts."

946
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,346
Evil beings, then. Paranormal.

947
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:01,768
I admitted to him
that I was seeing things,

948
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:03,270
the same thing that I told you.

949
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:04,897
That's not happening anymore. Okay?

950
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:08,609
It was stress and lack of sleep.

951
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:11,361
I confided in him,
and that was obviously a mistake.

952
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:13,572
But that's it.

953
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,532
Okay? Are we good?

954
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,077
How are you feeling today?

955
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:23,957
Let me think, um...

956
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,419
I'm pretty sure my fiancé
thinks I'm crazy.

957
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:34,218
My sister has just totally shut me out.

958
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,719
And now

959
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,180
my former therapist

960
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:41,600
is making unannounced house calls

961
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:44,102
to ensure that I am not a danger.

962
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:47,731
So, other than that, I'm really good.

963
01:23:57,658 --> 01:23:59,451
Should you get that?

964
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:05,791
What?

965
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,585
Rose, it's Madeline.

966
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:11,630
I've been trying your mobile all morning.

967
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:14,424
I'm very concerned about
how we left things yesterday.

968
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,972
- Rose? Are you there?
- No.

969
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:26,520
Hello?

970
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,064
- Rose?

971
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:31,900
No. No.

972
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:34,069
Almost time, Rose.

973
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:37,322
What the fuck are you?

974
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:42,160
Ple... please.

975
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:46,957
No, no.

976
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:49,668
No. No, no.

977
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,050
No.

978
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,081
Hey, Dr. Cotter.

979
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,583
Aren't you supposed to be on leave?

980
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:14,044
Just grabbing something from my office.

981
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:55,627
Carl. Hi.

982
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,299
- No. No.
- It's okay.

983
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:02,968
No, no, no.

984
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,803
- It's okay.
- Oh, god.

985
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:06,972
No, no. Oh, no, no, no.

986
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,266
- Shh. Shh. Just calm down.
- No! No, no!

987
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:12,394
- No! No!
- Shh! Shut the fuck up.

988
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:15,480
Just calm down, okay? Okay.

989
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:16,732
- Rose.
- [Gasps]

990
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:18,942
What are you doing here?

991
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:23,822
I don't know.

992
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,868
Rose, you can't be around patients.

993
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:02,194
Fuck! Rose!

994
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,258
Fuck!

995
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:41,942
Rose, what are you doing here?

996
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:43,985
Nothing.

997
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:46,822
I don't... I don't know.

998
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:49,866
I don't know why. I, uh...

999
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:52,202
Why don't we go inside together
and we can just talk?

1000
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:53,745
No! It's...

1001
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,038
It's not safe.

1002
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:57,457
Rose, I don't think you should
be alone right now.

1003
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:59,084
I need... I need to be alone.

1004
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:03,338
I need to be... I need to be alone.

1005
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:08,176
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have to go.

1006
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:12,848
Rose, I don't think you should
go anywhere, okay?

1007
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:15,308
You just relax, I'm gonna make
a phone call, all right?

1008
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,603
Rose. Rose, don't go anywhere.

1009
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:20,063
Wait. Rose, please.

1010
01:29:20,146 --> 01:29:22,107
Please don't go anywhere, okay?
Just hang...

1011
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,401
Rose. Rose, wait! Rose!

1012
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:51,511
Joel.

1013
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:53,597
Rose, I saw a police APB
go out for you

1014
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,616
that says you're dangerous.
What the fuck happened?

1015
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:56,909
- I know what I need to do.
- What?

1016
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:59,895
This thing, it needs all of its victims

1017
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:01,521
to pass it on in order to survive,

1018
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:04,774
but if there's no one else around,
then it has no way to pass.

1019
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:06,276
As long as I'm alone,

1020
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:07,944
I can deprive it of what it needs.

1021
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:09,654
That doesn't make any sense.

1022
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:11,865
Your plan is just to avoid people forever?

1023
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:14,618
I am not gonna keep running, okay?

1024
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:16,661
I've got to face it.

1025
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:19,331
Okay, Rose, I'm coming to you.
Just tell me where...

1026
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:50,792
Rose.

1027
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:56,506
Baby.

1028
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:03,847
Help me, please.

1029
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:10,145
Mommy made a mistake.

1030
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:18,611
Get the phone.

1031
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,573
Call for help.

1032
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,710
Rose!

1033
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:47,922
Rose.

1034
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:54,887
It's okay, baby.

1035
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,889
Come here.

1036
01:39:08,317 --> 01:39:11,821
I am so sorry.

1037
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:16,367
I... I haven't been a good mom.

1038
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:24,709
I want to be. I really try to be.

1039
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:30,756
But sometimes everything is just too much.

1040
01:39:32,258 --> 01:39:35,678
There is something terrible inside of me.

1041
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:40,266
- I hate myself.
- Stop. Stop. Stop.

1042
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:42,393
Are you ashamed of me?

1043
01:39:43,853 --> 01:39:44,937
No.

1044
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:47,148
Then why did you let me die?

1045
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:53,571
- Why didn't you save me?
- It's not my fault.

1046
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:56,407
- You could have called for help.
- Stop. Stop it.

1047
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:58,409
- But you didn't.
- Stop it.

1048
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:01,370
- You wished that I would die.
- Because I was afraid of you!

1049
01:40:01,454 --> 01:40:03,998
I was ten years old

1050
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:07,418
and you were a monster.

1051
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:14,926
And I know that it's not fair.
You... you needed help.

1052
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:18,012
But I couldn't.

1053
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:25,019
And I have carried that guilt

1054
01:40:26,395 --> 01:40:29,482
for my entire life.

1055
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:36,405
And I... I have to let it go.

1056
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:40,284
I ha... I have to let it go.

1057
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:48,751
This is not real.

1058
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:51,587
But Rose,

1059
01:40:51,671 --> 01:40:55,675
your mind makes it real.

1060
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:01,305
What are you?

1061
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:04,517
Why are you doing this to me?

1062
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:06,936
Because your mind...

1063
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:10,147
is so inviting.

1064
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:04,910
You can't escape your mind, Rose.

1065
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:13,293
It's...

1066
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:17,298
It's my mind.

1067
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:26,432
You can't escape it either.

1068
01:42:42,073 --> 01:42:43,783
Rose!

1069
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:48,204
Rose!

1070
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:13,581
Holy shit.

1071
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:17,835
Are you okay?

1072
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:20,421
- Can I just come in for a sec?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1073
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:28,012
Where have you been?

1074
01:44:32,641 --> 01:44:34,310
I'm sorry.

1075
01:44:36,187 --> 01:44:41,776
I'm sorry for dragging you into
my whole fucked-up mess.

1076
01:44:44,153 --> 01:44:45,905
For most of my life,

1077
01:44:45,988 --> 01:44:52,036
I've been afraid of
letting people get too close,

1078
01:44:53,162 --> 01:44:55,372
because I was afraid of...

1079
01:44:58,542 --> 01:45:01,212
what they might see if they really looked.

1080
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:06,300
And so I... I put walls up,
and I kept people at a distance.

1081
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:10,471
And then...

1082
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:15,518
I met you,

1083
01:45:15,601 --> 01:45:19,480
and I could feel those walls coming down.

1084
01:45:19,563 --> 01:45:22,483
And it scared the shit out of me.

1085
01:45:25,528 --> 01:45:26,779
And so...

1086
01:45:28,072 --> 01:45:34,495
I was selfish,
and that was not fair to you.

1087
01:45:36,288 --> 01:45:39,667
And I am so, so sorry.

1088
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:45,881
And I'm... I'm being selfish
again by even asking,

1089
01:45:45,965 --> 01:45:47,299
but do you think that...

1090
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:50,219
That I could stay here and just...

1091
01:45:52,638 --> 01:45:53,931
just sleep?

1092
01:45:57,226 --> 01:45:58,435
Could you...

1093
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:02,857
stay with me while I sleep?

1094
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:07,569
Please.

1095
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,282
Yeah, of course I'll stay with you.

1096
01:46:19,498 --> 01:46:21,292
I'll stay with you forever.

1097
01:46:27,839 --> 01:46:28,966
No.

1098
01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:37,307
No.

1099
01:46:38,517 --> 01:46:39,685
No, no, no, no.

1100
01:46:40,769 --> 01:46:41,812
No, no.

1101
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:24,104
Rose.

1102
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:29,777
No, no, no!

1103
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:39,536
- Rose!
- No.

1104
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:41,497
Rose, open the door!

1105
01:47:43,499 --> 01:47:46,418
Open the door.

1106
01:47:48,045 --> 01:47:49,463
Rose!

1107
01:47:59,556 --> 01:48:02,267
No!

1108
01:48:03,185 --> 01:48:06,271
- No!
- Fuck. Uh...

1109
01:48:06,355 --> 01:48:07,898
Hold on. I'm coming!

1110
01:48:07,981 --> 01:48:10,484
No!

1111
01:48:13,946 --> 01:48:15,155
Rose!

1112
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:20,369
No!

1113
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:03,162
Rose.

1114
01:49:37,529 --> 01:49:38,655
Rose?

1115
01:49:45,037 --> 01:49:46,037
Rose?
