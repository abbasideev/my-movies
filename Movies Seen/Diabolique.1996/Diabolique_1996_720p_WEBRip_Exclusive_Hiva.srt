1
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:08,409
Uh...

2
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:38,752
Guy...

3
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:48,401
Guy...

4
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:20,762
Hey!

5
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:22,851
What the hell are you doing up here?

6
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:25,260
The bathroom. I saw her.
There's something wrong.

7
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:28,224
You're a real little
peeping tom, aren't you?

8
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,125
Get back to your room.

9
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:32,435
She fell. She's hurt. Mrs. Baran!

10
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:38,533
I told you, there's something wrong.

11
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:41,022
And I told you to get back
to your room. Now go.

12
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:48,563
Nicole.

13
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:50,626
Is she dead?

14
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:52,515
I don't know. I didn't check.

15
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,187
Jesus, Guy!

16
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,486
Well, get her pills, for God's sake.
She's still alive.

17
00:06:16,046 --> 00:06:18,070
Call 911. She needs a doctor.

18
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,400
Go get another teacher.

19
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,925
Move it!

20
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,258
I'm alive?

21
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:31,711
No.

22
00:06:31,844 --> 00:06:34,442
You're dead, this is heaven,
and I'm the virgin Mary.

23
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:37,377
Can you swallow?

24
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,970
Yeah?

25
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:41,362
Here you go.

26
00:06:42,357 --> 00:06:44,456
I don't want them to see me like this.

27
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,139
Did they say how long?

28
00:06:53,953 --> 00:06:54,953
Erik...

29
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:56,345
What happened?

30
00:06:56,623 --> 00:06:57,837
It's just her heart again.

31
00:06:57,898 --> 00:06:59,045
Get the boy out of here.

32
00:07:05,335 --> 00:07:07,545
Failure, despair, passivity,

33
00:07:07,714 --> 00:07:09,381
rebelliousness, defeat...

34
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:10,848
Why?

35
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:14,436
Well-meaning people
may offer dozens of theories,

36
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,851
all of them boiling down to blaming you...

37
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,104
the parent.

38
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:20,019
You won't find those theories here

39
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,111
at the St. Anselm school for boys.

40
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:23,685
Poor little losers.

41
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:25,784
Aren't you glad you never did drugs?

42
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:27,846
You never did, right?

43
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,860
I think we should open with
the zero tolerance talk...

44
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:34,324
Then the room searches.
Parents eat that shit up!

45
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:37,276
Man, you'd have to be at the end
of your rope to wind up here.

46
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:39,405
We are here, dick head.

47
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:49,224
Front steps in 10 minutes

48
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:50,367
for the video shoot.

49
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:53,009
And take your books home
over the long weekend.

50
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,945
There'll be a test on Tuesday.

51
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:56,288
Miss Horner?

52
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,850
-I'll be in a better mood on Tuesday.
-Yes, ma'am.

53
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:04,987
Don't let Guy catch you.

54
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:07,883
He's occupied.

55
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:11,396
You see? He didn't resist the urge

56
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,780
to assist another mother.

57
00:08:15,282 --> 00:08:16,533
What happened to your eyes?

58
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,002
I don't know what you
did to him last night,

59
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:22,208
but your husband was in
one of his moods again.

60
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:23,996
Thank you very much.

61
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:25,765
Nicole!

62
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:29,438
You shouldn't be seen with him.

63
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:31,138
They all know, Mia.

64
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:32,569
It's better if we act Normal.

65
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,399
That way, it won't look bad after.

66
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:36,280
Anyway, I only went over there

67
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:38,447
because the wife chooses
to sedate herself.

68
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:42,424
What if she notices they're gone?

69
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:46,059
Oh, please. That woman has enough
drugs over there to relax China.

70
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:49,319
Good morning, ladies!

71
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,039
Oh, God.

72
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:53,509
Are we ready for our close-ups?

73
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:56,181
I can't wait for this filming to be done.

74
00:08:56,242 --> 00:08:58,004
It just gets everyone overexcited.

75
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,824
And your husband... forgive me...

76
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:01,889
how he expects us to handle more students

77
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,027
without having more staff...

78
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:04,392
Lovely seeing you last night.

79
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,271
Any time Estelle and I can
assist you two star-crossed...

80
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,190
Your eye, madam... is something
wrong with your eye?

81
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:12,188
Allergies.

82
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:14,359
Ah. I'm not surprised.

83
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:17,437
Well, if you don't quit for
yourself, think of us.

84
00:09:17,736 --> 00:09:20,171
Second-hand smoke does kill, too, you know.

85
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,817
Not reliably.

86
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:26,499
Thanks.

87
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:29,110
-This is disgusting.
-Hey, you going to eat that?

88
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:31,970
I've got to eat it. I'm starving.

89
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:56,763
And then we thought we'd cut
to a talking head of you,

90
00:09:56,918 --> 00:09:59,927
you know, consequences,
a system kids can believe in,

91
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:03,144
blah, blah, blah, then do
talks with some of the kids.

92
00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:05,508
I once was lost, but now I'm found...

93
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:06,626
that classic boys' town stuff.

94
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,180
Success stories are our speciality here.

95
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:11,130
As a matter of fact, I have
a very extra ordinary...

96
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:13,625
We want to get some footage of
the pool once it's cleaned.

97
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:14,705
Can we get that, this weekend?

98
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:16,821
I'm a poor man, guys.
As much as I'd like to,

99
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,682
I can't afford to maintain a
pool all summer for show.

100
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:20,756
But, it's just...

101
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:24,086
young... young boys frolicking,
sound minds and sound bodies,

102
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:26,206
the clean Appalachian
Mountain air, that...

103
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,227
type of thing.

104
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:31,428
O.K. We'll skip it.

105
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:33,656
But we really want to shoot
the kitchen work crew.

106
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,860
Yeah, take a number.

107
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,060
Hopkins,

108
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:37,971
would you take this away? I'm not hungry.

109
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,525
Our chef's skill is not presentation.

110
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:44,058
I think you'll find it
tastes better than it looks.

111
00:10:44,564 --> 00:10:45,583
It would have to.

112
00:10:46,158 --> 00:10:48,078
Peas mushy. Pepper.

113
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:51,311
Guy...

114
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:52,517
You promised.

115
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:54,621
It's a sin to waste.

116
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:56,746
Aren't you the expert on sin?

117
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:57,510
No.

118
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,759
You are.

119
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Mia.

120
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,553
No one's eating.

121
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:13,653
Well, don't encourage them.

122
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:15,788
Use your great moral force on my behalf.

123
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:16,866
Eat.

124
00:11:17,197 --> 00:11:18,278
It's perfectly edible.

125
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,650
See?

126
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,034
Pick up your fork.

127
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,658
Just pick up your fork.

128
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:29,431
Pick it up.

129
00:11:32,398 --> 00:11:34,431
Take some food and put it in your mouth.

130
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:47,569
That didn't kill you.

131
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:49,729
Now swallow.

132
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:55,025
Swallow it.

133
00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:56,753
For God's sake, Guy.

134
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:12,488
Swallow it for once in your life.

135
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:17,574
Actually, I...

136
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,470
I'm afraid I'm quite hungry myself,

137
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,079
so if you're not going to finish it...

138
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:24,069
Mr. Katzman,

139
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:26,123
will you please tell the table proctors

140
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:28,107
that no student will be
allowed to leave this room

141
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:29,390
until every plate is clean.

142
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:30,841
Yes.

143
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:33,177
Thank you.

144
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:35,044
A child bride, gentlemen.

145
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,516
That's what I married, a child bride.

146
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:40,387
And each year, she grows
younger and younger.

147
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:42,568
She's worse than the boys she teachers.

148
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:47,599
You're not finished yet.

149
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:49,733
Eat.

150
00:12:58,096 --> 00:12:59,096
Again.

151
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:03,200
You know, I think this might help.

152
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,124
Oh!

153
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,618
Look what I did.

154
00:13:08,094 --> 00:13:09,094
Hopkins,

155
00:13:09,324 --> 00:13:10,906
could you take this away, please?

156
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,159
Excuse me.

157
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:17,453
Wasn't that fun?

158
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:19,618
Don't you wish you had that on tape?

159
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:22,605
Bet you're just kicking
yourselves now, huh?

160
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,602
Excuse me.

161
00:13:26,214 --> 00:13:27,214
I'm...

162
00:13:27,856 --> 00:13:30,082
I'm sure Miss Horner will
keep something hot for you.

163
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,061
Mia?

164
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,065
Why do you make me do that to you?

165
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,583
Why?

166
00:13:57,528 --> 00:13:58,706
You always do it.

167
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:03,498
And you always will.

168
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:07,469
No, no, no. Only when you misbehave.

169
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,946
Like that stunt you pulled on Sunday.

170
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:14,170
When you do things like that,

171
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:16,960
do you know how bad that makes me feel?

172
00:14:18,141 --> 00:14:19,935
You should think about me sometimes.

173
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:24,298
I... just don't know you.

174
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:27,033
You know me, Mia.

175
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:33,566
The problem is, you just
don't understand me.

176
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:48,107
Isn't that right?

177
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:50,689
I know what my little nun likes.

178
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:57,335
I thought you weren't coming.

179
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:00,719
Hey. Go ahead, get in. Let's go.

180
00:16:40,136 --> 00:16:41,136
They'll see.

181
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:44,901
Well, we want them to see.
They're our alibis.

182
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:45,615
Come on.

183
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:48,108
You take my bedroom. It's
down by the bathroom.

184
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:51,953
And stay here till she sees you, O.K.?

185
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:54,979
Ah, Nicole!

186
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:56,722
What a surprise!

187
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:00,274
Irving, it's Nicole!

188
00:17:00,507 --> 00:17:02,264
Miss Horner, I should say,

189
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:04,327
now that you are the landlady.

190
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:07,286
I think about your poor mother every day.

191
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:09,573
Bijou!

192
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:12,005
Well, come in.

193
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:14,127
No, we can't today. We're just
here for the weekend.

194
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:16,763
But I would like you to meet
my principal, Mrs. Baran.

195
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:17,488
Hello.

196
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,811
Oh, how nice.

197
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:22,528
Welcome to Pittsburgh, Mrs. Baran,

198
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:25,372
and the entire Three Rivers area.

199
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:27,036
Oh, can you manage?

200
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:28,761
Irving!

201
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:50,906
Well, it must be the post office, then.

202
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:52,479
Half the people that work down there

203
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,206
aren't American any more, anyway.

204
00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:56,437
I'll send you another check tomorrow.

205
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:58,213
I'll drop by for it.

206
00:17:58,424 --> 00:17:59,533
Tomorrow night, say?

207
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:02,447
You can bring your house
guest, if you like.

208
00:18:03,252 --> 00:18:04,252
She'll be busy.

209
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,551
You look more like your mother every day.

210
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:09,668
From behind, you can really see it.

211
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,293
I've been to see a lawyer,

212
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:17,267
and she tells me a divorce
would be very simple.

213
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:19,041
I could even keep the school.

214
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,898
I don't want to talk about
it on the phone, Guy.

215
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:27,019
All right.

216
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:30,829
I'm at Nicole's house.

217
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:34,368
Fine.

218
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:35,762
Yeah.

219
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,765
Well, tomorrow night is best.

220
00:18:38,229 --> 00:18:39,378
We'll be out tomorrow.

221
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:40,907
All right.

222
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:42,251
After 8:00.

223
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:43,836
Fine. Goodbye.

224
00:18:46,952 --> 00:18:47,952
Good for you.

225
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:51,387
It's good to get it over with.
Now we can get on with our evening.

226
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,321
I should take him off speed-dial.

227
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:34,900
One good drink oughta do it.

228
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:37,030
I can't do this.

229
00:19:37,662 --> 00:19:39,194
He's never going to leave you alone.

230
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:40,538
Does he leave me alone?

231
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:43,310
If I give him the school...

232
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:45,584
If you give him the school,
he'll just sell it.

233
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:48,405
Then where will all the future
Lee Harvey Oswalds come from?

234
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:51,652
Anyway, it's not like he's
the one that won't let go.

235
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:54,427
What do you mean?

236
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,929
What I mean is,

237
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,330
you still want him,

238
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:00,818
or you wouldn't keep sleeping with him.

239
00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:05,330
It's not love.

240
00:20:06,158 --> 00:20:08,332
You don't love people
who treat you this way.

241
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:11,148
Where'd you get that, off a talk show?

242
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:15,120
You know, I'm not surprised
he likes to come to me

243
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,399
after he sleeps with you.

244
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:19,106
I don't care.

245
00:20:19,925 --> 00:20:20,925
I hate him.

246
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:23,391
I don't feel anything.

247
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,919
I don't feel anything.

248
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:28,497
You don't feel anything.

249
00:20:29,003 --> 00:20:30,513
How about when he does this?

250
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:31,595
Hmm?

251
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,034
Do you feel anything

252
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:34,592
when he does this?

253
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:40,511
You don't feel anything?

254
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,983
He doesn't do that to me.

255
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:44,801
Don't you lie to me!

256
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:46,700
We're not going to get anywhere

257
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:48,044
if you start lying to me now.

258
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:51,280
I know. It's me. My fault.

259
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:53,259
It's not your fault.

260
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:54,507
I know. I...

261
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:56,403
Oh, just snap out of it. all right!

262
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:57,619
It's not your fault, O.K.?

263
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,219
It's his fault. He is who he is.

264
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,897
And he's going to keep being who he is

265
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:01,901
and doing what he does.

266
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:03,981
And he's going to do it
and do it and do it...

267
00:21:05,737 --> 00:21:07,622
We're never going to
be free until he's dead.

268
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:09,962
He's my husband, Nicole.

269
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:11,693
Oh, yeah?

270
00:21:11,764 --> 00:21:13,743
Well, last week he was happy to stand by

271
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:14,895
and watch you die.

272
00:21:22,257 --> 00:21:24,417
Pull yourself together. You're
going to scare him away.

273
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:27,326
He always parks out there

274
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,787
so the neighbours won't notice him.

275
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:30,727
He'll be coming in through the back door.

276
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:31,788
You're going?

277
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:34,094
Yes. I'm going to the
neighbours to keep them busy.

278
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:35,254
I need 10 minutes.

279
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,004
O.K.?

280
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:41,539
O.K.?

281
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:42,978
Yeah.

282
00:21:48,782 --> 00:21:49,782
Courage.

283
00:22:13,392 --> 00:22:14,530
Make yourself one.

284
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:17,896
I want you to hear what I'm saying, Guy.

285
00:22:18,636 --> 00:22:19,636
I'm serious.

286
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,212
Ooh!

287
00:22:22,113 --> 00:22:23,521
Mia's serious.

288
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:28,551
Give me the goddamn drink.

289
00:22:29,323 --> 00:22:30,395
It's for your own good.

290
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,724
I'll be a lot easier to handle

291
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,042
with some of this in me, right?

292
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,421
Right.

293
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:44,692
It's a little cloudy.

294
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:45,849
What?

295
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:48,967
Whatever.

296
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:08,471
Do you want to talk, or do you
want to stare at me all night?

297
00:23:10,935 --> 00:23:12,924
The lawyer says I can get a divorce

298
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:14,322
and keep the school.

299
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:17,344
I inherited it before I got married.

300
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:18,975
You put me on the title.

301
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,662
You need me to sign a quit-claim deed.

302
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:24,215
He didn't mention that?

303
00:23:25,178 --> 00:23:26,514
Tsk-tsk.

304
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:09,867
What's the matter?

305
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:11,536
Are you all right?

306
00:24:13,655 --> 00:24:14,655
What?

307
00:24:17,137 --> 00:24:18,365
What were we talking about?

308
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:21,201
The title.

309
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,306
You forgot I'm on the title.

310
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:24,801
I could buy you out.

311
00:24:25,227 --> 00:24:26,332
I could get a loan.

312
00:24:27,138 --> 00:24:28,364
You give me the school,

313
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:29,903
and I'll give you a divorce.

314
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:37,506
Frankly, I didn't have to get
married to have lousy sex.

315
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:38,433
No.

316
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:39,856
I did.

317
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:42,342
Come on, Mia.

318
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:44,299
Ooh.

319
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:46,121
Why don't you have a drink with me?

320
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:47,841
What did I ever do to you, Guy?

321
00:24:48,115 --> 00:24:49,678
What did I do that's so wrong?

322
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,560
You try living with a fucking angel.

323
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:53,195
It's easier living with a dog.

324
00:24:53,256 --> 00:24:54,574
I'm not your little dog, Guy.

325
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:56,149
You do something with your hair?

326
00:24:58,049 --> 00:24:59,679
Yeah. You did something with your hair.

327
00:25:00,211 --> 00:25:02,252
Let me make you feel good
like you know I can.

328
00:25:02,955 --> 00:25:03,973
Isn't that nice?

329
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,072
You don't want to split up, do you?

330
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:08,634
You don't even love me.

331
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:09,695
But you can't let go.

332
00:25:14,227 --> 00:25:15,227
What was that?

333
00:25:15,487 --> 00:25:16,566
Something on TV.

334
00:25:17,013 --> 00:25:19,855
Oh, you're so good, Bijou!

335
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,950
Now that was her alarm bark.

336
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:24,333
It... it's like her stranger bark,

337
00:25:24,394 --> 00:25:25,945
only a little bit higher.

338
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:29,600
That doesn't sound very good,

339
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:31,722
that kind of noise, Irv.

340
00:25:33,092 --> 00:25:35,477
Why don't I just turn
up the TV a little bit?

341
00:25:36,754 --> 00:25:38,486
Their marriage is worth saving.

342
00:25:38,547 --> 00:25:40,408
We just heard from Tim and Tracy

343
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,296
who have been married
for less than a year,

344
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,861
but have already
been separated five times.

345
00:25:45,186 --> 00:25:46,186
Will they reconcile?

346
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,370
I'll find out.

347
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:48,948
-Don't you run away from me!
-Aah!

348
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:52,212
When is she coming back?

349
00:25:55,814 --> 00:25:56,853
You feel that?

350
00:25:57,395 --> 00:25:58,395
You feel it?

351
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,780
What did you do for feelings
before I came along, Mia?

352
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:10,085
You shouldn't get me mad.

353
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:12,761
It won't happen again.

354
00:26:25,804 --> 00:26:26,804
Come here, Mia.

355
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:36,758
Have another drink, Guy.

356
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:42,469
You deserve it.

357
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:52,825
What are you doing to me?

358
00:26:56,342 --> 00:26:57,342
Listen!

359
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,441
I don't know you that well.

360
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:06,332
I don't ever want you to come
back to Tennessee again!

361
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:10,249
That's the one...

362
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:11,564
has returned.

363
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:16,354
I hope that was an empty bottle, George.

364
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:18,333
You can't afford to waste good liquor.

365
00:27:18,394 --> 00:27:19,839
Oh. Yeah.

366
00:27:21,382 --> 00:27:23,382
I'm going to wait until this is in colour.

367
00:27:25,384 --> 00:27:26,871
Liar! You haven't...

368
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:28,454
You little bitch!

369
00:27:28,577 --> 00:27:29,812
You're trying to kill me!

370
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:43,734
Mia...

371
00:27:46,272 --> 00:27:47,272
Help me.

372
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,845
Say you're sorry, Guy.

373
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:52,979
I love you.

374
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:09,341
How is he?

375
00:28:10,431 --> 00:28:11,979
It wasn't quick like you said.

376
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:13,303
Yeah, or quiet.

377
00:28:13,914 --> 00:28:14,914
Well,

378
00:28:15,218 --> 00:28:17,326
it's attempted murder
now if he does wake up.

379
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,761
We have no choice.

380
00:28:21,553 --> 00:28:22,553
Come on.

381
00:28:29,964 --> 00:28:31,250
O.K, get out his wallet.

382
00:28:36,185 --> 00:28:37,825
It's O.K. If your fingerprints are on it.

383
00:28:39,257 --> 00:28:41,257
Check and see if there's
any gas station receipts.

384
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:45,509
There's nothing.

385
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:46,768
O.K, put it back.

386
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:48,334
Put it back.

387
00:28:49,843 --> 00:28:50,462
Now,

388
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,652
go turn on the radio in
case there's more noise.

389
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,580
Uhh!

390
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:02,261
# But #

391
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,954
# in the arms of love #

392
00:29:06,022 --> 00:29:08,914
# your embrace #

393
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:13,936
# fits me like a glove #

394
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,795
# in my world #

395
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:35,418
# You #

396
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:39,856
# took control of me #

397
00:29:39,983 --> 00:29:43,859
# and I fell #

398
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:44,727
# in love #

399
00:29:44,787 --> 00:29:47,553
# hopelessly... #

400
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:24,592
Aah!

401
00:30:36,215 --> 00:30:38,597
Aah!

402
00:30:58,912 --> 00:31:00,097
Get the water bottle!

403
00:31:45,346 --> 00:31:46,346
Is it over?

404
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:47,901
It's over.

405
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,169
Are you all right?

406
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,275
You're blaming yourself.

407
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:39,541
Don't.

408
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,574
For wanting him, I mean.

409
00:32:49,474 --> 00:32:50,625
I was the same way.

410
00:33:56,048 --> 00:33:57,684
Ohh! Oh, my God.

411
00:33:59,148 --> 00:34:00,933
He tried to move. He was alive.

412
00:34:58,973 --> 00:34:59,973
Nicole...

413
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,035
Let Irv help.

414
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:07,646
Look at them. It's too heavy.

415
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,583
Uh, Mrs. Baran...

416
00:35:10,348 --> 00:35:11,378
This is Irv.

417
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:12,133
Hi.

418
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:13,616
Hi.

419
00:35:14,853 --> 00:35:17,629
Well, he's... he's good
at this kind of thing.

420
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,226
Allow me.

421
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:19,500
-No. It's fine.
-Please.

422
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:22,816
Bend your knees.

423
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:24,994
All right. Ready?

424
00:35:25,055 --> 00:35:26,961
1, 2, 3...

425
00:35:28,018 --> 00:35:30,452
O.K, your end in first, Irv.

426
00:35:30,513 --> 00:35:31,584
What do you got in here?

427
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:32,645
Books.

428
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,450
O.K

429
00:35:38,635 --> 00:35:39,361
Thanks, Irv.

430
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:40,453
Oh, wait!

431
00:35:40,642 --> 00:35:42,984
I made a coffee cake for your trip!

432
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:44,544
Here. Oh.

433
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,030
Here.

434
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:47,526
-Let's go.
-Right.

435
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,243
Nice shape on that principal.

436
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:53,498
Hmm.

437
00:35:54,692 --> 00:35:56,871
That Nicole's always been
a cold fish, though.

438
00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:58,425
Yeah.

439
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:02,744
Bijou...

440
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,519
Bad dog.

441
00:36:38,844 --> 00:36:40,368
You take mine. I'll take his.

442
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:42,351
-Let's stay together.
-Sure.

443
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:52,341
Oh, Jesus.

444
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:16,817
Attention, all units.

445
00:37:16,878 --> 00:37:19,257
All units, accident on
the Pennsylvania turnpike.

446
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:21,009
Exit 12 is closed.

447
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:23,429
Units responding, please
give me your E.T.A.

448
00:37:23,564 --> 00:37:25,122
E.M.T. is on their way. Over.

449
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:31,234
Move your vehicle right away.

450
00:37:58,366 --> 00:38:00,086
Don't worry, we'll get
you out on the road

451
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:01,304
and out of this mess in no time.

452
00:38:02,649 --> 00:38:03,757
Excuse me,

453
00:38:04,245 --> 00:38:04,869
sir?

454
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:05,678
Yes, ma'am?

455
00:38:06,696 --> 00:38:08,115
Can I help, officer?

456
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:10,151
No. Everything is fine.

457
00:38:11,146 --> 00:38:12,667
Can I give the woman a lift?

458
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,281
I'm O.K. It's drivable.

459
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:17,104
It's not drivable.
You have a flat.

460
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:18,396
Oh.

461
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:21,096
Come on, Buddy, help
me get this going.

462
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,322
Sorry it's so heavy.

463
00:38:26,566 --> 00:38:27,443
Pull it out straight.

464
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:28,573
Books, you know?

465
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:35,264
Let me help you with that.

466
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:36,671
Look, ma'am,

467
00:38:36,812 --> 00:38:38,015
just return to your car, O.K?

468
00:38:38,076 --> 00:38:39,642
I mean, there's nothing you're
gonna be able to do tonight.

469
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,563
Thanks a lot.

470
00:39:35,444 --> 00:39:36,616
Uhh!

471
00:39:40,097 --> 00:39:40,855
Push.

472
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,087
O.K.

473
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:26,434
All right. Come on.

474
00:40:38,998 --> 00:40:39,684
O.K.

475
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,247
Go get the lights.

476
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:42,789
Go.

477
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:01,966
All right.

478
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:07,808
Oh, my God.

479
00:41:08,105 --> 00:41:08,666
O.K.

480
00:41:09,494 --> 00:41:10,258
All right.

481
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:24,408
Shit.

482
00:41:35,547 --> 00:41:36,673
Bastard.

483
00:41:40,085 --> 00:41:42,101
All right, it's over. We better
get the hell out of here.

484
00:41:58,064 --> 00:41:59,515
He'll never hurt us again.

485
00:42:00,616 --> 00:42:01,724
What do we do now?

486
00:42:02,851 --> 00:42:04,523
Wait for the body to surface.

487
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,411
They'll do an autopsy, maybe.

488
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,854
He was drunk. He fell in.

489
00:42:10,816 --> 00:42:11,869
When will it come up?

490
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,089
Tomorrow, maybe.

491
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:18,098
Oh,

492
00:42:18,312 --> 00:42:19,772
come on. You can't
pull that off.

493
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,326
Why hasn't he risen yet?

494
00:42:52,387 --> 00:42:53,311
It'll happen.

495
00:42:54,195 --> 00:42:55,320
Be patient.

496
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:57,395
I'm not going to be able to do this.

497
00:42:57,894 --> 00:42:59,711
Well, I suggest you try.

498
00:43:00,515 --> 00:43:02,416
It isn't like you burnt the toast, Mia.

499
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:03,677
You killed your husband.

500
00:43:04,107 --> 00:43:05,886
It's a little off the chart demerit-wise,

501
00:43:06,661 --> 00:43:07,567
understand?

502
00:43:12,835 --> 00:43:14,139
You're so calm.

503
00:43:15,766 --> 00:43:16,766
Look at you.

504
00:43:17,491 --> 00:43:18,747
Your hair is done.

505
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:20,902
You've got make up on...

506
00:43:21,447 --> 00:43:23,462
This is a day like any other day.

507
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:26,843
We did what we had to do, and it's done,

508
00:43:27,244 --> 00:43:28,244
O.K.?

509
00:43:29,054 --> 00:43:30,396
It was self-defence.

510
00:43:31,663 --> 00:43:33,377
You've been taking it for too long now.

511
00:43:33,438 --> 00:43:34,964
You finally said, 'fuck off.'

512
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:36,559
Good for you.

513
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:37,859
Fuck him.

514
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:39,519
Fuck them.

515
00:43:41,029 --> 00:43:43,159
Everything but 'fuck you.'

516
00:43:43,885 --> 00:43:44,620
Roughly.

517
00:43:44,879 --> 00:43:45,879
Now, come on.

518
00:43:47,943 --> 00:43:48,985
Places.

519
00:43:59,844 --> 00:44:01,187
I desire.

520
00:44:01,712 --> 00:44:03,054
Je desire.

521
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:05,647
They desire.

522
00:44:05,964 --> 00:44:07,809
Ils desirent.

523
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:23,213
They desire...

524
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:24,193
Feminine.

525
00:44:24,516 --> 00:44:25,964
Elles desirent.

526
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,504
Hey, Tad, over here!

527
00:44:35,897 --> 00:44:38,054
Ms. Horner. While the cat's
away, the mice will...

528
00:44:38,115 --> 00:44:39,377
Apparently.

529
00:44:39,884 --> 00:44:40,884
Not at all.

530
00:44:41,091 --> 00:44:44,070
Guy and I talked to a new supplier Friday.

531
00:44:44,484 --> 00:44:45,826
Portions are smaller.

532
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,390
Is Dr. Baran here?

533
00:44:47,934 --> 00:44:49,535
His car's back in the garage.

534
00:44:49,596 --> 00:44:50,617
It was gone all weekend.

535
00:44:50,678 --> 00:44:51,290
Excuse me?

536
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,416
Because, if he is, could
you ask him please,

537
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:55,439
if he's going to take
his classes tomorrow?

538
00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:58,352
I can't possibly take on
any more... Mrs. Baran!

539
00:44:58,884 --> 00:45:00,100
-Boys!
-You idiot.

540
00:45:00,161 --> 00:45:00,733
What?

541
00:45:00,996 --> 00:45:02,336
Why are you torturing her?

542
00:45:02,732 --> 00:45:05,100
Isn't it obvious she
doesn't know where he is?

543
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,702
Miss Horner, please.

544
00:45:06,763 --> 00:45:07,763
The students.

545
00:45:08,901 --> 00:45:10,012
I don't blame you, though.

546
00:45:10,302 --> 00:45:12,111
He could make an effort for your sakes...

547
00:45:12,405 --> 00:45:13,410
Uh, for her sake.

548
00:45:33,794 --> 00:45:35,387
You're drawing attention to yourself.

549
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,953
I'm allowed to brood.

550
00:45:39,324 --> 00:45:40,983
My husband's disappeared.

551
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:44,781
You'll feel better when the body surfaces.

552
00:45:45,585 --> 00:45:46,585
Yeah.

553
00:45:46,686 --> 00:45:48,021
It always perks me up.

554
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,495
What do your saints say?

555
00:45:55,479 --> 00:45:56,552
I'm brooding.

556
00:45:56,696 --> 00:45:57,696
I'm not praying.

557
00:45:58,241 --> 00:45:59,569
Lost your faith, huh?

558
00:46:01,203 --> 00:46:03,390
I never really had
any to begin with, I guess.

559
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,810
Never believed in any of it...

560
00:46:06,817 --> 00:46:09,947
God, the virgin Mary,
that life begins at 40,

561
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,665
and that people are all
just basically good inside.

562
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:16,827
Pretty soon, we'll be the Same person.

563
00:46:18,137 --> 00:46:19,572
See how nice things turned out?

564
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,993
I'm going inside.

565
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:27,450
You know, it wasn't too smart

566
00:46:27,477 --> 00:46:28,761
changing the food like that.

567
00:46:28,946 --> 00:46:31,248
You never would have done
that if he was alive.

568
00:46:31,309 --> 00:46:32,829
What's the point in killing him, then?

569
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,792
I like making it better for the boys.

570
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:39,225
Still, if it's all the Same with you,

571
00:46:39,286 --> 00:46:41,303
I'd rather not hang for fried chicken.

572
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,426
Nicole, why did you kill him?

573
00:46:44,561 --> 00:46:45,765
You could have left him.

574
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,266
You could have left here.

575
00:46:49,696 --> 00:46:51,105
I was underestimated.

576
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:04,344
Stop looking at it.

577
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:05,683
People are watching us.

578
00:47:05,744 --> 00:47:07,636
I can't stand it much longer.

579
00:47:10,406 --> 00:47:11,406
Finally.

580
00:47:13,688 --> 00:47:16,313
We're going to have to get
the net from the shed.

581
00:47:16,765 --> 00:47:18,002
Who wants to go?

582
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:21,212
Me! Me! Me! Me!

583
00:47:21,722 --> 00:47:22,722
Desantis?

584
00:47:25,417 --> 00:47:26,417
Ohh!

585
00:47:27,365 --> 00:47:28,604
What are we going to do now?

586
00:47:28,665 --> 00:47:30,217
Now, we'll have to drain the pool.

587
00:47:30,571 --> 00:47:31,571
I'll get it.

588
00:47:32,738 --> 00:47:33,394
No!

589
00:47:33,572 --> 00:47:34,964
-Why not?
-He's a child.

590
00:47:35,459 --> 00:47:37,029
Go and see if you can find it!

591
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:55,868
There's something down there.

592
00:48:10,107 --> 00:48:11,268
It's a lighter.

593
00:48:11,396 --> 00:48:13,047
Hey, that's Dr. Baran's.

594
00:48:13,399 --> 00:48:15,525
Remember the close-up when
he was playing with it?

595
00:48:15,846 --> 00:48:17,188
Did you see anything else?

596
00:48:17,546 --> 00:48:18,546
No.

597
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:20,792
All right, that's enough.
Go inside and change.

598
00:48:21,137 --> 00:48:22,999
Now, take that up to Dr. Baran's office.

599
00:48:24,483 --> 00:48:25,770
We'll have to drain the pool.

600
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:26,865
And refill it?

601
00:48:27,194 --> 00:48:28,936
Well, that's up to Dr. Baran.

602
00:48:29,772 --> 00:48:31,053
All right, everybody. That's enough.

603
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:31,585
Go on.

604
00:48:31,712 --> 00:48:34,053
Go on inside and get ready
and go back to class. Go on.

605
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:38,164
Mia...

606
00:48:38,637 --> 00:48:39,637
Mr. Gannon,

607
00:48:39,945 --> 00:48:41,179
will you drain the pool?

608
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,010
I've got orders not to.

609
00:48:43,776 --> 00:48:45,199
But my keys are in there.

610
00:48:45,758 --> 00:48:46,758
Please?

611
00:48:49,062 --> 00:48:50,062
Right away, please.

612
00:48:52,582 --> 00:48:53,582
Here's the penis

613
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:55,764
and the scrotum,

614
00:48:56,515 --> 00:48:59,671
that holds the testicles,
or testes, inside.

615
00:49:00,928 --> 00:49:02,480
Now, when you're around 14...

616
00:49:02,763 --> 00:49:04,454
maybe sooner, maybe later...

617
00:49:05,419 --> 00:49:08,554
the testes start making a chemical
substance called a hormone.

618
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:10,945
It's this hormone that causes the changes.

619
00:49:11,494 --> 00:49:15,289
It starts hair growing
here under your arms

620
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:16,928
and on your face.

621
00:49:18,026 --> 00:49:19,098
Mr. Gannon,

622
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:20,723
what is it?

623
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:23,354
Something blocking the drain!

624
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,380
Since you want it done right away,

625
00:49:25,404 --> 00:49:26,716
I can't help the noise.

626
00:49:32,451 --> 00:49:34,145
You all know what sperm is?

627
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,388
Yes.

628
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,539
Go on, Mr. Nunez.

629
00:49:40,748 --> 00:49:41,826
Atlantic...

630
00:49:42,434 --> 00:49:43,434
Pacific...

631
00:49:44,056 --> 00:49:45,078
Indian...

632
00:49:47,127 --> 00:49:48,127
Arctic.

633
00:49:48,473 --> 00:49:49,473
Arctic...

634
00:49:51,895 --> 00:49:52,895
Class?

635
00:49:53,765 --> 00:49:54,988
Atlantic...

636
00:49:55,186 --> 00:49:56,586
Pacific...

637
00:49:56,787 --> 00:49:58,160
Indian...

638
00:49:58,235 --> 00:49:59,444
Arctic...

639
00:49:59,574 --> 00:50:01,415
Mediterranean...

640
00:50:01,476 --> 00:50:03,418
Gulf of Mexico...

641
00:50:03,479 --> 00:50:05,060
And Caribbean.

642
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,975
Australian...

643
00:50:07,043 --> 00:50:08,418
Hudson bay...

644
00:50:08,751 --> 00:50:10,365
Baltic sea...

645
00:50:10,426 --> 00:50:11,867
North sea...

646
00:50:12,157 --> 00:50:13,698
English channel...

647
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:15,309
Irish sea...

648
00:50:15,825 --> 00:50:17,301
Bering sea.

649
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,487
Mrs. Baran fainted! Let's go!

650
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:35,710
-Get a doctor.
-I'll go.

651
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:52,115
Doctor's very worried about you.

652
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,198
-He thinks this is serious.
-Where is the body?

653
00:50:56,265 --> 00:50:58,299
Someone moved it. That's apparent.

654
00:50:58,757 --> 00:51:00,962
-Someone saw us put it in?
-No.

655
00:51:01,901 --> 00:51:02,901
Well, I don't know.

656
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:03,973
Maybe.

657
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:07,764
I've got to find him.

658
00:51:08,302 --> 00:51:11,145
No. Mia, let's just stick
to our story. O.K?

659
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:12,264
It's even better like this

660
00:51:12,325 --> 00:51:13,925
'cause we really don't know where he is.

661
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:15,369
He'll turn up.

662
00:51:15,464 --> 00:51:17,445
If he doesn't, all the better. O.K?

663
00:51:17,506 --> 00:51:19,453
-Did you take your heart medicine?
-No.

664
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:22,083
We've got to act naturally.

665
00:51:22,403 --> 00:51:24,454
You have to start asking about Guy,

666
00:51:24,645 --> 00:51:26,069
you know, be more concerned,

667
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,981
like you would be
if he was really missing.

668
00:51:31,766 --> 00:51:33,531
Ohh! Ohh!

669
00:51:33,835 --> 00:51:34,736
Ohh!

670
00:51:34,797 --> 00:51:35,797
What?

671
00:51:35,962 --> 00:51:36,962
His suit.

672
00:51:44,988 --> 00:51:46,097
Oh, my God.

673
00:52:06,213 --> 00:52:07,818
4 x 6 colour prints, please.

674
00:52:07,879 --> 00:52:09,451
Could I have those in 20 minutes?

675
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:29,013
Ah! Dios mio!

676
00:52:30,256 --> 00:52:31,256
Ask her.

677
00:52:39,273 --> 00:52:41,850
Tell her if she sees anything to call us.

678
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:52,659
He's disappeared.

679
00:53:04,699 --> 00:53:05,794
Vaya con dios,

680
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:07,216
O.K.?

681
00:53:11,411 --> 00:53:13,211
Let's just get these and
get out of here, O.K?

682
00:53:33,224 --> 00:53:34,467
Someone's watching us.

683
00:53:35,356 --> 00:53:36,799
Someone with Guy's camera.

684
00:53:47,429 --> 00:53:48,670
You need to eat, honey.

685
00:53:49,194 --> 00:53:50,129
I'm not hungry.

686
00:53:50,189 --> 00:53:51,189
Thank you.

687
00:53:51,564 --> 00:53:52,834
He is dead, Mia.

688
00:53:55,509 --> 00:53:57,012
He is dead. We killed him together.

689
00:53:57,073 --> 00:53:58,327
You saw him die.

690
00:54:02,711 --> 00:54:03,953
What about the pictures?

691
00:54:04,568 --> 00:54:07,029
I think someone took them
before he was killed...

692
00:54:09,098 --> 00:54:10,098
Right?

693
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,205
Who?

694
00:54:11,321 --> 00:54:13,824
We'll find that out when
they start blackmailing us.

695
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:16,052
He's dead.

696
00:54:16,579 --> 00:54:17,738
This is another thing.

697
00:54:19,378 --> 00:54:21,077
Look, there's something
I haven't told you.

698
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:25,291
Open it.

699
00:54:30,237 --> 00:54:31,377
It's from the school accounts.

700
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:33,041
That's why there's never any money there.

701
00:54:33,544 --> 00:54:36,030
It was for Guy and me.
He told me someone stole it.

702
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:38,173
Well, I found it when I
was looking for the body.

703
00:54:38,953 --> 00:54:40,327
You killed him for money?

704
00:54:40,869 --> 00:54:42,878
Believe me. It wasn't the only reason.

705
00:54:44,921 --> 00:54:46,721
There's $50,000 there, Mia.

706
00:54:47,046 --> 00:54:48,046
We'll split it.

707
00:54:48,507 --> 00:54:51,131
You can use it to pay for
your goddamn fried chicken.

708
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:54,469
I can go to the police.

709
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,008
I can tell them what we did.

710
00:54:58,422 --> 00:54:59,422
What you did.

711
00:55:00,574 --> 00:55:01,782
We both did it.

712
00:55:02,485 --> 00:55:05,193
Well, I don't think they'll
see that as beneficial to me.

713
00:55:05,548 --> 00:55:07,753
They'll say, 'the wife gets the school,

714
00:55:07,918 --> 00:55:09,729
'the money he embezzled, her freedom.

715
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:11,148
'What did the other woman get?

716
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,476
Nothing.'

717
00:55:14,033 --> 00:55:15,233
That's how they'll look at it.

718
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:23,605
I'll say we were lovers.

719
00:55:24,227 --> 00:55:26,850
Well, you can take the
girl out of the convent.

720
00:55:28,851 --> 00:55:30,761
I thought we had the Same reason.

721
00:55:32,123 --> 00:55:33,670
We did have the Same reason.

722
00:55:35,274 --> 00:55:36,807
I just had an extra one.

723
00:55:39,643 --> 00:55:41,301
I'm sorry I lied to you.

724
00:55:42,123 --> 00:55:43,294
I couldn't do it now.

725
00:55:46,515 --> 00:55:48,331
If you hadn't found this,

726
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:50,828
you killed the one person

727
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,726
who could have told you where it was.

728
00:55:54,774 --> 00:55:56,243
He said we were partners,

729
00:55:57,171 --> 00:55:58,617
and then he acted alone.

730
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:35,535
Mia!

731
00:56:37,212 --> 00:56:38,237
Mia!

732
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:40,262
Mia!

733
00:56:41,248 --> 00:56:42,303
Mia!

734
00:56:44,165 --> 00:56:44,774
Hey.

735
00:56:44,962 --> 00:56:45,962
Where you going?

736
00:56:46,064 --> 00:56:47,161
I've got to go.

737
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:48,539
What are you talking about?

738
00:56:51,192 --> 00:56:51,708
This.

739
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,182
It was under my door this morning.

740
00:56:54,425 --> 00:56:55,425
It's over.

741
00:56:55,546 --> 00:56:56,546
He's been found.

742
00:56:57,074 --> 00:56:58,315
This is Sunbury.

743
00:56:58,494 --> 00:57:01,049
This is 20 Miles from here.
Now, how would he get there?

744
00:57:01,276 --> 00:57:01,984
I don't know.

745
00:57:02,045 --> 00:57:03,934
Someone took him out of the pool
and dumped him in the river.

746
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:04,844
I don't know.

747
00:57:04,905 --> 00:57:06,911
Hey, Mia, but I think we
should call the police first

748
00:57:06,935 --> 00:57:09,047
and file a missing persons report.

749
00:57:09,108 --> 00:57:10,557
I've got to go. It's him.

750
00:57:10,726 --> 00:57:11,846
All right. I'll go with you.

751
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:29,822
No, I'll wait.

752
00:57:30,883 --> 00:57:31,438
Fine.

753
00:57:31,499 --> 00:57:31,952
Hold on.

754
00:57:32,029 --> 00:57:33,133
You can wait in there.

755
00:57:33,194 --> 00:57:35,011
No. I'll be fine.

756
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,760
Just...

757
00:57:37,012 --> 00:57:38,223
don't let him forget me.

758
00:57:39,266 --> 00:57:40,826
You're not going to light that are you?

759
00:57:41,615 --> 00:57:42,629
You can light these?

760
00:57:42,864 --> 00:57:43,864
In America?

761
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:45,519
Nah. I'm quitting.

762
00:57:45,797 --> 00:57:46,797
Nicorette.

763
00:57:50,211 --> 00:57:51,211
Excuse me.

764
00:57:52,248 --> 00:57:53,801
My husband is missing.

765
00:57:56,466 --> 00:57:57,882
I think this might be him.

766
00:57:58,650 --> 00:57:59,299
How long?

767
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,400
Four days.

768
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:02,718
Have you filled out
a missing persons report?

769
00:58:02,893 --> 00:58:03,893
No.

770
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:08,318
So, has he left before
without telling you?

771
00:58:08,863 --> 00:58:10,426
The description fits.

772
00:58:11,137 --> 00:58:12,137
Uh-huh.

773
00:58:12,385 --> 00:58:14,709
O.K. John Doe, 180 pounds, 6-foot even.

774
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:15,710
That's right.

775
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:16,984
Describe his clothing.

776
00:58:17,631 --> 00:58:19,727
The body was naked,
that's what it says here.

777
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,468
We don't always tell the press everything.

778
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:24,911
Well, I... I didn't see him
the day he disappeared.

779
00:58:25,783 --> 00:58:26,783
Any jewellery?

780
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,385
A wedding ring. That's all.

781
00:58:30,655 --> 00:58:31,942
He doesn't always wear that.

782
00:58:33,912 --> 00:58:35,338
Can I just see the body?

783
00:58:37,534 --> 00:58:38,684
Appendectomy scar?

784
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,040
No.

785
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,020
I see.

786
00:58:43,335 --> 00:58:44,335
No.

787
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:46,822
Hold on.

788
00:58:48,321 --> 00:58:49,321
Howie?

789
00:58:50,055 --> 00:58:51,754
I think we have Mrs. Doe here.

790
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:05,001
Hi.

791
00:59:06,217 --> 00:59:07,495
You've got to prepare yourself.

792
00:59:07,556 --> 00:59:08,936
The sand does a lot of damage.

793
00:59:12,868 --> 00:59:14,679
Oh, my God.

794
00:59:16,082 --> 00:59:17,279
Is that your husband, ma'am?

795
00:59:20,671 --> 00:59:21,671
No.

796
00:59:22,124 --> 00:59:23,124
Oh?

797
00:59:28,944 --> 00:59:30,085
Poor kid.

798
00:59:30,188 --> 00:59:32,727
Wasn't her husband. Never
saw him before in her life.

799
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,321
Excuse me?

800
00:59:58,933 --> 01:00:00,073
Mrs. Baran?

801
01:00:00,687 --> 01:00:01,687
Who are you?

802
01:00:01,714 --> 01:00:03,121
Please, forgive me for intruding.

803
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,347
Come, sit down.

804
01:00:08,796 --> 01:00:09,881
Coffee, please.

805
01:00:12,644 --> 01:00:14,640
I... I saw you at the sheriff's station.

806
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,699
I got your name off the view request.

807
01:00:17,686 --> 01:00:18,686
Shirley Vogel.

808
01:00:20,894 --> 01:00:21,909
You're the police?

809
01:00:23,269 --> 01:00:24,435
Cagney and Lacey.

810
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:25,496
That kind of thing.

811
01:00:25,697 --> 01:00:27,007
You know, they met with me once?

812
01:00:27,068 --> 01:00:28,068
Research stuff.

813
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:29,225
Nice girls.

814
01:00:29,735 --> 01:00:30,735
I say 'girls.'

815
01:00:30,762 --> 01:00:31,762
That O.K. With you?

816
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:33,571
Anyway...

817
01:00:33,749 --> 01:00:35,130
Flash forward 10 years,

818
01:00:35,248 --> 01:00:36,448
I'm on medical leave.

819
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:37,509
The big 'c.'

820
01:00:38,454 --> 01:00:39,454
Air.

821
01:00:40,327 --> 01:00:41,327
I'm sorry.

822
01:00:41,456 --> 01:00:42,456
Ah, whatever.

823
01:00:42,637 --> 01:00:43,485
I knew it was coming.

824
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:44,455
My family...

825
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,029
never two boobs in a coffin.

826
01:00:47,346 --> 01:00:48,346
I'm sorry, but...

827
01:00:48,735 --> 01:00:50,353
I don't know why you're here.

828
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:51,987
Remember your husband?

829
01:00:55,283 --> 01:00:57,446
Uh... could I get some coffee, please?

830
01:00:58,991 --> 01:00:59,991
You mean...

831
01:01:01,254 --> 01:01:02,542
I'm sure he'll turn up.

832
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:04,560
Yeah. Wrapped around a pier apparently.

833
01:01:04,621 --> 01:01:06,614
I mean, you drove all the way from...

834
01:01:06,675 --> 01:01:07,946
That's very kind of you, but...

835
01:01:09,139 --> 01:01:10,324
Who the hell am I, right?

836
01:01:10,819 --> 01:01:11,819
I don't blame you.

837
01:01:12,138 --> 01:01:13,138
Look, um...

838
01:01:13,512 --> 01:01:15,243
I know a Guy in the
department in Hazelton.

839
01:01:15,349 --> 01:01:17,834
I could call him, he'll
visit, get the details.

840
01:01:17,895 --> 01:01:19,327
I don't want to make it official.

841
01:01:20,939 --> 01:01:22,859
Suppose it's just intentional.

842
01:01:23,101 --> 01:01:24,101
Here's your coffee.

843
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,800
Yeah. I know what you mean.

844
01:01:27,053 --> 01:01:28,053
Men.

845
01:01:31,073 --> 01:01:32,577
How do they sleep at night?

846
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:36,347
They have sex.

847
01:01:36,853 --> 01:01:38,212
That's how they sleep at night.

848
01:01:40,033 --> 01:01:41,533
He might be home already.

849
01:01:42,941 --> 01:01:44,536
This place. Jesus.

850
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,310
It's no sizzler, is it?

851
01:01:47,372 --> 01:01:49,391
He'll be furious if I've
gone to the police.

852
01:01:50,163 --> 01:01:52,219
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Keep it private.

853
01:01:52,689 --> 01:01:54,689
You know, once the boys get
their hooks into you...

854
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:57,257
You know, I couldn't afford you.

855
01:01:57,370 --> 01:01:58,527
We run a school.

856
01:01:58,588 --> 01:01:59,588
A school?

857
01:01:59,747 --> 01:02:01,382
Then you can forget the police.

858
01:02:01,632 --> 01:02:03,761
You can't afford that kind of publicity.

859
01:02:04,243 --> 01:02:04,722
Look,

860
01:02:05,175 --> 01:02:08,630
2, 3 days, I chase him down
to some girlfriend's house,

861
01:02:08,793 --> 01:02:10,522
and I scare the shit out of him.

862
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,495
That wouldn't be easy.

863
01:02:14,441 --> 01:02:15,441
Look, I...

864
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,102
I don't want money.

865
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:19,563
I mean, look at me. I'm...

866
01:02:20,033 --> 01:02:22,301
chasing all over
Pennsylvania for lunch dates

867
01:02:22,362 --> 01:02:24,397
with guys I couldn't stand 10 years ago.

868
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:27,737
Give me something to do.

869
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:32,967
You ever smoke?

870
01:02:33,651 --> 01:02:34,651
No.

871
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:36,221
Yeah.

872
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,460
Well...

873
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:39,157
Look at this security system.

874
01:02:39,181 --> 01:02:41,560
You know, what is this, a
piece of the true cross?

875
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:45,458
Aren't you hungry?

876
01:02:46,384 --> 01:02:46,901
Oh.

877
01:02:46,962 --> 01:02:48,027
I thought I should eat.

878
01:02:50,454 --> 01:02:51,816
You know what your problem is?

879
01:02:52,828 --> 01:02:54,209
You're feeling guilty.

880
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,920
No.

881
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:57,530
I'm not.

882
01:02:58,652 --> 01:02:59,821
It's not your fault.

883
01:03:00,525 --> 01:03:01,525
It's men.

884
01:03:02,001 --> 01:03:03,143
Testosterone.

885
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:05,740
They should put it in bombs.

886
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:08,868
You want that?

887
01:04:01,386 --> 01:04:02,786
Mrs. Baran would like me to help...

888
01:04:03,133 --> 01:04:04,133
Informally.

889
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:09,382
Well, Ms. Vogel... or is it detective?

890
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:11,315
Detective.

891
01:04:12,494 --> 01:04:15,202
Well, frankly, detective, I don't
think we need to overreact.

892
01:04:15,611 --> 01:04:16,920
We've seen this before.

893
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:19,224
We have?

894
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:24,359
We, we, we. What is she, the school nurse?

895
01:04:25,707 --> 01:04:27,427
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

896
01:04:28,557 --> 01:04:29,792
Last Saturday.

897
01:04:31,586 --> 01:04:34,116
He was asleep when we left at 7:00.

898
01:04:34,623 --> 01:04:36,939
Nicole and I drove out to her duplex.

899
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Oh, look!

900
01:04:38,312 --> 01:04:40,388
This must be nice... when it's full.

901
01:04:40,497 --> 01:04:42,619
Isn't it kinda dangerous
keeping it empty like this?

902
01:04:43,256 --> 01:04:45,171
Yeah. Well, we lost some keys in there.

903
01:04:45,731 --> 01:04:48,061
You know, I think we should
get back to our students.

904
01:04:48,269 --> 01:04:49,513
They're on work crew this week.

905
01:04:49,947 --> 01:04:51,021
Yeah. So I noticed.

906
01:04:51,444 --> 01:04:53,763
Must save money, I bet, having
the kids keep up the place.

907
01:04:54,066 --> 01:04:55,325
These older buildings.

908
01:04:56,061 --> 01:04:58,569
So, none of his friends
know where he might be?

909
01:04:58,912 --> 01:05:00,081
We haven't asked them.

910
01:05:00,217 --> 01:05:01,457
You know, it's kind of awkward.

911
01:05:01,663 --> 01:05:02,883
'Hey, my husband's disappeared,

912
01:05:02,907 --> 01:05:04,400
have you seen him?' You know.

913
01:05:05,378 --> 01:05:06,378
Her husband.

914
01:05:06,767 --> 01:05:08,498
It wouldn't be awkward for me.

915
01:05:08,575 --> 01:05:09,878
If it's O.K, Mrs. Baran,

916
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:11,739
maybe I could take a look
at his address book.

917
01:05:12,695 --> 01:05:13,816
You know, detective,

918
01:05:13,942 --> 01:05:16,481
I don't think we need to make
a Mountain out of a molehill.

919
01:05:16,593 --> 01:05:19,761
Exactly. I mean can you imagine
this place crawling with police.

920
01:05:19,822 --> 01:05:22,698
Wouldn't be the kind of thing you'd write
home in letter about, now, would it?

921
01:05:22,722 --> 01:05:23,722
We'll tiptoe.

922
01:05:24,151 --> 01:05:25,994
Would you be kind enough to
show me your husband's things?

923
01:05:26,018 --> 01:05:27,018
Of course.

924
01:05:30,585 --> 01:05:32,015
So nice meeting you, Ms. Horner.

925
01:05:43,267 --> 01:05:44,611
Oh, this is lucky.

926
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:46,032
A phone bill.

927
01:05:46,093 --> 01:05:48,345
Yeah. It came this morning.

928
01:05:50,531 --> 01:05:51,531
May I?

929
01:05:57,795 --> 01:05:59,185
Ah. This must be Ms. Horner.

930
01:05:59,564 --> 01:06:00,564
Pittsburgh.

931
01:06:00,689 --> 01:06:01,737
Earlier this month.

932
01:06:02,081 --> 01:06:04,260
I... I call her there sometimes

933
01:06:04,321 --> 01:06:05,601
when she goes there on weekends.

934
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:08,131
53 minutes.

935
01:06:08,453 --> 01:06:09,670
72 minutes.

936
01:06:09,988 --> 01:06:10,988
Girl talk.

937
01:06:11,186 --> 01:06:12,186
Yeah.

938
01:06:14,297 --> 01:06:15,457
This goes through Monday.

939
01:06:16,192 --> 01:06:17,872
He didn't call you there over the weekend?

940
01:06:18,423 --> 01:06:19,423
No.

941
01:06:20,898 --> 01:06:22,538
What kind of car does your husband drive?

942
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:24,970
We have one car... the Cherokee.

943
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:26,985
How did you break the tail light?

944
01:06:27,009 --> 01:06:28,037
I don't know.

945
01:06:28,149 --> 01:06:29,656
It happened a while ago.

946
01:06:31,438 --> 01:06:33,133
What was he wearing when he disappeared?

947
01:06:34,649 --> 01:06:36,351
Um... His blue suit.

948
01:06:37,905 --> 01:06:39,006
Could I see his closet?

949
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,240
Yes.

950
01:06:45,578 --> 01:06:46,790
It's missing.

951
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:48,143
His blue suit...

952
01:06:49,182 --> 01:06:50,182
And his belt...

953
01:06:50,303 --> 01:06:51,328
with the silver buckle.

954
01:06:52,076 --> 01:06:53,520
You just have to look and you know.

955
01:06:54,018 --> 01:06:55,018
Good for you.

956
01:06:55,996 --> 01:06:57,222
Place for everything,

957
01:06:57,283 --> 01:06:58,801
and everything in its place.

958
01:07:00,129 --> 01:07:01,421
I hope we're not too late.

959
01:07:01,834 --> 01:07:03,338
There's video cameras out there.

960
01:07:04,523 --> 01:07:05,472
Is that the news?

961
01:07:05,532 --> 01:07:08,185
Oh, no. It's just some PR for the school.

962
01:07:08,456 --> 01:07:10,731
Is that all, detective? I'm really tired.

963
01:07:10,936 --> 01:07:11,936
Of course.

964
01:07:13,104 --> 01:07:14,104
The address book?

965
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:15,190
It's in his office.

966
01:07:16,327 --> 01:07:17,327
I'll find it.

967
01:07:19,863 --> 01:07:20,863
Oh, um...

968
01:07:21,278 --> 01:07:22,486
It's just one more thing.

969
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:24,254
That isn't the suit there, is it?

970
01:07:27,724 --> 01:07:28,724
Mia,

971
01:07:28,755 --> 01:07:30,269
you're needed to take Voss' classes.

972
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:32,094
Oh, detective, you're still here.

973
01:07:32,293 --> 01:07:33,633
Yes, I was just wondering if...

974
01:07:33,694 --> 01:07:36,208
this is the suit Dr. Baran
was wearing on Sunday.

975
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:37,490
No.

976
01:07:37,579 --> 01:07:38,956
But close. He had two.

977
01:07:40,755 --> 01:07:43,666
Well, maybe I'll go and speak with
some of the other teachers now.

978
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:46,039
Ms. Horner.

979
01:07:46,306 --> 01:07:47,306
Mm-hmm.

980
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:53,597
Why did you bring her here?

981
01:07:54,244 --> 01:07:55,880
I'm supposed to act concerned.

982
01:07:56,367 --> 01:07:57,921
Anyway, it keeps the police away.

983
01:07:58,977 --> 01:07:59,977
Fine.

984
01:08:00,602 --> 01:08:02,042
That woman should wear a prosthesis.

985
01:08:02,089 --> 01:08:04,601
I hate that in-your-face survivor crap.

986
01:08:07,605 --> 01:08:09,220
I'm really tired, Nicole.

987
01:08:15,461 --> 01:08:16,993
It's O.K. You did fine.

988
01:08:17,597 --> 01:08:18,913
I heard you from the hallway.

989
01:08:20,937 --> 01:08:22,767
Just don't see her alone any more.

990
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,263
Promise?

991
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,997
Can I get a print-out of that?

992
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:42,987
Yeah. You can get a dub of it, too.

993
01:08:50,503 --> 01:08:52,069
Oh, this is some really cool stuff.

994
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:53,643
Total inside edition material.

995
01:08:54,053 --> 01:08:55,261
Yeah. The magic hour tape.

996
01:08:55,367 --> 01:08:57,057
This guy gives 'prick' a bad name.

997
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,471
What doesn't?

998
01:09:01,622 --> 01:09:02,937
I want this one, too.

999
01:09:12,617 --> 01:09:16,778
O.K, if x equals 4, then x minus 2 is?

1000
01:09:16,884 --> 01:09:17,945
-2.
-Great.

1001
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:21,109
10 plus x, when x equals 3 is?

1002
01:09:23,144 --> 01:09:24,317
I'm talking to you.

1003
01:09:24,377 --> 01:09:25,859
Oh, um, 13.

1004
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:26,920
Thank you.

1005
01:09:27,012 --> 01:09:28,012
Ahem.

1006
01:09:31,994 --> 01:09:34,129
All right, I want you to
review these equations,

1007
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:36,047
continue to work them until I return.

1008
01:09:36,108 --> 01:09:37,681
And stay in your seats.

1009
01:09:49,794 --> 01:09:51,020
This is Ms. Horner.

1010
01:09:51,864 --> 01:09:53,942
Nicole, this is Lisa Campos.

1011
01:09:54,228 --> 01:09:55,228
Hello.

1012
01:09:57,507 --> 01:09:59,304
Ms. Campos is looking for Guy.

1013
01:10:01,777 --> 01:10:04,000
Well, I'm sure Mrs. Baran told you

1014
01:10:04,061 --> 01:10:06,057
that Dr. Baran is away on business.

1015
01:10:06,757 --> 01:10:08,387
You said you didn't know where he was.

1016
01:10:09,249 --> 01:10:10,249
Well...

1017
01:10:10,691 --> 01:10:12,161
Someone has to pay.

1018
01:10:12,763 --> 01:10:14,091
He said he would, but...

1019
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:15,526
I thought it over.

1020
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:17,601
I don't want to wait till
next month like he said.

1021
01:10:20,224 --> 01:10:21,224
Excuse me?

1022
01:10:22,057 --> 01:10:23,898
Ms. Campos is expecting.

1023
01:10:24,891 --> 01:10:27,620
Unto her a child will be born.

1024
01:10:30,183 --> 01:10:31,970
What does this have to do with Dr. Baran?

1025
01:10:32,454 --> 01:10:33,454
What do you think?

1026
01:10:34,284 --> 01:10:35,876
What makes you think that it's Guy's?

1027
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:38,978
That's what he said. But come on,

1028
01:10:39,299 --> 01:10:40,401
I would know.

1029
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:42,829
I don't sleep around.

1030
01:10:43,745 --> 01:10:45,083
And he said he'd pay.

1031
01:10:45,391 --> 01:10:46,924
I'm not putting it on my card.

1032
01:10:47,021 --> 01:10:48,101
I'm maxed out.

1033
01:10:54,353 --> 01:10:55,353
O.K.

1034
01:11:00,021 --> 01:11:01,021
Well...

1035
01:11:02,577 --> 01:11:05,999
So, you're absolutely certain
this is Dr. Baran's?

1036
01:11:06,171 --> 01:11:07,571
What does she have to say about it?

1037
01:11:08,202 --> 01:11:09,636
Abortion is murder.

1038
01:11:09,811 --> 01:11:12,472
Well, I'm going to have an
anaesthetic, for God's sake.

1039
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:14,157
How much is this going to cost?

1040
01:11:15,158 --> 01:11:16,498
They want 650,

1041
01:11:16,953 --> 01:11:17,953
and that's a clinic.

1042
01:11:18,391 --> 01:11:20,157
I'm not holding anybody up here, you know?

1043
01:11:20,218 --> 01:11:21,599
I just want what he promised.

1044
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:23,290
Besides...

1045
01:11:23,728 --> 01:11:24,881
It's your husband.

1046
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:27,331
You don't want me to have his baby.

1047
01:11:32,148 --> 01:11:32,997
I wouldn't have come,

1048
01:11:33,058 --> 01:11:35,351
only he said you knew
about his girlfriends,

1049
01:11:36,005 --> 01:11:37,105
Mrs. Baran.

1050
01:11:43,653 --> 01:11:44,653
Thank you.

1051
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:49,110
And tell him not to call

1052
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:50,909
when he does get back, you know?

1053
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,266
It's boundary time.

1054
01:11:55,752 --> 01:11:58,051
Incidentally, Ms. Campos...

1055
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:01,700
When was the last time you saw Dr. Baran?

1056
01:12:04,043 --> 01:12:05,114
Sunday afternoon.

1057
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:06,613
I dropped by.

1058
01:12:07,168 --> 01:12:09,384
He was real wired-up about something.

1059
01:12:10,086 --> 01:12:11,483
Figured you two had a fight.

1060
01:12:13,172 --> 01:12:14,380
Make him pay you back.

1061
01:12:18,022 --> 01:12:19,022
Anyway...

1062
01:12:19,749 --> 01:12:20,749
Goodbye.

1063
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:27,096
You knew about her?

1064
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:28,721
Yeah.

1065
01:12:30,128 --> 01:12:31,494
Since last fall.

1066
01:12:33,311 --> 01:12:34,687
Right after you came.

1067
01:12:37,031 --> 01:12:38,631
You should've told me about her.

1068
01:12:39,732 --> 01:12:42,031
Why would I want you
to be hurt like I was?

1069
01:13:07,386 --> 01:13:08,596
Somebody knows.

1070
01:13:13,715 --> 01:13:14,302
You know...

1071
01:13:14,406 --> 01:13:17,573
there was a big pile-up on the I-80.
And, uh,

1072
01:13:17,892 --> 01:13:19,152
technically, there
could've been a mistake.

1073
01:13:19,176 --> 01:13:21,371
I mean, does anyone else
use it for their travel?

1074
01:13:22,103 --> 01:13:23,103
No.

1075
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,477
No one you can think of?

1076
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:27,739
All they got was a list
of license plate numbers.

1077
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,788
Technically, they could've
gotten a number wrong,

1078
01:13:30,535 --> 01:13:32,191
But it looks like that was his car.

1079
01:13:32,253 --> 01:13:33,327
There's no way to know

1080
01:13:33,388 --> 01:13:35,486
if he was actually driving the car or not.

1081
01:13:38,182 --> 01:13:40,055
I was just telling Mrs. Baran

1082
01:13:40,116 --> 01:13:42,593
I ran Dr. Baran's license
plate through the DMV.

1083
01:13:42,998 --> 01:13:45,129
That pile-up Monday evening on the I-80?

1084
01:13:45,459 --> 01:13:46,459
He was in it.

1085
01:13:47,096 --> 01:13:48,359
The report doesn't tell us much,

1086
01:13:48,383 --> 01:13:49,646
but his car's right
there on the print out.

1087
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:50,691
It's one of 22.

1088
01:13:51,339 --> 01:13:52,859
Didn't you tell me it was an old dent?

1089
01:13:53,735 --> 01:13:54,735
Did I?

1090
01:13:56,112 --> 01:13:57,406
Let's say he left Sunday,

1091
01:13:57,466 --> 01:13:58,811
wearing one of the blue suits.

1092
01:13:59,532 --> 01:14:01,278
Couldn't he have been
heading to Pittsburgh?

1093
01:14:01,606 --> 01:14:04,157
We know, he stopped for gas
Sunday in Williamsport.

1094
01:14:04,218 --> 01:14:05,218
Oh?

1095
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:06,165
Yes.

1096
01:14:06,385 --> 01:14:09,105
Mrs. Baran gave me his credit card
numbers on the phone this morning.

1097
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,047
Anyway,

1098
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:13,313
doesn't it look like he
was trying to see you?

1099
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:15,991
Pittsburgh is a big town.

1100
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:20,602
You're sure you didn't hear from
him any time after Saturday?

1101
01:14:22,268 --> 01:14:24,407
-Oh...
-That's not the kind of thing we'd forget.

1102
01:14:26,025 --> 01:14:27,025
Mia?

1103
01:14:27,806 --> 01:14:29,063
Dear, aren't you on room checks?

1104
01:14:29,087 --> 01:14:30,355
Oh, yeah. Excuse me.

1105
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:32,622
Well, I'll be in touch.

1106
01:14:34,115 --> 01:14:35,369
I'm glad she didn't ask.

1107
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,447
There weren't any charges on
the cards from Sunday on.

1108
01:14:39,298 --> 01:14:40,298
What are room checks?

1109
01:14:40,986 --> 01:14:43,246
Drug searches. Some of the
kids here used to use.

1110
01:14:43,514 --> 01:14:45,490
My son had a habit, years ago.

1111
01:14:45,866 --> 01:14:48,065
My husband and I looked
into this kind of place.

1112
01:14:48,211 --> 01:14:49,237
He's dead now.

1113
01:14:49,572 --> 01:14:50,296
Your husband?

1114
01:14:50,415 --> 01:14:51,415
Son.

1115
01:14:51,466 --> 01:14:52,807
I.V. drug users.

1116
01:14:53,367 --> 01:14:55,045
You know what happens to them nowadays.

1117
01:14:55,469 --> 01:14:56,763
But my ex is alive.

1118
01:14:57,283 --> 01:14:58,707
Isn't God quirky?

1119
01:14:59,348 --> 01:15:00,348
You got an ex?

1120
01:15:00,383 --> 01:15:01,383
Nothing official.

1121
01:15:01,525 --> 01:15:03,125
Mine thought he was God's gift to women.

1122
01:15:03,194 --> 01:15:04,795
Like that topped my list...

1123
01:15:04,986 --> 01:15:06,130
God, please send me something

1124
01:15:06,154 --> 01:15:08,997
that'll wear black nylon socks
to bed every night of his life.

1125
01:15:10,302 --> 01:15:11,241
My idea of heaven

1126
01:15:11,302 --> 01:15:12,942
is a place where they screw you barefoot.

1127
01:15:13,492 --> 01:15:15,298
You make me want to pass a hat for you.

1128
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:16,680
Don't feel sorry for me.

1129
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:18,018
I got him to leave.

1130
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:20,132
Every cloud has a silver lining.

1131
01:15:20,594 --> 01:15:21,993
He was too dull to kill.

1132
01:15:23,562 --> 01:15:24,321
What about her?

1133
01:15:24,382 --> 01:15:25,742
She ever want to kill her husband?

1134
01:15:26,071 --> 01:15:27,211
Why would she do that?

1135
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:29,230
Maybe she found out
you were sleeping with him.

1136
01:15:30,207 --> 01:15:31,382
Oh, that's so clever.

1137
01:15:31,592 --> 01:15:34,235
What'd you do, ask a faculty
member or any student?

1138
01:15:34,673 --> 01:15:36,547
I know. You read it
in the brochure, right?

1139
01:15:37,586 --> 01:15:38,618
So she knew?

1140
01:15:38,821 --> 01:15:40,374
Of course she knew. Ask her.

1141
01:15:41,085 --> 01:15:42,332
Come on, she's not a murderer.

1142
01:15:42,393 --> 01:15:43,990
She's an ex-nun for Christ's sake.

1143
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:46,333
Yeah. Remember them?

1144
01:15:46,857 --> 01:15:49,189
They disappeared overnight
like dial phones.

1145
01:15:50,117 --> 01:15:51,117
What about you?

1146
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,660
What if he wouldn't leave her?

1147
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:54,908
Honey, if I couldn't get
a man to leave her,

1148
01:15:55,052 --> 01:15:56,663
I wouldn't kill him. I'd kill myself.

1149
01:15:57,461 --> 01:15:59,203
Well, he has left her...

1150
01:15:59,877 --> 01:16:00,877
Apparently.

1151
01:16:01,221 --> 01:16:02,393
One way or another.

1152
01:16:03,946 --> 01:16:04,946
Well...

1153
01:16:05,348 --> 01:16:06,686
Unless there's anything else...

1154
01:16:07,115 --> 01:16:08,890
Yeah, there is. Just one more thing.

1155
01:16:10,681 --> 01:16:12,005
Guy did it barefoot.

1156
01:16:14,874 --> 01:16:16,030
'Did, ' Ms. Horner?

1157
01:16:16,962 --> 01:16:18,173
Don't you mean 'does'?

1158
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:29,583
Mrs. Baran?

1159
01:16:31,102 --> 01:16:32,664
It's dinner time, Erik.

1160
01:16:33,397 --> 01:16:35,399
You should go inside with the others.

1161
01:16:36,917 --> 01:16:37,917
Are you O.K.?

1162
01:16:39,374 --> 01:16:40,738
You know the rules, Erik.

1163
01:16:41,823 --> 01:16:44,106
Your table won't be able to
eat before you're there.

1164
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:46,942
It's so much nicer here since he left.

1165
01:16:48,386 --> 01:16:50,010
I hope he never comes back.

1166
01:16:58,879 --> 01:17:00,066
Where did you find those?

1167
01:17:00,347 --> 01:17:01,656
I found them yesterday.

1168
01:17:01,832 --> 01:17:02,832
Give them to me.

1169
01:17:05,252 --> 01:17:06,252
They're good, though.

1170
01:17:06,604 --> 01:17:07,826
They're just a little rusty.

1171
01:17:07,908 --> 01:17:09,218
Give them to me!

1172
01:17:21,058 --> 01:17:22,286
Doesn't mean anything.

1173
01:17:22,824 --> 01:17:24,429
The pool was empty, and...

1174
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:26,132
maybe he saw them at the bottom.

1175
01:17:27,617 --> 01:17:28,617
I didn't.

1176
01:17:28,838 --> 01:17:29,838
Did you?

1177
01:17:30,943 --> 01:17:32,363
If they were so plain to see...

1178
01:17:32,639 --> 01:17:34,161
Don't you see what it means?

1179
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,510
Yeah. It means we overlooked them.

1180
01:17:36,721 --> 01:17:38,597
It means Guy's watching us.

1181
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:40,495
He's alive.

1182
01:17:40,964 --> 01:17:41,964
He's dead,

1183
01:17:42,356 --> 01:17:43,468
and I'm not sorry.

1184
01:17:44,866 --> 01:17:47,310
And neither are you, if you're
really honest with yourself.

1185
01:17:48,699 --> 01:17:50,027
Killing him is a good thing...

1186
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:52,125
like planting a tree.

1187
01:17:53,867 --> 01:17:55,447
Maybe there is a God.

1188
01:17:57,165 --> 01:17:58,408
What are you talking about?

1189
01:18:00,202 --> 01:18:02,194
I haven't believed for so long.

1190
01:18:03,694 --> 01:18:05,529
So when the pool was empty, I thought,

1191
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:07,873
maybe there is a God.

1192
01:18:09,379 --> 01:18:11,082
And he knows what we did,

1193
01:18:11,485 --> 01:18:13,197
and he's coming for us.

1194
01:18:14,807 --> 01:18:15,881
It's not God, honey.

1195
01:18:16,433 --> 01:18:18,665
That's a lady detective with one breast.

1196
01:18:20,659 --> 01:18:22,188
You're always laughing at me.

1197
01:18:24,131 --> 01:18:25,275
So was Guy.

1198
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:28,446
He must be laughing now.

1199
01:18:29,855 --> 01:18:31,422
I'm not laughing at you, Mia.

1200
01:18:33,371 --> 01:18:34,371
You are...

1201
01:18:34,522 --> 01:18:35,522
A little.

1202
01:18:36,641 --> 01:18:37,641
Inside.

1203
01:18:42,241 --> 01:18:44,006
It's lonely without God, isn't it?

1204
01:18:45,444 --> 01:18:46,644
It's just lonely...

1205
01:18:48,674 --> 01:18:49,674
Period.

1206
01:19:45,978 --> 01:19:47,446
They're filling the pool!

1207
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,226
When's it going to be done?

1208
01:19:53,411 --> 01:19:54,677
Should be soon.

1209
01:19:54,738 --> 01:19:55,786
That's great.

1210
01:22:39,376 --> 01:22:41,095
We should have cancelled this.

1211
01:22:42,051 --> 01:22:44,580
Every thing's fine. Just calm down.

1212
01:22:46,968 --> 01:22:48,218
20 bucks they killed him.

1213
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:50,260
Dykes.

1214
01:22:50,874 --> 01:22:52,914
And that would explain why
they're not all over you.

1215
01:22:53,294 --> 01:22:54,294
Thanks.

1216
01:22:56,792 --> 01:22:58,692
We really could use Dr.
Baran for these shots.

1217
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:01,523
Well, he's still away on business.
So, we'll do without him.

1218
01:23:01,959 --> 01:23:02,959
I don't want to be in it.

1219
01:23:09,045 --> 01:23:10,817
O.K. It's parents' day,

1220
01:23:11,127 --> 01:23:12,861
and these are your parents.

1221
01:23:13,354 --> 01:23:14,589
Now, boys, you're happy,

1222
01:23:14,894 --> 01:23:16,471
but try not to look relieved.

1223
01:23:17,196 --> 01:23:18,196
O.K.?

1224
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:19,270
Um...

1225
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:21,506
I'm glad to see you, mom and dad, but,

1226
01:23:21,782 --> 01:23:23,661
boy, is this school great!

1227
01:23:24,534 --> 01:23:25,534
Moms,

1228
01:23:25,566 --> 01:23:27,465
one or two of you can look misty-eyed.

1229
01:23:27,813 --> 01:23:28,734
Who wants to be misty?

1230
01:23:28,794 --> 01:23:29,836
O.K. Here.

1231
01:23:29,897 --> 01:23:31,602
All right, you, and, uh...

1232
01:23:31,795 --> 01:23:32,404
You.

1233
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:33,640
Don't overdo it.

1234
01:23:33,835 --> 01:23:35,515
Let's make sure everyone
has their numbers.

1235
01:23:35,839 --> 01:23:36,839
Number one?

1236
01:23:37,483 --> 01:23:38,483
O.K.

1237
01:23:38,652 --> 01:23:39,910
Is that Dr. Baran?

1238
01:23:41,005 --> 01:23:42,311
What are you talking about?

1239
01:23:43,182 --> 01:23:44,919
Up there on the second
floor, at the window.

1240
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:51,312
Wait. I'll play it back.

1241
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:07,621
Well, it's someone, that's for sure.

1242
01:24:09,471 --> 01:24:10,471
It's Guy.

1243
01:24:12,326 --> 01:24:13,326
It's Guy.

1244
01:24:53,383 --> 01:24:55,463
Bless me, father, for I have sinned...

1245
01:25:39,036 --> 01:25:40,036
What are you doing?

1246
01:25:41,013 --> 01:25:43,358
I'm fasting and praying for our sins.

1247
01:25:45,971 --> 01:25:47,417
I want you to stop that...

1248
01:25:48,604 --> 01:25:49,632
And come inside.

1249
01:25:50,608 --> 01:25:51,608
You're not well.

1250
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:53,690
Each time I go to sleep,

1251
01:25:53,751 --> 01:25:55,662
I have to kill him over and over.

1252
01:25:57,575 --> 01:25:59,875
No, Mia. Someone's playing a game with us.

1253
01:26:01,722 --> 01:26:03,042
Now, come inside.

1254
01:26:04,013 --> 01:26:05,030
You're ill.

1255
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:09,961
It's holy water.

1256
01:26:12,402 --> 01:26:13,402
Come on.

1257
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:17,679
What are you looking at?

1258
01:26:18,032 --> 01:26:19,032
Go inside!

1259
01:26:19,763 --> 01:26:20,763
Let's get out of here.

1260
01:26:20,830 --> 01:26:21,830
Go in!

1261
01:26:23,628 --> 01:26:24,628
Go!

1262
01:26:32,042 --> 01:26:33,532
Where's your heart medicine?

1263
01:26:34,057 --> 01:26:35,376
I'm sure it's there.

1264
01:26:36,655 --> 01:26:37,806
No. I think you're out.

1265
01:26:37,867 --> 01:26:39,959
I'll go to the pharmacy
and get it refilled.

1266
01:26:43,728 --> 01:26:45,080
You should take these.

1267
01:26:47,484 --> 01:26:48,484
Here. Go on.

1268
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:52,633
You'll be out like a
light before I get back.

1269
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:54,668
I want you to go, Nicole.

1270
01:26:55,107 --> 01:26:55,852
O.K.

1271
01:26:55,913 --> 01:26:57,457
No. I mean away.

1272
01:26:58,278 --> 01:26:59,624
Leave the school...

1273
01:27:00,061 --> 01:27:01,061
For good.

1274
01:27:01,784 --> 01:27:02,821
I'm sick of you.

1275
01:27:06,032 --> 01:27:07,094
If they only knew.

1276
01:27:07,602 --> 01:27:09,580
They will if you keep acting like this.

1277
01:27:11,395 --> 01:27:13,102
You know, the church can't save you now,

1278
01:27:13,163 --> 01:27:14,741
no matter how much you pay them off.

1279
01:27:17,151 --> 01:27:19,321
Look, I know you gave
that priest my money.

1280
01:27:20,066 --> 01:27:22,130
The money should go to
the people who love you.

1281
01:27:22,899 --> 01:27:24,423
It should go to the people you love.

1282
01:27:27,669 --> 01:27:29,483
They don't love you, Mia. They used you.

1283
01:27:30,068 --> 01:27:32,197
And now that you're scared,
you're using them, too.

1284
01:27:32,358 --> 01:27:33,608
Like you used me?

1285
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:35,978
You're a good teacher, Nicole.

1286
01:27:36,039 --> 01:27:37,399
We should have paid you more.

1287
01:27:37,727 --> 01:27:39,401
You like playing the victim, don't you?

1288
01:27:39,462 --> 01:27:40,462
Get out!

1289
01:27:40,799 --> 01:27:41,799
Leave me alone!

1290
01:27:42,697 --> 01:27:44,498
Fine, if that's the way you want it,

1291
01:27:44,712 --> 01:27:47,270
but let me tell you one thing,
from one Saint to another...

1292
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,326
you should keep right on praying.

1293
01:27:49,663 --> 01:27:51,370
Wear your knees out that way for a change.

1294
01:30:43,957 --> 01:30:45,024
Hello?

1295
01:31:28,088 --> 01:31:29,133
Hello?

1296
01:32:12,446 --> 01:32:13,446
Oh.

1297
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:16,029
Aah!

1298
01:33:09,224 --> 01:33:10,408
Who's there?

1299
01:33:15,165 --> 01:33:16,317
Who's there?

1300
01:34:21,855 --> 01:34:22,943
Get the water bottle!

1301
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:26,554
Aah!

1302
01:34:26,662 --> 01:34:27,662
Aah!

1303
01:34:54,345 --> 01:34:55,345
He's dead.

1304
01:34:56,170 --> 01:34:57,170
He's dead.

1305
01:34:57,811 --> 01:34:58,960
He's dead.

1306
01:34:59,839 --> 01:35:01,135
God forgive you...

1307
01:35:01,543 --> 01:35:02,744
He's dead.

1308
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:17,497
Aah!

1309
01:35:17,558 --> 01:35:18,558
Aah!

1310
01:35:58,451 --> 01:36:00,794
You're a lot tougher than I
thought, you little bitch.

1311
01:36:07,447 --> 01:36:08,822
Jesus, Guy.

1312
01:36:09,905 --> 01:36:12,462
Sucking on that douche-bag
hose for eight hours...

1313
01:36:13,981 --> 01:36:15,521
And that ride in the back...

1314
01:36:16,705 --> 01:36:17,922
I've still got a cold.

1315
01:36:18,535 --> 01:36:20,058
I don't care what the doctors say...

1316
01:36:20,725 --> 01:36:22,599
That fucking heart was made of iron.

1317
01:36:24,652 --> 01:36:26,516
I tried to reach you to call it off.

1318
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:28,890
Call it off?

1319
01:36:29,788 --> 01:36:30,788
What for?

1320
01:36:31,499 --> 01:36:33,019
I wish I could have seen her face.

1321
01:36:33,728 --> 01:36:35,134
Some of those gags were great.

1322
01:36:36,108 --> 01:36:38,643
What are we going to do with
that goddamn detective now?

1323
01:36:39,441 --> 01:36:40,441
Snooping around.

1324
01:36:41,068 --> 01:36:42,118
She got hers.

1325
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:44,328
You were supposed to call me.

1326
01:36:46,271 --> 01:36:47,601
I think you should find the body.

1327
01:36:48,694 --> 01:36:50,035
I'll show up tomorrow...

1328
01:36:50,291 --> 01:36:51,681
And you can break the news to me.

1329
01:36:52,851 --> 01:36:53,947
I'll be grief-stricken.

1330
01:36:57,884 --> 01:36:59,267
I think you should go.

1331
01:37:00,732 --> 01:37:01,732
Go?

1332
01:37:02,828 --> 01:37:03,828
Yeah.

1333
01:37:05,979 --> 01:37:06,979
Why?

1334
01:37:07,049 --> 01:37:08,049
Haven't you missed me?

1335
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:09,458
Yeah.

1336
01:37:12,190 --> 01:37:13,252
That's better.

1337
01:37:13,815 --> 01:37:14,815
It's over.

1338
01:37:15,611 --> 01:37:16,663
So, let's celebrate.

1339
01:37:16,724 --> 01:37:17,724
O.K, but I...

1340
01:37:22,109 --> 01:37:23,430
I don't... you know...

1341
01:37:24,536 --> 01:37:26,534
I just... I don't want you to get caught.

1342
01:37:26,761 --> 01:37:27,896
I think you'd better...

1343
01:37:27,957 --> 01:37:28,957
Is this natural?

1344
01:37:29,336 --> 01:37:30,336
Huh?

1345
01:37:30,669 --> 01:37:32,659
I mean, the tub is full.

1346
01:37:33,497 --> 01:37:34,497
Hmm?

1347
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:38,896
Shouldn't she be undressed?

1348
01:37:38,957 --> 01:37:40,039
Yeah, O.K.

1349
01:37:41,236 --> 01:37:42,289
Aah!

1350
01:37:46,011 --> 01:37:47,585
-I thought she was dead.
-I...

1351
01:37:47,943 --> 01:37:48,953
I thought she was.

1352
01:37:49,305 --> 01:37:50,305
I did.

1353
01:37:50,371 --> 01:37:51,386
It's over. Look,

1354
01:37:51,647 --> 01:37:52,887
she's not going to do anything.

1355
01:37:53,148 --> 01:37:54,988
-We'll think of something else.
-Lying bitch!

1356
01:37:55,755 --> 01:37:57,832
We'll do something different with her!
Just let her go!

1357
01:37:57,856 --> 01:37:59,267
-You're with her!
-No, I'm not!

1358
01:37:59,358 --> 01:38:00,391
-Yes, you are.
-No!

1359
01:38:00,675 --> 01:38:01,675
Mia, go!

1360
01:38:01,733 --> 01:38:02,733
You...

1361
01:38:03,064 --> 01:38:04,064
bitch!

1362
01:38:04,135 --> 01:38:05,135
Aah!

1363
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:07,999
-No!
-Just you wait!

1364
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:09,326
No! No!

1365
01:38:13,151 --> 01:38:14,151
Mia!

1366
01:38:31,179 --> 01:38:32,284
Mia!

1367
01:38:38,196 --> 01:38:39,766
Don't you run from me!

1368
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:43,257
I said stop!

1369
01:38:43,551 --> 01:38:44,551
No! No!

1370
01:38:51,916 --> 01:38:53,026
Come here!

1371
01:38:54,602 --> 01:38:55,602
Aah!

1372
01:38:56,980 --> 01:38:58,157
Let me see your face!

1373
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:00,727
Was it a lonely week...

1374
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:02,975
Or did you two keep each other company?

1375
01:39:03,654 --> 01:39:06,398
How does it feel, after all
these years of sainthood,

1376
01:39:06,459 --> 01:39:08,125
finding out we're perfectly matched?

1377
01:39:08,852 --> 01:39:10,025
You're just like me...

1378
01:39:10,447 --> 01:39:11,528
Soul mates.

1379
01:39:11,952 --> 01:39:13,205
-Aah!
-Aah!

1380
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:15,001
Bitch.

1381
01:39:22,154 --> 01:39:24,362
Do you want to confess before you die?

1382
01:39:24,622 --> 01:39:26,025
Say, 'I'm sorry, Guy.'

1383
01:39:26,086 --> 01:39:28,046
Maybe I'll forgive you, even if God won't.

1384
01:39:28,537 --> 01:39:29,537
Fuck you!

1385
01:39:40,145 --> 01:39:41,753
You son of a bitch!

1386
01:39:42,091 --> 01:39:44,156
This is a week late, ass hole!

1387
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:45,700
Aah!

1388
01:40:00,154 --> 01:40:01,154
Mia.

1389
01:40:01,902 --> 01:40:02,902
Mia.

1390
01:40:03,739 --> 01:40:04,988
Oh, Jesus.

1391
01:40:08,386 --> 01:40:09,412
Mia, come on.

1392
01:40:09,526 --> 01:40:11,370
Aah!

1393
01:42:04,215 --> 01:42:06,529
This way it'll be easier
to claim self-defence.

1394
01:42:10,186 --> 01:42:12,220
You know, paramedics can work miracles.

1395
01:42:14,059 --> 01:42:15,631
One of us should go get one right away.

1396
01:42:24,706 --> 01:42:25,753
Oh, Mia.

1397
01:42:30,543 --> 01:42:31,617
I'm sorry.

1398
01:42:44,149 --> 01:42:45,149
Goodbye.
