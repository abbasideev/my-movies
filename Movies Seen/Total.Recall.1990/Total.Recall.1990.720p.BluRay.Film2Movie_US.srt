1
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,708
Oh!

2
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:15,791
Ah!

3
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:18,666
Doug?

4
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:23,208
Honey, are you all right?

5
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:28,250
You were dreaming. Doug?

6
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:31,291
Was it about Mars?

7
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,166
- Is that better?
- Hmm.

8
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:43,166
My poor baby.

9
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:46,666
This is getting to be an obsession.

10
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:56,000
Was she there?

11
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,000
Who?

12
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,291
The one you told me about.
The brunette.

13
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:06,791
Oh, Lori.

14
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,625
I can't believe
you're jealous of a dream.

15
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:16,166
- Who is she?
- Nobody.

16
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:18,625
"Nobody"? What's her name?

17
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:21,291
I don't know.

18
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,333
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

19
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:25,458
You better tell me!

20
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:29,291
It's not funny, Doug.
You dream about her every night.

21
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:32,041
And I'm always back
in the morning.

22
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,250
Let me go!

23
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:38,375
Come on, baby.

24
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:41,208
You know you're the girl
of my dreams.

25
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:43,375
You mean it?

26
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,375
You know I do.

27
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:58,791
I'll give you
something to dream about.

28
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:12,166
<i>The chairman defended the attack,
saying that space-based weapons</i>

29
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:16,333
<i>are our only defence against the
southern block's numerical superiority.</i>

30
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,833
<i>And more violence last night on Mars</i>

31
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:21,250
<i>where terrorists
demanding independence</i>

32
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:24,833
<i>once again halted the extraction
of terbinium ore.</i>

33
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:31,958
<i>Kuato and his so-called
freedom brigade</i>

34
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:34,083
<i>claimed credit
for this latest bombing,</i>

35
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,833
<i>which attempted to reopen
the sealed-off Pyramid Mines.</i>

36
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:44,250
<i>Mars military restored order
with minimal use of force</i>

37
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:48,291
<i>and all damage to the strategic facility
was repaired within hours.</i>

38
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:49,750
<i>No cameras!</i>

39
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:53,875
<i>With one mine already closed,
Mars administrator Vilos Cohaagen</i>

40
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:56,125
<i>vowed that troops
would be used if necessary</i>

41
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:59,000
<i>to keep production at full capacity...</i>

42
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:03,916
No wonder you're having nightmares.
You're always watching the news.

43
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,916
- Lori.
- Doug?

44
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:13,500
- Let's do it.
- Do what?

45
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,041
Move to Mars.

46
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:19,541
Honey, why do you have to spoil
a perfectly wonderful morning?

47
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:22,666
Just think about it.

48
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:28,333
Sweetheart, we've been through this
a million times. You'd hate it on Mars.

49
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:31,333
It's dry, it's ugly, it's boring.

50
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:36,333
I mean, really, a revolution could
break out there any second.

51
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:39,541
Cohaagen says
it's just a few extremists.

52
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,166
You believe him?

53
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,458
OK. Forget about it.

54
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:56,791
<i>Absolutely not. Mars was colonised by
the northern block at enormous expense.</i>

55
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,500
<i>Our entire war effort
depends on their terbinium.</i>

56
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:04,083
<i>It's ridiculous to think we'd give it away
just because some lazy mutants...</i>

57
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,333
Doug.

58
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:10,750
- Maybe we should take a trip.
- Lori, move, please.

59
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:14,500
<i>...you've closed the Pyramid Mine
because you found alien artefacts?</i>

60
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:17,875
There's a lot better places
than Mars.

61
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:20,916
What about Saturn?
Don't you wanna see Saturn?

62
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,875
<i>I wish we could find some artefacts.</i>

63
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:25,083
<i>Our tourist industry could use a boost.</i>

64
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:27,625
Everybody says that its gorgeous.

65
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:31,416
<i>Fact is, it's Mr Kuato and his terrorists
who spread these rumours</i>

66
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:33,583
<i>to undermine trust in the government.</i>

67
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:37,416
We could take a long space cruise,
the kind with nothing to do.

68
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:41,083
- <i>Have you found Kuato yet?</i>
- <i>We don't even know what he looks like.</i>

69
00:08:41,251 --> 00:08:45,250
- What do you say?
- I'm late, Lori.

70
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:52,791
Sweetheart. Doug.

71
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:59,583
I know it's hard being in a new town,
but let's give it a chance, OK?

72
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,500
Lori, don't you understand?

73
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:06,500
I feel like I was meant
for something more than this.

74
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:11,291
I want to do something with my life.
I want to be somebody.

75
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,416
You are somebody.

76
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:15,541
You're the man I love.

77
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:21,750
Bye.

78
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,208
Have a nice day.

79
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,958
<i>You are now entering
a safety zone.</i>

80
00:09:48,126 --> 00:09:52,250
<i>No unauthorised weapons allowed
beyond this point.</i>

81
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:55,791
<i>You are now entering a safety zone.</i>

82
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:00,041
<i>No unauthorised weapons allowed
beyond this point.</i>

83
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:08,208
<i>Would you like to ski
but you're snowed under with work?</i>

84
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:12,500
<i>Do you dream of a vacation
at the bottom of the ocean,</i>

85
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:15,000
<i>but you can't float the bill?</i>

86
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,833
<i>Have you always wanted
to climb the mountains of Mars...</i>

87
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,458
<i>...but now you're over the hill?</i>

88
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:25,583
<i>Then come to Rekall Incorporated</i>

89
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,583
<i>where you can buy the memory
of your ideal vacation</i>

90
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:31,333
<i>cheaper, safer and better
than the real thing.</i>

91
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:34,250
<i>So don't let life pass you by.</i>

92
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:37,791
<i>Call Rekall for the memory of a lifetime.</i>

93
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:41,791
<i>For the memory of a lifetime</i>

94
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,458
<i>Rekall, Rekall, Rekall</i>

95
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:05,208
Harry.

96
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,875
- Harry! You ever hear of Rekall?
- Rekall?

97
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:12,875
Where they sell
those fake memories.

98
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:17,125
Oh, Rekall!
Rekall, rekall, rekall!

99
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:19,416
- Thinking of going there?
- I don't know. Maybe.

100
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:21,250
- Well, don't.
- Why not?

101
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:25,958
A friend of mine tried one of their special
offers, nearly got himself lobotomised.

102
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:27,791
No shit?

103
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,666
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.
It ain't worth it.

104
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,458
I guess not.

105
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:17,833
Hello.

106
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:21,041
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Rekall.

107
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:23,291
Douglas Quaid.
I have an appointment.

108
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,250
- Bob?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

109
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:30,500
- Doug Quaid is here to see you.
- <i>I'll be right out.</i>

110
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,083
OK.

111
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,208
That'll be just one minute, Mr Quaid.

112
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,208
Thank you.

113
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:47,958
- Doug! Bob McClane. Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

114
00:12:48,126 --> 00:12:50,333
Come on in. Through here.

115
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,125
Go and have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

116
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:54,541
- Thank you.

117
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,333
Now, help me out here, Doug.

118
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:59,583
- You were interested in a memory of...
- Of Mars.

119
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:01,791
Yeah. Mars.

120
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,125
- Is there a problem?
- Uh...

121
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,500
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug,
if outer space is your thing,

122
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,583
you'd be much happier
with one of our Saturn cruises.

123
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:13,166
Everybody raves about them.

124
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,166
No. I'm not interested in Saturn.
I said Mars.

125
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:19,166
OK. You're the boss.

126
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,833
Mars it is.

127
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:24,250
Now, let me see.

128
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:29,750
The basic Mars package
will run you 899 credits.

129
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:33,208
Now, that's for two full weeks
of memories, complete in every detail.

130
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:36,833
If you want a longer trip, that'll cost you
more cos it's a deeper implant.

131
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:39,291
What's in the two-week package?

132
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:43,000
When you go Rekall, you get nothing
but first-class memories.

133
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:48,041
Private cabin on the shuttle, deluxe suite
at the Hilton, all the major sights:

134
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:53,041
Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals
and of course, Venusville.

135
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:54,958
But how real does it seem?

136
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:59,208
- As real as any memory in your head.
- Come on. Don't bullshit me.

137
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:02,166
No. I'm telling you, Doug.
Your brain will not know the difference.

138
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:04,333
And that's guaranteed
or your money back.

139
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:07,875
What about the guy you lobotomised?
Did he get a refund?

140
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,541
You're talking ancient history.

141
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:17,500
Nowadays, travelling with Rekall
is safer than getting on a rocket.

142
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,625
Check out those statistics.

143
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:23,333
Besides, a real holiday
is a pain in the butt.

144
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:28,208
You got lost luggage, lousy weather,
crooked taxi drivers.

145
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:33,625
When you travel with Rekall,
everything is perfect.

146
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,875
So, what do you say?

147
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,625
- All right.
- Smart move.

148
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:43,083
All right,
while you fill out this questionnaire,

149
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:45,666
I'm going to familiarise you
with some of our options.

150
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:47,416
No options.

151
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:51,791
Whatever you say.
Can I ask you just one question?

152
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,708
What is that is exactly the same

153
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:57,875
about every single vacation
you have ever taken?

154
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:00,083
I give up.

155
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:02,875
You. You're the same.

156
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:05,625
No matter where you go, there you are.
It's always the same old you.

157
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:10,458
Let me suggest that you take
a vacation from yourself.

158
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:12,250
I know, it sounds wild.

159
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:15,125
It is the latest thing in travel.
We call it the Ego Trip.

160
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:17,333
No. I'm not interested in that.

161
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,250
You're gonna love this, Doug.

162
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:22,958
We offer you a choice of
alternate identities during your trip.

163
00:15:23,126 --> 00:15:26,625
Why go to Mars as a tourist,
when you can go as a playboy?

164
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,750
- Or a famous jock or...?
- "Secret agent."

165
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:31,625
How much is that?

166
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,166
A-ha! Let me tantalise you.

167
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:42,000
You are a top operative under deep cover
on your most important mission.

168
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:44,666
People are trying to kill you.
Left and right!

169
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:47,791
You meet this beautiful,
exotic woman.

170
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,041
Go on.

171
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,833
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug,

172
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,041
but by the time the trip is over,

173
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:58,125
you get the girl, kill the bad guys
and save the entire planet.

174
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:03,000
Now, you tell me.
Isn't that worth a measly 300 credits?

175
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:19,583
- Your first trip?
- Mm-hm.

176
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:22,916
Well, don't worry. Things hardly ever
fuck up around here.

177
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,958
Good evening... Doug.

178
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:28,208
- I'm Dr Lull.
- Nice to meet you.

179
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:32,208
Ernie, patch in matrix 62-B-37.

180
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:35,250
And would you like us
to integrate some alien stuff?

181
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:37,500
Sure. Why not?

182
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:42,166
- Two-headed monsters?
- Don't you keep up with the news?

183
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,916
- We're doing alien artefacts now.
- It's wild.

184
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:48,666
Yeah, they date back a million years.

185
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:51,750
- Ernie?
- That's a new one.

186
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:53,666
- Blue sky on Mars.
- Been married long?

187
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:57,375
- Eight years.
- Oh, I see.

188
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:59,708
Slipping away for
a little hanky-panky.

189
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:02,666
- No. I'm fascinated with Mars.
- All systems go.

190
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:04,625
Then we're set.

191
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:07,541
Ready for dreamland?

192
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:12,791
I'll be asking you some questions
so we can fine-tune the Ego program.

193
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,791
You answer honestly,
you'll enjoy yourself a whole lot more.

194
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,708
- Your sexual orientation.
- Hetero.

195
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,291
So, how do you like your women?

196
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,250
Blonde? Brunette? Redhead?

197
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:31,416
Brunette.

198
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:38,041
Slim. Athletic. Voluptuous.

199
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:42,541
Athletic.

200
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:50,708
Demure. Aggressive. Sleazy.

201
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:53,875
- Be honest.
- Sleazy.

202
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,416
Demure.

203
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:04,041
41A, Ernie.

204
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,458
Boy, is he gonna have a wild time.

205
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:11,958
- He's not gonna want to come back.
- Oh, that's for sure.

206
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,250
So...

207
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:36,250
what do you say?

208
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:39,333
I'm not so sure,
and I don't get a souvenir.

209
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:41,666
Not true. For just a few more credits,

210
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:44,625
we supply T-shirts,
snapshots of you at the site,

211
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,666
and even letters from...

212
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,125
<i>Bob!</i>

213
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,416
- What is it?
- <i>You'd better get down here.</i>

214
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:54,625
I am with a very important client.

215
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:57,250
<i>Looks like we got
another schizoid embolism.</i>

216
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,625
- I'll be right back.
- Uh... Mr McClane?

217
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:05,166
- Mr McClane?
- Bob! What's wrong?

218
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:07,250
Don't let her leave!

219
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,625
Get off!

220
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,416
Ah!

221
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:17,250
You blew my cover!

222
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:20,541
What's going on? You can't do
a simple goddamn double implant?

223
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,375
It's not my fault we hit a memory cap.

224
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:25,000
They'll be here any minute!
They'll kill you all!

225
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,458
- What is he talking about?
- Let me go!

226
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:29,458
Mr Quaid, try to calm down!

227
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:33,833
My name is not Quaid.

228
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:36,833
- Let me go! Untie me now!
- Ernie, grab his leg!

229
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:38,500
- Untie me!
- Hold him down!

230
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:40,583
Let me go!

231
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:48,666
Ah!

232
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:06,291
Are you all right?

233
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:09,750
Listen to me.
He's been going on and on about Mars.

234
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,500
- He has really been there.
- Use your head, you dumb bitch.

235
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:16,041
He's just acting out the "secret agent"
portion of his ego trip.

236
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:17,875
- I'm afraid that's not possible.
- Why not?

237
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,875
Because we haven't implanted it yet.

238
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,250
Oh, shit.

239
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:26,791
Oh, shit!

240
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,375
I've been trying to tell you,
someone has erased his memory.

241
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:33,625
Excuse me. "Someone"?

242
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,833
We're talking about the fucking Agency.

243
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,666
- Shut up!
- Bob, the client's gone.

244
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:42,125
OK, all right. All right, look.
Here's what we're going to do.

245
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:44,916
Renata, cover up any memory
he's got of us or Rekall.

246
00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:46,916
I'll do what I can.
It's pretty messy in there.

247
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:50,083
Ernie, dump him in a cab around
the corner. Tiffany, you help him.

248
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:52,166
I'm gonna destroy his file
and refund his money.

249
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,583
And if anybody comes asking,
we never heard of Douglas Quaid.

250
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:12,416
Where am I?

251
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:18,375
- You're in a Johnnycab.
- What am I doing here?

252
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:21,833
I'm sorry. Would you please
rephrase the question?

253
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:24,041
How did I get in this taxi?

254
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:26,958
The door opened, you got in.

255
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:31,458
Hell of a day, isn't it?

256
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:47,083
- This OK?
- Right here.

257
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:49,916
- Thank you for taking Johnnycab.
- Thank you.

258
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:52,250
Hope you enjoyed the ride.

259
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:53,791
Hey, Quaid.

260
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:57,250
- Harry.
- How was your trip to Mars?

261
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,833
- What trip?
- You went to Rekall. Remember?

262
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,875
- I did?
- Yeah, you did.

263
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:07,333
- I told you not to, but you went anyway.
- What are you, my father?

264
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:12,125
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
- Listen. I'm already late. Thank you...

265
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,958
OK, bring him...
Come on, move it!

266
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:19,208
Let's go get that drink. Move it!

267
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:22,750
What the hell is going on?
What the fuck did I do wrong?

268
00:22:22,917 --> 00:22:25,875
- Tell me!
- You blabbed about Mars!

269
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:29,166
Are you crazy? I don't even know
anything about Mars!

270
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:33,750
You should've listened to me, Quaid.
I was there to keep you out of trouble.

271
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:39,916
You're making a big mistake. You got me
mixed up with somebody else.

272
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:42,416
Uh-uh, pal.
You got yourself mixed up with...

273
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:47,916
Ah!

274
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:11,666
Ah!

275
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:35,250
<i>And pivot... and serve...</i>

276
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:39,333
<i>and shift... and stroke... and pivot.</i>

277
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:43,208
<i>And serve... and shift... and stroke.</i>

278
00:23:43,376 --> 00:23:45,291
<i>Very good. Perfect form.</i>

279
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:48,500
<i>And serve... and shift... and stroke.</i>

280
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,416
Hi, honey.

281
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:55,583
- What are you doing?
- Some men just tried to kill me.

282
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:57,125
Muggers? Are you all right?

283
00:23:57,292 --> 00:23:59,333
No, they were spies or something.

284
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:02,166
And Harry from work, he was the...
Get down!

285
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:06,041
- Harry from work, he was the boss.
- Take it easy, Doug, OK?

286
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:09,125
Tell me exactly what happened.
Why would spies want to kill you?

287
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:11,833
I don't know.
But it had something to do with Mars.

288
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:13,625
You've never been to Mars.

289
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:17,125
It sounds crazy, but I went
to this Rekall place after work...

290
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:19,458
- You went to those brain butchers?
- Let me finish.

291
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22,041
- What did they do to you?
- I got a trip to Mars.

292
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:24,000
- So what happened...
- Oh...

293
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:27,416
Forget about Rekall. Will you?
These guys were going to kill me.

294
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:30,291
- Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
- They did.

295
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:32,416
But I killed them.

296
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:35,958
Listen to me, sweetheart.

297
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:39,083
Those assholes at Rekall
have fucked up your mind.

298
00:24:39,251 --> 00:24:41,291
You're having paranoid delusions.

299
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:44,041
You call this a delusion?

300
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:51,666
Doug.

301
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:56,541
- Doug, I'm gonna call a doctor.
- Don't. Don't call anybody.

302
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,666
<i>Hello.</i>

303
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:27,541
Lori, go! Get out!

304
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:55,083
Lori?

305
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:21,291
Why are you doing this, Lori?

306
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:38,333
Talk! I said talk.

307
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:40,416
- I'm not your wife.
- The hell you're not.

308
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:42,625
I never saw you
before six weeks ago.

309
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:44,875
Our marriage
is just a memory implant.

310
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:47,791
You think I'm stupid?
I remember our wedding.

311
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,416
It was implanted by the Agency.

312
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:51,250
- Falling in love.
- Implanted.

313
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:55,041
Our friends, my job, 8 years together.
All of this was implanted too?

314
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:57,875
The job's real.
The Agency set it up.

315
00:26:58,042 --> 00:26:59,833
Bullshit.

316
00:27:02,126 --> 00:27:04,666
They erased your identity
and implanted a new one.

317
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:07,041
I was written in as your wife
so I could watch you

318
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,416
and make sure the erasure took.

319
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:18,625
Sorry, Quaid.
Your whole life is just a dream.

320
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:25,166
OK, then if I'm not me,
who the hell am I?

321
00:27:25,334 --> 00:27:26,500
Beats me.

322
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:30,125
I just work here.

323
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:37,166
Doug.

324
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:40,625
Doug, there's something
I want you to know.

325
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:46,166
You were the best assignment
I ever had. Really.

326
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:47,875
I'm honoured.

327
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:52,000
You sure you don't want to,
just for old times' sake?

328
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:56,125
Come on. If you don't trust me,
you can tie me up.

329
00:27:58,334 --> 00:28:02,041
- I didn't know you were so kinky.
- Maybe it's time you found out.

330
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:09,041
Clever girl.

331
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:15,541
You wouldn't shoot me, would you,
Doug? After all we've been through.

332
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:18,541
Some of it was fun.

333
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,041
Nice knowing you.

334
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,166
Don't touch her.

335
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:00,666
Nobody here.

336
00:29:02,334 --> 00:29:05,791
- Are you OK?
- I guess I blew it.

337
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:08,541
- What does he remember?
- Nothing, so far.

338
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:10,208
I've got him.

339
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:26,291
Shit, he's going for the subway.
Let's get him. Go.

340
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:28,833
Let's go. Move it.

341
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:44,666
Pack your stuff
and get outta here.

342
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:46,708
What if they bring him back?

343
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:49,208
Not a chance.

344
00:29:58,209 --> 00:29:59,708
Subway! Go!

345
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:06,375
Hey!

346
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,500
Get him! He's got a gun!

347
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:16,166
- Cut him off! That way!
- Over there!

348
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:18,750
- Hold it!
- Don't move!

349
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:50,666
The escalator.

350
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:53,416
You four go up.
You come with me.

351
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:09,708
Get out of the way! Come on!

352
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:13,916
Get out of the way! Move!

353
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:46,000
The platform!

354
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:52,000
- Which way?
- To the right.

355
00:32:18,876 --> 00:32:23,041
<i>Botco. Tomorrow's fuels,
tomorrow's prices.</i>

356
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:26,166
<i>Don't settle for pale memories
or fake implants.</i>

357
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:28,791
<i>Experience space travel
the old-fashioned way</i>

358
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:32,416
<i>on a real, live holiday
you can afford.</i>

359
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,000
I want that fucker dead.

360
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,291
I don't blame you. I wouldn't want
Quaid porking my old lady.

361
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:47,916
- You saying she likes it?
- No, I'm sure she hated every minute.

362
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:54,458
<i>Six-beta-nine, we have
a live transmission from Mr Cohaagen.</i>

363
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:57,166
- Richter here. Patch it through.
- <i>You're on, Mr Cohaagen.</i>

364
00:32:57,334 --> 00:33:00,750
- <i>What the fuck is going on?</i>
- I'm trying to neutralise a traitor, sir.

365
00:33:00,917 --> 00:33:03,458
<i>If I wanted him dead, you moron,
I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.</i>

366
00:33:03,626 --> 00:33:05,791
We can't let him run around.
He knows too much.

367
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:09,291
<i>Lori says he can't remember jack shit.</i>

368
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:11,916
That's now. In an hour
he could have total recall.

369
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:16,625
<i>Listen to me, Richter. I want Quaid
delivered alive for re-implantation.</i>

370
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:18,375
<i>Have you got that?</i>

371
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:21,083
<i>I want him back in place with Lori.</i>

372
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,958
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

373
00:33:25,126 --> 00:33:26,833
What was that, sir?
I couldn't hear you.

374
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:29,875
- <i>Richter, what are you doing?</i>
- I got Quaid again.

375
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:32,750
Switching to another channel, sir.
I've got sunspots.

376
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:37,250
- <i>Call him back! Call him back!</i>
- I'm losing you.

377
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:40,291
- Where is he?
- Second level, galleria.

378
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:42,583
We should've killed Quaid on Mars.

379
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:09,166
- How we doing?
- Fine.

380
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:15,083
Zooming in... We got him!

381
00:34:36,584 --> 00:34:38,541
<i>If you want to live, don't hang up.</i>

382
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,583
- What do you want?
- <i>They've got you bugged.</i>

383
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:42,458
<i>They'll be busting down your door
in about three minutes</i>

384
00:34:42,626 --> 00:34:44,875
<i>unless you do exactly what I say.</i>

385
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:48,291
<i>Don't bother searching.
The bug's in your skull.</i>

386
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:52,875
- Who are you?
- <i>Never mind.</i>

387
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:55,833
<i>Wet a towel and wrap it around
your head. That'll muffle the signal.</i>

388
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:58,958
- How'd you find me?
- <i>I'd advise you to hurry.</i>

389
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:05,166
<i>This'll buy you some time.
They won't be able to pinpoint you.</i>

390
00:35:12,626 --> 00:35:14,083
Shit!

391
00:35:14,251 --> 00:35:16,500
- What?
- I lost him.

392
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:19,458
- Well, find him!
- Yeah, right.

393
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:22,000
<i>Come on. Hurry up.
You look beautiful.</i>

394
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:27,625
<i>Now go to the window. Go.</i>

395
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:32,958
- <i>Can you see me down here?</i>
- Mm-hm.

396
00:35:33,126 --> 00:35:36,083
- <i>This is the suitcase you gave me.</i>
- I gave you?

397
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:39,625
<i>I'm gonna set it here.
You come and get it, keep moving.</i>

398
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:41,833
- Wait. Wait.
- <i>What?</i>

399
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:45,500
- Who are you?
- <i>We were buddies in the Agency.</i>

400
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:48,916
<i>You asked me, if you disappeared,
to find you, so here I am.</i>

401
00:35:49,084 --> 00:35:51,500
What was I doing on Mars? Damn!

402
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:57,791
Excuse me, ma'am, but this is mine.

403
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:01,125
- I don't see your name on it.
- Someone left it for me.

404
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,125
- Find your own bag.
- Excuse me, ma'am, but I need it!

405
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:07,041
Fuck you, you asshole!

406
00:36:16,751 --> 00:36:18,500
Son of a bitch gotta be here
somewhere.

407
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:24,750
That guy there.

408
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:36,833
Hello, I'm Johnnycab.
Where can I take you tonight?

409
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:40,583
Drive. Drive!

410
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:44,166
- Please repeat the destination.
- Anywhere! Just go! Go! Go!

411
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:45,916
Please state the street
and number.

412
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:48,125
Shit. Shit!

413
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm not familiar with that address.
Would you please repeat...?

414
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:01,125
Fasten your seat belt!

415
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:36,583
The fare is 18 credits, please.

416
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:38,083
Sue me, dickhead.

417
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:39,416
Ah!

418
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:50,625
We hope you enjoyed the ride.

419
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:10,291
Hmm.

420
00:39:25,584 --> 00:39:27,958
<i>Howdy, stranger.
This is Hauser.</i>

421
00:39:29,126 --> 00:39:31,541
<i>If things have gone wrong,
I'm talking to myself</i>

422
00:39:31,709 --> 00:39:34,541
<i>and you've got a wet towel
wrapped around your head.</i>

423
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:38,458
<i>Now, whatever your name is,
get ready for the big surprise.</i>

424
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:42,666
<i>You are not you. You are me.</i>

425
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:45,291
No shit.

426
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,916
<i>Six-beta-nine, six-beta-nine,
come in.</i>

427
00:39:50,084 --> 00:39:51,250
Did you find him?

428
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:54,166
<i>We picked up an explosion
at the old cement factory.</i>

429
00:39:55,251 --> 00:39:57,875
- Send two units. We'll meet you there.
- <i>Roger.</i>

430
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:05,000
<i>All my life I've worked
for Mars Intelligence.</i>

431
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:07,375
<i>I did Cohaagen's dirty work.</i>

432
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:10,375
<i>But a few weeks ago
I met somebody, a woman,</i>

433
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,541
<i>and I learned a few things.</i>

434
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:15,291
<i>Like I've been playing
for the wrong team.</i>

435
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:19,666
<i>All I can do now is try
to make up for it.</i>

436
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,791
<i>There's enough shit in here
to fuck Cohaagen good.</i>

437
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:28,000
<i>Unfortunately, if you're listening to
this, that means he has got to me first.</i>

438
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,708
<i>Here comes the hard part,
old buddy.</i>

439
00:40:30,876 --> 00:40:33,000
<i>Now it is all up to you.</i>

440
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:34,375
Great.

441
00:40:46,251 --> 00:40:48,041
- What have we got?
- Nothing here.

442
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:50,458
- He's gone.
- I got a weak signal over there.

443
00:40:50,626 --> 00:40:52,041
Split up. Find him.

444
00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:55,125
<i>First let's get rid
of that bug in your head.</i>

445
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:58,958
<i>Take this thing out of the case
and stick it up your nose.</i>

446
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:01,166
<i>Don't worry. it's self-guiding.</i>

447
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:09,125
<i>Just shove real hard.</i>

448
00:41:15,084 --> 00:41:16,833
<i>When it crunches, you're there.</i>

449
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:20,208
<i>Just pull it out.</i>

450
00:41:20,376 --> 00:41:22,541
<i>Be careful. It's my head too.</i>

451
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:25,333
Ah! Ah!

452
00:41:44,584 --> 00:41:48,291
- I've got a lock.
- Up. Let's go.

453
00:41:50,126 --> 00:41:51,875
<i>This is the plan.</i>

454
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,500
<i>Get your ass to Mars,</i>

455
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:56,875
<i>then go to the Hilton and flash
the Brubaker ID at the desk.</i>

456
00:41:57,042 --> 00:41:58,750
<i>That's all there's to it.</i>

457
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:00,541
<i>Just do what I tell you.</i>

458
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:04,666
<i>And we can nail that son of the bitch
who fucked you and me.</i>

459
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:06,750
<i>I'm counting on you, buddy.</i>

460
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:08,583
<i>Don't let me down.</i>

461
00:42:37,376 --> 00:42:38,583
Straight ahead.

462
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:44,250
In there.

463
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:54,041
There!

464
00:42:59,459 --> 00:43:01,041
There!

465
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:05,458
There!

466
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:13,250
What? Give me that.

467
00:43:13,417 --> 00:43:15,500
<i>Get your ass to Mars.</i>

468
00:43:17,376 --> 00:43:19,875
- <i>Get your ass to Mars.</i>
- Shit.

469
00:43:21,459 --> 00:43:26,541
<i>Get your ass to Mars...
Get your ass to Mars...</i>

470
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:00,875
<i>Welcome to the Mars
Federal Colony.</i>

471
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:03,791
<i>For your safety and comfort,
domes have been installed</i>

472
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:06,416
<i>to protect you
from the vacuum outside.</i>

473
00:44:06,584 --> 00:44:10,333
<i>Please do not touch
exterior windows or air locks.</i>

474
00:44:10,501 --> 00:44:14,291
<i>Air volume is limited. No smoking
is allowed anywhere in the colony.</i>

475
00:44:14,459 --> 00:44:15,791
Next.

476
00:44:15,959 --> 00:44:20,166
<i>Thank you,
and enjoy your stay on Mars.</i>

477
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:21,875
Passport.

478
00:44:33,376 --> 00:44:34,625
Hmm?

479
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:38,541
Get out of the way.
Make way! Stand back!

480
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:47,583
Mr Cohaagen wants to see you
right away.

481
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:50,125
Any news of Quaid?

482
00:44:50,292 --> 00:44:53,250
- Not since you lost him.
- Watch your mouth, Captain...

483
00:44:54,334 --> 00:44:57,333
- So how long do you plan to stay?
- Two weeks.

484
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:00,208
Look at that shit.

485
00:45:00,376 --> 00:45:03,875
- What the hell's this?
- The Martians love Kuato.

486
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:06,041
They think he's fuckin'
George Washington.

487
00:45:06,209 --> 00:45:07,833
Kill the bastard.

488
00:45:08,001 --> 00:45:09,583
Nobody knows who he is.

489
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:13,541
Have you brought
any fruits or vegetables?

490
00:45:13,709 --> 00:45:15,458
Two weeks.

491
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:18,125
Excuse me?

492
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:20,750
Two weeks.

493
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:24,166
Two weeks!

494
00:45:27,917 --> 00:45:32,625
It's not just graffiti. The rebels
took over the refinery last night.

495
00:45:32,792 --> 00:45:34,708
No terbinium is going out.

496
00:45:34,876 --> 00:45:36,375
And it gets worse.

497
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:38,583
T-w-o...

498
00:45:56,917 --> 00:45:58,250
Quaid.

499
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:01,000
- That's Quaid!
- Where?

500
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:02,875
The woman!
Get him... her!

501
00:46:03,876 --> 00:46:05,333
Arrest that woman!

502
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:07,000
Get that woman. Grab her!

503
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:37,833
Catch!

504
00:46:40,084 --> 00:46:42,125
Get ready for a surprise!

505
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:28,958
Ah!

506
00:47:53,292 --> 00:47:54,958
- Open the goddamn door!
- I can't!

507
00:47:55,126 --> 00:47:56,333
Open it!

508
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:58,291
They're all connected!

509
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:08,916
That's terrible.

510
00:48:09,084 --> 00:48:11,000
A few days ago
Cohaagen raised the price of air.

511
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:12,333
Again?

512
00:48:12,501 --> 00:48:14,791
Nobody on Earth gives a damn
what happens up here.

513
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:17,416
They just want our terbinium
so they can fight their war.

514
00:48:17,584 --> 00:48:19,500
Excuse me. What's that?

515
00:48:19,667 --> 00:48:21,708
You mean the Pyramid Mine?

516
00:48:21,876 --> 00:48:25,333
I used to work there until
they found that alien shit inside.

517
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:27,333
Well, that's a rumour, isn't it?

518
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:29,250
Think so?

519
00:48:58,876 --> 00:49:00,291
Mr Cohaagen.

520
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:09,708
You wanted to see me, sir?

521
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:14,708
Richter...

522
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:17,958
Do you know why
I'm such a happy person?

523
00:49:18,126 --> 00:49:19,458
No, sir.

524
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:24,833
Because I've got the greatest job
in the solar system.

525
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:28,375
As long as the terbinium keeps flowing,
I can do anything I want.

526
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:30,791
Anything.

527
00:49:32,209 --> 00:49:35,291
In fact, the only thing
that I ever worry about

528
00:49:35,459 --> 00:49:40,791
is that one day, if the rebels win,
it all might end...

529
00:49:42,042 --> 00:49:43,541
and you're fucking making it happen!

530
00:49:44,709 --> 00:49:47,583
First you try to kill Quaid,
then you let him get away.

531
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:50,000
He had help from our side, sir.

532
00:49:51,084 --> 00:49:52,250
I know that.

533
00:49:54,584 --> 00:49:56,625
- But I thought...
- Who told you to think?

534
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:59,791
I don't give you enough information
to think.

535
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:05,000
You do what you're told.
That's what you do.

536
00:50:07,459 --> 00:50:08,875
Yes, sir.

537
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:11,500
Now...

538
00:50:13,792 --> 00:50:15,416
Let's get to business.

539
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:19,458
We've got a tricky situation here.

540
00:50:19,626 --> 00:50:21,833
Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.

541
00:50:23,584 --> 00:50:26,625
And he might be able to get it,
cos they say he's psychic.

542
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:31,208
And I have a plan
to keep this from happening.

543
00:50:34,709 --> 00:50:36,250
Do you think you could play along?

544
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:38,458
- Yes, sir.
- Great.

545
00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:41,000
Cos otherwise, I'll erase your ass.

546
00:50:55,834 --> 00:50:59,208
You've got some
identification? Yeah, you too.

547
00:50:59,376 --> 00:51:03,291
Taxi? You need a taxi, sir?
I got magazines, music, whisky.

548
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:06,000
Hey, man, you need a cab, man?
Come on! Come on!

549
00:51:31,042 --> 00:51:32,750
Good afternoon. Can I help you?

550
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:35,333
Yes, I would like
to have a room, please.

551
00:51:40,876 --> 00:51:43,416
Nice to have you back, Mr Brubaker.
Would you like the same suite?

552
00:51:43,584 --> 00:51:45,250
Oh, definitely.

553
00:51:47,251 --> 00:51:49,375
Seems you've left something
in our safe.

554
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:51,208
Could you get it, please?

555
00:51:56,584 --> 00:51:58,208
Identification?

556
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:10,291
- I'll encode your room key.
- Thank you.

557
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:29,833
- Suite 610 in the east wing.
- Thank you.

558
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:32,583
- Could I borrow your pen, please?
- Certainly.

559
00:52:44,334 --> 00:52:45,458
Thank you.

560
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,208
Hey, man, you need a cab?

561
00:52:53,376 --> 00:52:57,750
- What's wrong with this one?
- He ain't got five kids to feed.

562
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:01,041
- Where's yours?
- Right over there, man.

563
00:53:01,209 --> 00:53:03,291
Hey! Hey, man.

564
00:53:03,459 --> 00:53:05,291
Hey, asshole! That's my fare!

565
00:53:05,459 --> 00:53:08,125
- Eat this!
- Damn you, Benny!

566
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:16,000
Welcome to Mars, man!

567
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:21,750
What the hell was that, an accident?

568
00:53:21,917 --> 00:53:25,208
That's the rebels, man.
Let's get outta here...

569
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:27,166
Before they arrest us!

570
00:53:27,334 --> 00:53:29,041
What do the rebels want?

571
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:32,666
The usual.
More money, more freedom, more air.

572
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:38,916
So, where to?

573
00:53:39,084 --> 00:53:40,791
Last Resort.

574
00:53:40,959 --> 00:53:42,875
You're getting off to an early start.

575
00:53:43,917 --> 00:53:46,125
- First time on Mars?
- Yes.

576
00:53:46,292 --> 00:53:49,541
Well, actually, no. Well, sort of.

577
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:53,875
The man don't even know
whether he's been to Mars or not.

578
00:54:04,417 --> 00:54:06,791
Voila. Venusville.

579
00:54:06,959 --> 00:54:10,291
Ha, ha!
Hey, you see anything you like?

580
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,583
Well, this is the end of the line.
We'd better walk from here.

581
00:54:17,751 --> 00:54:19,666
I'll show you where.

582
00:54:19,834 --> 00:54:23,375
- Do you want to know the future?
- What about the past?

583
00:54:23,542 --> 00:54:27,208
Come on. It's around the corner,
right down this alley.

584
00:54:27,376 --> 00:54:29,416
They got everything.

585
00:54:32,084 --> 00:54:33,750
Not bad, huh?

586
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:39,791
Read your palm? Your mind? Your aura?
Probe the secrets of your heart?

587
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:42,083
I bet I can guess your birthday.

588
00:54:42,251 --> 00:54:45,208
- You're a Taurus, right?
- How did you guess?

589
00:54:47,876 --> 00:54:50,083
- Tell me, are all psychics...?
- Freaks?

590
00:54:50,251 --> 00:54:52,208
Afraid so, man.
It goes with the territory.

591
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:57,333
- What happened to them?
- Cheap domes, no air to clean the rays.

592
00:54:57,501 --> 00:55:01,375
So, this is it. The Last Resort.
You sure you want to go in here?

593
00:55:01,542 --> 00:55:04,875
- Why not?
- There's a better place down there.

594
00:55:05,042 --> 00:55:07,708
The girls are cleaner,
the liquor ain't watered down...

595
00:55:07,876 --> 00:55:10,208
Sure, and you get kickbacks.

596
00:55:10,376 --> 00:55:13,208
Hey, man, I got five kids to feed.

597
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:14,916
Take them to the dentist.

598
00:55:15,084 --> 00:55:17,583
Hey, thanks, mister!
I'll be waiting for you.

599
00:55:17,751 --> 00:55:19,875
You just take your time.
Benny's the name.

600
00:55:40,126 --> 00:55:42,083
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for Melina.

601
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:43,958
She's busy.

602
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:45,958
But Mary here, she's free.

603
00:55:46,709 --> 00:55:49,416
Well, not free, honey, but...

604
00:55:50,209 --> 00:55:51,625
...available.

605
00:55:52,501 --> 00:55:54,375
Ha-ha-ha!

606
00:55:54,542 --> 00:55:56,833
Thanks. I'll wait for Melina.

607
00:55:57,001 --> 00:55:58,125
Earth slime.

608
00:55:58,292 --> 00:56:00,875
Thing is, friend, Mel's real picky.

609
00:56:01,042 --> 00:56:03,250
She kind of sticks to her regulars.

610
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:05,416
She'll like me.

611
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:07,625
Mel!

612
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:09,291
Hey, Mel!

613
00:56:45,376 --> 00:56:46,916
Hello, Hauser.

614
00:56:47,917 --> 00:56:49,583
Still bulging, I see.

615
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:54,375
- What you been feeding this thing?
- Blondes.

616
00:56:56,209 --> 00:56:58,375
I think it's still hungry.

617
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:03,625
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here, Hauser.

618
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:05,708
Look who's talking.

619
00:57:05,876 --> 00:57:08,583
Hey, Tony,
give the big guy a break.

620
00:57:08,751 --> 00:57:11,000
Relax. You'll live longer.

621
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,916
Come on.

622
00:57:18,209 --> 00:57:21,166
- Honey, take care of Tony, will you?
- No problem.

623
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:24,875
If you need any help with this one,
give me a holler.

624
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:41,708
You son of a bitch.

625
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:44,541
You're alive? I thought that
Cohaagen tortured you to death.

626
00:57:44,709 --> 00:57:46,500
Well, I guess he didn't.

627
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:50,416
And you couldn't get me a message? You
never wondered what happened to me?

628
00:57:58,001 --> 00:58:00,333
Hauser, thank God you're alive.

629
00:58:01,417 --> 00:58:03,833
Melin... Melina. Melina.

630
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:08,583
- Melina, I have to tell you something.
- What?

631
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:12,291
- I don't remember you.
- What are you talking about?

632
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:14,541
I don't remember you.

633
00:58:14,709 --> 00:58:18,041
I don't remember us.
I don't even remember me.

634
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:22,500
Did you get amnesia?
How did you get here?

635
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:24,958
- Hauser left me a note.
- Hauser? You're Hauser.

636
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:27,000
Not anymore.

637
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:30,166
Now I'm Quaid. Douglas Quaid.

638
00:58:33,417 --> 00:58:37,416
- Hauser, you've lost your mind.
- I didn't. Cohaagen stole it.

639
00:58:37,584 --> 00:58:42,041
He found out that Hauser switched sides,
so he turned him into somebody else: me.

640
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:43,583
This is too weird.

641
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:46,166
He dumped me on earth
with a wife and a lousy job...

642
00:58:46,334 --> 00:58:49,166
Did you say wife?
Are you fucking married?

643
00:58:49,334 --> 00:58:51,291
- She wasn't really my wife.
- Oh, she isn't?

644
00:58:51,459 --> 00:58:53,708
How stupid of me.
She was Hauser's wife?

645
00:58:53,876 --> 00:58:56,875
- Look. Forget that I said wife.
- Let's just forget everything.

646
00:58:57,042 --> 00:59:00,541
- I'm sick of hearing your goddamn lies.
- Why would I lie to you?

647
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:05,000
Because you're still
working for Cohaagen.

648
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:07,583
Don't be ridiculous.

649
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:12,500
You never loved me, Hauser.

650
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:14,583
You just used me to get inside.

651
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,708
Inside what?

652
00:59:20,792 --> 00:59:22,791
I think you'd better leave.

653
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:26,041
- Hauser sent me to do something.
- I'm not falling for it.

654
00:59:26,209 --> 00:59:28,375
He says there's enough in here
to nail Cohaagen for good.

655
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:30,375
- Get out!
- You've got to help me remember!

656
00:59:30,542 --> 00:59:32,666
- I said, get out!
- Melina, please!

657
00:59:32,834 --> 00:59:34,625
People are trying to kill me.

658
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:37,125
Really?

659
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:41,541
All right, I'm leaving.

660
00:59:53,334 --> 00:59:56,375
Baby, you make me wish
I had three hands.

661
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:59,208
I think you're doing
just fine with two.

662
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:01,666
Excuse me, baby.
We'll pick this up later.

663
01:00:01,834 --> 01:00:04,166
Hey, that didn't take long.

664
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,833
Listen. Let me ask you a question.
Did you ever fuck a mutant?

665
01:00:07,001 --> 01:00:09,375
- Take me to the hotel.
- I know these Siamese twins.

666
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:12,333
Man, you won't know
if you're coming or going.

667
01:00:21,917 --> 01:00:22,208
<i>This afternoon at 4:30 p.m.,
I signed an order declaring martial law</i>

668
01:00:22,209 --> 01:00:25,583
<i>This afternoon at 4:30 p.m.,
I signed an order declaring martial law</i>

669
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:27,833
<i>throughout the Mars federal colony.</i>

670
01:00:28,001 --> 01:00:32,750
<i>I will not tolerate any further damage
to our mineral export operations.</i>

671
01:00:32,917 --> 01:00:34,916
<i>Mr Kuato and his terrorists
must understand</i>

672
01:00:35,084 --> 01:00:38,708
<i>that their self-defeating efforts
will only bring misery and suffering...</i>

673
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:45,166
- Mr Quaid?
- What?

674
01:00:45,334 --> 01:00:47,833
I need to talk to you
about Mr Hauser.

675
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:51,250
- Who are you?
- Dr Edgemar from Rekall.

676
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:53,583
- How did you find me?
- It's difficult to explain.

677
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:56,833
Could you open the door?
I'm unarmed.

678
01:00:58,876 --> 01:01:01,208
Don't worry. I'm alone.
May I come in?

679
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:04,333
What do you want?

680
01:01:04,501 --> 01:01:06,750
This is going to be very difficult
for you to accept, Mr Quaid.

681
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:11,875
- I'm listening.
- You're not really standing here now.

682
01:01:12,042 --> 01:01:15,041
- Doc, you could have fooled me.
- I'm quite serious.

683
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:18,291
You're not here and neither am I.

684
01:01:18,459 --> 01:01:19,791
That's amazing.

685
01:01:19,959 --> 01:01:22,583
- Where are we?
- At Rekall.

686
01:01:23,209 --> 01:01:24,791
You're strapped into
an implant chair,

687
01:01:24,959 --> 01:01:28,208
and I'm monitoring you
from the psychoprobe console.

688
01:01:29,209 --> 01:01:31,625
Ah, I get it. I'm dreaming.

689
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:35,000
And all this is part of the delightful
vacation your company has sold me.

690
01:01:35,167 --> 01:01:36,500
Not exactly.

691
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:40,750
What you're experiencing is a free-form
delusion based on our memory tapes

692
01:01:40,917 --> 01:01:43,875
but you're inventing it yourself
as you go along.

693
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:48,375
If it is my delusion,
who the hell invited you?

694
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:52,166
I've been artificially implanted
as an emergency measure.

695
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:55,666
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you've suffered a schizoid embolism.

696
01:01:55,834 --> 01:01:58,041
We can't snap you
out of your fantasy,

697
01:01:58,209 --> 01:02:01,333
and I've been sent in
to try to talk you down.

698
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:03,250
How much is Cohaagen
paying you for this?

699
01:02:04,751 --> 01:02:08,875
Think about it. Your dream started
in the middle of the implant procedure.

700
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:11,250
Everything after that,
the chases, the trip to Mars,

701
01:02:11,417 --> 01:02:15,875
the suite at the Hilton, are elements
of your Rekall Holiday and Ego Trip.

702
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:18,333
You paid to be a secret agent.

703
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,916
Bullshit. It's coincidence.

704
01:02:21,084 --> 01:02:23,750
And what about the girl?

705
01:02:23,917 --> 01:02:26,458
Brunette, athletic,
sleazy and demure?

706
01:02:26,626 --> 01:02:29,000
Just as you specified.
Is that coincidence?

707
01:02:29,167 --> 01:02:32,708
She's real. I dreamt about her
before I even went to Rekall.

708
01:02:32,876 --> 01:02:34,833
Ha, Mr Quaid.

709
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:39,000
Can you hear yourself?
She's real because you dreamed her?

710
01:02:39,167 --> 01:02:42,083
- That's right.
- Maybe this will convince you.

711
01:02:42,251 --> 01:02:44,625
Would you mind opening the door?

712
01:02:46,626 --> 01:02:51,083
- You open it.
- No need to be rude. I'll do it.

713
01:02:57,501 --> 01:02:58,750
Sweetheart?

714
01:03:01,292 --> 01:03:03,708
Come in, Mrs Quaid.

715
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:12,208
- I suppose you're not here either.
- I'm here... at Rekall.

716
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:18,625
I love you.

717
01:03:18,792 --> 01:03:22,041
Right.
That's why you tried to kill me.

718
01:03:22,209 --> 01:03:25,250
No. I'd never do anything
to hurt you.

719
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:28,500
I want you to come back to me.

720
01:03:30,792 --> 01:03:33,958
- Bullshit.
- What's bullshit, Mr Quaid?

721
01:03:34,126 --> 01:03:35,958
That you're having
a paranoid episode

722
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:38,708
triggered by acute
neurochemical trauma?

723
01:03:38,876 --> 01:03:42,750
Or that you're really an invincible
secret agent from Mars,

724
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:46,958
who's the victim of an interplanetary
conspiracy to make him think

725
01:03:47,126 --> 01:03:49,041
he's a lowly construction worker?

726
01:03:56,626 --> 01:03:58,833
Stop punishing yourself, Doug.

727
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,916
You're a fine, upstanding man.
You have a beautiful wife who loves you.

728
01:04:03,459 --> 01:04:05,416
- Your whole life is ahead of you.
- I do.

729
01:04:07,459 --> 01:04:10,041
But you've got to want
to return to reality.

730
01:04:12,417 --> 01:04:15,000
Let's assume I do. Then what?

731
01:04:17,917 --> 01:04:20,958
- Swallow this.
- What is it?

732
01:04:21,126 --> 01:04:24,333
It's a symbol of your desire
to return to reality.

733
01:04:25,251 --> 01:04:27,833
Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.

734
01:04:31,459 --> 01:04:36,125
All right, let's say you're telling
the truth and this is all a dream.

735
01:04:36,292 --> 01:04:38,250
Then I could pull this trigger
and it won't matter.

736
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:41,375
- Doug, don't.
- It won't make a difference to me.

737
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:45,958
But the consequences to you would be
devastating. In your mind I'll be dead.

738
01:04:46,126 --> 01:04:49,416
With no one to guide you out,
you'll be stuck in permanent psychosis.

739
01:04:49,584 --> 01:04:51,791
Doug, let Dr Edgemar help you.

740
01:04:51,959 --> 01:04:54,041
The walls of reality
will come crashing down.

741
01:04:54,209 --> 01:04:56,375
One minute you'll be
the saviour of the rebel cause,

742
01:04:56,542 --> 01:05:00,000
and the next thing you know
you'll be Cohaagen's bosom buddy.

743
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:04,083
You'll even have fantasies about
alien civilisations, as you requested,

744
01:05:04,251 --> 01:05:06,875
but in the end, back on earth
you'll be lobotomised!

745
01:05:09,417 --> 01:05:13,333
So get a grip on yourself, Doug,
and put down that gun!

746
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:22,500
Good. Now take the pill
and put it in your mouth.

747
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:28,916
Swallow it!

748
01:05:32,167 --> 01:05:33,958
Go ahead, sweetheart.

749
01:05:56,667 --> 01:06:00,000
Now you've done it.
Now you've done it!

750
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:16,000
Ah!

751
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:20,625
Aargh!

752
01:06:20,792 --> 01:06:23,291
That's for making me come to Mars.

753
01:06:24,584 --> 01:06:28,000
You know how much I hate
this fucking planet!

754
01:06:29,834 --> 01:06:31,125
Cuff him.

755
01:06:37,834 --> 01:06:41,208
- <i>I got him.</i>
- Bring him down in the service elevator.

756
01:06:43,376 --> 01:06:44,916
Let's go.

757
01:07:58,209 --> 01:07:59,333
Fuck you!

758
01:08:09,917 --> 01:08:11,125
Doug.

759
01:08:13,126 --> 01:08:15,166
Honey...

760
01:08:15,334 --> 01:08:17,791
You wouldn't hurt me,
would you, sweetheart?

761
01:08:19,584 --> 01:08:22,833
Sweetheart, be reasonable.

762
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:25,125
After all, we're married.

763
01:08:30,542 --> 01:08:32,041
Consider that a divorce.

764
01:08:34,542 --> 01:08:36,166
That was your wife?

765
01:08:40,209 --> 01:08:41,625
What a bitch.

766
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:51,833
Hey, get out of the way!

767
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,833
I thought you didn't like me.

768
01:08:57,001 --> 01:08:59,625
If Cohaagen wants you dead,
you might be OK.

769
01:08:59,792 --> 01:09:03,166
- Got it.
- So you've come back to apologise.

770
01:09:03,334 --> 01:09:05,000
Kuato wants to see you.

771
01:09:07,084 --> 01:09:08,625
Come on.

772
01:09:36,959 --> 01:09:38,500
- Now what?
- Jump!

773
01:09:42,292 --> 01:09:44,000
Ah!

774
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:12,000
No! Don't do it!
You'll crack the fucking dome!

775
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:18,708
What are you trying to do, kill us?
The dome will crack!

776
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,541
- Move!
- Hey!

777
01:10:34,084 --> 01:10:36,000
Taxi!

778
01:10:36,876 --> 01:10:39,000
Melina! Melina!

779
01:10:42,126 --> 01:10:43,541
- Need a ride?
- Last Resort. Quick!

780
01:10:43,709 --> 01:10:45,166
You guys are going in circles.

781
01:10:50,209 --> 01:10:51,125
Jesus!

782
01:10:51,292 --> 01:10:53,416
Come on! You drive!

783
01:10:53,584 --> 01:10:54,625
You guys are in trouble?

784
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,500
Go! Go!

785
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:10,125
- What are you trying to do to me?
- Shut up and drive!

786
01:11:10,292 --> 01:11:12,500
Hey, I got five kids to feed!

787
01:11:28,459 --> 01:11:30,208
Aargh!

788
01:11:46,584 --> 01:11:47,625
Shit!

789
01:11:47,792 --> 01:11:49,500
- No brakes! Ah!
- Stop it!

790
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:51,291
You idiot!

791
01:11:54,501 --> 01:11:55,708
What are you doing?

792
01:12:08,292 --> 01:12:11,000
Oh, Christ! Now they're after me!

793
01:12:12,292 --> 01:12:13,500
Give me that!

794
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:15,625
Get out of the way!

795
01:12:17,751 --> 01:12:19,208
Hey!

796
01:12:22,126 --> 01:12:23,541
Tony!

797
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:29,625
Get out of the way!
Come on!

798
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:32,166
Come on! Come on!

799
01:12:32,334 --> 01:12:33,583
Quick!

800
01:12:35,542 --> 01:12:36,916
- Thank you, Tony.
- Uh-um.

801
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:04,000
Hey! You wanna have some fun?

802
01:13:04,167 --> 01:13:05,291
Where are they?

803
01:13:05,459 --> 01:13:07,916
What are you talking about?
I don't know.

804
01:13:16,376 --> 01:13:17,875
Maybe you know.

805
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:26,541
Kill them all!

806
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:39,250
Ah!

807
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:42,125
Thumbelina!

808
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:08,333
Richter!

809
01:14:08,501 --> 01:14:11,833
- A call from Cohaagen!
- Richter here.

810
01:14:12,001 --> 01:14:14,666
- We've got them pinned down.
- <i>Stop fighting and pull out.</i>

811
01:14:14,834 --> 01:14:16,708
But they've got Quaid.
They're protecting him.

812
01:14:18,001 --> 01:14:21,083
<i>Perfect.
Get out of Sector G now.</i>

813
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:22,708
<i>Don't think.</i>

814
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:25,291
- <i>Do it!</i>
- Yes, sir.

815
01:14:25,459 --> 01:14:27,291
Pull 'em out.

816
01:14:27,459 --> 01:14:29,750
Everybody, pull out!

817
01:14:29,917 --> 01:14:31,458
Move!

818
01:14:40,292 --> 01:14:43,416
- Cohaagen's sealing off the area!
- Come on, Benny!

819
01:15:45,126 --> 01:15:46,875
The first settlers are buried here.

820
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:51,000
They worked themselves to death, but
Cohaagen ended up with all the money.

821
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:53,750
He built cheap domes and
watched the kids turn into freaks.

822
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:55,083
I saw them.

823
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:57,875
And if you want to breathe,
you have to buy his air.

824
01:15:58,042 --> 01:15:59,625
Maybe you can change all that.

825
01:16:00,417 --> 01:16:03,875
Hey, I think my grandpa might be here.

826
01:16:04,042 --> 01:16:05,625
So what can I do?

827
01:16:05,792 --> 01:16:08,458
Kuato's gonna make you remember some
things you knew when you were Hauser.

828
01:16:08,626 --> 01:16:11,125
- Like what?
- All sorts of things.

829
01:16:11,292 --> 01:16:14,250
- Maybe you'll remember you loved me.
- I don't need Kuato for that.

830
01:16:15,542 --> 01:16:17,458
Since when?

831
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:28,875
Freeze!

832
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:30,708
Come on, Melina.

833
01:16:32,001 --> 01:16:33,291
Kuato's waiting.

834
01:16:33,459 --> 01:16:35,833
I didn't find Grandpa, but...

835
01:16:36,917 --> 01:16:38,375
Oh, shit.

836
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:41,625
- Who's this?
- He helped us get away.

837
01:16:41,792 --> 01:16:45,958
Hey, don't worry about me, man.
I'm on your side.

838
01:16:56,501 --> 01:16:58,416
You're a mutant, huh?

839
01:16:58,584 --> 01:17:00,833
All right, let's go.

840
01:17:16,042 --> 01:17:18,750
- Have you tried ramming down the door?
- You wait here. Follow me.

841
01:17:18,917 --> 01:17:20,625
<i>It won't do any good.</i>

842
01:17:20,792 --> 01:17:24,083
- <i>Cohaagen depressurised the tunnels.</i>
- Then drill through to Section M.

843
01:17:24,251 --> 01:17:27,125
<i>We can't.
We're running out of air.</i>

844
01:17:27,292 --> 01:17:29,291
<i>We need help.</i>

845
01:17:29,459 --> 01:17:32,083
Sit tight.
Melina just got here with Quaid.

846
01:17:33,126 --> 01:17:34,833
<i>I hope he was worth it.</i>

847
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:36,833
So do I.

848
01:17:39,001 --> 01:17:40,875
- I'm glad you made it.
- You don't look glad.

849
01:17:41,042 --> 01:17:44,250
Cohaagen sealed up Venusville.
He shut off the air.

850
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:46,500
You must know something
pretty important, Quaid.

851
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:48,666
He wants you.

852
01:17:48,834 --> 01:17:52,166
If we don't hand you over, everybody
in this sector will be dead by morning.

853
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,166
Then we don't have much choice.
Do we?

854
01:17:54,334 --> 01:17:55,875
We can't turn him in.

855
01:17:57,167 --> 01:17:59,500
That's up to Kuato.
Come with me, Quaid.

856
01:18:13,626 --> 01:18:15,666
Sit down.

857
01:18:15,834 --> 01:18:18,125
- Where's Kuato?
- On his way.

858
01:18:18,792 --> 01:18:21,166
You heard the rumours
about the Pyramid Mine?

859
01:18:21,334 --> 01:18:23,125
Yeah.

860
01:18:23,292 --> 01:18:26,541
Cohaagen found something weird inside
and it's got him scared shitless.

861
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:28,958
What? Aliens?

862
01:18:30,584 --> 01:18:33,291
- You tell me.
- I don't know.

863
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:35,916
Yes, you do.
That's why we brought you here.

864
01:18:36,084 --> 01:18:38,625
Cohaagen's big secret
is buried in that black hole

865
01:18:38,792 --> 01:18:40,833
you call a brain.

866
01:18:43,459 --> 01:18:45,250
And Kuato's gonna dig it out.

867
01:18:45,417 --> 01:18:48,166
- You're Kuato, right?
- Wrong.

868
01:18:48,959 --> 01:18:52,833
Kuato's a mutant,
so don't get upset when you see him.

869
01:18:57,459 --> 01:18:59,291
Ah!

870
01:19:31,376 --> 01:19:33,458
What do you want, Mr Quaid?

871
01:19:34,542 --> 01:19:36,250
The same as you. To remember.

872
01:19:36,417 --> 01:19:38,583
But why?

873
01:19:39,209 --> 01:19:42,458
- To be myself again.
- You are what you do.

874
01:19:45,876 --> 01:19:49,083
A man is defined by his actions...

875
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:51,375
not his memory.

876
01:19:52,542 --> 01:19:55,583
Please take my hands.

877
01:19:57,834 --> 01:19:59,666
Ah!

878
01:20:01,334 --> 01:20:03,791
Now open your mind to me.

879
01:20:04,917 --> 01:20:06,791
Please.

880
01:20:09,126 --> 01:20:11,833
Open your mind.

881
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:16,375
Open your mind.

882
01:20:18,584 --> 01:20:22,250
Open your mind.

883
01:20:23,709 --> 01:20:27,375
Open your mind.

884
01:20:29,209 --> 01:20:32,833
Open your mind.

885
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:06,708
We should blow the thing up
before the rebels turn it on.

886
01:21:06,876 --> 01:21:09,166
I say we throw the switch
and see what happens.

887
01:21:09,334 --> 01:21:11,291
- Don't be an idiot.
- We can't risk it.

888
01:21:11,459 --> 01:21:14,291
The chain reaction could spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

889
01:21:14,459 --> 01:21:17,291
That means a meltdown,
a meltdown on a planetary scale.

890
01:21:17,459 --> 01:21:19,791
Don't you think whoever
built this thing thought of that?

891
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:22,958
Who knows what the hell they thought?
They weren't human.

892
01:21:23,126 --> 01:21:25,583
Maybe it's a trap.
Maybe they want a meltdown.

893
01:21:25,751 --> 01:21:27,833
We don't even know
if this piece of junk will work.

894
01:21:28,001 --> 01:21:30,500
What is it?
A million? Half a million?

895
01:21:30,667 --> 01:21:33,625
- About half a million.
- Half a million years old.

896
01:21:33,792 --> 01:21:35,666
Let's make sure Kuato...

897
01:22:06,584 --> 01:22:09,916
Wake up! Wake up!
Come on, wake up!

898
01:22:11,334 --> 01:22:13,875
They found us! Shit! Let's go!

899
01:22:15,126 --> 01:22:17,750
Wake up! Snap out of it now!
Come on!

900
01:22:22,001 --> 01:22:24,833
- They found us! Everybody out!
- Melina!

901
01:22:25,001 --> 01:22:26,833
Get moving! Get out!

902
01:22:28,334 --> 01:22:30,000
Get out!

903
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:41,083
Everybody out! Get out!

904
01:22:46,751 --> 01:22:49,041
Get to the air lock! Follow me!

905
01:22:50,834 --> 01:22:52,375
Benny, come on!

906
01:22:56,459 --> 01:22:59,125
- Benny!
- I'm coming!

907
01:23:11,251 --> 01:23:12,583
- Ah!
- This way!

908
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:21,916
Put these spacesuits on!
We're going outside!

909
01:23:24,584 --> 01:23:26,583
Benny, hurry.

910
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:38,208
Congratulations, Quaid.
You led us right to him.

911
01:23:38,376 --> 01:23:41,125
How can you do this?
You're a mutant.

912
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:46,166
- I got four kids to feed.
- So what happened to number five?

913
01:23:48,084 --> 01:23:51,291
Oh, shit, man. You got me.

914
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:53,041
I ain't even married.

915
01:23:53,209 --> 01:23:55,333
Now put your fucking hands
in the air!

916
01:24:01,126 --> 01:24:03,125
Quaid.

917
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:06,708
Quaid.

918
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:11,875
Forget it, man.
His fortunetelling days are over.

919
01:24:14,584 --> 01:24:17,291
Start the reactor.

920
01:24:17,459 --> 01:24:19,291
Free Mars.

921
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:27,041
Mr Cohaagen
would like to talk to you.

922
01:24:35,042 --> 01:24:37,833
So this is the great man.

923
01:24:42,376 --> 01:24:44,500
No wonder he kept out of sight.

924
01:24:46,459 --> 01:24:48,666
Well, my boy...

925
01:24:50,959 --> 01:24:52,875
- You're a hero.
- Fuck you.

926
01:24:53,042 --> 01:24:56,708
Uh? Don't be modest.
Kuato is dead.

927
01:24:56,876 --> 01:25:01,083
The resistance is completely wiped out,
and you were the key to the whole thing.

928
01:25:01,251 --> 01:25:02,583
He's lying.

929
01:25:03,584 --> 01:25:06,250
You two-faced bastard.

930
01:25:07,251 --> 01:25:11,083
Ha, ha. You can't blame him, angel.
He's innocent.

931
01:25:12,959 --> 01:25:16,791
You see, Quaid, none of my people
could get close to Kuato.

932
01:25:17,376 --> 01:25:20,125
Fucking mutants
could always sniff us out.

933
01:25:20,292 --> 01:25:24,375
So Hauser and I sat down
and invented you, the perfect mole.

934
01:25:24,542 --> 01:25:27,625
You know you're lying.
Hauser turned against you.

935
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:33,458
That's what we wanted
you to think.

936
01:25:34,376 --> 01:25:37,541
The fact is, Hauser volunteered
to become Doug Quaid.

937
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:40,666
It was the only way
to fool the psychics.

938
01:25:40,834 --> 01:25:42,291
Get your story straight.

939
01:25:42,459 --> 01:25:45,875
This idiot here has been trying to kill me
ever since I went to Rekall.

940
01:25:46,042 --> 01:25:48,250
You don't kill somebody
you're trying to plant.

941
01:25:48,417 --> 01:25:51,666
He wasn't in on it.
You set him off by going to Rekall.

942
01:25:52,417 --> 01:25:55,250
- So why am I still alive?
- We gave you lots of help.

943
01:25:55,417 --> 01:25:57,208
- Benny here.
- My pleasure, man.

944
01:25:57,376 --> 01:26:00,875
The guy with the suitcase,
the mask, the money,

945
01:26:01,042 --> 01:26:04,875
the message from Hauser,
all of that was set up by us.

946
01:26:05,042 --> 01:26:07,458
Sorry. Too perfect.

947
01:26:07,626 --> 01:26:09,208
Perfect, my ass!

948
01:26:09,376 --> 01:26:11,958
You pop your memory cap
before we can activate you.

949
01:26:12,126 --> 01:26:16,083
Richter goes hog-wild, screwing up
everything I spent a year planning.

950
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:20,000
Frankly, I'm amazed it worked.

951
01:26:20,167 --> 01:26:21,500
Well, Cohaagen,

952
01:26:21,667 --> 01:26:25,208
I have to hand it to you.
It's the best mind-fuck yet.

953
01:26:26,542 --> 01:26:29,208
Well, don't take my word for it.

954
01:26:31,042 --> 01:26:36,166
- Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
- Who is it this time? My mother?

955
01:26:38,251 --> 01:26:39,583
<i>Howdy, Quaid.</i>

956
01:26:39,751 --> 01:26:43,208
<i>If you're listening to this,
it means that Kuato is dead</i>

957
01:26:43,376 --> 01:26:45,583
<i>and you have led us to him.</i>

958
01:26:45,751 --> 01:26:47,708
<i>I knew you wouldn't let me down.</i>

959
01:26:47,876 --> 01:26:52,500
<i>Sorry for the shit I've put you through,
but hey, what are friends for?</i>

960
01:26:52,667 --> 01:26:55,875
<i>I would like to wish you
happiness and long life, old buddy,</i>

961
01:26:56,042 --> 01:26:58,875
<i>but unfortunately,
this is not gonna happen.</i>

962
01:26:59,042 --> 01:27:03,208
<i>You see, it's my body
you've got there and I want it back.</i>

963
01:27:03,376 --> 01:27:07,500
<i>Sorry to be an Indian giver,
but I was here first.</i>

964
01:27:07,667 --> 01:27:10,208
<i>So adios, amigo.</i>

965
01:27:10,376 --> 01:27:13,500
<i>And thanks for not
getting yourself killed.</i>

966
01:27:13,667 --> 01:27:16,250
<i>Hey, maybe we'll meet
in our dreams.</i>

967
01:27:19,876 --> 01:27:21,875
<i>You never know.</i>

968
01:27:26,542 --> 01:27:28,666
You bastards!

969
01:27:46,751 --> 01:27:48,250
Let go of me!

970
01:28:04,376 --> 01:28:06,375
- Ready?
- Auto.

971
01:28:06,542 --> 01:28:09,458
- Check.
- Ready to go, sir.

972
01:28:11,459 --> 01:28:13,583
Relax, Quaid.

973
01:28:13,751 --> 01:28:17,083
- You'll like being Hauser.
- The guy's a fucking asshole.

974
01:28:17,251 --> 01:28:20,375
Not true.
He's one of my best friends.

975
01:28:20,542 --> 01:28:23,375
Besides, he's got
a big house and a Mercedes.

976
01:28:23,542 --> 01:28:27,500
And you like Melina, right?
You'll get to fuck her every night.

977
01:28:27,667 --> 01:28:30,541
That's right.
She's going to be Hauser's babe.

978
01:28:30,709 --> 01:28:32,875
I'll bust his balls.

979
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:37,375
Uh-uh, princess.

980
01:28:37,542 --> 01:28:39,875
We're having you fixed.

981
01:28:40,042 --> 01:28:43,208
You're going to be
respectful, compliant

982
01:28:43,376 --> 01:28:46,791
and appreciative,
the way a woman should be.

983
01:28:50,667 --> 01:28:52,750
Mr Cohaagen, telephone.

984
01:28:55,459 --> 01:28:57,083
Yes? What is it?

985
01:28:57,251 --> 01:28:59,875
<i>The oxygen level
is bottoming out in Sector G.</i>

986
01:29:00,042 --> 01:29:02,208
<i>What do you want me
to do about it?</i>

987
01:29:02,376 --> 01:29:06,375
- Don't do anything.
- <i>But they won't last an hour, sir.</i>

988
01:29:06,542 --> 01:29:08,916
Fuck 'em. it'll be a good lesson
to the others.

989
01:29:09,084 --> 01:29:12,875
Come on, you got what you want.
Give these people air.

990
01:29:13,042 --> 01:29:16,791
My friend, in five minutes
you won't give a shit about the people.

991
01:29:16,959 --> 01:29:18,083
Fire it up, Doc.

992
01:29:18,251 --> 01:29:20,291
Excuse me, Doctor.

993
01:29:20,459 --> 01:29:22,500
- Is he gonna remember any of this?
- Not a thing.

994
01:29:23,542 --> 01:29:24,750
Oh, really?

995
01:29:35,251 --> 01:29:38,583
Quaid, I'm having a party tonight.
Why don't you and Melina drop by?

996
01:29:38,751 --> 01:29:40,250
- Remind him, Doc.
- Sure.

997
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:42,000
See you at the party.

998
01:29:56,667 --> 01:29:59,166
Keep still.
Fighting just makes it hurt.

999
01:30:11,959 --> 01:30:14,750
If you don't keep still,
you'll end up psychotic.

1000
01:30:18,959 --> 01:30:20,458
Hey, don't!

1001
01:30:27,376 --> 01:30:29,041
Melina, hold on!

1002
01:30:51,959 --> 01:30:55,208
Are you all right?
Are you still you?

1003
01:30:55,376 --> 01:30:58,750
I'm not sure, dear.
What do you think?

1004
01:31:01,667 --> 01:31:04,041
Let's get the hell out of here.

1005
01:31:30,292 --> 01:31:32,625
You have to make a decision, sir.

1006
01:31:43,126 --> 01:31:44,416
Kill him.

1007
01:31:45,626 --> 01:31:47,625
It's about goddamn time.

1008
01:32:39,917 --> 01:32:42,541
- Where are you going?
- To the reactor.

1009
01:32:42,709 --> 01:32:46,333
- What reactor?
- The one in the mines. Come on!

1010
01:32:46,501 --> 01:32:50,458
People are dying, Quaid!
Stop! We've got to get air!

1011
01:32:50,626 --> 01:32:53,750
The reactor makes air.
That's Cohaagen's secret. Let's go.

1012
01:32:53,917 --> 01:32:55,333
Where's this reactor come from?

1013
01:32:55,501 --> 01:32:57,458
- Aliens built it.
- Aliens?

1014
01:32:57,626 --> 01:33:01,000
- Are you sure about this?
- It's just up ahead.

1015
01:33:03,626 --> 01:33:05,833
What the hell?

1016
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:33,333
Quaid! Hey, Quaid,
you remember me?

1017
01:33:33,501 --> 01:33:35,750
Benny! Benny's the name!

1018
01:33:50,001 --> 01:33:51,500
Oh, that's good!

1019
01:33:57,292 --> 01:34:01,458
I'm gonna drill you, sucker!
I'm gonna grind you up!

1020
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:10,416
Ha-ha! I'm coming!

1021
01:34:10,584 --> 01:34:12,416
I'm coming for you, baby!

1022
01:34:27,917 --> 01:34:29,958
What the fuck is this?

1023
01:34:36,501 --> 01:34:38,583
Damn this piece of Martian junk!

1024
01:34:41,001 --> 01:34:43,416
Hey, Quaid,
I'm gonna squash you!

1025
01:34:44,709 --> 01:34:46,583
Benny, here!

1026
01:34:49,792 --> 01:34:51,416
Where the fuck are you?

1027
01:34:57,084 --> 01:34:58,791
Screw you!

1028
01:35:04,917 --> 01:35:08,791
- Quaid, get over here!
- What is it?

1029
01:35:09,792 --> 01:35:13,583
- There's an opening.
- I knew it.

1030
01:35:42,417 --> 01:35:45,625
This whole thing is one big reactor
made out of terbinium.

1031
01:35:45,792 --> 01:35:49,041
Cohaagen knows it makes air.
The bastard won't turn it on.

1032
01:35:49,209 --> 01:35:53,500
Of course not. If Mars had
an atmosphere, he'd lose control.

1033
01:35:54,709 --> 01:35:56,083
See down there?

1034
01:35:57,209 --> 01:35:59,541
It's a glacier.

1035
01:35:59,709 --> 01:36:02,750
The whole core of Mars is ice.

1036
01:36:02,917 --> 01:36:07,125
The reactor melts it
and it releases the oxygen.

1037
01:36:07,292 --> 01:36:08,541
Come on.

1038
01:36:08,709 --> 01:36:11,625
- Enough for everyone to breathe?
- Sure.

1039
01:36:11,792 --> 01:36:14,625
Enough for the whole planet.

1040
01:36:14,792 --> 01:36:17,083
If we turn it on in time.

1041
01:36:23,709 --> 01:36:25,708
Come on. Come on!

1042
01:36:42,626 --> 01:36:43,875
Hold on.

1043
01:37:15,209 --> 01:37:16,083
Now!

1044
01:37:46,459 --> 01:37:47,708
Son of a bitch.

1045
01:37:55,584 --> 01:37:57,166
Move!

1046
01:38:00,001 --> 01:38:02,000
He's got a hologram!

1047
01:38:24,001 --> 01:38:26,708
You think this is
the real Quaid? It is.

1048
01:39:46,126 --> 01:39:48,375
You're coming with me!

1049
01:40:02,084 --> 01:40:04,291
See you at the party, Richter.

1050
01:40:42,584 --> 01:40:47,000
- Don't touch that! Get back!
- What are you afraid of?

1051
01:40:47,167 --> 01:40:49,458
- Turn it on.
- Impossible!

1052
01:40:49,626 --> 01:40:52,750
Once the reaction starts, it'll spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

1053
01:40:52,917 --> 01:40:55,166
Mars will go into global meltdown.

1054
01:40:55,334 --> 01:40:57,833
That's why the aliens
never turned it on.

1055
01:40:58,001 --> 01:40:59,958
And you expect me to believe you?

1056
01:41:00,126 --> 01:41:04,750
Who gives a shit what you believe?
In 30 seconds you'll be dead.

1057
01:41:04,917 --> 01:41:08,125
Then I'll blow this place up
and be home in time for cornflakes.

1058
01:41:11,834 --> 01:41:15,791
I didn't want it to end this way.
I wanted Hauser back. But no.

1059
01:41:17,126 --> 01:41:19,125
You had to be Quaid!

1060
01:41:19,292 --> 01:41:21,625
- I am Quaid.
- You're nothing!

1061
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:24,875
You're nobody!
You're a stupid dream.

1062
01:41:25,042 --> 01:41:29,000
Well, all dreams come to an end.

1063
01:42:43,792 --> 01:42:46,041
Melina, hold on!

1064
01:42:46,209 --> 01:42:49,750
Don't do it! We'll all die!

1065
01:42:50,709 --> 01:42:53,208
Everybody will die!

1066
01:43:56,292 --> 01:43:57,625
Quaid!

1067
01:49:12,459 --> 01:49:14,833
I can't believe it.
It's like a dream.

1068
01:49:16,167 --> 01:49:17,666
What's wrong?

1069
01:49:17,834 --> 01:49:21,666
I just had a terrible thought.
What if this is a dream?

1070
01:49:23,167 --> 01:49:26,250
Well, then kiss me quick
before you wake up.
