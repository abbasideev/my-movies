1
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:45,539
Another glass of

2
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:47,809
rosé?

3
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:52,713
No. The hour is long past.

4
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:53,982
Check.

5
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,154
Check!

6
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,950
The case, Santos.

7
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:30,118
My case. Stand back!

8
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:31,585
Do not advance!

9
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,088
The case, Santos.

10
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:35,257
Halt! Evildoer.

11
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,692
The case, Santos.

12
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:40,862
Not on your life, waiter.

13
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,941
Oh, God.

14
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,268
Go.

15
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,095
Oh, Jamie!

16
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:49,040
Neither Sukie nor Jamie
are here right now.

17
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:50,298
Leave a message.

18
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:51,608
Hey, Jamie.

19
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,601
Are you there?

20
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,113
Just wondering,
are you and Sukie

21
00:03:55,137 --> 00:03:57,172
- going to shot night tonight?
- Oh, my God!

22
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:59,350
I don't want to be stuck
there not knowing anyone.

23
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:00,674
Maybe Carla's going.

24
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,044
Do you know if Carla's going?

25
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:03,145
Are you going?

26
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,248
Anyway, call me if you would.

27
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:07,748
Come on, back to mama.

28
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:09,127
Hope you and Sukie
are doing well.

29
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:10,986
Miss you, friend. It's Marian.

30
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:16,124
Hey. Marian.

31
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:17,859
Hi, Bart.

32
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:20,328
Say, what are you
doing tomorrow night?

33
00:04:20,362 --> 00:04:22,197
There's a Phish concert.

34
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,865
What?

35
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,633
Phish concert.

36
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,936
Great jam band, at
the Civic Center.

37
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:30,338
Yeah, oh, I...

38
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:31,339
P-H.

39
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:33,641
I know how to spell Phish.

40
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,277
Y-Yeah, of course.
I didn't mean to...

41
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,080
- Y-You know, I just meant...
- Sorry, I have an engagement.

42
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:40,282
Okay. Bummer.

43
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:42,284
Didn't mean to, you know...

44
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:43,684
That's fine.

45
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,653
Anyhoo, what about...

46
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,655
Please don't use
that expression.

47
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,623
- What expression?
- "Anyhoo."

48
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,893
It's not an expression.

49
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:53,694
What is it?

50
00:04:55,063 --> 00:04:56,198
A word.

51
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:58,166
Please don't use that word.

52
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,802
Okay. You-you free Wednesday?

53
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:02,280
Plus, it's not even
a word. Not really.

54
00:05:02,304 --> 00:05:03,839
Okay, sure. Free for
dinner Wednesday?

55
00:05:03,872 --> 00:05:05,706
There's a new place
near me, Montana's.

56
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,142
It's very good.

57
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:09,244
Yeah, the food is trendy,
but it's super gourmet.

58
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:11,612
No, I have an
engagement Wednesday.

59
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:14,648
Okay. Huh. Wednesday, too.

60
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:19,087
People don't usually
call them "engagements."

61
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:21,755
Do I tell you how to speak?

62
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:24,059
Yes.

63
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:25,994
The fact remains.

64
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:27,129
The engagement.

65
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:28,864
That's right.

66
00:05:51,253 --> 00:05:52,354
Oh, my.

67
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:54,189
Oh, my God. Oh!

68
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:56,391
My God!

69
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,698
Neither Sukie nor Jamie
are here right now.

70
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:07,135
Leave a message.

71
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,304
Jesus, Marian, don't
call me during sex.

72
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:11,072
Yes, I am going tonight.

73
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:12,407
During sex?

74
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,277
- Hi, Sukie.
- Wow.

75
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:20,081
- Who? Here?
- Yes, there.

76
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:22,750
Oh, no one's here, babe.

77
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,453
- I was just masturbating.
- Uh-huh.

78
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:26,821
Me... me time.

79
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,892
Let me turn the video down.

80
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,104
No.

81
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:44,772
- What?
- No.

82
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:46,808
No what, Carla?

83
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:48,310
You're not wearing that.

84
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:51,446
- I just came from work.
- I came from Toledo.

85
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,746
I don't dress like it.

86
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,016
- Is Jamie here?
- Okay, look.

87
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,219
Keep the coat on. Take
the shirt off underneath.

88
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:58,954
And flaunt my breasts?

89
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:00,788
I'm not here to peddle my wares.

90
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:02,190
Why else would you be here?

91
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:03,825
To socialize.

92
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,336
Hello, girls.

93
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:10,465
All I hear lately is "Y2K, Y2K."

94
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,434
But Jamie Dobbs
is here to say...

95
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:14,502
Why not 2K?

96
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:18,506
New millennium, bring it on.

97
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:24,446
Oh, yeah. It's the last body
shot competition of 1999

98
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,014
here at Sugar 'n Spice,

99
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:28,350
and Jamie is last
month's winner,

100
00:07:28,383 --> 00:07:30,986
so we are gonna salt you up.

101
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,356
Show us where the
first lick goes, babe.

102
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:37,025
So, first lick...

103
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:40,462
Here.

104
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:44,065
God, look at that slut.

105
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh. Hi, Sukie.

106
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,534
Don't put that woman

107
00:07:46,568 --> 00:07:48,403
in front of a crowd
with a microphone.

108
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:51,840
- And then second lick...
- Well, she likes to entertain.

109
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:53,908
Ooh! Take it off! Take it off!

110
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:56,544
Here.

111
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,382
And then she gets
this reinforcement.

112
00:08:00,415 --> 00:08:03,151
- And then third lick...
- Do you know who she's fucking?

113
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:04,919
I don't know that
she's seeing anyone.

114
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:06,421
She's seeing you, of course.

115
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:08,323
Can I have your shirt?

116
00:08:08,356 --> 00:08:09,557
Here.

117
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:12,927
She's a free spirit.

118
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,429
I admire her.

119
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:16,031
Free. Yeah, that's the problem.

120
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:18,566
Put a meter on her pussy,
we could all retire!

121
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,968
That's not fair, Sukie.

122
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:25,073
And a lime wedge... right here!

123
00:08:27,242 --> 00:08:28,543
Pull that out!

124
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,945
That is not a public receptacle!

125
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:33,248
- Somebody's gonna get hit.
- Oh. Hi, Sukie.

126
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,586
I've had it with love.

127
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,122
I know bards and
troubadours are high on it,

128
00:08:41,156 --> 00:08:43,058
but I don't believe it's
relevant to the modern

129
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:45,393
20th... soon-to-be
21st... century lesbian.

130
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:47,329
Here are some carrots.
Those peas are thawed.

131
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:49,998
- This right here is what it gets you.
- Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,866
So I've hatched a
plan, my friend.

133
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,168
If you'll come help me

134
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:54,612
move my shit out of
Sukie's tomorrow...

135
00:08:54,636 --> 00:08:55,603
I'm not getting in
the middle of that.

136
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:57,305
I have my own problems.

137
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:59,174
What problems?

138
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:00,575
Internal.

139
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,377
- Internal?
- Yes.

140
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,012
I don't know how else to put it.

141
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,214
Problems with what
I feel internally.

142
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:08,116
How can you have
internal problems?

143
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:10,151
You got your ass all bricked up.

144
00:09:10,185 --> 00:09:13,254
I'm not certain, honey
darling, that you have ever

145
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:17,292
reached deep inside any
orifice to scoop out your soul

146
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:20,128
and fling it shamelessly
at a fellow human being

147
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:23,298
and humiliate yourself
and grovel and weep

148
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:26,101
and feel your ego
completely disintegrate,

149
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:28,370
otherwise known as
the glory of love.

150
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:29,971
Please don't eat those peas.

151
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,507
Now, my plan is: You
come help me pack,

152
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,176
- and then we two...
- I can't. I'm leaving town.

153
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,911
What? I am, too.
That was my plan.

154
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:37,979
Where are you going?

155
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,647
Tallahassee, Florida.

156
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:41,683
Why would anybody go to
Tallahassee, Florida?

157
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:43,451
My Aunt Ellis lives there.

158
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:45,320
Can't she move?

159
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:47,188
Tallahassee is very nice.

160
00:09:47,222 --> 00:09:49,190
It's not glitzy and
gross like Miami.

161
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:50,992
It has live oak
and Spanish moss.

162
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:54,028
Me and Aunt Ellis go to the
St. Marks Wildlife Preserve.

163
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:56,231
There's good birding.

164
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:57,932
Birding?

165
00:09:57,966 --> 00:09:59,534
How have I missed out on this?

166
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,269
It's very pleasant.

167
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:04,038
So you just came up with this
wild hair in your ass to bird.

168
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:06,174
I've been unhappy,

169
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,376
and I'm starting to
snap at people at work,

170
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,044
and it's not fair to them.

171
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:12,680
I'm only impatient with myself.

172
00:10:12,714 --> 00:10:14,416
Well, we can fix that.

173
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:16,317
We'll have you running
right in no time.

174
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:18,520
That's why we take this
trip together, honey babe.

175
00:10:18,553 --> 00:10:21,189
We get our shit
together, together.

176
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:23,024
See, I was gonna
take some time off,

177
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,460
get a drive-away, just
go potluck anywhere.

178
00:10:25,493 --> 00:10:26,728
Now you can come with me,

179
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,730
and we can go to
Tallahassee and bird.

180
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:30,465
What's a drive-away?

181
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:32,033
Free one-way rental.

182
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:33,577
You deliver the car to
wherever some client

183
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:35,203
of the drive-away
company wants it,

184
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:37,305
if they got one going
near your destination.

185
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:40,041
I don't know if you'll
like Aunt Ellis.

186
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:42,343
Are you kidding? A birder?

187
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:45,346
I'll wear my great
big old straw hat,

188
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,316
and she is going
to L-O-V-E love me.

189
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:50,185
You know how parents
and such love me.

190
00:10:50,218 --> 00:10:52,020
They think I got charisma.

191
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:54,355
"Oh, Marian, who's
your loquacious friend?

192
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:55,990
"I just love that
chatty little girl.

193
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:57,058
Isn't she something?"

194
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:58,593
I'm not sure.

195
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:00,028
Don't go finding a problem here.

196
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:01,663
This is going to be
F-U-N-N fun, girl.

197
00:11:01,696 --> 00:11:04,265
Just come help me move my
stuff out of Sukie's tomorrow.

198
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:06,334
Don't worry, she's not
even gonna be there.

199
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,069
<i>Oh, God!</i>

200
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:10,080
Take it! Oh, God!

201
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:12,240
Sukie, don't. What
are you doing?

202
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,742
I don't want it anymore.

203
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:16,744
You said she wouldn't be here.

204
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:20,281
Sukie, I'm just
taking my own stuff.

205
00:11:20,315 --> 00:11:21,516
That was a gift.

206
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:23,184
I wanted you to have it.

207
00:11:23,218 --> 00:11:27,622
I don't want it if we're
not going to both use it!

208
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:30,325
Sukie, it's your wall dildo.

209
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:31,593
No, no, no, no.

210
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:33,394
And take Alice, too.

211
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:35,129
I never liked her.

212
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:37,098
And she won't stop barking!

213
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,234
How can I take the dog,
Sukie? I don't have a home.

214
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:40,635
Remember, you kicked me out?

215
00:11:41,804 --> 00:11:44,706
Take Alice. Take the wall dildo.

216
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:46,809
It's your dildo, Susanne.

217
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:51,312
Curlie's Drive-Away,

218
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:52,791
Pennsylvania's most trusted
name in car delivery.

219
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:54,315
Curlie speaking.

220
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:56,060
Okay, it's going
to Tallahassee.

221
00:11:56,084 --> 00:11:58,086
Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

222
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,663
Yeah, you have something
to write this down?

223
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:02,257
- Yes, I'm writing it down.
- To 14 Tinywick Road.

224
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,625
- Right.
- Tallahassee.

225
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:05,093
- Sure.
- You got it?

226
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:06,494
- Right. Got it.
- Can you help us?

227
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:09,130
And it's got to be there
by end of day tomorrow.

228
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:10,798
- By tomorrow.
- No later.

229
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,534
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

230
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,469
- Okay.
- Over and out.

231
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:18,540
Can you help us? We
need a drive-away.

232
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:21,409
$250 deposit and a reference.

233
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:22,744
A reference?

234
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:24,813
Somebody local I
can break his balls

235
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:26,781
if you don't show up
where you're supposed to.

236
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:28,550
His balls.

237
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,285
Can the reference be a woman?

238
00:12:30,318 --> 00:12:32,420
We don't know a lot of men.

239
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:33,721
No kidding.

240
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:36,357
- Where do you want to go?
- Tallahassee.

241
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:39,260
Tallahassee?

242
00:12:39,294 --> 00:12:41,696
What's wrong with
Tallahassee? It's very nice.

243
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:43,298
There's Spanish
moss and live oak.

244
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:44,566
I think Curlie here...

245
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,200
Don't call me Curlie.

246
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:49,137
Isn't your name Curlie?

247
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,238
My name is Curlie.

248
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,874
We just met. It's too familiar.

249
00:12:51,907 --> 00:12:54,142
Have you ever been
to Tallahassee?

250
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:55,376
No, I got good sense.

251
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,212
- Your car is a Dodge Aries.
- Oh.

252
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:00,648
Okay. Is that a good car?

253
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:02,350
Not really.

254
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,187
You sell those shirts?

255
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,866
There's also a place
here in Wilmington

256
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,191
fantastic dyke bar,
the Butter Churn.

257
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,160
And this place, Levi's
Barbecue in Charleston.

258
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:13,370
Memphis-style
barbecue, really good.

259
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:14,796
Everyone goes to
Charlie Vergos',

260
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,264
- but it's just...
- Jamie.

261
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:17,608
It's a straight
shot to Tallahassee.

262
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:19,133
Down and across.

263
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,611
Right here's the world's
largest Dixie cup

264
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:21,870
outside of Mitchell, Georgia.

265
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:23,638
Direct route, down and across.

266
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:26,374
We don't need to see the
world's largest Dixie cup.

267
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:29,210
We don't need to enjoy life,
but as long as we're here...

268
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:31,512
The world's largest
Dixie cup is not life.

269
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:33,916
It's a straight shot on the
interstate, down and across.

270
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:35,450
The interstate is not life.

271
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:36,895
It is, more than the
world's largest Dixie cup.

272
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,495
You're the one that
wanted to go birding.

273
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,354
That's nature.

274
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:41,222
What's a dyke bar?
That's not nature?

275
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,700
Even a Dixie cup, you
could make an argument.

276
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:44,225
He said it was a rush job.

277
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:45,536
We're supposed to have
the car there tomorrow.

278
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,628
Tomorrow can wait a day.

279
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:48,229
We could even go to Miami.

280
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:49,631
Bikinis and high heels.

281
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:53,434
A medical doctor?

282
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:54,602
Or a reverend?

283
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:58,907
Yeah, no, we don't have a
discount for men of God, no.

284
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:01,209
No, not for medical
doctors, either.

285
00:14:01,242 --> 00:14:02,911
Make up your mind...
which are you?

286
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:05,613
It doesn't matter.
We have no discounts.

287
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:09,183
Our everyday low prices
are already rock bottom.

288
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:11,486
Thank you for calling Curlie's.

289
00:14:13,254 --> 00:14:15,189
Welcome to Curlie's Drive-Away.

290
00:14:15,223 --> 00:14:18,626
Well, we're here.

291
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,295
Okay. Who are you?

292
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,799
- The car.
- The car?

293
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,567
The Dodge Aries.

294
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:28,703
The Dodge Aries?

295
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:29,972
What are you, a mynah bird?

296
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:31,305
I'm Curlie.

297
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:33,207
I understand that.

298
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:34,776
You're not the Dodge.

299
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:38,814
What do you mean,
we're not the Dodge?

300
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:49,323
What's the big deal?

301
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:50,993
The car isn't ours.

302
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:53,761
But it's art, and the car
is ours till Tallahassee.

303
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:55,329
And once we get to Tallahassee,

304
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:56,841
it stops being art and
starts being vandalism.

305
00:14:56,865 --> 00:14:58,810
Fuckety-fuck's sake, Marian,
it'll come off with a little

306
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,501
- soap and water.
- It won't.

307
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:02,537
- Won't what?
- Come off with soap and water.

308
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,873
- Well, how do you know?
- I tried.

309
00:15:04,907 --> 00:15:06,942
Marian, it's art.

310
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:08,376
Stop saying it's art.

311
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,945
That doesn't end all discussion.

312
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:11,446
We're gonna be driving through

313
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:13,314
some conservative
towns... the South.

314
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:14,983
- The Bible Belt.
- Mm, don't I know it.

315
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:16,985
Honey, I grew up
where the Bible Belt

316
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,753
meets the ass crack
of the Pecos River.

317
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,989
Fort Worth is nowhere
near the "Pay-cos" River.

318
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:23,524
That's "Peck-us," honey darling.

319
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:26,028
And the car art is just a
part of my larger undertaking.

320
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:27,395
My project.

321
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,430
What's your project?

322
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:33,234
Loosening you up so we can
get you laid, sugar sweet.

323
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:35,536
How long's it been?

324
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:39,373
Weeks?

325
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:42,978
Months?

326
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,746
Oh, my God, Marian.

327
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:47,015
Don't tell me it's been years.

328
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:49,350
H-How many years? Who was it?

329
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,452
You've had sex since
what's-her-name, haven't you?

330
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:52,921
Donna.

331
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:54,555
Yeah, Donna.

332
00:15:57,592 --> 00:15:59,694
Oh, my God.

333
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:02,263
Oh, my God. Donna?

334
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:04,799
She work for Al Gore now?

335
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,300
Nader.

336
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,804
That's right. She just
looks like Al Gore.

337
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:12,373
Wait a minute.

338
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:15,777
You said people of yours
would come in for it.

339
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:19,047
Yes, I did.

340
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:22,483
You call with a
drop-off in Tallahassee,

341
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:24,052
and then these broads come in

342
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:26,454
and say they're ready
to go to Tallahassee.

343
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,523
You gave them the car.

344
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:30,324
You don't know who they were?

345
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:31,927
I told you their names.

346
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,427
Their names, yes, but...

347
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:35,097
This place is a dump.

348
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,565
They drive the car
instead of you.

349
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:38,533
Is that bad?

350
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:39,968
Bad if they find the goods.

351
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:42,537
This place is a pigsty. Why
don't you get a girl in?

352
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,039
I like clutter.

353
00:16:44,072 --> 00:16:45,540
They didn't have
a cellular phone?

354
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:46,683
Sterile doesn't work for me.

355
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:48,442
He asked you a
question, dick-yank.

356
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:49,912
- Dick-yank?
- Flint.

357
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:51,079
I'm a dick-yank?

358
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:52,580
Don't antagonize.

359
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:53,992
It's like talking to a
bucket of wet cement.

360
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:56,060
You wouldn't know wet cement
if it bit you in the ass.

361
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:57,718
And you would?

362
00:16:57,752 --> 00:17:00,022
So, there's no way to
get in contact with them?

363
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:02,891
Not per se.

364
00:17:02,925 --> 00:17:04,492
"Per se"?!

365
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,995
They left a local number.

366
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:09,965
Everybody's got to
leave a local number.

367
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:11,766
Someone whose balls I can break.

368
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:18,339
Now you've gone and done it.

369
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:26,081
Susanne Shinkleman,
2431 North Garnet.

370
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:31,752
You better hope your
friends deliver that car.

371
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,488
Tomorrow.

372
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,427
This is great.

373
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,729
This is so slutty. I love this.

374
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:44,465
- Hope they have postcards.
- Uh, Jamie?

375
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,400
All right, let's put
on our war paint.

376
00:17:46,434 --> 00:17:47,568
The Butter Churn awaits.

377
00:17:47,602 --> 00:17:48,871
Jamie, I think I'd prefer to...

378
00:17:48,904 --> 00:17:50,873
No. No, don't even.

379
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:52,107
You come with me.

380
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,909
I'll show you how this is done.

381
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,887
Hiya. Do you know where
the Butter Churn is?

382
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,520
It's a dyke bar.

383
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:09,724
Or do you have, like,
a <i>Time Out Wilmington?</i>

384
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:12,660
I mean, is there one with,
uh, gay/lesbian listings?

385
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,695
You wouldn't have
one, but do you know

386
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:17,798
if there's a news stand
or a lesbian bookstore?

387
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,836
You know, Sapphic Wonders,
something like that?

388
00:18:24,873 --> 00:18:26,540
Hello?

389
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,681
Confidence.

390
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:36,517
You got to show that you're
comfortable with the physical.

391
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,653
This isn't like meeting
somebody at a NOW convention,

392
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:40,621
where you talk about
dismantling the patriarchy.

393
00:18:40,655 --> 00:18:42,224
Jamie, I have done this before.

394
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:43,926
It's just like this.

395
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,493
One message.

396
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:47,996
You dig the female body.

397
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,197
Your body.

398
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:51,465
You're like this.

399
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:55,070
Not like this.

400
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,872
"Let's dismantle
the patriarchy."

401
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:58,206
I have done this before.

402
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,707
I am not a schoolmarm.

403
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,219
You fuck people that
work for Ralph Nader.

404
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:03,145
- Not only.
- Only in the last four years.

405
00:19:03,178 --> 00:19:04,913
Three years.

406
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:07,782
And four months and 14 days.

407
00:19:09,985 --> 00:19:11,987
♪ Peanut, peanut butter ♪

408
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,788
Okay.

409
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:15,599
♪ Yeah, it tasted real good,
but it stuck to my teeth... ♪

410
00:19:15,623 --> 00:19:17,125

411
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:18,994
Very much so.

412
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:20,728
Okay.

413
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:23,664
Who looks good to you?

414
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:26,902
♪ Peanut, peanut butter... ♪

415
00:19:26,935 --> 00:19:29,171
They all look fine.

416
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:30,571
Fine?

417
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:31,840
Like, "You'll do"?

418
00:19:31,873 --> 00:19:33,184
"Please, please come
home with me, baby.

419
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,843
"You seem totally okay.

420
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:36,753
Are there any other mediocre
ones like you at home?"

421
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,579
I didn't say they
all looked mediocre.

422
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:39,848
I said they all looked fine.

423
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:42,683
Yeah, but not in the
sense of "super fine."

424
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:45,553
In the sense of
"fine, whatever."

425
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:47,521
Why are you jousting with me?

426
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,790
I'm not jousting.

427
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:51,126
I'm asking which of these women

428
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:52,760
you want to throw
up against the wall

429
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:54,595
and fuck like
there's no tomorrow.

430
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:56,597
Look, Jamie, I'm not a
"throw up against the wall

431
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,309
and fuck the daylights
out of" kind of person.

432
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,911
Stop trying to make
me something I'm not.

433
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:02,536
I'm just trying to get
you laid, sugar sweet.

434
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,572
They sense it, whether
you want to fuck them

435
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,141
or you think they're just fine.

436
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:07,675
I have to be me.

437
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,710
It has to be done
with authenticity.

438
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:11,755
- You mean with authority.
- I mean with authenticity.

439
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:14,282
Authenticity gets you somebody
that works for Ralph Nader.

440
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:16,051
You don't know what
our life was like.

441
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:17,328
You know nothing
about its worth.

442
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:18,954
Then why didn't
the two of you move

443
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:21,023
to Santa Fe and synchronize
your menstrual cycles?

444
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:22,290
That didn't happen.

445
00:20:22,324 --> 00:20:24,259
That's why you're
here in a dyke bar

446
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:25,894
looking for cheap, sleazy sex.

447
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:27,029
No, I'm not.

448
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:28,562
This is not me.

449
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:30,098
You're right. I can't do this.

450
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:32,000
No, Marian.

451
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:35,904
I'm sorry, honey girl. I-I'm
saying you can do this.

452
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:37,605
You can do this.

453
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:39,083
You can be cheap. I
promise, honey girl.

454
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:40,308
Your best self.

455
00:20:40,342 --> 00:20:41,943
Jamie, I know you're
well-intentioned,

456
00:20:41,977 --> 00:20:43,744
but this really
isn't right for me.

457
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:46,680
You should stay and enjoy
your night on the town.

Right here. Look.

464
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:05,766
Hold it. Better.

465
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,936
Great. Turn.

466
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:11,106
Oh.

467
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,975
Hello.

468
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:16,577
Good evening.

469
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,915
I'm Amber.

470
00:21:19,948 --> 00:21:21,817
Marian.

471
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:25,821
What you reading?

472
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:29,291
<i>Europeans</i> by Henry James.

473
00:21:29,324 --> 00:21:32,027
Wow. Thick one.

474
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:35,997
Hello, Marian.

475
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:38,699
Hello.

476
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:42,971
So, is this gonna
be a threesome?

477
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:44,039
No.

478
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:45,974
No, no.

479
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:48,210
- No.
- Oh. Okay.

480
00:21:48,243 --> 00:21:50,744
Rats.

481
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:54,916
Well...

482
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:57,819
I'll just

483
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:25,807
How was it?

484
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:28,310
Bouncy.

485
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:33,982
How's your book?

486
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:36,218
Good.

487
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:38,186
It's about two free spirits

488
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,155
who visit a repressed
family in New England.

489
00:23:40,188 --> 00:23:43,992
Uh, hello. They are all
repressed in New England.

490
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:46,461
That is why we are
going the other way.

491
00:23:46,494 --> 00:23:47,963
Although there
was this one chick

492
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:49,497
I screwed once
from New Hampshire.

493
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:51,233
Uh, she got her
tongue so far in me,

494
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:53,368
I swore it was gonna
wriggle out my asshole.

495
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:55,036
No, I'm not kidding.

496
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,972
They say that there's
advanced yoga people

497
00:23:57,005 --> 00:23:58,540
in India supposedly
who can do that.

498
00:23:58,573 --> 00:24:00,542
Black belts in cunnilingus.

499
00:24:00,575 --> 00:24:03,111
They can even
cunniling themselves.

500
00:24:03,144 --> 00:24:05,380
They got pictures of it
in, like, medical texts.

501
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:06,780
You got to ask the librarian.

502
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:08,516
They don't keep
'em in the stacks.

503
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,285
Who wrote your book?

504
00:24:11,286 --> 00:24:12,320
Henry James.

505
00:24:12,354 --> 00:24:13,855
Henry James...

506
00:24:13,888 --> 00:24:16,024
American writer.

507
00:24:16,057 --> 00:24:18,193
Famous family. His brother, too.

508
00:24:18,226 --> 00:24:19,294
Rick?

509
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:21,830
No, I'm kidding.

510
00:24:21,863 --> 00:24:23,498
I know who Henry James is.

511
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:25,066
White and uptight.

512
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:29,371
They had us read <i>Portrait
of a Lady</i> in school.

513
00:24:29,404 --> 00:24:31,273
Boy, that was a great read.

514
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:34,409
Like somebody dragging day-old
spaghetti across my tits.

515
00:24:34,442 --> 00:24:37,112
That's a very apt simile.

516
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:39,881
- His prose is labyrinthine.
- Yeah.

517
00:24:39,914 --> 00:24:41,916
Put me off the whole book thing.

518
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,895
Henry James is, in fact, the
reason that I don't read.

519
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:46,187
- Uh-huh.
- Except road signs.

520
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:47,531
Uh-huh, yeah. I don't
think you should've

521
00:24:47,555 --> 00:24:48,875
brought someone
back to the room.

522
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:51,559
Okay.

523
00:24:51,593 --> 00:24:53,028
I knew this was coming.

524
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:54,562
How do you think I felt?

525
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:56,298
You told me to have
a night on the town.

526
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:58,600
Yeah, people say things. It's
not always what they feel.

527
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:00,535
Yeah, well, I'm from
Texas. We don't read minds.

528
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:02,170
We operate on a handshake basis.

529
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:04,072
- What does that mean?
- "Hiya. How you doing?"

530
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:05,573
"How much for that Cadillac car?

531
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:07,442
"How would you like to
have oral sex?" Texas!

532
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:09,077
- Okay.
- Where you from, girl?

533
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,445
- Not Texas.
- I know that.

534
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:12,514
- Well, then why'd you ask?

Uh-huh.

553
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:54,999
They're very
committed lesbians,

554
00:25:55,023 --> 00:25:56,434
and they're on their way
to Marietta, Georgia,

555
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:58,126
which is practically on our way.

00:25:59,127 --> 00:26:00,962

Should we look at the
map, see how long...

559

After today's game,

560
00:26:04,332 --> 00:26:06,501
these girls are gonna
have a basement party.

561
00:26:06,534 --> 00:26:08,002

699
00:37:06,194 --> 00:37:08,629

00:37:40,661 --> 00:37:42,931
last night in Marietta, Georgia.

716
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:45,067
- Just north of Atlanta.
- On it.

717
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:47,803
Georgia.

718
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:02,918
Thank you.

719
00:38:02,951 --> 00:38:04,685
For what?

720
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:06,822
Just picking me up.

721
00:38:06,855 --> 00:38:08,857
Am I not gonna pick you up?

722
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,825
Hard not to.

723
00:38:09,858 --> 00:38:11,402
"Ma'am, your friend
here is in the hoosegow.

724
00:38:11,426 --> 00:38:12,793
Care to come get her?"

725
00:38:12,828 --> 00:38:14,628
I'll come get you
all day, every day.

726
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:16,374
I will not let a friend
of mine rot in prison

727
00:38:16,398 --> 00:38:18,699
longer than is
absolutely necessary.

728
00:38:18,732 --> 00:38:21,870
And so I say thank you.

729
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:29,845
Course, you ain't told me
how you come to be in prison,

730
00:38:29,878 --> 00:38:32,347
and I've been
careful not to ask,

731
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,883
but damn, Marian,

732
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:38,353
landing yourself in prison is
a very hopeful sign for you.

733
00:38:38,386 --> 00:38:40,355
I think it was jail, not prison.

734
00:38:40,388 --> 00:38:41,957
Oh. I'm sorry.

735
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,259
Uh, you ain't told me how
you come to be in jail.

736
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:46,128
It wasn't hell-raising.

737
00:38:46,161 --> 00:38:48,130
Sorry to disappoint.

738
00:38:48,163 --> 00:38:50,866
A policeman didn't like my tone.

739
00:38:50,899 --> 00:38:52,100
Oh.

740
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:54,668
You copped some attitude.

741
00:38:54,702 --> 00:38:57,072
I don't have attitude.

742
00:38:58,406 --> 00:39:00,708
Marian, if I may,

743
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:02,911
there are certain things in life

744
00:39:02,944 --> 00:39:05,779
which you got to
sense and understand

745
00:39:05,814 --> 00:39:07,883
in order to live life,

746
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:10,919
and one of the things that
you got to understand is, uh

747
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:13,155
well, all these funny
little creatures

748
00:39:13,188 --> 00:39:15,756
that you probably noticed
walking around on two legs,

749
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:18,026
we call 'em human beings.

750
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:20,195
Got to understand
what makes 'em tick.

751
00:39:20,228 --> 00:39:21,997
And your whole social situation,

752
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,065
you got to understand
what that is.

753
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:25,167
Uh-huh.

754
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,301
You know what that means?

755
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:27,768
"Social situation"?

756
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:29,703
I know what "social
situation" means.

757
00:39:29,737 --> 00:39:30,939
Okay, good.

758
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:32,874
So, the whole thing
with a cop is,

759
00:39:32,908 --> 00:39:35,043
and you should remember
this for future reference

760
00:39:35,076 --> 00:39:38,446
when you're in a social
situation with a cop,

761
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,714
there ain't no social situation.

762
00:39:40,748 --> 00:39:42,984
There's a "keep your fucking
mouth shut" situation.

763
00:39:43,018 --> 00:39:45,719
There's a "yes, sir"
situation is what there is.

764
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:47,465
Believe me, honey doll,
I've been dating a cop

765
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:49,024
for two years now, and...

766
00:39:49,057 --> 00:39:50,791
I ain't talking
through my vulva here.

767
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:53,261
Thank you. I understand.

768
00:39:53,295 --> 00:39:55,397
But if authority
is being abused,

769
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:59,067
- there's an obligation to...
- Holy shit.

770
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,969
Florida.

771
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:06,942
Lesbian

772
00:40:06,975 --> 00:40:11,813
don't let the sun
go down on you here.

773
00:40:31,866 --> 00:40:34,236
You okay?

774
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:36,204
Spare tire.

775
00:40:51,052 --> 00:40:52,220
What?

776
00:40:55,257 --> 00:40:57,025
Something burning?

777
00:41:12,874 --> 00:41:15,043
Jamie, it's cold.

778
00:41:17,245 --> 00:41:18,913
Don't touch it.

779
00:41:20,448 --> 00:41:22,117
I saw this movie once where

780
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,819
they come across this box,
the people in the movie,

781
00:41:24,853 --> 00:41:26,187
and they opened the box,

782
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:30,058
and it was, like,
really, really bad.

783
00:41:44,606 --> 00:41:47,175
Head!

784
00:41:56,885 --> 00:41:58,453
No, I'm kidding.

785
00:41:58,486 --> 00:42:01,189
It was a minor traffic accident.

786
00:42:01,222 --> 00:42:02,590
Fast stop.

787
00:42:02,624 --> 00:42:05,994
His, uh, face hit the wheel.

788
00:42:06,027 --> 00:42:08,129
Looking at a pretty
girl, weren't you, Flint?

789
00:42:09,964 --> 00:42:12,067
No more looking at pretty
girls for you, right?

790
00:42:13,635 --> 00:42:15,136
That's right.

791
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:18,039
So, are they, like,
wanted or something?

792
00:42:18,073 --> 00:42:20,342
Oh, no, no. No, they're
not in trouble at all.

793
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:22,577
Just drove off with
something we need.

794
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,245
Didn't even know they had it.

795
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:27,182
So, what were you all
doing here last night?

796
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:30,452
Just making out.

797
00:42:30,485 --> 00:42:32,354
Oh, yeah?

798
00:42:32,387 --> 00:42:34,089
With who?

799
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:38,226
No kiss-and-tell, huh?

800
00:42:39,994 --> 00:42:43,365
Anyway, we need to find
those girls to get our

801
00:42:43,398 --> 00:42:45,133
sample case back.

802
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:48,002
And when we heard Doreen here
paid Marian's fine, we thought,

803
00:42:48,036 --> 00:42:49,647
well, you girls might
know where they're headed.

804
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:52,207
How did you know about
its being Doreen's check?

805
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,476
We have contacts
in law enforcement.

806
00:42:59,147 --> 00:43:00,615
No, no.

807
00:43:00,648 --> 00:43:02,250
We should just call the cops.

808
00:43:02,283 --> 00:43:03,518
We will, Jamie.

809
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,354
First, we should
see what's in here.

810
00:43:06,388 --> 00:43:08,189
Why? I don't want to look.

811
00:43:08,223 --> 00:43:10,225
- Why do I have to look?
- Jamie, listen.

812
00:43:10,258 --> 00:43:12,627
Whoever sliced that head
off knows who we are.

813
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,229
This might tell us who they are,

814
00:43:14,262 --> 00:43:16,197
so we won't be at
a disadvantage.

815
00:43:16,231 --> 00:43:18,500
The police can find out, and
the police can protect us.

816
00:43:18,533 --> 00:43:20,268
Protect us?

817
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:22,613
They're not the Secret Service,
and we're not Chelsea Clinton.

818
00:43:22,637 --> 00:43:24,906
What do we lose by looking?

819
00:43:25,507 --> 00:43:27,108
Look.

820
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:30,245
I just want to know
what's going on.

821
00:43:31,446 --> 00:43:33,248
This might tell us.

822
00:43:34,048 --> 00:43:35,984
I bet it's locked.

823
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:02,277
- We got to call the cops.
- Why?

824
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:03,378
That was awful.

825
00:44:03,411 --> 00:44:05,346
You just said not
to call the cops.

826
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,048
In ignorance.

827
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:08,349
No, what you said was true.

828
00:44:08,383 --> 00:44:10,185
The cops could think
you're involved.

829
00:44:10,218 --> 00:44:11,653
You just spent
the night in jail.

830
00:44:11,686 --> 00:44:13,154
For vagrancy.

831
00:44:13,188 --> 00:44:15,490
We wouldn't have anything
to do with... that.

832
00:44:15,523 --> 00:44:16,758
Okay, honey, cool your jets.

833
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:18,159
Here's what we do.

834
00:44:18,193 --> 00:44:20,195
First, we get to Tallahassee.

835
00:44:20,228 --> 00:44:21,563
Bye!

836
00:44:23,531 --> 00:44:26,100
How about next time, you
let me do all the talking?

837
00:44:26,134 --> 00:44:27,545
Sure, gassing is
what you're good at.

838
00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:29,537
Well it sure as hell
ain't what you're good at.

839
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:31,272
I'm not a suck-up or a salesman.

840
00:44:31,306 --> 00:44:32,650
Uh-huh. You think
you would've gotten

841
00:44:32,674 --> 00:44:34,108
the address where
they're headed?

842
00:44:34,142 --> 00:44:36,277
I don't think so, Mr. Sunshine.

843
00:44:36,311 --> 00:44:38,213
Okay, we've got some
hard driving to do.

844
00:44:38,246 --> 00:44:40,248
Bye!

845
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:46,087
Welcome to El Conquistador.

846
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,523
Yeah, hiya. Do you have a
room for two right away?

847
00:44:48,556 --> 00:44:51,092
Uh, we do have one available.
Yes. How many nights?

848
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:53,561
Well, tonight, and then
we'll play it by ear.

849
00:44:53,595 --> 00:44:55,096
You take the Rainbow Card?

850
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:56,531
Uh, I'm sure we do.

851
00:44:56,564 --> 00:44:58,576
Yes, actually, that's just
a, uh, Visa specialty card.

852
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,478
Yeah, but they give a
percentage of each purchase

853
00:45:00,502 --> 00:45:02,112
to gay, lesbian, bi,
transgender charities.

854
00:45:02,136 --> 00:45:03,538
You do that, right?

855
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:05,382
Well, the issuer would be
the one to take care of that.

856
00:45:05,406 --> 00:45:06,809
Do you have a super
reinforced safe

857
00:45:06,842 --> 00:45:08,510
for sensitive materials?

858
00:45:08,543 --> 00:45:09,812
We do have in-room safes

859
00:45:09,845 --> 00:45:11,312
for any valuables
that you may have.

860
00:45:11,346 --> 00:45:13,648
This place is
lesbian-friendly, right?

861
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:15,517
Uh, yes. Uh, well, sure.

862
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,418
We're friendly to anyone
who wants to stay.

863
00:45:17,452 --> 00:45:18,653

to Junior Kimbrough
a couple years back.

One girl come in here, appear
to be to me a half local.

881

I don't recollect two come
in here any time recent.

882
00:46:26,788 --> 00:46:28,723

But why would these people
just be waiting there

888
00:46:45,273 --> 00:46:46,708
in the drive-away office?

889
00:46:46,741 --> 00:46:47,910
Well, clearly, this was not

890
00:46:47,943 --> 00:46:49,644
your garden-variety
decapitation.

891
00:46:49,677 --> 00:46:51,245
This was some kind of a...

00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:53,181
Well, I don't know what it was,

893
00:46:53,214 --> 00:46:55,750
but they know we
have their stuff.

894
00:46:55,783 --> 00:46:57,185
Yeah?

895
00:46:57,218 --> 00:46:59,654
Look, Marian, they
can't find us.

896
00:46:59,687 --> 00:47:02,390
Maybe they're waiting
for us to find them.

897
00:47:02,423 --> 00:47:04,359
That's the only place
we'd know to call.

898
00:47:04,392 --> 00:47:07,328
But why would we get
in touch with them?

899
00:47:07,362 --> 00:47:09,364
Sell it back, shake 'em down.

900
00:47:09,397 --> 00:47:11,900
Which, incidentally,
is not such a bad idea.

901
00:47:11,934 --> 00:47:13,368
Jamie.

902
00:47:13,401 --> 00:47:14,937
Look, I didn't invent extortion.

903
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:17,171
But, Jamie, why would
Susanne help us?

904
00:47:17,205 --> 00:47:18,473
She hates you.

905
00:47:18,506 --> 00:47:21,509
Oh, she's had two
days to cool off.

906
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:23,678
Get the fuck back
in that lockup.

907
00:47:24,612 --> 00:47:27,181
Officer Kracik said I
could speak to my attorney.

908
00:47:27,215 --> 00:47:29,517
Attorney? Are you a college boy?

909
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,787
Officer Kracik said I
could speak to my lawyer.

910
00:47:32,821 --> 00:47:34,923
Officer Kracik ain't
running booking.

911
00:47:34,957 --> 00:47:36,658
I'm running booking, jackass.

912
00:47:36,691 --> 00:47:38,793
- He said...
- You want me to walk over there

913
00:47:38,827 --> 00:47:40,461
and kick your number-running ass

914
00:47:40,495 --> 00:47:42,664
back into the Delaware
fucking River?

915
00:47:42,697 --> 00:47:45,533
Who's running booking?

916
00:47:45,566 --> 00:47:46,969
- You are.
- Who is?

917
00:47:47,002 --> 00:47:49,270
- You are.
- No fucking shit!

918
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:50,806
- Shink!
- Yeah.

919
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,573
Telephone.

920
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:54,910
Sergeant Shinkleman.

921
00:47:54,943 --> 00:47:56,879
Hey. It's me.

922
00:47:56,912 --> 00:47:58,613
Oh, what a lovely surprise.

923
00:47:58,646 --> 00:48:00,883
Sukie, come on, now.
Let's be friends. I...

924
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:03,484
- Did the two creeps find you?
- What?

925
00:48:03,518 --> 00:48:04,987
The two weirdos looking for you.

926
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,688
I tried to be helpful.

927
00:48:07,588 --> 00:48:09,724
- Uh, but who were they?
- How should I know?

928
00:48:09,757 --> 00:48:11,492
Bill collectors,
herpes patients.

929
00:48:11,526 --> 00:48:13,394
Two more people you
fucked over somehow.

930
00:48:13,428 --> 00:48:16,297
- George and Lennie.
- George and Lennie?

931
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:19,968
<i>Of Mice and Men.</i> Have
you read any books?

932
00:48:20,002 --> 00:48:21,703
Books, maybe not, but, sweetie,

933
00:48:21,736 --> 00:48:23,571
I'm gonna help you
break a big murder case.

934
00:48:23,604 --> 00:48:25,974
"Break a big murder case"?

935
00:48:26,008 --> 00:48:28,844
Just go over to
Curlie's Drive-Away.

936
00:48:28,877 --> 00:48:30,678
- Curlie's Drive-Away?
- Yeah.

937
00:48:30,712 --> 00:48:33,481
And you ask Curlie about...

938
00:48:33,514 --> 00:48:35,818
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Turn that down!

939
00:48:37,052 --> 00:48:38,854
Ask him about the what
in the attaché case?

940
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:41,389
You should see what they
got locked up in that thing.

941
00:48:41,422 --> 00:48:42,724
Jamie, that is about

942
00:48:42,757 --> 00:48:45,593
the dumbest thing I've
ever heard, and I'm a cop.

943
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:47,738
Why would I make it up? Just
go to Curlie's Drive-Away.

944
00:48:47,762 --> 00:48:49,263
I guarantee you someone's there.

945
00:48:49,297 --> 00:48:51,733
You guarantee? I'm
supposed to believe you?

946
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:54,268
Fine. You know what?
If no one's there,

947
00:48:54,302 --> 00:48:55,971
I'll take Alice.

948
00:48:56,004 --> 00:48:57,638
Really? Swear?

949
00:48:57,672 --> 00:49:00,008
Yes, I swear. I pussy-promise.
I will take the dog.

950
00:49:00,042 --> 00:49:02,643
You'll never have to
deal with her again.

951
00:49:03,544 --> 00:49:05,713
A juke joint where?

952
00:49:05,747 --> 00:49:07,749
Wetumpka, Alabama.

953
00:49:07,782 --> 00:49:09,484
Well, outside of Wetumpka.

954
00:49:09,517 --> 00:49:10,651
They hadn't been there,

955
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:14,022
but a very personable
music lover

956
00:49:14,056 --> 00:49:15,891
told us of another juke joint

957
00:49:15,924 --> 00:49:17,692
- fairly close by called...
- You see?

958
00:49:17,725 --> 00:49:18,827
Stop!

959
00:49:18,861 --> 00:49:20,695
Called Ike's.

960
00:49:21,529 --> 00:49:23,698
Maybe he said "Mike's."

961
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:25,333
Maybe he said "Mike."

962
00:49:25,366 --> 00:49:27,468
Uh, "Mike" or... But whatever.

963
00:49:27,502 --> 00:49:29,370
I think the soccer
team was just confused

964
00:49:29,403 --> 00:49:31,372
about which joint these
girls were going to,

965
00:49:31,405 --> 00:49:32,841
so we're gonna drive...

966
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,576
Stop saying words.

967
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,312
One of the girls finally
used a credit card.

968
00:49:38,346 --> 00:49:39,781
They arrived in Tallahassee

969
00:49:39,815 --> 00:49:43,451
and checked into a hotel
called El Conquistador.

970
00:49:44,086 --> 00:49:45,486
Tallahassee.

971
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,065
I want you to get
your asses over there

972
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:49,390
and take care of it right away.

973
00:49:49,423 --> 00:49:50,926
Not a juke joint.

974
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:52,460
You should arrive
by early morning.

975
00:49:52,493 --> 00:49:53,561
I'll meet you there.

976
00:49:53,594 --> 00:49:55,797
Uh, I'll level with you, Chief.

977
00:49:55,831 --> 00:49:57,765
Flint and me could
use a little shut-eye.

978
00:49:57,799 --> 00:49:59,868
We have not slept since
the night before last,

979
00:49:59,902 --> 00:50:01,804
and we...

980
00:50:01,837 --> 00:50:03,504
Hello?

981
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:06,842
- Chief?
- Who's in Tallahassee?

982
00:50:07,843 --> 00:50:09,410
Certainly.

983
00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:11,355
There are a number of places
I can recommend locally,

984
00:50:11,379 --> 00:50:12,680
or right here at the hotel,

985
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:15,349
we have Espadrilles
for casual dining,

986
00:50:15,383 --> 00:50:16,819
or we have Baxter's by the Pool,

987
00:50:16,852 --> 00:50:19,888
which is our more elegant
venue down in the lower level.

988
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:22,423
Maybe we should stay here.

989
00:50:22,456 --> 00:50:23,892
Replenish the ice.

990
00:50:28,496 --> 00:50:30,531
This is great, but how...

991
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:32,901
Ladies, are we enjoying
a beverage this evening?

992
00:50:34,468 --> 00:50:36,604
Rainbow.

993
00:50:36,637 --> 00:50:37,505
Yes.

994
00:50:37,538 --> 00:50:40,075
Uh, can we get some
champagne, please?

995
00:50:40,108 --> 00:50:41,844
Like, a really, really good one?

996
00:50:41,877 --> 00:50:42,945
Of course.

997
00:50:44,046 --> 00:50:46,982
Won't you have to pay for
the card at some point?

998
00:50:47,015 --> 00:50:48,649
Theoretically.

999
00:50:56,892 --> 00:50:58,426
So...

1000
00:51:00,128 --> 00:51:03,631
I've been thinking about it, and

1001
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,469
finally dawned on me that you
are not the kind of person

1002
00:51:08,502 --> 00:51:11,874
that a girl brings to a
roadside motel for a quickie.

1003
00:51:12,773 --> 00:51:14,775
Now, I have heard of
the more soulful sex

1004
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:17,778
where you have a nice dinner
and conversation first

1005
00:51:17,813 --> 00:51:19,915
so it all comes out
of someplace deeper,

1006
00:51:19,948 --> 00:51:22,818
but I usually have stuff to do.

1007
00:51:23,784 --> 00:51:25,453
Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque '95.

1008
00:51:25,486 --> 00:51:27,990
You mean you want
to sleep with me?

1009
00:51:28,924 --> 00:51:32,493
Marian, you have got to
have a good, steamy fuck.

1010
00:51:32,526 --> 00:51:34,528
Something I decided

1011
00:51:34,562 --> 00:51:35,907
last night while
I was lying in bed

1012
00:51:35,931 --> 00:51:38,901
before I started
masturbating, and I figure,

1013
00:51:38,934 --> 00:51:43,138
it's important to me, I
should take care of it myself.

1014
00:51:43,171 --> 00:51:44,705
Especially since, with you,

1015
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:46,774
it's got to be with
somebody who cares for you.

1016
00:51:46,808 --> 00:51:47,943
Am I right?

1017
00:51:49,077 --> 00:51:51,445
Can't just be a finger
jiggling your clit and adios.

1018
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:54,715
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Madame?

1019
00:51:54,749 --> 00:51:55,918
Yes, please.

1020
00:51:55,951 --> 00:51:58,053
But is it a good idea
for us to have sex?

1021
00:51:58,086 --> 00:51:59,720
I mean, we're good friends,

1022
00:51:59,754 --> 00:52:01,722
and maybe it's not supposed
to be more than that.

1023
00:52:01,756 --> 00:52:03,191
Maybe we shouldn't
risk ruining it.

1024
00:52:03,225 --> 00:52:06,761
Look, you can always find
reasons to not have sex,

1025
00:52:06,794 --> 00:52:09,730
and if you think about
them too much, guess what.

1026
00:52:09,764 --> 00:52:11,934
- You never have sex.
- Exactly.

1027
00:52:11,967 --> 00:52:13,869
Like my high school
guidance counselor.

1028
00:52:13,902 --> 00:52:16,570
She was always saying
that this or that

1029
00:52:16,604 --> 00:52:18,240
- would be inappropriate.
- Uh-huh.

1030
00:52:18,273 --> 00:52:21,910
But when I finally
got her to relax,

1031
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:23,611
the sex was great.

1032
00:52:23,644 --> 00:52:25,579
Ladies, have we decided?

1033
00:52:27,715 --> 00:52:29,885
Don't rush us, buddy.

1034
00:52:30,852 --> 00:52:33,855
First, we'll dance.

1035
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,870
Maybe I do overthink things.

1036
00:52:50,072 --> 00:52:51,706
Yeah.

1037
00:52:52,606 --> 00:52:55,743
Got to keep that brain
loose, let that mind fly.

1038
00:52:59,647 --> 00:53:02,884
There was this one time I
was with Debbie Augenblick.

1039
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:04,785
Ah, you know Debbie.

1040
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,855
She's got this humongous
dildo she's got mounted

1041
00:53:06,888 --> 00:53:08,857
on a Black & Decker
circular sander,

1042
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:11,792
and she had me going
like my brains were gonna

1043
00:53:11,827 --> 00:53:13,829
come out the top of
my freaking skull.

1044
00:53:13,862 --> 00:53:16,530
I mean, I came like the Grand
Burlington mother fuck...

1045
00:53:16,564 --> 00:53:21,736
♪ Watch the sunrise
from a tropic isle ♪

1046
00:53:23,305 --> 00:53:27,042
♪ Just remember, darling ♪

1047
00:53:27,075 --> 00:53:29,710
♪ All the while ♪

1048
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,517
♪ You belong to me... ♪

1049
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:10,038
One accomplishment.

1050
00:56:10,071 --> 00:56:12,773
Huh? Name me one.

1051
00:56:12,807 --> 00:56:15,310
At least I'm in the arena
dealing with people.

1052
00:56:15,343 --> 00:56:17,179
Those girls wound
you up like a top.

1053
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,116
Flint, have you
ever fucked a woman

1054
00:56:21,149 --> 00:56:22,783
on a creaky porch swing

1055
00:56:22,817 --> 00:56:24,495
on a warm summer evening...
crickets, so forth?

1056
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:27,788
I mean, just fucked her
like there's no tomorrow,

1057
00:56:27,822 --> 00:56:29,457
trousers around your ankles,

1058
00:56:29,491 --> 00:56:31,993
belt jangling, yelling
to beat the band,

1059
00:56:32,027 --> 00:56:34,795
slamming away like a
Cincinnati jackhammer.

1060
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:36,797
Yes, people might stroll by

1061
00:56:36,831 --> 00:56:38,271
and see you looking
foolish up there

1062
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,800
slapping ham on the veranda,

1063
00:56:39,834 --> 00:56:42,804
but that is the price
you pay for interaction.

1064
00:56:42,837 --> 00:56:45,407
If this is too messy for
you, then you will spend

1065
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,943
the rest of your
miserable fucking life

1066
00:56:47,976 --> 00:56:50,979
just hitting people and then
pulling your measly little pud.

1067
00:56:51,012 --> 00:56:52,480
Can't wait to tell the chief.

1068
00:56:52,514 --> 00:56:54,782
Yeah, and why don't
you also tell him

1069
00:56:54,816 --> 00:56:56,484
that you're a social
fucking imbecile

1070
00:56:56,518 --> 00:56:58,253
that I've been
carrying on my back

1071
00:56:58,286 --> 00:57:00,721
all the way from Philadelphia!

1072
00:57:18,807 --> 00:57:20,342
Help.

1073
00:57:29,284 --> 00:57:30,919
"Big case."

1074
00:57:31,553 --> 00:57:33,255
That woman.

1075
00:57:36,891 --> 00:57:39,494
Won't anybody save Curlie?

1076
00:58:00,448 --> 00:58:02,284
Wake me in Tallahassee.

1077
00:58:02,317 --> 00:58:04,052
Yes, sir.

1078
00:59:24,933 --> 00:59:27,969
Honey, we eating soon?

1079
00:59:28,002 --> 00:59:29,904
Okay.

1080
00:59:31,673 --> 00:59:34,075
Oh. All right.

1081
01:00:05,707 --> 01:00:07,675
Jamie?

1082
01:00:07,709 --> 01:00:12,914
Waited for you as
long as I could.

1083
01:00:14,682 --> 01:00:16,918
Jamie, no!

1084
01:00:25,226 --> 01:00:26,461
Jamie, why?

1085
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:34,169
Oh, my God.

1086
01:00:34,202 --> 01:00:35,503
Marian.

1087
01:00:36,571 --> 01:00:38,373
Sir?

1088
01:00:38,406 --> 01:00:40,074
- Sir.
- Hmm?

1089
01:00:41,309 --> 01:00:43,077
Tallahassee, sir.

1090
01:00:43,111 --> 01:00:45,680
Where to, exactly?

1091
01:00:45,713 --> 01:00:48,082
Yes, um...

1092
01:00:48,683 --> 01:00:49,984
The track.

1093
01:00:50,018 --> 01:00:52,053
Dog track? Yes, sir.

1094
01:00:52,086 --> 01:00:53,688
Those penises are
trouble, Jamie.

1095
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:55,256
Oh, come on now.

1096
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:58,126
I thought you were
gonna loosen up.

1097
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:00,061
You gonna work your way
through all of them?

1098
01:01:00,094 --> 01:01:02,363
No. I like this one.

1099
01:01:03,798 --> 01:01:05,733
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

1100
01:01:05,767 --> 01:01:07,202
Last night was beautiful,

1101
01:01:07,235 --> 01:01:09,170
but you fell asleep and
I didn't get my turn

1102
01:01:09,204 --> 01:01:11,081
on the water slide, if
you know what I'm saying.

1103
01:01:11,105 --> 01:01:12,750
Okay! -All right!

1104
01:01:12,774 --> 01:01:15,443
Everyone, relax. Stay calm.

1105
01:01:15,477 --> 01:01:17,212
We're here for two things.

1106
01:01:18,513 --> 01:01:20,024
Careful with that thing,
you fucking moron!

1107
01:01:20,048 --> 01:01:21,282
Screw you!

1108
01:01:21,316 --> 01:01:23,751
We're here for two items.

1109
01:01:23,785 --> 01:01:25,253
Whoa. She's naked.

1110
01:01:25,286 --> 01:01:27,489
All right, no big deal.
Just a naked lady.

1111
01:01:27,522 --> 01:01:29,123
We're here for two items.

1112
01:01:29,157 --> 01:01:31,192
Yes, this. Please and thank you.

1113
01:01:31,226 --> 01:01:33,294
- And the head box.
- Head box!

1114
01:01:33,328 --> 01:01:35,296
Fuck you! Don't you
fucking lecture me!

1115
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:37,208
All right, ladies. No need
to panic. One more time.

1116
01:01:37,232 --> 01:01:39,200
Please and thank you.
We're all friends here.

1117
01:01:39,234 --> 01:01:41,736
Two items. Don't panic. Okay.

1118
01:01:41,769 --> 01:01:44,105
Let's get this show on the road.

1119
01:01:45,707 --> 01:01:48,042
Yeah, baby.

1120
01:01:48,076 --> 01:01:52,580
You're such a big, bouncy,

1121
01:01:52,614 --> 01:01:56,284
beautiful baby.

1122
01:01:56,317 --> 01:01:59,387
Love doesn't have to die, baby.

1123
01:02:00,688 --> 01:02:02,490
Whoa.

1124
01:02:02,524 --> 01:02:05,093
This is so groovy.

1125
01:02:05,126 --> 01:02:07,795
Now I can love you forever.

1126
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:09,531
Whoa.

1127
01:02:09,564 --> 01:02:11,733
And ever

1128
01:02:11,766 --> 01:02:15,537
and ever and ever

1129
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:20,608
- and ever and ever.
- And ever and ever.

1130
01:02:20,642 --> 01:02:25,179
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1131
01:02:25,213 --> 01:02:29,284
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1132
01:02:29,317 --> 01:02:33,822
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1133
01:02:33,856 --> 01:02:38,226
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1134
01:02:38,259 --> 01:02:41,830
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1135
01:02:41,864 --> 01:02:45,567
Never to wilt...

1136
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:50,806
Took 'em straight here.

1137
01:02:50,839 --> 01:02:52,273
Haven't debriefed 'em, Chief.

1138
01:02:52,307 --> 01:02:54,375
Figured you want
to do the talking.

1139
01:02:57,846 --> 01:02:59,581
This is all they had?

1140
01:02:59,614 --> 01:03:01,382
What's all they had?

1141
01:03:02,483 --> 01:03:06,889
Ladies, you're a day
late and a dick short.

1142
01:03:06,922 --> 01:03:09,157
What are you talking about?

1143
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,326
The senator's penis
is not in the case!

1144
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,728
- Not in the...
- Well, that just figures.

1145
01:03:13,761 --> 01:03:15,630
Come on, girls.

1146
01:03:15,663 --> 01:03:17,265
Where's the last phallus?

1147
01:03:20,435 --> 01:03:22,637
You didn't check the
case before you left?

1148
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:24,339
I-I...

1149
01:03:24,372 --> 01:03:26,317
He's been stepping on his dick
the whole way down, Chief.

1150
01:03:26,341 --> 01:03:28,209
What have you done, jerk-off?

1151
01:03:28,242 --> 01:03:30,144
I got the Spanish
guy's head, Einstein!

1152
01:03:30,178 --> 01:03:31,479
They gave you the combination,

1153
01:03:31,512 --> 01:03:33,481
and it still took
you 15 minutes!

1154
01:03:33,514 --> 01:03:35,259
- I never slip up.
- Right, left,

1155
01:03:35,283 --> 01:03:37,151
past the first number.

1156
01:03:49,397 --> 01:03:53,434
The senator is a good man.

1157
01:03:54,335 --> 01:03:57,238
He smoked marijuana
once in college.

1158
01:03:57,271 --> 01:03:58,539
Many of us did.

1159
01:03:58,573 --> 01:04:00,909
It was a different time.

1160
01:04:00,943 --> 01:04:04,212
He went to a party and
met a hippie chick,

1161
01:04:04,245 --> 01:04:06,681
Tiffany Plaster Caster.

1162
01:04:12,754 --> 01:04:13,956
Housekeeping.

1163
01:04:15,958 --> 01:04:20,428
She took a plaster
cast of his excited

1164
01:04:21,964 --> 01:04:23,464
thing.

1165
01:04:25,433 --> 01:04:28,670
She made one model of
each of her "old men."

1166
01:04:31,439 --> 01:04:33,809
At the time, the senator
didn't know that someday

1167
01:04:33,842 --> 01:04:37,211
he'd be called on to serve
his community, his state,

1168
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:39,714
and perhaps someday, his nation.

1169
01:04:41,716 --> 01:04:42,918
He was just a kid.

1170
01:04:46,387 --> 01:04:50,391
His penis passed
from hand to hand.

1171
01:04:50,425 --> 01:04:52,460
Finally ended up with an
international collector

1172
01:04:52,493 --> 01:04:55,396
named Alejandro
Santos y Obrador.

1173
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:58,766
You saw him, sort of.

1174
01:05:13,681 --> 01:05:16,885
This penis cannot become
a piece of merchandise.

1175
01:05:16,919 --> 01:05:19,620
Think of it: eBay,

1176
01:05:19,654 --> 01:05:23,859
"Senator Gary Channel's
ding-dong, lightly used."

1177
01:05:23,892 --> 01:05:26,427
Comments, reviews.

1178
01:05:26,461 --> 01:05:28,897
Think of what it
would do to him.

1179
01:05:28,931 --> 01:05:33,301
His children, his
family, his career.

1180
01:05:35,904 --> 01:05:39,007
We're not unreasonable.

1181
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:41,743
We'll gladly pay for it.

1182
01:05:41,776 --> 01:05:43,011
We just...

1183
01:05:43,045 --> 01:05:44,980
Will you please shut up!

1184
01:05:45,013 --> 01:05:46,314
That wasn't my idea!

1185
01:05:46,347 --> 01:05:47,850
I was just trying
to keep us awake.

1186
01:05:47,883 --> 01:05:48,917
I was experimenting.

1187
01:05:48,951 --> 01:05:50,351
But you liked it.

1188
01:05:50,384 --> 01:05:51,662
- No, I didn't!
- I could tell.

1189
01:05:51,686 --> 01:05:53,363
Hey, it was the Irish
coffee. I was drunk!

1190
01:05:53,387 --> 01:05:54,655
Drunk on cock.

1191
01:05:54,689 --> 01:05:56,333
- No! I didn't.
- It's not my thing.

1192
01:05:56,357 --> 01:05:58,060
I was just trying to
help you be a man.

1193
01:05:58,093 --> 01:05:59,995
- To understand life.
- No!

1194
01:06:00,028 --> 01:06:02,663
- The stuff of life!
- No, no, no!

1195
01:06:05,399 --> 01:06:08,302
God, man, what are you doing?!

1196
01:06:41,103 --> 01:06:42,737
Mommy.

1197
01:07:04,659 --> 01:07:06,436
All right, we have to
get back to the hotel

1198
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:07,830
and grab the penis
out of the bed.

1199
01:07:07,863 --> 01:07:09,430
Then we switch hotels.

1200
01:07:09,463 --> 01:07:11,142
You grab the penis. I'll
meet you at the hotel.

1201
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:12,667
Okay. The La Lanterna.

1202
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,970
I'll check in under
the name Abzug.

1203
01:07:15,003 --> 01:07:17,438
- Where are you going?
- Art store.

1204
01:07:24,545 --> 01:07:26,647
Next customer, please.

1205
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:29,684
Shinkleman. Going
to Tallahassee.

1206
01:07:29,717 --> 01:07:31,086
Don't ask me why.

1207
01:07:34,156 --> 01:07:35,723
Committee to Reelect.

1208
01:07:35,756 --> 01:07:37,625
I need to speak
to the senator.

1209
01:07:37,658 --> 01:07:41,063
Well, who should
I say is calling?

1210
01:07:41,096 --> 01:07:43,598
Someone who has his

1211
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,368
personal effects.

1212
01:08:18,233 --> 01:08:20,701
Who is this?

1213
01:08:20,735 --> 01:08:21,970
Senator?

1214
01:08:22,004 --> 01:08:24,505
Yes. Who is this?

1215
01:08:24,538 --> 01:08:27,575
Somebody who wants
a million dollars.

1216
01:08:27,608 --> 01:08:30,913
If you can get it by tonight,
you can have your thing back.

1217
01:08:30,946 --> 01:08:32,613
Everybody's things.

1218
01:08:32,647 --> 01:08:35,217
I'll tell you where to
bring the money. Come alone.

1219
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:37,451
If you're not alone,

1220
01:08:37,485 --> 01:08:39,487
believe me, I'll know it.

1221
01:08:48,897 --> 01:08:50,232
Someone named Jamie Dobbs

1222
01:08:50,265 --> 01:08:52,167
made a phone call
from here last night.

1223
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,601
Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

1224
01:08:55,103 --> 01:08:56,939
Well, this is for her.

1225
01:08:56,972 --> 01:08:58,073
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

1226
01:08:58,106 --> 01:08:59,674
You've missed them.

1227
01:08:59,707 --> 01:09:02,576
Um, her-her friend
just checked them out.

1228
01:09:22,264 --> 01:09:23,999
Done.

1229
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,102
With what?

1230
01:09:27,135 --> 01:09:29,503
Tell you later.
I'm gonna clean up.

1231
01:09:30,172 --> 01:09:31,974
Want to join me?

1232
01:10:01,169 --> 01:10:02,838
Jamie.

1233
01:10:04,906 --> 01:10:06,741
I want...

1234
01:10:06,774 --> 01:10:08,076
Uh-huh?

1235
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:11,146
I... I-I want...

1236
01:10:11,179 --> 01:10:13,781
What do you want, sugar sweet?

1237
01:10:15,783 --> 01:10:18,186
I want to make love with
the senator's penis.

1291
01:14:25,867 --> 01:14:27,511
they put us in the
back of a Toyota Tercel

1292
01:14:27,535 --> 01:14:29,175
and took us to the dog
track, and I'm sure

01:14:29,204 --> 01:14:31,072
they were gonna kill
us, but lucky for us,

1294
01:14:31,106 --> 01:14:32,907
they had left the most
important penis behind.

1295
01:14:32,941 --> 01:14:36,177
Well, you've had a full day.

1296

01:16:06,634 --> 01:16:10,171
You know, hers and hers.

1321
01:16:13,608 --> 01:16:15,210

1322

- Uh-huh.

1324
01:16:19,547 --> 01:16:20,982

1325

She's very religious.
