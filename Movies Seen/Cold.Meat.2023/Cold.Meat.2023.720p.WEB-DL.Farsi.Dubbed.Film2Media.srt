1
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:59,303
<i>When I was a child,
my mother told me that</i>

2
00:00:59,403 --> 00:01:02,372
<i>humans are capable
of the best and the worst.</i>

3
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:05,309
She was wrong.

4
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:08,111
Some are
only capable of the worst.

5
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:17,321
<i>The natives have a legend
about those people:</i>

6
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:20,457
<i>a legend as old as the mountains
of this region.</i>

7
00:01:24,194 --> 00:01:26,463
<i>They say that in time of famine,</i>

8
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:29,466
<i>an evil spirit comes out
of the woods to possess</i>

9
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:32,870
<i>those who had cannibalised
the flesh of their peers.</i>

10
00:01:35,372 --> 00:01:38,141
<i>It appears first in the dreams,</i>

11
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:40,143
<i>but it's already
too late for them.</i>

12
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,052
<i>They're damned,
condemned to become like it:</i>

13
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:51,421
<i>a wandering soul seeking
human flesh.</i>

14
00:01:51,522 --> 00:01:55,994
<i>Always insatiable.
Never satisfied.</i>

15
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,879
<i>Our top story this hour is
still the weather outside</i>

16
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:50,615
<i>being not just frightful,
but downright deadly.</i>

17
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:53,483
<i>50 below zero range,
temperatures below minus 20,</i>

18
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:55,185
<i>and whether you're being
naughty or nice,</i>

19
00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:58,255
<i>frostbite and hypothermia
are all on the list.</i>

20
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:00,257
<i>With no relief sight
until Friday,</i>

21
00:03:00,357 --> 00:03:02,927
<i>even Santa Claus may not be
coming to town.</i>

More coffee, John?

41
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:37,522
- Ah, you bet.
- No good today?

42
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:39,533
Yeah. Looks like he bit
off more than he can chew.

43
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:40,901
I'm actually watching my weight
right now.

44
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:42,392
- I'm on a diet.
- Really?

45
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,762
It's cold out there.
You gotta build up your energy.

46
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:46,339
If you wanna drive that
snowplough one day

47
00:04:46,363 --> 00:04:48,199
like your old man,
you'd better eat up.

48
00:04:48,298 --> 00:04:50,367
I don't wanna drive a
snowplough. It's boring.

49
00:04:50,467 --> 00:04:52,335
What do you wanna
be when you grow up?

50
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:54,005
Something around
video games, I guess.

51
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:54,772
Hmm.

52
00:04:54,872 --> 00:04:56,908
Video games. Kids.

53
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,408
I'll get a doggy bag.

54
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:00,244
What's so wrong
with video games?

55
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,079
You can't raise a family
on video games.

56
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,782
Billy. Billy!

57
00:05:06,184 --> 00:05:07,417
Wrap this to go, will ya?

58
00:05:07,518 --> 00:05:09,398
- It's already done.
- You can leave after that.

59
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:32,610
- Pleasure as ever.
- See you after the storm.

60
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,078
Yeah. Thanks Ana.

61
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:34,679
Be careful.
It's slippery out there!

62
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:36,047
See you after the storm.

63
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:48,092
What can I get you?

64
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:49,503
I could kill
for a hot cup of coffee.

65
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:50,728
I can fix that.

66
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:53,430
And a rare steak and some
potatoes would be perfect.

67
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:56,499
Sorry, the cook just left
because of the incoming storm.

68
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:59,303
I can get you a piece of
our world famous cherry pie.

69
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:00,171
World famous, huh?

70
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:01,572
Well, some people's worlds

71
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:04,041
are a lot smaller than others,
right?

72
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,345
Look, if I can have a hot
coffee to go

73
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:09,547
and a slice of that pie,
I'll be on my way.

74
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:22,026
Here you go.

75
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:24,729
- Thank you.
- And careful, the coffee's hot.

76
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:28,799
The sugar's right
there if you need any.

77
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,034
Thanks.

78
00:06:33,804 --> 00:06:35,039
Oh shit.

79
00:06:40,044 --> 00:06:41,078
Ana!

80
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:46,416
You fucking bitch.

81
00:06:46,517 --> 00:06:47,561
Can't you read? It's closed.

82
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:48,629
Why are you dodging my calls?

83
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:49,763
Because
I have nothing to say to you

84
00:06:49,787 --> 00:06:51,707
and you have nothing to say
to me I want to hear.

85
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,700
Now get the hell out of here
before I call the cops.

86
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:55,259
Hey. I wanna see my daughter.

87
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:59,163
Our daughter! And she doesn't
want see you. She hates you.

88
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:00,331
Yeah.

89
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,608
Yeah,
because of all the bullshit

90
00:07:01,632 --> 00:07:02,943
- you keep feeding her about me.
- No!

91
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:06,270
No, because of this!
This is who she sees now!

92
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,672
A drunk fuck!

93
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:10,408
Listen, you and that
asshole judge can't stop me

94
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:13,277
from seeing her,
you hear me? Do you hear me?

95
00:07:13,377 --> 00:07:14,477
You do one stupid thing

96
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:16,314
and your ass is going straight
back to jail.

97
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:17,574
Now get the hell out of here!

98
00:07:17,615 --> 00:07:19,717
I'm not done talking to you.
I am not done talking!

99
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:21,519
Though I wish you were.

100
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:29,827
I'm sorry, what did you say?

101
00:07:32,263 --> 00:07:33,463
Say it again.

102
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:41,939
Well, come on pal.
Say it again.

103
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:18,809
Eat it.

104
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:30,054
- Vince, please...
- Shut up!

105
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,132
Eat it.

106
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:47,104
I get it.
You're angry.

107
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,443
I heard that a judge won't let
you see your daughter anymore,

108
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:55,246
probably because of the
excessive alcohol,

109
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:56,447
substance abuse,

110
00:08:56,547 --> 00:09:00,451
which also explains how easily
you just grabbed Ana there.

111
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:02,586
You guys knew each other.
You're fucking her.

112
00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:06,323
I'm just a customer, pal.
She has a name tag.

113
00:09:06,424 --> 00:09:09,126
Listen though, Vincent, right?

114
00:09:11,128 --> 00:09:13,564
The way I see it,
you have two options.

115
00:09:13,664 --> 00:09:15,099
Option one:

116
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:17,110
you'll notice there aren't
any surveillance cameras

117
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:20,505
in this place, but there's Ana
and there's me.

118
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:22,006
And if you touch either of us

119
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:24,442
with any semblance
of aggression again,

120
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:27,244
we'll have each other to say
that it was you.

121
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:30,281
And then you're looking at never
seeing your daughter again.

122
00:09:31,982 --> 00:09:35,419
Option two:
much better option, you'll see.

123
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,654
You leave here right now.

124
00:09:37,655 --> 00:09:40,624
You realise
you have the opportunity

125
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:43,994
to wake up in the morning sober

126
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:46,931
and start being the father
your daughter deserves.

127
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:51,570
And with time and a little
or lot of rehab,

128
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:53,337
you can go back
to that asshole judge

129
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:56,173
and convince him you deserve
to see your daughter.

130
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,710
That's all you have,
two choices.

131
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:02,146
So, the real question:

132
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:06,784
how much do you love
your daughter, Vincent?

133
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:23,334
You're lucky
I'm in a good mood tonight.

134
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:29,173
I'll be seeing you again.

135
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:39,016
Vince... Sober up
and we'll talk. I promise.

136
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,148
I'm sorry about that.

137
00:11:11,248 --> 00:11:12,248
Don't be sorry.

138
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:16,220
Okay, thanks.

139
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:20,291
You know he wasn't
always like that.

140
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:23,294
You know, he was a good person
when I married him.

141
00:11:23,394 --> 00:11:25,262
It's hard to believe, I know.

142
00:11:25,362 --> 00:11:27,998
He got fired and then
started to drink.

143
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:31,636
Or maybe it
was the other way around.

144
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:34,838
Anyway, it's gotten worse
and worse since.

145
00:11:35,873 --> 00:11:38,475
Well, they say you only
really know

146
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:40,878
someone when
they become your enemy.

147
00:11:40,978 --> 00:11:43,914
Yeah. You married?

148
00:11:44,014 --> 00:11:46,317
Yeah.

149
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:47,418
I'm David, by the way.

150
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,053
- Ana.
- Yeah.

151
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:52,122
Guess you're
not gonna finish that.

152
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:53,724
World famous cherry pie, right?

153
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:55,859
Yeah.

154
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:03,100
How would you like your steak?

155
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:06,937
Err... Rare.

156
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:38,329
Hi.

157
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:43,601
I'll take the cookie, err,
$20 on pump two and 20'

158
00:13:43,702 --> 00:13:46,070
you know, 40 Holmes Menthol.

159
00:13:47,505 --> 00:13:49,574
$54.

160
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:50,817
Yeah, I'm a couple
of bucks short.

161
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:52,577
Err, I'll leave
the cookies, thanks.

162
00:13:52,677 --> 00:13:53,877
We take credit cards.

163
00:13:55,012 --> 00:13:56,692
I... I just remembered
that my wife has it,

164
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:58,248
which is never a good thing.

165
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:12,463
Yeah.

166
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:17,868
Shit.

167
00:14:27,746 --> 00:14:29,155
- Do you want something?
- No thanks.

168
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:30,539
I don't know how
you can that shit.

169
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:31,649
What can I say?

170
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,484
Since I quit smoking,
I compensate.

171
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,679
- Officer.
- Sir, that needs to be fixed.

172
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,056
You can't drive
with that taped up.

173
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,415
Yeah, I know.
You're right.

174
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:07,017
As soon as I get to a garage,
it'll be fixed, I promise.

175
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:13,323
Drive safely, Sir.

176
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:22,052
Fucking shit!

177
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:52,610
Oh shit.

178
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:00,484
Come on!

179
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:05,489
Fuck!

180
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:18,903
Shit!

181
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:21,506
Ah!

182
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:33,985
Come on!

183
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:35,553
Fuck!

184
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:49,733
Ah!

185
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:51,936
Come on!

186
00:19:54,806 --> 00:19:56,641
Ah!

187
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:58,275
Ah.

188
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,474
Oh shit.

189
00:22:32,897 --> 00:22:34,364
God damn.

190
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:33,050
Don't go anywhere.

191
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:37,081
Help!

192
00:26:22,593 --> 00:26:23,861
Fuck.

193
00:30:32,744 --> 00:30:34,211
Ah!

194
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:39,617
Ah!

195
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,716
One wrong move
and I'll slit your throat.

196
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,719
I should kill you right now.

197
00:36:50,353 --> 00:36:53,323
- Is that my hat?
- You speak once spoken to!

198
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:58,896
Now, I have some questions,
and you answer them and maybe...

199
00:36:58,996 --> 00:37:01,799
maybe I'll keep you alive
long enough for the police

200
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:02,900
to take you.

201
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:05,636
Where are we?

202
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,107
I have no idea.

203
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:11,274
I got lost in the storm.

204
00:37:11,374 --> 00:37:12,944
Somewhere in the
Black Mountains.

205
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:16,581
Where's my phone?

206
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:18,281
Tossed it.

207
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:20,450
- And yours?
- In my pocket.

208
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:22,295
If you untie me a little,
I can get it out for you

209
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:24,655
- if you'd like.
- Do I look fucking stupid?

210
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:36,768
As nice as that feels,
inside pocket.

211
00:37:41,438 --> 00:37:42,940
You fuck with me?

212
00:37:51,115 --> 00:37:52,784
Pin code.

213
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:53,985
It's a dead zone.

214
00:37:55,352 --> 00:37:57,021
4-5-5-6.

215
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,895
Oh shit.

216
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:05,462
Sucks, doesn't it?

217
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:08,599
You can never trust the coverage
maps in those commercials.

218
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:12,904
I'm surprised the cold
didn't kill you back there.

219
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:14,304
You're a tough one.

220
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:17,675
My mom must have noticed.

221
00:38:17,775 --> 00:38:19,476
I'm not back yet.

222
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:22,113
She's probably already
called the cops.

223
00:38:22,213 --> 00:38:25,283
Well,
she thinks you're with Vince

224
00:38:25,382 --> 00:38:26,818
- trying to patch things up.
- What?

225
00:38:26,918 --> 00:38:29,319
I sent a little
message from your phone.

226
00:38:29,419 --> 00:38:30,588
I used your fingerprint.

227
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:33,624
You son of a bitch.

228
00:38:33,724 --> 00:38:36,194
You planned this all along, huh?

229
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:37,528
Almost all.

230
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:41,098
Is that a habit of yours
to kidnap women

231
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,667
and put them in your trunk?

232
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:46,369
Answer me!

233
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:50,413
I don't know what came over me.

234
00:38:51,642 --> 00:38:53,476
I've never done anything
like this before.

235
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:56,814
Someone driving around
with a hunter's knife,

236
00:38:56,914 --> 00:38:58,916
duct tape
and a bottle of chloroform

237
00:38:59,016 --> 00:39:00,218
looks pretty prepared to me.

238
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:01,953
Common misconception.

239
00:39:02,053 --> 00:39:03,788
Everybody thinks chloroform.

240
00:39:03,888 --> 00:39:06,200
I mean, people watch movies,
they read books and they think

241
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:07,304
chloroform's the way to go.

242
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,262
By people you mean
murderers like you?

243
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:13,097
Well, right now
I'm just a kidnapper.

244
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:16,133
I haven't murdered you, yet.

245
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:18,468
Ah!

246
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:20,972
Stop whining.
I barely touched you.

247
00:39:21,072 --> 00:39:23,074
- It's my leg.
- What's wrong with your leg?

248
00:39:23,174 --> 00:39:24,675
It's fucked!

249
00:39:24,775 --> 00:39:26,844
Broken.
Bone's sticking out.

250
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:29,113
- Does it hurt?
- What the fuck do you think?

251
00:39:31,448 --> 00:39:33,284
Good.

252
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:34,919
I hope it gets worse.

253
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:41,626
I bet you didn't expect this
to be used against you, huh?

254
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:44,695
Pretty effective stuff,
I have to admit.

255
00:39:44,795 --> 00:39:45,795
What is it?

256
00:39:47,298 --> 00:39:48,666
You wanna know my trade secret?

257
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:49,800
Mm-hmm.

258
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:54,138
There are so many
options from desflurane

259
00:39:54,238 --> 00:39:56,807
to sevoflurane isoflurane.

260
00:39:56,908 --> 00:40:00,511
Basically, my recipe ends
in 'flurane', if that helps.

261
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:01,746
Keep that to yourself.

262
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:04,048
I'm sure the cops
will be thrilled to hear that.

263
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:10,688
I tried chloroform at the start.

264
00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:12,623
I thought
you never did this before.

265
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:17,460
But chloroform,

266
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:18,906
you can take up
to five minutes for someone

267
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,798
to pass out from inhaling
that shit.

268
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,035
Do you know
how long five minutes is?

269
00:40:26,504 --> 00:40:27,939
Five minutes.

270
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,841
And in that time, they...

271
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:34,779
they kick, they punch,
they grab...

272
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,516
tear at your hair,

273
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:41,018
and you have no control over
how much they're inhaling

274
00:40:41,118 --> 00:40:43,721
because it's all
based on their breathing.

275
00:40:43,821 --> 00:40:48,960
And if they're panicked they
breathe too deeply, too quickly,

276
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,061
you know what happens?

277
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:55,232
They die,
right there in your arms.

278
00:40:57,467 --> 00:40:58,803
Kind of takes the fun out of it.

279
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:01,739
So, no chloroform.

280
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,908
I like to keep control.

281
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:08,646
You're no longer in control,
asshole!

282
00:41:09,847 --> 00:41:10,991
A knife doesn't put you
in control

283
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:12,159
unless you're prepared
to use it.

284
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:13,250
Don't tempt me.

285
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:16,653
At least I'm free.

286
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:19,090
- Free? Really?
- Mmm.

287
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,059
You can choose between
dying slowly in here

288
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,427
or quickly outside.

289
00:41:23,527 --> 00:41:25,730
That's the only
freedom you have.

290
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:29,266
So, tell me, why the hell
are you still inside then?

291
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:36,207
Oh, I get it.

292
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:38,809
You've already tried.

293
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:47,752
I'm just imagining you escaping
from the trunk back there,

294
00:41:47,852 --> 00:41:50,488
getting outside
and then realising

295
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:51,589
there's nowhere to go

296
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:53,166
and you'd have to get back
into the car.

297
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,259
Oh, that's brutal!

298
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,829
It's just funny that you swapped
one cage for another.

299
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:02,500
Only this time the
shark's inside with you.

300
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,901
A shark with no teeth.

301
00:42:04,001 --> 00:42:05,136
Hmm.

302
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:11,242
So, what now?

303
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:14,278
What do you plan to do
with me, Annie Wilkes?

304
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:15,780
I don't give a shit about you.

305
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:19,650
As soon as things calm down,
I'll take my chances outside.

306
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,951
Oh, good luck then.

307
00:42:22,753 --> 00:42:24,955
How far do you think
you'll get in this blizzard?

308
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:25,956
500 yards?

309
00:42:26,057 --> 00:42:27,858
A mile?

310
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:29,960
It's minus four degrees outside.

311
00:42:30,061 --> 00:42:33,130
- I'll make it.
- No, you won't.

312
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,167
I climbed up that hill
and nearly died in ten minutes.

313
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:37,944
You're not equipped
to make it through this storm.

314
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:40,204
Even with my hat and my gloves.

315
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:44,075
Many factors can keep
you alive during the storm.

316
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:47,311
The body will work overtime
to protect its vitals,

317
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:48,813
the head and the organs.

318
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:50,981
It doesn't care
about extremities.

319
00:42:51,082 --> 00:42:53,918
So, I intend to walk away
from here with everything

320
00:42:54,018 --> 00:42:55,653
I have intact.

321
00:42:56,555 --> 00:42:57,955
On the other hand,

322
00:42:58,055 --> 00:43:01,025
many factors can
accelerate hypothermia:

323
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:04,161
body fat, age,
alcohol consumption,

324
00:43:04,261 --> 00:43:07,264
injury-sorry- and wetness.

325
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:10,501
Your clothes are soaked.

326
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:12,636
They'll freeze pretty fast.

327
00:43:13,572 --> 00:43:15,039
I'm not sure you'll make it.

328
00:43:16,307 --> 00:43:17,542
- Fuck me.
- Mmhmm.

329
00:43:17,641 --> 00:43:19,110
Waitress with a medical degree.

330
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,979
I don't need one.
I grew up in the cold.

331
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:26,250
Your best chance of survival
is to stay in here with me.

332
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,953
That'd be the smartest choice,
given the circumstances.

333
00:43:29,954 --> 00:43:31,789
- Trust me.
- Trust you?

334
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:37,529
You know, you and I
got off on the wrong foot.

335
00:43:37,628 --> 00:43:39,063
There's no 'you and I', asshole.

336
00:43:39,163 --> 00:43:40,798
Well,
whether you like it or not,

337
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:42,366
we're both in the same shit now.

338
00:43:42,466 --> 00:43:43,968
Not for long.

339
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:46,270
You know
what I'll do before I go.

340
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,972
I'll make damn sure that you are

341
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:50,808
attached and strapped
down to this chair,

342
00:43:50,908 --> 00:43:53,811
and then I'll leave the car
doors wide open

343
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:55,212
and with some luck,

344
00:43:55,312 --> 00:43:57,715
we'll find your frozen body
by the end of the winter.

345
00:43:57,815 --> 00:43:58,983
Unless of course

346
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,418
the wild animals have taken care
of you first.

347
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:17,268
How long have I been out?

348
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:18,368
Not long enough.

349
00:44:18,435 --> 00:44:20,104
Listen, if you wanna survive,

350
00:44:20,204 --> 00:44:23,140
we've got to start saving
on the fuel and on the battery.

351
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,784
We can only use the heat
for a couple of minutes

352
00:44:24,808 --> 00:44:26,810
every day or else
we won't last long.

353
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:28,212
I don't intend
to stay here long.

354
00:44:28,312 --> 00:44:29,789
You don't know if we have
to stay here two hours,

355
00:44:29,813 --> 00:44:31,282
two days or two weeks.

356
00:44:31,382 --> 00:44:33,618
We can survive without
food, but without heat.

357
00:44:33,717 --> 00:44:35,686
The cold's gonna kill
us in a couple of hours.

358
00:44:35,786 --> 00:44:37,321
Hypothermia, remember?

359
00:44:40,525 --> 00:44:41,892
Turn it off.

360
00:44:45,597 --> 00:44:46,997
Turn it off!

361
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:53,304
You move one muscle.

362
00:45:09,286 --> 00:45:11,355
You are not from around here,
are you?

363
00:45:11,455 --> 00:45:13,190
I like to travel.

364
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,259
David Herman Petersen.

365
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,794
That name.

366
00:45:16,894 --> 00:45:18,495
Is that your real name at least?

367
00:45:19,664 --> 00:45:21,098
It's not important.

368
00:45:21,198 --> 00:45:23,801
To me you're just
Fucked Up Motherfucker.

369
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:25,541
You don't mind if I call
you that, do you,

370
00:45:25,604 --> 00:45:28,038
Fucked Up Motherfucker?

371
00:45:33,744 --> 00:45:35,846
Seems like nobody
knows who you really are.

372
00:45:35,946 --> 00:45:37,649
I'm a shy guy.

373
00:45:37,748 --> 00:45:39,292
And I'm guessing you
don't have a kid either.

374
00:45:39,316 --> 00:45:41,118
Oh, you're a smart girl.

375
00:45:41,218 --> 00:45:42,963
That must be where Ella gets her
brain's from,

376
00:45:42,987 --> 00:45:45,055
'cause it ain't from Vince.

377
00:45:45,155 --> 00:45:46,500
How do you know
my daughter's name?

378
00:45:46,524 --> 00:45:50,094
Oh, I know a lot about you Ana,
and you know shit about me.

379
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:52,096
I know more than
enough about you.

380
00:45:53,264 --> 00:45:56,100
And don't you ever bring up
my daughter's name again.

381
00:46:13,752 --> 00:46:14,894
Those fucking seats
are expensive.

382
00:46:14,918 --> 00:46:16,186
You're gonna pay for that.

383
00:46:23,595 --> 00:46:24,595
What?

384
00:46:25,929 --> 00:46:26,830
My bonds are too tight.

385
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:28,667
They're cutting into my wrists.

386
00:46:28,767 --> 00:46:30,034
Don't worry about it.

387
00:46:30,134 --> 00:46:32,254
After a while, you won't even
feel your hands anymore.

388
00:46:40,512 --> 00:46:41,579
Why didn't you kill me?

389
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,517
I made up my own theory
back in the trunk.

390
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:47,818
Wanna hear it?

391
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:50,789
Superiority complex.

392
00:46:50,888 --> 00:46:52,056
You got sloppy.

393
00:46:52,156 --> 00:46:54,358
- I'm never sloppy.
- You were overconfident.

394
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:56,193
You still are.

395
00:46:56,293 --> 00:46:58,228
You should have killed
me when you could.

396
00:46:58,329 --> 00:47:00,898
If I wanted to just kill
you, you'd be dead by now.

397
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:03,967
You had other
plans for me, right?

398
00:47:06,671 --> 00:47:08,540
Sick motherfucker.

399
00:47:12,577 --> 00:47:13,911
Why didn't you kill me?

400
00:47:14,978 --> 00:47:16,847
It would've been so easy
when I was out cold.

401
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:18,849
Because I'm not like you.

402
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:20,284
I'm not a monster.

403
00:47:20,384 --> 00:47:22,219
Oh.

404
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,289
Oh, in the right circumstances,
we can all be cruel.

405
00:47:25,389 --> 00:47:26,890
Even you.

406
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:30,729
Imagine.

407
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:32,296
Just imagine.

408
00:47:33,665 --> 00:47:35,499
Someone hurting little Ella.

409
00:47:39,069 --> 00:47:42,339
Don't you ever mention
my daughter's name again.

410
00:47:42,439 --> 00:47:44,108
Okay.

411
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:45,442
Okay.

412
00:47:45,543 --> 00:47:46,944
Okay.

413
00:47:54,786 --> 00:47:56,053
You see?

414
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:58,989
It's just about circumstance.

415
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,431
First time's never easy.

416
00:48:08,899 --> 00:48:10,334
But after time,
you get used to it.

417
00:48:12,837 --> 00:48:14,004
Who knows?

418
00:48:15,005 --> 00:48:16,641
Ana, you could even enjoy it.

419
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:19,376
Oh, I could teach
you some things.

420
00:48:19,476 --> 00:48:21,011
Shut up!

421
00:48:28,152 --> 00:48:29,319
You got anything to eat?

422
00:48:31,021 --> 00:48:32,289
What's so funny?

423
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:35,292
I nearly bought a pack of
cookies back at the gas station.

424
00:48:35,392 --> 00:48:37,027
I didn't wanna use
my credit card.

425
00:48:37,127 --> 00:48:39,029
They can trace you so easily
with a credit card.

426
00:48:40,364 --> 00:48:42,933
I only had enough cash
for gas and cigarettes.

427
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:48,272
My doc always said
the smokes will kill me.

428
00:48:57,047 --> 00:48:58,282
I'm gonna take a little nap.

429
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:01,185
You should try
and get some sleep too.

430
00:49:01,285 --> 00:49:02,754
I don't intend to sleep.

431
00:49:02,854 --> 00:49:04,988
Oh, you'll sleep.

432
00:49:05,088 --> 00:49:06,490
The cold will make you.

433
00:49:08,392 --> 00:49:09,460
It's inevitable.

434
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:16,133
In that case.

435
00:49:18,603 --> 00:49:19,883
You fucking bitch!
You fucking...

436
00:51:03,808 --> 00:51:05,242
Bad dream?

437
00:51:07,277 --> 00:51:09,814
I wonder what nightmares
like yours look like.

438
00:51:11,015 --> 00:51:13,250
Mine like all normal people
are crowded

439
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:17,287
with twisted fucks like you,
but yours,

440
00:51:17,387 --> 00:51:19,691
I mean, what do they look like?

441
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:20,792
What scares you?

442
00:51:22,192 --> 00:51:24,662
Being caught by the police?

443
00:51:24,762 --> 00:51:25,930
Being executed?

444
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:27,331
No?

445
00:51:28,766 --> 00:51:34,038
Maybe they're about normal
people, happiness, family.

446
00:51:34,137 --> 00:51:36,406
You know,
everything you'll never have.

447
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:53,290
There's a bottle
back there somewhere.

448
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,863
Go ahead.

449
00:51:58,963 --> 00:52:00,865
I don't mind sharing.

450
00:52:00,965 --> 00:52:02,600
I won't look, I promise.

451
00:52:21,019 --> 00:52:22,687
Don't go anywhere.

452
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,394
Bitch.

453
00:53:28,418 --> 00:53:30,320
Fucking open.

454
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,689
Open this door!

455
00:53:31,789 --> 00:53:33,791
I'd love to help
but my hands are tied.

456
00:53:37,729 --> 00:53:38,796
You fucking bitch.

457
00:54:00,752 --> 00:54:01,886
What the fuck?

458
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,712
Ah! I'll fucking kill you!

459
00:54:27,812 --> 00:54:29,213
Ah!

460
00:54:29,312 --> 00:54:31,549
Ah!

461
00:57:56,587 --> 00:57:58,022
Finish snooping?

462
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:01,959
How long have
you been following me?

463
00:58:02,059 --> 00:58:03,861
Long enough.

464
00:58:03,961 --> 00:58:06,496
Like I said, I know
a lot about you.

465
00:58:06,597 --> 00:58:07,932
Why me?

466
00:58:08,032 --> 00:58:10,601
Always the same question.
What do you want me to say?

467
00:58:10,701 --> 00:58:12,236
You're special.
You're the one?

468
00:58:13,471 --> 00:58:16,574
I saw... an opportunity.

469
00:58:17,608 --> 00:58:19,510
You're single.
You live alone with your kid.

470
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:20,511
You have no friends.

471
00:58:20,611 --> 00:58:22,480
Your mother's family.

472
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:26,917
Just another ordinary immigrant
that no-one really cares about.

473
00:58:27,018 --> 00:58:28,052
It was easy.

474
00:58:28,152 --> 00:58:29,553
Except for Vince.

475
00:58:30,721 --> 00:58:32,423
I didn't plan on that idiot.

476
00:58:32,523 --> 00:58:34,558
He nearly fucked everything up.

477
00:58:34,658 --> 00:58:36,727
Is that how you do it?

478
00:58:36,827 --> 00:58:39,397
You help damsels in distress
to gain their trust

479
00:58:39,497 --> 00:58:41,198
and then you kidnap them?

480
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:45,169
Is that what you did
with Ashley Mitchell?

481
00:58:45,269 --> 00:58:46,904
- Who?
- Ashley Mitchell!

482
00:58:47,004 --> 00:58:48,139
Her!

483
00:58:50,274 --> 00:58:52,009
How many women have you killed?

484
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,345
I've never counted.

485
00:58:54,445 --> 00:58:55,713
I'm sure you have.

486
00:58:56,747 --> 00:58:59,784
That's what all twisted
fucks like you do.

487
00:58:59,884 --> 00:59:02,253
And that's why you
have all these IDs.

488
00:59:05,524 --> 00:59:07,591
How many?

489
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:08,993
Well, it's difficult to answer.

490
00:59:10,529 --> 00:59:11,809
There was one who only
afterwards

491
00:59:11,896 --> 00:59:13,197
I discovered was pregnant.

492
00:59:13,297 --> 00:59:16,400
Now, does that count as two?

493
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,671
Oh, and there was this very
cute brunette I really liked.

494
00:59:21,705 --> 00:59:23,407
She looked a bit like you,

495
00:59:23,508 --> 00:59:25,176
but she talked a lot
fucking less.

496
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:27,111
What was her name?

497
00:59:27,211 --> 00:59:28,779
Maria, Mia.

498
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,583
Well, she choked on her
own vomit under my gag.

499
00:59:32,683 --> 00:59:36,020
Now, is that murder or
is that an accident?

500
00:59:37,955 --> 00:59:39,023
You asked.

501
00:59:40,391 --> 00:59:44,328
All those lives ended
because they were in the wrong

502
00:59:44,428 --> 00:59:46,430
place at the wrong time.

503
00:59:46,531 --> 00:59:48,699
Because they crossed
path with a psycho.

504
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,602
You're going to listen
to the names

505
00:59:51,702 --> 00:59:52,970
of all of these women.

506
00:59:54,038 --> 00:59:57,942
Amanda Walker, Maddie Parker.

507
01:00:01,779 --> 01:00:03,714
Elizabeth Guzman.

508
01:00:03,814 --> 01:00:04,715
Look at them.

509
01:00:04,815 --> 01:00:06,617
Open your eyes!

510
01:00:11,755 --> 01:00:13,324
Cassie Beckerman.

511
01:00:13,424 --> 01:00:14,559
Your son of a bitch.

512
01:00:14,692 --> 01:00:15,960
Look at her.

513
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:17,194
Oh, Cassie.

514
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:19,997
Yes.

515
01:00:20,097 --> 01:00:21,232
I remember her.

516
01:00:23,134 --> 01:00:24,902
She was my first.

517
01:00:25,002 --> 01:00:26,937
We never forget
our first, do we?

518
01:00:28,105 --> 01:00:30,174
A total mess.
I did everything wrong.

519
01:00:31,375 --> 01:00:33,545
I... I didn't even know
I was hunting that day.

520
01:00:33,644 --> 01:00:34,884
I just was going out to pick up

521
01:00:34,945 --> 01:00:36,505
chicks and see
if I could drop them off.

522
01:00:36,581 --> 01:00:37,915
I was testing myself.

523
01:00:39,116 --> 01:00:41,852
I learned so much about
the female psychology back then.

524
01:00:45,689 --> 01:00:48,993
<i>Some women were
always suspicious.</i>

525
01:00:49,093 --> 01:00:51,795
<i>They see a single
guy in his car alone.</i>

526
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,074
<i>I wanted to change the situation</i>

527
01:00:54,098 --> 01:00:56,267
<i>so they wanted
to get into the car.</i>

528
01:00:56,367 --> 01:00:58,202
<i>It was a game.</i>

529
01:00:58,302 --> 01:01:01,839
<i>Each time I was testing myself,
seeing how far I would go.</i>

530
01:01:02,907 --> 01:01:04,708
<i>I didn't want to get caught.</i>

531
01:01:04,808 --> 01:01:06,177
<i>But there I was,</i>

532
01:01:06,277 --> 01:01:09,113
<i>driving for hours and hours
and then suddenly...</i>

533
01:01:10,381 --> 01:01:11,382
<i>I got lucky.</i>

534
01:01:32,469 --> 01:01:33,572
- Hey.
- Hi.

535
01:01:33,672 --> 01:01:35,172
Um, I have to go to Lakeside.

536
01:01:35,272 --> 01:01:36,006
Oh, I'm sorry.

537
01:01:36,106 --> 01:01:37,576
I'm-I'm going to Columbia Falls.

538
01:01:37,676 --> 01:01:38,776
- Oh.
- Sorry.

539
01:01:38,876 --> 01:01:40,420
<i>- I didn't say
- I was going to Lakeside</i>

540
01:01:40,444 --> 01:01:42,046
<i>or offer to take her
straight away.</i>

541
01:01:42,146 --> 01:01:43,757
<i>That would've been too
much of a coincidence.</i>

542
01:01:43,781 --> 01:01:44,583
Much too eager.

543
01:01:44,683 --> 01:01:46,518
I mean,

544
01:01:46,618 --> 01:01:48,858
I guess I could swing around,
get you closer to Lakeside,

545
01:01:48,886 --> 01:01:50,187
if that helps.

546
01:01:52,022 --> 01:01:54,693
<i>I looked at my watch
as if to say,</i>

547
01:01:54,825 --> 01:01:56,493
<i>do I really have time?</i>

548
01:01:56,595 --> 01:01:59,263
<i>You'd be surprised how effective
something like that is.</i>

549
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:03,743
<i>Her mother must have told her</i>

550
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:06,270
<i>not to get into a stranger's car
on her own.</i>

551
01:02:08,739 --> 01:02:09,940
<i>Then she looked at me.</i>

552
01:02:11,041 --> 01:02:14,613
<i>You could see she was
like, yeah, he's a dork.</i>

553
01:02:14,713 --> 01:02:17,014
<i>- He wouldn't hurt a fly.</i>
- Um, okay.

554
01:02:17,114 --> 01:02:18,617
<i>- And then.</i>
- Sure, yeah.

555
01:02:18,717 --> 01:02:19,726
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

556
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:21,885
Yeah. She got in.

557
01:02:24,154 --> 01:02:25,889
<i>She should have trusted her gut.</i>

558
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:38,769
<i>She had these
incredible brown eyes,</i>

559
01:02:38,869 --> 01:02:41,438
<i>long blonde hair
and these bouncing breasts</i>

560
01:02:41,539 --> 01:02:43,240
<i>that were just driving me wild.</i>

561
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:45,876
So, do you like music?

562
01:02:45,976 --> 01:02:47,077
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

563
01:02:47,177 --> 01:02:49,079
- I like music.
- Play music you want.

564
01:02:49,179 --> 01:02:50,615
Sure.

565
01:02:50,715 --> 01:02:52,149
See if there's anything on.

566
01:02:55,252 --> 01:02:56,521
- I love this song.
- Yeah?

567
01:02:56,621 --> 01:02:58,222
I do, yes.

568
01:02:58,322 --> 01:03:02,293
<i>She laughed at things I said
that even I knew weren't funny.</i>

569
01:03:02,393 --> 01:03:04,094
<i>I let her think
she was in control.</i>

570
01:03:07,331 --> 01:03:08,767
Going to see your boyfriend,
or...?

571
01:03:08,866 --> 01:03:11,235
No, I don't actually
have a boyfriend.

572
01:03:11,335 --> 01:03:12,102
- No?
- No.

573
01:03:12,202 --> 01:03:13,837
I'm just gonna
visit some friends.

574
01:03:13,937 --> 01:03:15,640
<i>She started playing a game.</i>

575
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:16,916
<i>Not quite teasing me,
but you know,</i>

576
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,909
<i>these games men and women play.</i>

577
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:24,549
<i>I had this craving,
this awful, raging feeling.</i>

578
01:03:24,649 --> 01:03:26,518
<i>It was consuming my insides.</i>

579
01:03:29,587 --> 01:03:31,488
Hey, I think you just
missed the turn actually.

580
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:32,829
This, this isn't the right way,

581
01:03:32,856 --> 01:03:35,192
This road's much faster.
I know this road so well.

582
01:03:35,292 --> 01:03:37,161
Oh! Okay.

583
01:03:37,261 --> 01:03:38,929
<i>She knew something was wrong.</i>

584
01:03:41,899 --> 01:03:43,033
You know, it's... honestly,

585
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:44,512
you could totally just pull over
right here

586
01:03:44,536 --> 01:03:46,870
and I could just jump out,
get another ride.

587
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:48,439
It's all... It's okay.

588
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,341
No need to stress, it's fine.

589
01:03:52,811 --> 01:03:53,944
Okay.

590
01:03:54,044 --> 01:03:55,322
Can you please pull over
and just let me out?

591
01:03:55,346 --> 01:03:56,456
You can just let
me out right here.

592
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,449
<i>I was trying to buy myself time,</i>

593
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:00,552
<i>but at this point
she was completely hysterical.</i>

594
01:04:00,652 --> 01:04:02,119
Okay. Seriously,

595
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:03,020
if you don't let me out right
now, I'm gonna call the cops.

596
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,254
Would you... Don't even.

597
01:04:04,355 --> 01:04:05,595
- What is wrong with you?
- Hey!

598
01:04:05,657 --> 01:04:06,657
Let me out!

599
01:04:06,691 --> 01:04:07,424
<i>I tried to keep her quiet,</i>

600
01:04:07,525 --> 01:04:09,561
<i>but she just wouldn't shut
the fuck up.</i>

601
01:04:09,661 --> 01:04:11,061
Unlock this fucking door!

602
01:04:11,161 --> 01:04:11,995
<i>And that's when I lost it.</i>

603
01:04:12,096 --> 01:04:13,631
Unlock this fucking door!

604
01:04:13,732 --> 01:04:14,932
Ah!

605
01:04:15,966 --> 01:04:17,234
<i>I really fucked up.</i>

606
01:04:18,335 --> 01:04:19,335
<i>Enough!</i>

607
01:04:20,672 --> 01:04:21,972
<i>That's enough!</i>

608
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:27,378
That's enough!

609
01:04:41,158 --> 01:04:44,294
Suddenly I was just
standing there and I.

610
01:04:46,631 --> 01:04:47,631
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

611
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:51,034
<i>I... I fucking did it.</i>

612
01:04:54,471 --> 01:04:56,039
<i>I fucking did it.</i>

613
01:04:58,208 --> 01:05:01,078
She didn't die instantly
like she was supposed to.

614
01:05:02,614 --> 01:05:03,648
<i>Like in the movies.</i>

615
01:05:05,149 --> 01:05:06,417
<i>It doesn't happen like that.</i>

616
01:05:08,385 --> 01:05:10,622
When you stab someone,
they bleed out slowly.

617
01:05:10,722 --> 01:05:14,224
They lose blood pressure
and you have to stab them again

618
01:05:14,324 --> 01:05:16,393
and again and again and again.

619
01:05:17,294 --> 01:05:19,531
These things take time.

620
01:05:19,631 --> 01:05:21,533
I could have stabbed her
in the heart, but...

621
01:05:23,635 --> 01:05:26,103
I couldn't bring myself
to damage those breasts.

622
01:05:28,472 --> 01:05:30,441
She ended up getting
her throat slit.

623
01:05:33,678 --> 01:05:36,046
I dumped what was left of her
body under a pile of wood

624
01:05:36,146 --> 01:05:38,248
and that's where she was
found two days later.

625
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:41,719
The cops were all over it.
Local news picked it up.

626
01:05:43,153 --> 01:05:45,857
Cassie was the daughter
of a judge.

627
01:05:45,956 --> 01:05:47,324
So, fucking stupid.

628
01:05:48,927 --> 01:05:51,962
I had to hide for weeks waiting
for everything to die down.

629
01:05:52,996 --> 01:05:54,498
She made me change
my whole game.

630
01:05:56,033 --> 01:05:59,069
From then on,
I was very careful.

631
01:06:01,171 --> 01:06:03,307
The next one was an immigrant.

632
01:06:03,407 --> 01:06:04,876
Cassie was still in the news.

633
01:06:04,975 --> 01:06:08,445
But with this low class chick,
nothing.

634
01:06:09,747 --> 01:06:12,416
I hadn't anticipated the lack
of effort in finding

635
01:06:12,517 --> 01:06:16,286
the murderer of a poor woman,
low-lives or immigrants.

636
01:06:17,421 --> 01:06:19,189
It's even convenient for some.

637
01:06:21,158 --> 01:06:22,727
It opened up a whole
new world to me.

638
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:25,697
I've got bad
news for you, David.

639
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:29,834
Your winning streak
ends right here.

640
01:06:29,934 --> 01:06:32,369
The next time they talk
of your exploits,

641
01:06:32,469 --> 01:06:34,539
it'll be as they walk you
to Death Row.

642
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:37,341
I feel pity for you.

643
01:06:37,441 --> 01:06:39,309
Fuck you and your pity.

644
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:41,746
Your life must be miserable.

645
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:46,885
No friends, no wife,
no-one to talk to.

646
01:06:46,985 --> 01:06:48,118
No-one to confide in.

647
01:06:48,218 --> 01:06:49,119
Yeah.

648
01:06:49,219 --> 01:06:50,822
You and I have
so much in common.

649
01:06:50,922 --> 01:06:52,289
We have nothing in common.

650
01:06:52,389 --> 01:06:54,224
Nothing.

651
01:06:54,324 --> 01:06:56,895
I wonder how you
became what you are.

652
01:06:56,995 --> 01:06:58,663
Why you're so afraid of women?

653
01:06:58,763 --> 01:07:01,766
Because that's what
it's all about, right?

654
01:07:01,866 --> 01:07:04,268
Women scare the shit out of you.

655
01:07:04,368 --> 01:07:06,036
Are you incapable
of getting a hard-on?

656
01:07:06,136 --> 01:07:07,170
Oh, come on...

657
01:07:07,271 --> 01:07:09,172
Did they laugh at you?

658
01:07:09,273 --> 01:07:11,743
I wanna know.
Tell me, what is it?

659
01:07:11,843 --> 01:07:13,176
Is it because of your mom?

660
01:07:13,277 --> 01:07:15,355
Don't you dare talk about my
mother, you fucking whore!

661
01:07:15,379 --> 01:07:20,284
Oh, mama's little murderer
has a sensitive spot.

662
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:31,295
What did you mean when you said
what was left of the body?

663
01:07:31,395 --> 01:07:33,598
Do you ever stop asking
fucking questions?

664
01:07:33,698 --> 01:07:35,567
What did you do with them?

665
01:07:38,368 --> 01:07:40,370
Well, were dead anyway.

666
01:07:42,072 --> 01:07:43,675
The world is gonna be
a better place

667
01:07:43,775 --> 01:07:45,409
when you get the needle.

668
01:07:46,644 --> 01:07:50,548
Yesterday at the café,
there was something between

669
01:07:50,648 --> 01:07:51,950
you and me.

670
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:54,519
An electricity. I saw it.

671
01:07:54,619 --> 01:07:56,186
Go on. Admit it.

672
01:07:56,286 --> 01:07:57,287
Keep on dreaming.

673
01:07:57,387 --> 01:08:00,058
Go on.
That's all you have left.

674
01:08:00,157 --> 01:08:01,997
Oh, when I saved you
from your abusive husband,

675
01:08:02,026 --> 01:08:03,528
that made you hot.

676
01:08:03,628 --> 01:08:04,361
That turns you on.

677
01:08:04,461 --> 01:08:06,129
It's okay. You can admit it.

678
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:07,431
You're delusional.

679
01:08:07,532 --> 01:08:09,634
- Really?
- Nice guys get me hot.

680
01:08:09,734 --> 01:08:10,835
Not psychos.

681
01:08:10,935 --> 01:08:13,071
Well, why did you marry Vince?

682
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:13,938
He's pretty violent.

683
01:08:14,038 --> 01:08:15,673
Not really a nice guy.

684
01:08:15,773 --> 01:08:17,008
He was drinking.

685
01:08:17,107 --> 01:08:19,010
He... he was depressed,
he lost his job.

686
01:08:19,109 --> 01:08:21,713
Excuses, excuses, excuses.

687
01:08:21,813 --> 01:08:22,957
What about the guy before Vince?

688
01:08:22,981 --> 01:08:24,549
There was one before him, right?

689
01:08:24,649 --> 01:08:26,084
Was he violent too?

690
01:08:26,183 --> 01:08:27,327
Would he beat you
and then give you flowers

691
01:08:27,351 --> 01:08:29,195
that you couldn't smell
through your broken nose?

692
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:30,788
And did you make
excuses for him?

693
01:08:30,888 --> 01:08:32,090
Yeah. Drinking, depression.

694
01:08:32,189 --> 01:08:33,256
Lost his job. Bang.

695
01:08:33,357 --> 01:08:34,559
Oh, I'm sorry. Flowers.

696
01:08:34,659 --> 01:08:36,259
Drinking, depression,
lost his job.

697
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,128
Oh, bang. Oh, I'm sorry.

698
01:08:38,228 --> 01:08:39,329
Here's some flowers.

699
01:08:39,429 --> 01:08:42,265
Drinking, depression,
lost his job.

700
01:08:42,366 --> 01:08:44,736
Bang! Oh, I'm sorry...

701
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:47,805
I'm sick of hearing you.

702
01:10:52,864 --> 01:10:54,297
I think it's gone...

703
01:11:03,473 --> 01:11:04,542
What?

704
01:11:05,877 --> 01:11:06,877
What?

705
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:10,982
Wait, what?

706
01:11:55,193 --> 01:11:56,928
What was that?

707
01:12:03,301 --> 01:12:04,836
I don't know.

708
01:12:04,936 --> 01:12:06,576
Whatever it was,
it must've been attracted

709
01:12:06,604 --> 01:12:08,044
to the car by the scent
of your piss.

710
01:12:08,105 --> 01:12:09,941
Could've been your blood.

711
01:12:13,177 --> 01:12:14,377
Let's turn the heat on.

712
01:12:14,477 --> 01:12:16,147
We have to be sparing, remember?

713
01:12:16,247 --> 01:12:18,182
- Just a few minutes come on.
- No.

714
01:12:18,282 --> 01:12:19,726
I'm freezing my ass off here,
goddammit!

715
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,427
Well, you should've thought
about that before you made me

716
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:23,821
smash that fucking window!

717
01:12:30,761 --> 01:12:31,295
15 minutes.

718
01:12:31,394 --> 01:12:32,763
That's it.

719
01:12:44,407 --> 01:12:46,510
I need to use the boy's room.

720
01:12:48,478 --> 01:12:49,947
Seriously, I need to go.

721
01:12:50,047 --> 01:12:52,149
You're optimistic.

722
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:53,985
Well, at least give me a hand.

723
01:12:58,356 --> 01:13:00,224
Don't make me piss myself.

724
01:13:00,324 --> 01:13:02,360
Please.

725
01:13:02,492 --> 01:13:04,494
I ain't setting you free.

726
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:21,512
You see?

727
01:13:21,612 --> 01:13:24,615
I told you you were capable
of being cruel.

728
01:13:24,715 --> 01:13:27,151
At least it'll keep you warm
for a while.

729
01:13:33,124 --> 01:13:34,725
What now?

730
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,427
My leg.

731
01:13:44,535 --> 01:13:46,637
Skin has turned black.

732
01:13:46,737 --> 01:13:47,972
Shit.

733
01:13:50,341 --> 01:13:54,444
If the storm keeps going
like this, I'm gonna lose it.

734
01:13:54,545 --> 01:13:57,381
If the storm goes on like this,
it'll be the least

735
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,183
of your worries.

736
01:14:14,098 --> 01:14:16,968
Looks like we're in the middle
of a reservation.

737
01:14:20,638 --> 01:14:24,108
Here, the natives have a legend.

738
01:14:25,475 --> 01:14:27,812
Talks of a spirit living
in the forest

739
01:14:27,912 --> 01:14:30,181
which comes to hunt people
like you.

740
01:14:31,515 --> 01:14:34,819
Those who have committed
the worst of atrocities.

741
01:14:34,919 --> 01:14:38,022
Those who have ceased
to act like civilised men.

742
01:14:39,857 --> 01:14:42,693
They say it first appears
in dreams.

743
01:14:44,228 --> 01:14:48,933
When their time has come,
it comes to get them,

744
01:14:49,033 --> 01:14:50,968
and they become it.

745
01:14:51,068 --> 01:14:53,637
A soul condemned
to wander in the woods.

746
01:14:57,341 --> 01:14:59,577
You believe that bullshit?

747
01:14:59,677 --> 01:15:01,245
The natives do.

748
01:15:07,051 --> 01:15:08,185
Oh shit.

749
01:15:08,285 --> 01:15:09,420
What?

750
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,155
Battery just died.

751
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:14,992
No!

752
01:15:15,092 --> 01:15:16,494
Shit!

753
01:15:16,627 --> 01:15:18,295
Shit!

754
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:21,632
Now we're fucked.

755
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,001
Don't forget I have a knife.

756
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:40,344
We fall asleep this time,
we won't wake up.

757
01:16:40,444 --> 01:16:42,179
We won't.

758
01:16:42,279 --> 01:16:44,148
The storm's gonna stop.

759
01:16:47,218 --> 01:16:50,855
I'm trying to remember the
last time a woman touched me.

760
01:16:52,089 --> 01:16:55,960
I mean,
really wanted to touch me.

761
01:16:58,329 --> 01:16:59,930
I'm not touching you.

762
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:03,334
I'm taking your body
heat to keep me alive.

763
01:17:07,938 --> 01:17:10,174
I wish I was a better person.

764
01:17:10,274 --> 01:17:12,343
It's a little late
to feel guilty.

765
01:17:14,311 --> 01:17:16,881
I don't expect you
to have sympathy for me.

766
01:17:18,782 --> 01:17:21,252
But life hasn't been kind.

767
01:17:21,352 --> 01:17:24,989
My dad, the piece of shit...

768
01:17:26,891 --> 01:17:28,792
he ran out on us
when I was nine.

769
01:17:31,262 --> 01:17:33,297
Never saw him again.

770
01:17:33,397 --> 01:17:35,366
My mother was already a drinker.

771
01:17:36,867 --> 01:17:39,670
One of the only two
things they had in common.

772
01:17:40,738 --> 01:17:42,339
The other one was me.

773
01:17:44,241 --> 01:17:48,212
But when he left,
all she did is drink.

774
01:17:50,881 --> 01:17:54,185
She was much more
violent than my father.

775
01:17:54,285 --> 01:17:59,423
After he left, I got scared
and I pissed the bed.

776
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:08,199
When she found out, she beat me.

777
01:18:10,701 --> 01:18:13,204
And every night
I pissed the bed.

778
01:18:15,139 --> 01:18:16,373
Every night.

779
01:18:19,877 --> 01:18:22,079
I grew up in an orphanage.

780
01:18:23,648 --> 01:18:29,353
At nine, I got lucky and I
was adopted by a nice couple.

781
01:18:31,722 --> 01:18:34,425
The mother was affectionate.

782
01:18:34,526 --> 01:18:36,160
The father was attentive.

783
01:18:38,028 --> 01:18:40,497
But not long after I arrived,

784
01:18:42,933 --> 01:18:45,736
the attention became
more than I wanted.

785
01:18:47,338 --> 01:18:49,406
Than any child wants.

786
01:18:52,309 --> 01:18:58,048
Things happen in... in silence
until I was 15.

787
01:19:00,284 --> 01:19:02,753
And then I started
getting into trouble.

788
01:19:02,853 --> 01:19:05,189
Sound familiar?

789
01:19:06,423 --> 01:19:12,396
And then I finally spoke up
and my father went to jail.

790
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:21,472
And then came the drink,
the drugs, the violence, jail.

791
01:19:23,807 --> 01:19:27,444
Then... then I became a mother.

792
01:19:29,847 --> 01:19:36,020
And I've only given
Ella love and kindness.

793
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:39,023
Even though life
wasn't kind to me.

794
01:19:40,291 --> 01:19:44,094
And the truth is,
you're looking for excuses,

795
01:19:44,194 --> 01:19:46,130
but you don't have any.

796
01:19:47,131 --> 01:19:49,266
They won't bring back
the lives you took.

797
01:19:51,201 --> 01:19:53,337
It has nothing to
do with your mother.

798
01:19:56,775 --> 01:19:58,510
It doesn't matter now anyway.

799
01:20:00,578 --> 01:20:03,080
In a couple of hours,
the cold will take us.

800
01:20:04,815 --> 01:20:06,950
That solves everything.

801
01:20:09,953 --> 01:20:13,991
It was one advantage to the cold
that I didn't expect.

802
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:17,861
I can't feel the pain
in my leg anymore.

803
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:23,367
There's one other thing
that really surprises me.

804
01:20:25,336 --> 01:20:26,738
What?

805
01:20:26,837 --> 01:20:29,306
The cold makes everything
so fragile.

806
01:20:29,406 --> 01:20:31,041
Yeah.

807
01:20:31,141 --> 01:20:33,277
Including this tape.

808
01:20:49,226 --> 01:20:51,171
Oh, you should've killed me,
instead of talking on

809
01:20:51,195 --> 01:20:53,063
and on like my
bitch of a mother.

810
01:20:53,163 --> 01:20:56,333
I killed her ten years ago.

811
01:20:56,433 --> 01:20:58,603
I ripped out her fucking
throat to shut her up.

812
01:21:00,304 --> 01:21:04,576
Oh, oh, oh Ana,
I'm gonna do something

813
01:21:04,676 --> 01:21:06,210
so special with you.

814
01:21:08,879 --> 01:21:11,482
Because we're pals now.

815
01:21:11,583 --> 01:21:15,886
I'm really gonna enjoy the
moment with a friend,

816
01:21:17,655 --> 01:21:21,992
and when I get outta here,
the first place I'm gonna go...

817
01:21:22,092 --> 01:21:24,461
I'm gonna go play
with little Ella.

818
01:22:11,743 --> 01:22:12,744
Ah!

819
01:22:48,913 --> 01:22:50,981
Fall asleep.

820
01:22:51,081 --> 01:22:52,750
I won't fall asleep.

821
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:56,386
I promise.

822
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:04,194
I won't fall asleep.

823
01:23:04,294 --> 01:23:07,164
I won't fall asleep, I promise.

824
01:25:33,143 --> 01:25:35,013
