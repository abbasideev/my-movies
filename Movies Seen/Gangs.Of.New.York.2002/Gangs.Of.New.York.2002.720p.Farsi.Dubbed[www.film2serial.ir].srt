1
00:00:53,264 --> 00:00:55,432
No son, never.

2
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:58,269
The blood stays
on the blade.

3
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,910
One day you'll understand.

4
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:14,751
Some of it I have remembered.

5
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:20,221
And the rest I
took from dreams.

6
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:27,521
St. Michael the Archangel
defend us in battle.

7
00:01:28,431 --> 00:01:29,811
Be our protector.

8
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:35,401
Against the snares. And
the wickedness of the devil.

9
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:38,571
Now son, who's that?

10
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:39,991
St. Michael.

11
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:40,531
Who is it?

12
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:41,661
St. Michael.

13
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:42,821
And what did he do?

14
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:44,832
He cast Satan out
of Paradse.

15
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:46,872
Good boy!

16
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:33,065
Johnny!

17
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:35,105
What's the battle?

18
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:37,155
Natives against the
Dead Rabbits.

19
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:37,815
Which are you?

20
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:39,945
What do you think?
Dead Rabbits!

21
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:21,986
Well,well, Monk!

22
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,036
Are you with us
or not?

23
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:27,746
For the last time Vallon,
only if the money is right.

24
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:31,586
I'll give you 10 per notch.

25
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:34,207
10?

26
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:35,337
You have my word.

27
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:43,637
10 per notch. Per new notch.

28
00:04:48,347 --> 00:04:48,937
Then I'm your man.

29
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,420
Is this it, Priest?
The Pope's new army?

30
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,800
A few crusty bitches
and a handful of ragtags!

31
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,890
I know Bill. You swore, this was
a battle between warriors.

32
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,811
Not a bunch of Miss Nancy's.

33
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,601
So warriors is what I brought.

34
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:58,821
The O'Connell Guard!

35
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:00,231
The Plug Uglies!

36
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:01,901
The Shirt Tails!

37
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:09,541
The Chichesters!

38
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,501
The Forty Thieves!

39
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:22,921
Bene.

40
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:34,352
On my challenge, by the ancient
laws of combat...

41
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:37,232
...we are met at
this chosen ground...

42
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:39,572
...to settle for good and all...

43
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:42,782
...who holds sway,
over the Five Points.

44
00:07:44,822 --> 00:07:49,832
Us Natives, born rightwise
to this fine land....

45
00:07:50,832 --> 00:07:53,162
...or the foreign hordes
defiling it!

46
00:07:58,132 --> 00:08:02,423
Under the ancient laws of combat
I accept the challenge of the so called Natives.

47
00:08:03,423 --> 00:08:05,263
You plague our people at
every turn!

48
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:08,433
But from this day out, you
shall plague us no more!

49
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:12,183
Let it be known, that the hand
that tries to strike us from this land...

50
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:14,143
...shall be swiflty cut down!

51
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:22,483
Then may the Christian Lord, guide
my hand, against your Roman popery!

52
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,783
Prepare to receive
the true Lord!

53
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:29,197
Priest!

54
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:19,458
Look at me!

55
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:24,049
Who is this under my knife?

56
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,809
Father, get up! Get up!

57
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:36,849
Where are you?

58
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:38,519
Where are you?

59
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,069
No, my son.

60
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:48,239
Don't never look away!

61
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,130
Soon be over, Priest.

62
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,010
Finish it!

63
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,320
You may need this to cross
the river.

64
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:35,751
Ears and noses will be the
trophies of the day.

65
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:40,131
But no hand shall touch him!

66
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:45,011
No hand shall touch him!

67
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:49,931
He'll cross over whole!

68
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:52,511
In honour!

69
00:12:54,021 --> 00:12:55,431
Not before I get what's owed!

70
00:13:03,321 --> 00:13:03,781
No!

71
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:09,492
It's fair. A touch indelicate,
but fair.

72
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:16,122
My sympathies.

73
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:19,212
What shall we do with
the boy?

74
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,042
Look at me.

75
00:13:28,222 --> 00:13:29,092
Give him to the law.

76
00:13:30,222 --> 00:13:31,802
See he gets a good
education.

77
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,102
Okay, boss. Say goodbye
to your father.

78
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:39,943
Hey. Take it easy!

79
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:49,533
Hurry! Come in here!

80
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,724
Come here, boy. You're
going to Hell's Gate!

81
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:14,684
There he is!

82
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:15,304
Get him!

83
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:17,894
Priest Vallon died a
noble death.

84
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:23,024
But his Dead Rabbits is done
and outlawed.

85
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:29,194
Let no one even speak their
name from now on.

86
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:20,545
In this place, you've
grown from a boy into a man.

87
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,926
Put to death the earthly
things in you.

88
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:28,676
Immorality. Impurity.
Passion. Vengeance.

89
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:31,676
The Lord has forgiven you.

90
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:35,226
You also must forgive.

91
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:41,476
You go forth to a country torn
apart by civil strife.

92
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:42,936
Thank you, Reverend.

93
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:50,076
Lend your hand to the work
that yet remains.

94
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,156
That this war may end.

95
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:56,707
And the plague of slavery,
that brought this confergration down upon us  ...

96
00:15:57,537 --> 00:16:00,997
...vanish forever
from the earth.

97
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,408
In the second year of the
great civil war...

98
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:36,498
...when the irish brigades
marched through the streets...

99
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:39,708
...New york was a city
full of tribes.

100
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:43,298
War chiefs. Rich and poor.

101
00:16:45,758 --> 00:16:48,218
Lincoln will make all
white men slaves!

102
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,638
It wasn't a city really.

103
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,758
It was more a furnace.

104
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:55,308
Where cities someday
might be forged.

105
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,058
That's the spirit boys.

106
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,058
Go off and die for your
blackie friends.

107
00:17:01,768 --> 00:17:04,819
We should have run a better man against
Lincoln when we had the chance.

108
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:09,359
They are trying to say ,we
are no different than niggers.

109
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:10,909
You ain't.

110
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:17,789
Go back to Africa,
niggers!

111
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,669
The angriest talk was of
the new conscription act.

112
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:28,219
The first draft in Union
history.

113
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,940
Join the army lads. Three square
meals a day and good pay.

114
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,990
When the Irish came, the city was
in a fever.

115
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,410
Since the time of the great famine
they'd come streaming off the boats.

116
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,240
And they got a right warm welcome.

117
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,120
Go back to Ireland, you
dumb Mick!

118
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,870
You'll remember that!

119
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,460
Get back on the boat, Paddy!

120
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,130
I came only 2 hours down
river from Hell Gate...

121
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,710
..but they all took me
for an immigrant.

122
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,010
Why not?

123
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,090
There were a 1000 different
accents in New York..

124
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,301
..and to the Natives you see,
they were all the same.

125
00:18:15,431 --> 00:18:18,601
Come here to take the chill off
your soul and the weight off your heart.

126
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:22,851
Welcome to America son, your long
arduous journey is over.

127
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:24,401
Go back to your own country.

128
00:18:24,441 --> 00:18:25,571
Vote Tammany!

129
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,731
America for Americans!

130
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:37,041
New York loved William
Tweed and hated him.

131
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,041
And those of us trying
to be thieves....

132
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,581
...we couldn't help but
admire him.

133
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,581
Mr. Cutting. Gentlemen.

134
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:45,631
Thank you for coming.
It's an honour.

135
00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:46,752
Mr. Tweed?

136
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,882
Sir! Please! Excuse me?

137
00:18:52,472 --> 00:18:53,592
I think your're frightening
them.

138
00:18:54,012 --> 00:18:54,472
So?

139
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:57,062
Don't mind him, he used to
be an Irishman.

140
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,732
The Five Points!

141
00:19:02,062 --> 00:19:04,902
Murderer's Alley. Brickbat Mansion.

142
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,072
The Gates of hell!

143
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:09,532
In this wild place....

144
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:13,072
Look upon the face of this
poor child.

145
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:20,373
She lives in squalor, in this
godforsaken den of vice and
misery behind me.

146
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:23,123
Every year the Reformers came.

147
00:19:23,543 --> 00:19:25,673
Every year the Points got
worse.

148
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:28,253
As if it liked being dirty.

149
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:31,763
Where am I going to go?

150
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:32,223
Move.

151
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,553
The Reverend wants you out
of here.

152
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:51,573
You may or not know Bill, that every
day I go down to the waterfront...

153
00:19:51,653 --> 00:19:53,994
...with hot soup for the Irish
as they come on shore.

154
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:56,114
As part of building a political
base.

155
00:19:56,954 --> 00:19:58,124
I've noticed you there.

156
00:19:58,574 --> 00:19:59,834
You may have noticed me?

157
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:00,834
Indeed I have!

158
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:05,004
Throwing torrents of favours and
withering abuse on every person who
step off those boats.

159
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:06,964
If only I had the guns Mr. Tweed...

160
00:20:07,004 --> 00:20:10,384
...I'd shoot each and everyone of them,
before they set foot on American soil.

161
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:46,625
Mulbeery street and Worth. Cross.
Orange and Littlewater.

162
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:49,465
Each of the Five Points is a
finger...

163
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:53,885
...when I close my hand
it becomes a fist.

164
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:59,345
And any time that I wish, I
can turn it against you.

165
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,605
I understand. But we're talking
about different things.

166
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:05,356
I'm talking about civic duty.
Responsibilites we owe to the people.

167
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:08,446
Schools and hospitals. Sewers
and utilities.

168
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:12,736
Street construction, repairs and
sweeping. Business and saloon licences...

169
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:36,267
St. Michael the Archangel...

170
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:38,477
Defend us in battle.

171
00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:42,517
Be our protector against the snares
and the wickedness of the devil.

172
00:21:43,107 --> 00:21:45,817
Streetcars, ferries,
rubbish disposal.

173
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,487
There's a power of money to
be made in this city, Bill.

174
00:21:48,697 --> 00:21:52,527
With your help, the people must
be made to understand...

175
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:57,367
...that all these things are best
kept, in what I like to call the
Tammany family.

176
00:21:57,407 --> 00:22:01,417
That is why I am talking about
an alliance between our organisations.

177
00:22:02,077 --> 00:22:04,167
You're talking about muscle
work.

178
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:06,547
That too. Muscle to match
our spirit.

179
00:22:06,837 --> 00:22:08,717
You own the crushers, get
them to do it.

180
00:22:08,837 --> 00:22:10,378
The police? Oh, no! Jezus,no!

181
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:14,008
The appearance of the law must
be upheld.

182
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:16,808
Especially while it's been
broken.

183
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:31,448
Give me the strength, for what I
must do.

184
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:35,868
Who are you?

185
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,038
I said, who are you?
What are you doing here?

186
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:54,469
I just like it down here
is all.

187
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:58,179
See what's in his pockets,
Jimmy.

188
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:01,229
Now look, boys. I really don't
want to fight.

189
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:02,349
You don't want to fight?

190
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:04,599
Don't worry, son. Ain't gonna
be much of a fight.

191
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:13,909
Don't kill me.

192
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,170
Where did you get that?

193
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,830
I told you I didn't want
to fight!

194
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,670
Why not?

195
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,510
Look how good you done.

196
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,100
You're the priest's son
aren't you?

197
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,770
You! Get away from me.
You understand?

198
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,810
You don't remember me, do you?

199
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,400
I was the one tried to help
you.

200
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,070
What?

201
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,241
I was the one tried to help
you.

202
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:53,531
When the Natives took you.

203
00:23:58,531 --> 00:23:58,951
That was you?

204
00:23:59,411 --> 00:24:01,871
Yeah. I thought you was killed.

205
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:07,711
They just locked me up
You know that.

206
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:08,961
This long?

207
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:12,171
I kept trying to escape, you know.

208
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:14,261
Did more time for that.

209
00:24:16,381 --> 00:24:17,721
So what are you doing back
here?

210
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:21,011
Guess I missed the place.

211
00:24:28,562 --> 00:24:29,562
Bowery boys.

212
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:46,462
The Five Points.
Paradise square!

213
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:49,332
The streets here are always
livelier in the evening.

214
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:52,592
Who are the gangs around now?

215
00:24:53,002 --> 00:24:55,212
We got the Daybreak boys
and the Swamp Angels.

216
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:56,762
They work the River
Luton ships.

217
00:24:57,182 --> 00:25:00,142
The Frog Haulers shanghai sailors
down around the bay.

218
00:25:00,353 --> 00:25:04,183
Shortails were rough for awhile,
but they became a bunch of jackrolling
dandies.

219
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:06,733
Lolling around Murderer's Alley
looking like Chinamen.

220
00:25:07,063 --> 00:25:09,523
Hellcat Maggie she tried to open
up her own grog shop.

221
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:12,823
But she drunk up all her own
liquor and got thrown out
on the street.

222
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:14,903
Now she's on the lay
for everything.

223
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:17,903
The Plug Uglies they're from
somewhere in the old country.

224
00:25:18,323 --> 00:25:19,033
They got their own language.

225
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:20,373
No one understands what they're
saying.

226
00:25:20,783 --> 00:25:21,913
They love to fight the cops.

227
00:25:22,493 --> 00:25:24,623
And the Nightwalkers and Ratpickers.

228
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:26,793
They work on their backs and
kill with their hands.

229
00:25:27,463 --> 00:25:28,833
They're so scurvy, only the
Plug Uglies...

230
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:29,623
...will talk with them.

231
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,173
But who knows what they're
saying.

232
00:25:31,543 --> 00:25:35,924
The Slaughterhouses and the
Broadway Twisters are a fine
bunch of Bengal boys!

233
00:25:35,924 --> 00:25:37,264
And the little  Forty Thieves.

234
00:25:37,264 --> 00:25:38,844
I used to run with them
for a while.

235
00:25:38,844 --> 00:25:41,804
Till they got taken over by
Benjer the Cockroach and his red
eyed buggers.

236
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:43,054
Benjer is a germ.

237
00:25:43,764 --> 00:25:44,644
If you try to leave the
gang, they say...

238
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:45,854
...he hacks the blood off you.

239
00:25:46,854 --> 00:25:49,984
The righteousness are nothing but
a bunch of repetitious grab ups..

240
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,154
The True Blue Americans call
themselves a gang...

241
00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:56,364
...but all they really do is stand
around on corners damning Engeland.

242
00:25:56,694 --> 00:25:59,114
Do you believe one word that
the British say...?

243
00:25:59,864 --> 00:26:02,124
Anything about the sand of
the Dead Rabbits?

244
00:26:06,874 --> 00:26:08,084
You don't say that name!

245
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,375
That name died with your...

246
00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:12,545
It's been outlawed.

247
00:26:14,425 --> 00:26:16,135
When I was in the blockhouse,
the chinks told me...

248
00:26:16,135 --> 00:26:17,845
...that the Natives celebrate
their victory...

249
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:19,015
....every year.

250
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:20,725
Is that true?

251
00:26:21,305 --> 00:26:22,435
Aye, that they do.

252
00:26:22,845 --> 00:26:23,805
It's quite a fair.

253
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:25,565
The Butcher himself has got
to invite you...

254
00:26:25,565 --> 00:26:26,435
...or you don't go.

255
00:26:37,615 --> 00:26:39,115
Look where you are going, Johnny!

256
00:26:43,286 --> 00:26:44,826
You look stunned and
poorly, sir!

257
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:52,336
Quite a pair of conversationists
aren't you!

258
00:26:55,886 --> 00:26:58,176
Maybe not. We're deep
thinkers.

259
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:07,896
Gentlemen, I leave you in the grace
and favour of the Lord!

260
00:27:16,026 --> 00:27:18,527
Jenny, finest bludget in all
the Points.

261
00:27:19,077 --> 00:27:21,327
She is a prim looking
star gazer!

262
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:25,747
But I'd check my pockets
if I were you.

263
00:27:26,627 --> 00:27:28,837
Because I do believe she lifted
your time piece.

264
00:27:33,627 --> 00:27:35,047
I let her take it.

265
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:37,967
I let here take things all
the time.

266
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:40,137
Is that right?

267
00:27:40,387 --> 00:27:40,927
Yeah.

268
00:27:46,687 --> 00:27:49,107
We always liked a good fire
in the Points.

269
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:52,988
You generally pick up a swag
and if the cops came along...

270
00:27:52,988 --> 00:27:55,108
...you really got a show.

271
00:27:56,158 --> 00:27:58,828
The municipal police fought
the metropolitan police.

272
00:27:59,948 --> 00:28:02,948
The metropolitan police fought
the streetgangs.

273
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,538
Hurry up before the Black
Joke get here!

274
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:07,708
There were 37 amateur fire-
brigades.

275
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:09,538
They all fought each other.

276
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:11,418
The Black Joke are on
their way!

277
00:28:17,718 --> 00:28:22,468
Okay boys, get the hoses!

278
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:31,149
It's the Black Joke!

279
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:33,279
Go get 'm boys!

280
00:28:34,689 --> 00:28:36,449
Give those Bowery boys
help!

281
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,609
Quick before there's nothing
left!

282
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:40,579
Go back to the Bowery,
ya bum!

283
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,579
For gods sake. They're taking
everything!

284
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:45,409
In your next time of trouble
ma'm....

285
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:46,869
...call Tammany first!

286
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:48,999
It's not too late. You can
still save my house!

287
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:51,419
Let's go!

288
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:54,919
I thought you said you
were hungry!

289
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,890
Grab what you can. Let's get
out of here!

290
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,480
May I point out that this building
is burning to ashes?

291
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,600
And may I point out that this
area is the provenance...

292
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,190
..of my own America's firebrigade.

293
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,900
And that you lot only belong
in the Bowery.

294
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,900
May I point out that you are
outmanned, outmanouvered...

295
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,910
...and at the moment outfought!

296
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,030
Am I?

297
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,380
There's the Black Joke!

298
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,751
Let's get 'm!

299
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:38,971
Clear the way for
Bill the Butcher.

300
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:41,761
Okay boys, to work!

301
00:29:43,101 --> 00:29:44,101
What's the point?

302
00:29:44,101 --> 00:29:46,811
The fire's near burnt eveything
of value inside.

303
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:50,481
Boys forget that one.
Next building over.

304
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:51,941
Mustn't let it spread!

305
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:53,401
Grab what you want from
that one!

306
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:56,651
What are you doing? There's
nothing wrong with this one!

307
00:30:19,802 --> 00:30:21,302
Come on. Johnny. Get up!

308
00:30:22,262 --> 00:30:22,722
Leave that.

309
00:30:31,272 --> 00:30:32,152
You two, on your way!

310
00:30:50,293 --> 00:30:51,463
His name's Amsterdam.

311
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:55,593
How's the beak?

312
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:57,343
Ain't so bad.

313
00:30:58,053 --> 00:31:01,053
You. You got anything or you
can get out.

314
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:13,943
Is that it?

315
00:31:15,484 --> 00:31:16,064
That's it.

316
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,034
Right. Here's the rake.

317
00:31:20,494 --> 00:31:22,074
Everything comes here we
fence it.

318
00:31:22,324 --> 00:31:25,624
Johnny takes our tribute to the
Natives and we chop up....

319
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:28,624
....the winnings, each to his
equal portion of the gang.

320
00:31:29,744 --> 00:31:31,914
Does that meet with your
approval, Hell Gate?

321
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:34,504
My approval?

322
00:31:35,254 --> 00:31:37,674
What's the matter Jack Sprat,
can't you think for yourself!

323
00:31:39,804 --> 00:31:41,634
I'll slit your fucking throat!

324
00:31:47,684 --> 00:31:50,645
You boys settle with me, before
settling with each other.

325
00:31:55,105 --> 00:31:56,945
I come for my due
and proper.

326
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,255
This ain't a bad haul.

327
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:22,425
You know, when the folks say the
country is going to hell...

328
00:32:23,136 --> 00:32:25,846
...I always tell them, look at
all the hard work...

329
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:28,726
..our fine young lads are doing
down in the Points.

330
00:32:29,856 --> 00:32:33,606
Oh, yeah. This is just the
thing for Mrs. Mulraney.

331
00:32:34,146 --> 00:32:38,196
Alright Happy Jack. Leave us for
something to give Bill de Butcher.

332
00:32:38,736 --> 00:32:39,316
Would ya?

333
00:32:52,296 --> 00:32:53,876
Not my favorite tune.

334
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:03,057
Thank you, boys.

335
00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:06,597
You keep out of trouble
now.

336
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:30,077
Every year the Natives celebrated
the killing of my father all over again.

337
00:33:31,748 --> 00:33:34,958
At Sparrow's Chinese Pagoda
in Mott street.

338
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:39,508
The chinks hated the Natives
worse than we did.

339
00:33:43,928 --> 00:33:47,768
The drum rolls and the Butcher
drinks a glass of fire.

340
00:33:51,768 --> 00:33:56,648
When you kill a king, you don't
stab him in the dark.

341
00:33:59,358 --> 00:34:03,988
You kill him where the whole
court can watch him die.

342
00:34:08,499 --> 00:34:09,709
Got any timber?

343
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,930
Hi, Maggie. Rightie or leftie?

344
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,760
Give us a drink.

345
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,850
Help yourself.

346
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,310
Two minutes. Place
your bets.

347
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:17,731
Gentlemen. The match is due
to commence.

348
00:35:18,071 --> 00:35:21,441
The count to be is,
25 rodents in 3 minutes.

349
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:23,151
Rouser against the vermin.

350
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:25,161
Satisfied?

351
00:35:25,451 --> 00:35:26,201
50!

352
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:26,741
Yes!

353
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:42,671
Where are you going, boil?

354
00:35:43,631 --> 00:35:44,931
I'm here to pay tribute
to Bill.

355
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:45,761
Are you now?

356
00:35:46,181 --> 00:35:47,512
Give it to me. I'll give
it to him.

357
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:49,222
No thanks. I'll give it to
him myself.

358
00:35:52,232 --> 00:35:54,692
What do you want to keep, the
money or your teeth?

359
00:35:54,692 --> 00:35:55,272
John?

360
00:35:57,272 --> 00:35:57,942
Welcome.

361
00:36:07,162 --> 00:36:08,242
From me and the lads, sir.

362
00:36:16,252 --> 00:36:17,132
Mate of yours?

363
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:18,422
Where's he from?

364
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:21,302
He's not from here, sir.

365
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:25,723
YOU!

366
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:45,283
That's close enough!

367
00:36:57,464 --> 00:36:58,924
Your friend can't look me
in the eye...

368
00:36:58,924 --> 00:37:00,884
...that's not an admirable
characteristic.

369
00:37:02,214 --> 00:37:03,594
No one can look you in the
eye, Bill..

370
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,424
...not when you're playing
cards.

371
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,244
This is whist, it's a
gentleman's game.

372
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:28,454
Make a gentleman's bet.

373
00:37:28,824 --> 00:37:30,075
I am betting large, Bill!

374
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:31,665
That ain't large.

375
00:37:41,505 --> 00:37:43,465
Don't make that noise
again, Harvey.

376
00:37:47,095 --> 00:37:49,935
I like a man who's willing
to burn for his swag.

377
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:56,105
How do you fair on water?
Come closer.

378
00:37:56,935 --> 00:37:58,395
Closer. I ain't gonna bite!

379
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,696
There's a Portugese ship lying
low in the harbour....

380
00:38:05,946 --> 00:38:07,536
...quarantined three weeks.

381
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:09,996
Get there before the Day Break
Boys strip her.

382
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,536
Maybe you and me wil talk
some more.

383
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:12,576
Consider it done, sir.

384
00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:13,416
Good boy.

385
00:38:15,286 --> 00:38:16,166
And you...

386
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:16,956
...whatever you name is.

387
00:38:16,956 --> 00:38:17,796
What is your name?

388
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:23,716
Amsterdam, sir.

389
00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:25,846
Amsterdam?

390
00:38:27,176 --> 00:38:28,516
I'm New York.

391
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:31,686
Don't you ever come in
here empty handed again.

392
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:34,106
You gotta pay for the pleasure
of my company.

393
00:38:35,266 --> 00:38:36,816
Take him for a boat ride, John.

394
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,857
Maybe he'll save your life
again.

395
00:38:44,737 --> 00:38:47,327
If the Day Break boys catch us on
this river, they'll slit our throats!

396
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:49,747
I'll do it myself, if you don't
keep quiet!

397
00:38:50,407 --> 00:38:52,617
I never liked the harbour
after dark.

398
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:57,047
And now each night they brought
on shore the bodies of the soldiers.

399
00:38:57,047 --> 00:39:01,007
So many mothers don't even have the solace
of knowing where their sons have fallen.

400
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:04,217
I lost my own eldest in Antida.

401
00:39:04,757 --> 00:39:07,307
His mother and I weren't able
to recover his remains.

402
00:39:07,307 --> 00:39:08,597
It was a mournful sight.

403
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,137
The war can't last forever.

404
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:12,228
But we had business of our
own.

405
00:39:21,898 --> 00:39:23,608
The Day Break boys have already
been here.

406
00:39:23,608 --> 00:39:25,368
There's nothing left. Let's
go back.

407
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:31,368
What in hell...?

408
00:39:39,798 --> 00:39:41,048
Jimmy..get down!

409
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:46,799
Jezus..that'll bring the
harbour cops for sure!

410
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:47,639
Out of the way!

411
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:56,479
Let's take a look.

412
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:02,239
Jezus..they killed everybody!

413
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:03,699
There's nothing here but...

414
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:05,819
Watch it....dead sea crabs.

415
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,119
Come on! Let's go.

416
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:10,659
Shove off!

417
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,369
No. Wait for Amsterdam!

418
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,409
Where is Amsterdam?

419
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,419
Take him, damn fool!

420
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:19,419
What in the hell for?

421
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:21,840
Look in my glims. I said no
less than 15!

422
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,090
Is this fresh?

423
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,550
Four hours most.

424
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,180
Much obliged, gents.

425
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,520
What's that word?

426
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,520
It means bodysnatchers.

427
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,820
I didn't ask the meaning.
I asked the word.

428
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,570
Ghoul?

429
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,740
Ghoul?

430
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,120
That's a good word.

431
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,871
A fresh outrage in the
Five Points.

432
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:57,871
A notice that you can
be proud of.

433
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:58,751
Thank you.

434
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:02,001
Low thing, to do that to
a body.

435
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:02,921
Low.

436
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,171
Why? They could've left that
ship with nothing.

437
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,761
Instead they made the Police
Gazette.

438
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:08,591
A periodical of note.

439
00:41:09,591 --> 00:41:11,761
A body is supposed to stay
beneath the earth....

440
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,311
...wearing a wooden coat...

441
00:41:13,311 --> 00:41:15,141
..until the resurrection.

442
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:18,771
These two are just a pair of
bug eating sons of Irish bitches.
Just like you.

443
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:19,941
Don't seem to bother them none.

444
00:41:20,861 --> 00:41:23,071
Maybe they don't share your
religious scruples.

445
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:26,361
Maybe they're just a couple
of fiddeling bends.

446
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:33,662
I've been called a lot of things,
mister...

447
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:34,912
...but I've never been called..?

448
00:41:36,502 --> 00:41:37,502
Fiddeling bends.

449
00:41:37,502 --> 00:41:38,372
Fiddeling bends. Right.

450
00:41:42,212 --> 00:41:43,842
If I knew what in the hell
that meant..

451
00:41:44,632 --> 00:41:46,342
...I might be inclined to
take offense.

452
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,382
A fiddeling bend is a fellow
who would steal anything...

453
00:41:49,932 --> 00:41:50,932
...dead or alive.

454
00:41:50,932 --> 00:41:54,352
Because he's too low to work up a
decent lay for himself.

455
00:41:54,352 --> 00:41:55,682
Count that careful.

456
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,102
I'm telling you that's all there
is. That's all they gave us.

457
00:41:58,102 --> 00:41:58,772
That's all they gave us.

458
00:41:58,772 --> 00:41:59,352
Chiseler!

459
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:02,813
If you had said chiseler, now
that's a word I understand.

460
00:42:03,823 --> 00:42:05,073
Is that what you're calling us?

461
00:42:05,073 --> 00:42:07,573
I can think of a number of things
to call you, boil!

462
00:42:07,573 --> 00:42:10,493
Right. But I asked if you was
calling us chiselers?

463
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:13,283
Supposing I am?

464
00:42:16,293 --> 00:42:17,543
Well, then we got business.

465
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:21,003
That we do!

466
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:31,973
2 dollars on McGloin!

467
00:42:33,973 --> 00:42:34,553
5 pieces on the kid!

468
00:42:35,513 --> 00:42:36,264
5 on Amsterdam!

469
00:42:46,274 --> 00:42:48,194
Come on, McGloin, it's
just a kid.

470
00:42:59,754 --> 00:43:01,584
Watch his left, McGloin!

471
00:43:41,545 --> 00:43:43,375
Alright, that'll do.

472
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:44,626
What do you say now, huh?

473
00:43:45,176 --> 00:43:46,636
That'll do, for Christ sake.

474
00:43:46,636 --> 00:43:47,636
Drag him off.

475
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:49,096
That's enough, kid.

476
00:43:49,966 --> 00:43:51,216
You got him.

477
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:23,007
McGloin? How would that head
look without the ears and nose on it?

478
00:44:25,127 --> 00:44:27,427
You'd better leave that head
alone, Bill.

479
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:31,387
I think I'm gonna trim the beak
and the ears off that head.

480
00:44:32,597 --> 00:44:34,597
Make a nice pot of soup out of
that head.

481
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:36,807
You can find a tastier head
than that, Bill.

482
00:44:37,727 --> 00:44:40,267
I ain't got no stomach
for an Irish stew.

483
00:44:43,857 --> 00:44:45,277
The mighty McGloin.

484
00:44:45,857 --> 00:44:47,907
Almost fish hooked by
a sprat.

485
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,708
On the seventh day the Lord rested.

486
00:45:00,128 --> 00:45:01,168
But before that He did...

487
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:03,878
...He squatted over the side
of England...

488
00:45:03,878 --> 00:45:07,758
...and what came out of him?
Ireland!

489
00:45:08,048 --> 00:45:09,008
No offense, son.

490
00:45:09,008 --> 00:45:10,298
None taken, sir.

491
00:45:10,638 --> 00:45:11,758
I grew up here.

492
00:45:12,058 --> 00:45:15,728
AllI ever knew of Ireland was in
the talk of others in the asylum.

493
00:45:16,928 --> 00:45:21,228
From which part of that
excrementitous island were your
forebares spawn?

494
00:45:21,858 --> 00:45:23,898
I've been told Carrey.

495
00:45:23,898 --> 00:45:26,358
But I lost proof of it in my
language in the asylum.

496
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:30,779
I was raised in a similar
establishment myself.

497
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:34,329
Everything you see belongs to
me, to degree or another.

498
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:37,869
But beggars, quick thieves,
here in Paradise..

499
00:45:38,209 --> 00:45:41,329
...gymmills, blind tigers on
the waterfront...

500
00:45:41,749 --> 00:45:44,499
...anglers and the musers. The
she-he's and the chinks.

501
00:45:44,799 --> 00:45:46,919
Everybody owes...

502
00:45:46,919 --> 00:45:48,049
...everybody pays, because...

503
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:52,049
...that's how you stand up,
to the rising of the tide.

504
00:45:52,929 --> 00:45:54,099
Is that right boys?

505
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:55,099
Yes Bill, that's right.

506
00:45:56,469 --> 00:45:58,059
Enlist. Join up! Serve
your country.

507
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,820
Volunteer and get your 50
dollar bonus!

508
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,530
We need 30,000 volunteers..

509
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:10,570
...and we're prepared to pay
677 dollar per volunteer.

510
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:12,530
Please read this. Thank you.

511
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,700
Would you like one to
fill out?

512
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,410
3 square meals a day.

513
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,210
3 square meals a day.
Young man?

514
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,420
Enlist and...

515
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,290
...serve you country.

516
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:23,960
3 square meals a day, gentlemen!

517
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:27,710
If you're interested, I suggest...

518
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:30,430
Everywhere you went, people
talked about the daft.

519
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,680
You could buy your way
out for 300 dollars.

520
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,601
But who had 300 dollars?

521
00:46:35,891 --> 00:46:38,731
For us it had might as well
been 3 millions.

522
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:41,691
The recruters were too scared
of the gangs...

523
00:46:41,691 --> 00:46:43,151
...to come after us.

524
00:46:43,441 --> 00:46:45,611
Besides, we never dreamt the war..

525
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:48,321
...would ever touch
New York.

526
00:46:48,321 --> 00:46:49,571
Good morning, sir.

527
00:46:51,741 --> 00:46:52,411
You!

528
00:46:53,451 --> 00:46:54,621
Don't you run into me.

529
00:46:56,741 --> 00:46:57,451
Fair enough!

530
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:04,751
I said don't run in to me!

531
00:47:05,921 --> 00:47:06,461
Sorry!

532
00:47:13,592 --> 00:47:14,512
Everything in place?

533
00:47:15,602 --> 00:47:16,472
It seems so.

534
00:47:17,182 --> 00:47:19,772
Then I leave you in the grace
and favour of the Lord.

535
00:47:20,182 --> 00:47:20,932
Thank you.

536
00:47:30,032 --> 00:47:31,612
Why that dirty...!

537
00:47:37,162 --> 00:47:37,782
Oh, no!

538
00:47:39,372 --> 00:47:40,162
Allow me!

539
00:47:43,543 --> 00:47:44,753
Thank you kindly, sir.

540
00:47:45,213 --> 00:47:46,383
It's my pleasure.

541
00:47:47,793 --> 00:47:48,923
I hope you don't mind if
I speak...

542
00:47:48,923 --> 00:47:51,263
..I don't want to appear forward.

543
00:47:52,513 --> 00:47:55,933
Well sir, that depends on what you
say!

544
00:48:05,233 --> 00:48:09,113
Would you call me wreckless, if I say
that you are the prettiest girl
in New York?

545
00:48:09,823 --> 00:48:11,483
Only New York?

546
00:48:14,283 --> 00:48:15,113
This is my stop.

547
00:48:17,664 --> 00:48:19,874
May I walk with you a little
then?

548
00:48:20,954 --> 00:48:23,504
That sir...would be too bold.

549
00:48:50,734 --> 00:48:53,445
For every lay we had a
different name.

550
00:48:54,535 --> 00:48:56,745
An Angler put a hook on the
end of a stick...

551
00:48:56,995 --> 00:48:59,415
...to drop behind store
windows and doors.

552
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:02,875
An Autumn diver picked your
pocket in church.

553
00:49:04,005 --> 00:49:06,465
A Badger, gets a fellow in bed
with a girl...

554
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:09,215
..and robs his pockets when
they're on the go.

555
00:49:10,175 --> 00:49:11,885
Jenny was a Bludger..

556
00:49:12,305 --> 00:49:13,765
...a girl pickpocket.

557
00:49:14,175 --> 00:49:16,635
And a Turtle dove.

558
00:49:19,515 --> 00:49:21,895
A Turtle dove goes uptown...

559
00:49:21,895 --> 00:49:22,895
...dressed like a housemaid.

560
00:49:22,895 --> 00:49:24,185
Picks out a fine house...

561
00:49:24,185 --> 00:49:28,736
...and goes right through the
back door. Robs you blind.

562
00:49:30,776 --> 00:49:33,526
It takes a lot of sand to
be a Turtle dove.

563
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:57,096
I'll have my medal back.

564
00:49:57,346 --> 00:49:58,386
Oh, jezus.

565
00:50:06,567 --> 00:50:07,527
Don't do that again.

566
00:50:08,817 --> 00:50:10,407
I said, don't do that!

567
00:50:11,277 --> 00:50:13,657
Go back to the Points
and let me do my business...

568
00:50:13,657 --> 00:50:15,787
...or I will open your throat.

569
00:50:20,707 --> 00:50:21,117
Alright.

570
00:50:24,247 --> 00:50:25,087
Go on then.

571
00:50:28,297 --> 00:50:29,217
I would.

572
00:50:31,967 --> 00:50:32,717
Go on then.

573
00:50:56,868 --> 00:50:58,118
Give me back my medal.

574
00:50:58,578 --> 00:50:59,578
Make it quick.

575
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:09,759
I don't know which one's
yours.

576
00:51:17,509 --> 00:51:19,429
Suppose I help myself to
everything.

577
00:51:22,769 --> 00:51:23,939
Suppose you do.

578
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:05,350
Shall I walk with you a
little, then?

579
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:17,371
What do you suppose a fellow
can earn up here in a day?

580
00:52:18,121 --> 00:52:19,531
Maybe we can pile in together?

581
00:52:19,531 --> 00:52:22,661
I think you're a bit rough for
this game.

582
00:52:23,251 --> 00:52:25,211
Besides, I work alone.

583
00:52:26,211 --> 00:52:26,831
Alone?

584
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:28,961
What do you core to
the Butcher?

585
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:29,841
Nothing.

586
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:31,251
Nothing?

587
00:52:31,671 --> 00:52:33,671
The Butcher and me have a
special arrangement.

588
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:43,021
I don't want to see
you again!

589
00:52:43,021 --> 00:52:44,431
I don't blame you.

590
00:52:46,561 --> 00:52:48,811
Pennies in their pockets and
hope in their eyes.

591
00:52:49,271 --> 00:52:50,732
They peer to the west.

592
00:52:51,442 --> 00:52:54,862
Searching the horizon for a
glimpse of land and salvation.

593
00:52:57,862 --> 00:52:59,452
A glimpse of America.

594
00:52:59,992 --> 00:53:03,042
Seeing all this poverty must be
most unsettling, Mrs. Schermerhorn?

595
00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:06,462
Some days the uptown gangs
came to us.

596
00:53:07,422 --> 00:53:10,592
The Schermerhorns were one of the
oldest families in New York.

597
00:53:11,172 --> 00:53:12,212
They didn't run the city..

598
00:53:12,882 --> 00:53:15,722
...but they were listened to quite
carefully, by them who did.

599
00:53:15,722 --> 00:53:17,302
Commissioner Brunt, said you
wanted to view the Points....

600
00:53:17,302 --> 00:53:19,342
...in all its splendor an
squalor.

601
00:53:19,762 --> 00:53:22,142
Spare nothing concerning the
conditions, said he!

602
00:53:22,512 --> 00:53:25,313
Nothing except our safety,
constable.

603
00:53:25,643 --> 00:53:29,353
I'm sure we can be in no danger
while we're in the constable's
company, my dear!

604
00:53:29,353 --> 00:53:31,483
Quite so, madam. Witness!

605
00:53:40,203 --> 00:53:41,493
Shall we continue on?

606
00:53:41,493 --> 00:53:43,083
You dare to leave it there?

607
00:53:43,373 --> 00:53:44,873
Safe as a bank, Mr. Greely.

608
00:53:45,243 --> 00:53:46,543
They all know it's mine.

609
00:53:48,163 --> 00:53:49,543
Is that man drunk?

610
00:53:49,923 --> 00:53:52,173
Dead as good friday, miss.

611
00:53:57,514 --> 00:53:58,804
Good day, Mulraney.

612
00:53:59,344 --> 00:53:59,974
Boys?

613
00:53:59,974 --> 00:54:00,344
Jack?

614
00:54:00,764 --> 00:54:01,934
Slum socialable?

615
00:54:01,934 --> 00:54:04,224
Track finding. Reform studying.

616
00:54:04,764 --> 00:54:05,394
May I present...

617
00:54:05,394 --> 00:54:09,644
The Schermerhorns hardly require
an introduction from you, Jack.

618
00:54:09,644 --> 00:54:11,694
Mrs. Schermerhorn and her
daughter.

619
00:54:12,234 --> 00:54:12,774
The gentleman of course is...

620
00:54:12,774 --> 00:54:14,864
Mr. Greely. The famous
publisher.

621
00:54:14,864 --> 00:54:15,984
It's a pleasure and an
honour, sir.

622
00:54:17,114 --> 00:54:17,994
Of the Tribune.

623
00:54:17,994 --> 00:54:19,074
I am William Cutting.

624
00:54:20,954 --> 00:54:22,244
How do you do, Mr. Cutting?

625
00:54:24,874 --> 00:54:26,544
As of this moment,
extremely well.

626
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:27,584
How do you do?

627
00:54:28,964 --> 00:54:31,084
Orange blossom. Delicious!

628
00:54:31,675 --> 00:54:33,085
Mr. Cutting is...

629
00:54:33,425 --> 00:54:35,845
What a peach! You had a fine
carreer on the stage.

630
00:54:35,965 --> 00:54:37,675
...one of the Five Points local...

631
00:54:37,675 --> 00:54:38,515
Please to meet you, sir.

632
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:39,885
..leaders.

633
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:40,685
Mr. Greely!

634
00:54:40,685 --> 00:54:41,725
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Cutting.

635
00:54:41,725 --> 00:54:42,595
The Five Points welcomes you..

636
00:54:42,595 --> 00:54:43,855
...to these streets...

637
00:54:44,435 --> 00:54:45,815
..and you shall pas in
safety.

638
00:54:46,975 --> 00:54:48,565
I'll see to their safety.

639
00:54:49,395 --> 00:54:50,185
Thank you, Bill.

640
00:54:50,985 --> 00:54:51,735
This way.

641
00:54:52,275 --> 00:54:53,105
Good day lads.

642
00:54:53,565 --> 00:54:55,155
Criminals who brag
a dote show.

643
00:54:55,575 --> 00:54:56,325
He knows who I am!

644
00:54:56,325 --> 00:54:58,615
Inderdeed, sir. You are well
known in these parts.

645
00:55:00,535 --> 00:55:03,575
I find that strangely flattering.

646
00:55:03,575 --> 00:55:04,995
Never did like crushers.

647
00:55:04,995 --> 00:55:06,036
Well draw it mild, son.

648
00:55:06,456 --> 00:55:09,456
Happy Jack don't fill his lungs
without me telling him to.

649
00:55:23,596 --> 00:55:25,606
Do you think my watch would be
safe in that lamp post, Bill?

650
00:55:29,066 --> 00:55:30,606
Why don't you hang it
up there and see?

651
00:55:34,236 --> 00:55:35,026
Some day.

652
00:55:37,196 --> 00:55:38,446
Some day is right.

653
00:55:40,327 --> 00:55:41,327
Is this the new lad?

654
00:55:43,037 --> 00:55:47,087
just another bastard I folded
in the warmth of my embrace.

655
00:55:50,627 --> 00:55:51,627
Hey!

656
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:53,217
Just wanted to see your face,
son.

657
00:55:54,177 --> 00:55:55,217
No harm intended.

658
00:56:19,278 --> 00:56:21,288
You get to know a lot by
butchering meat.

659
00:56:23,828 --> 00:56:25,418
We're made up of the same
things.

660
00:56:25,418 --> 00:56:28,538
Flesh and blood. Tissue. Organs.

661
00:56:29,998 --> 00:56:31,668
I love to work with pigs.

662
00:56:32,878 --> 00:56:36,968
The nearest thing in nature to
the flesh of a man, is the
flesh a pig.

663
00:56:38,218 --> 00:56:39,098
Pig, huh?

664
00:56:39,548 --> 00:56:39,798
That's right.

665
00:56:40,808 --> 00:56:41,848
This is for you, mother.

666
00:56:45,808 --> 00:56:46,518
Here you are.

667
00:56:47,899 --> 00:56:48,729
God bless you.

668
00:56:50,269 --> 00:56:51,729
She ain't really my mother.

669
00:56:52,819 --> 00:56:53,819
I knew that, Bill.

670
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:00,159
This is the liver.

671
00:57:01,699 --> 00:57:04,829
The kidneys. The heart.

672
00:57:05,749 --> 00:57:08,919
This is a wound.
The stomach will bleed and bleed.

673
00:57:09,289 --> 00:57:10,419
This is a kill.

674
00:57:11,209 --> 00:57:12,299
This is a kill.

675
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:15,589
And the artery. This is a kill.

676
00:57:18,129 --> 00:57:19,049
You try it.

677
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,060
Go ahead.

678
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:52,670
Don't follow the blade
on the rib.

679
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:53,880
Very good!

680
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:54,800
And the artery.

681
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:58,551
Bleed 'm slow. Let them think
about it for a while.

682
00:57:58,551 --> 00:57:59,511
Slow death.

683
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:00,221
Good!

684
00:58:02,971 --> 00:58:04,761
You'll each bill the city
5000 dollars a month...

685
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:06,061
..for supplies and services..

686
00:58:06,271 --> 00:58:07,681
...for which you will
receive 10%.

687
00:58:08,101 --> 00:58:12,061
Bill! Mr. Glour will work out
the details. Thank you.

688
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:14,401
That's how we do things
around Tammany, gentlemen.

689
00:58:15,231 --> 00:58:16,231
Who's this?

690
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:19,531
Thank you, boys.

691
00:58:20,241 --> 00:58:21,111
Good day, sir.

692
00:58:34,092 --> 00:58:35,422
You got something on
your mind?

693
00:58:39,552 --> 00:58:40,842
Bill's taking quite a liking
to you.

694
00:58:44,222 --> 00:58:45,262
If you're up to something..

695
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:50,022
...I don't want no
part in it.

696
00:58:55,112 --> 00:58:56,982
I was in Hell Gate for
16 years.

697
00:58:58,992 --> 00:59:00,742
I'm just trying to make my
way is all...

698
00:59:01,532 --> 00:59:02,702
...just like you.

699
00:59:04,323 --> 00:59:06,453
Less of course you got
a better notion?

700
00:59:08,453 --> 00:59:09,003
No.

701
00:59:10,873 --> 00:59:13,883
I can't get a days work
done...

702
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,003
...for all the good citizens
coming here..

703
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:17,633
...harrassing me about
crime in the Points.

704
00:59:18,463 --> 00:59:21,923
Some even go so far to accuse
Tammany of connivance..

705
00:59:22,303 --> 00:59:24,643
..in this so called rampant
criminality.

706
00:59:25,053 --> 00:59:26,933
What can I do?
I can't have this.

707
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:28,183
Something has to be done.

708
00:59:28,183 --> 00:59:29,563
What do you have in mind?

709
00:59:29,563 --> 00:59:32,643
I don't know. Maybe we
should hang someone.

710
00:59:34,233 --> 00:59:34,943
Who?

711
00:59:35,153 --> 00:59:37,863
No one important necessarily.

712
00:59:37,863 --> 00:59:40,444
Back alley thieves, with
no affiliations.

713
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:42,204
How many?

714
00:59:42,784 --> 00:59:43,744
3 or 4.

715
00:59:45,324 --> 00:59:46,074
Which?

716
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:47,494
Vier.

717
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:53,794
You stand here convicted..

718
00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:56,254
...of ludeness, jackrolling...

719
00:59:56,254 --> 01:00:01,514
...sneak thievery, chloral
hydrating, sodomy..

720
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:07,104
...strangulation and corruption
of the public good.

721
01:00:11,104 --> 01:00:11,684
Chin up.

722
01:00:11,974 --> 01:00:13,645
Handsome bunch of gallows
food!

723
01:00:13,645 --> 01:00:14,395
There's my old friend.

724
01:00:14,395 --> 01:00:15,525
How are you feeling, Arthur?

725
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:17,115
I'm okay. Okay you know.

726
01:00:17,525 --> 01:00:20,485
Say hello to Amsterdam.
He nearly fish hooked McGloin.

727
01:00:20,485 --> 01:00:21,235
Nearly!

728
01:00:21,865 --> 01:00:23,535
I see that you are dressed for
the occasion, Arthur.

729
01:00:23,955 --> 01:00:26,205
You know me, Bill. Always
like to look me best.

730
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:27,375
That's the spirit.

731
01:00:28,955 --> 01:00:30,995
Nice locket. I'll give you
a dollar for it.

732
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,205
It's me mother's.

733
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:35,255
Dollar and a halve?

734
01:00:36,255 --> 01:00:37,085
Done.

735
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,805
I'll miss you, Arthur.

736
01:00:43,305 --> 01:00:44,725
See you in the hot
country, Shamus.

737
01:00:52,976 --> 01:00:54,856
Is my son present here?

738
01:00:56,566 --> 01:00:58,106
Where's my little fellow?

739
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,326
Look at your dad.

740
01:01:02,446 --> 01:01:04,156
Farewell dear boy.

741
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:08,746
I never struck a foul blow..

742
01:01:08,746 --> 01:01:10,876
..or turned a card.

743
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:15,126
May God greet me as a friend!

744
01:01:47,617 --> 01:01:50,207
That night the Reformers
held a dance.

745
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:52,207
That was the Five Points
alright....

746
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:56,168
...hangings in the morning,
a dance in the evening.

747
01:01:56,548 --> 01:01:57,758
To be sure!

748
01:01:58,628 --> 01:02:01,638
It's not a matter of words,
but by the way she smiles at me.

749
01:02:01,638 --> 01:02:03,348
She smiles at a lot of
people, John.

750
01:02:05,098 --> 01:02:07,638
A penny, for a fighting
Irishman?

751
01:02:12,058 --> 01:02:12,808
Are you from Carey?

752
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:14,188
I am sir.

753
01:02:16,478 --> 01:02:17,358
It ain't much.

754
01:02:17,778 --> 01:02:18,688
Thank you.

755
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:23,278
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
delighted to see so many young faces..

756
01:02:23,278 --> 01:02:25,658
...at our first annual
mission dance.

757
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,408
This will be a real circus!

758
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:30,579
The mission welcomes Christians
of every stamp...

759
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:33,959
...and we are happy to greet
our Roman catholic friends...

760
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:36,129
...who join us here tonight.

761
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:39,549
Ladies....come with me.

762
01:02:40,839 --> 01:02:43,299
We're going to start the dance
in just a moment.

763
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:48,559
Good evening, your Holyness.

764
01:02:51,389 --> 01:02:52,519
Good evening, Reverend.

765
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:54,979
You should have shaved
closer!

766
01:02:59,739 --> 01:03:00,989
Good evening, Reverend.

767
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:02,450
I'd like to make a pardon.

768
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:07,990
Miss...?

769
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:14,130
Everdeane.

770
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:16,040
Miss Everdeane.

771
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,930
Gentlemen, over here! If
you don't mind.

772
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,020
Thank you.

773
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:35,310
Open it. Hold it up!

774
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:39,901
Into the mirror.

775
01:04:33,252 --> 01:04:33,962
That one!

776
01:04:36,502 --> 01:04:38,542
Our queen has chosen.

777
01:04:58,233 --> 01:04:58,983
Sir...

778
01:05:00,153 --> 01:05:00,983
...your lady!

779
01:05:02,693 --> 01:05:05,863
Regular services are held in
the church at 6 and 8.

780
01:05:05,863 --> 01:05:06,703
Go to hell.

781
01:05:16,293 --> 01:05:17,423
What do you think your
doing?

782
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:18,543
I'm dancing.

783
01:05:18,543 --> 01:05:19,714
Why did you pick me?

784
01:05:20,544 --> 01:05:21,844
That's none of your business.

785
01:05:22,004 --> 01:05:23,464
Would you mind telling me?

786
01:05:24,714 --> 01:05:25,174
Sorry!

787
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:33,184
I'm not much of a dancer.

788
01:05:33,474 --> 01:05:34,774
Try and stay calm.

789
01:05:35,484 --> 01:05:37,484
I've never been to a dance
before!

790
01:05:37,484 --> 01:05:38,774
It's best not to look down.

791
01:05:41,944 --> 01:05:43,364
You can hold me tighter if
you like.

792
01:05:52,084 --> 01:05:52,494
Alright.

793
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:53,035
Okay!

794
01:05:55,915 --> 01:05:57,375
Why didn't you dance
with Johnny?

795
01:06:00,175 --> 01:06:01,215
Because...

796
01:06:04,095 --> 01:06:05,635
...I didn't want him.

797
01:07:04,697 --> 01:07:06,027
I'm not good in this.

798
01:07:14,457 --> 01:07:14,877
Wait!

799
01:07:14,877 --> 01:07:15,167
What?

800
01:07:15,587 --> 01:07:15,917
Wait.

801
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:18,877
How does this open?

802
01:07:19,337 --> 01:07:20,757
It takes too long to lace
back up...

803
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:22,217
...we'll be here all night.

804
01:07:34,727 --> 01:07:36,228
Alright. I'll take it off.

805
01:07:59,168 --> 01:08:00,918
There was a baby.
They cut it out.

806
01:08:06,178 --> 01:08:06,888
Sorry!

807
01:08:09,469 --> 01:08:10,349
It's fine.

808
01:08:15,099 --> 01:08:16,349
Have you got any scars?

809
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:19,899
A few.

810
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:19,921
What's that then?

811
01:09:21,461 --> 01:09:21,591
That?

812
01:09:22,751 --> 01:09:24,011
A gift from Mr. Cutting.

813
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:30,181
A gift?

814
01:09:31,891 --> 01:09:32,761
A gift!

815
01:09:35,021 --> 01:09:36,021
Was it your birthday?

816
01:09:37,771 --> 01:09:38,601
No.

817
01:09:43,611 --> 01:09:44,781
What did you give him?

818
01:09:48,201 --> 01:09:50,031
The answer to that has nothing
to do with you.

819
01:09:57,582 --> 01:09:59,752
Don't tell me you're angry
with me?

820
01:09:59,752 --> 01:10:02,042
No..I'm through with you.

821
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:09,762
Well, you're quicker then
most fellows...

822
01:10:09,762 --> 01:10:11,972
...generally they wait till
afterwards!

823
01:10:11,972 --> 01:10:14,262
I ain't interested..

824
01:10:14,262 --> 01:10:15,182
...in the Butcher's leavings.

825
01:10:35,703 --> 01:10:37,543
Stay away from the pikers.

826
01:10:37,543 --> 01:10:39,663
15 to 1. Bug Eye Ward!

827
01:10:39,663 --> 01:10:40,673
Amsterdam!

828
01:10:41,423 --> 01:10:43,253
Everyone was working
for the Butcher.

829
01:10:43,883 --> 01:10:44,963
We ran his errands..

830
01:10:44,963 --> 01:10:45,883
...made his money...

831
01:10:45,883 --> 01:10:46,593
...took a piece...

832
01:10:46,593 --> 01:10:47,843
...and said thank you, sir.

833
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:48,843
Gentlemen in the ring!

834
01:10:49,263 --> 01:10:50,683
Even Tweed!

835
01:10:50,883 --> 01:10:52,263
The fight's over!

836
01:10:52,263 --> 01:10:52,973
Even me.

837
01:10:54,973 --> 01:10:56,223
My father's son.

838
01:10:56,813 --> 01:10:57,563
What the hell is this?

839
01:10:57,973 --> 01:10:58,683
Sorry, Bill.

840
01:10:59,103 --> 01:11:00,444
The city ordenance against
boxing...

841
01:11:01,144 --> 01:11:02,984
...is a blight. I grant you.

842
01:11:02,904 --> 01:11:04,444
I'm losing money while
you speak.

843
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:06,274
Go out there and collect
those bets.

844
01:11:06,274 --> 01:11:08,154
How do I collect, if no one
won the fight?

845
01:11:08,534 --> 01:11:10,244
This counts as a no decision.

846
01:11:10,244 --> 01:11:11,284
You've got that covered,
right?

847
01:11:11,284 --> 01:11:13,114
Didn't anyone pay off the
god damn police?

848
01:11:13,114 --> 01:11:14,704
Yes, the municipal police...

849
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:15,914
...this is the metropolitan
police.

850
01:11:15,914 --> 01:11:17,454
You're going to repay me
every cent.

851
01:11:17,454 --> 01:11:18,454
Wait! Mr. Tweed!

852
01:11:18,454 --> 01:11:19,454
Who asked for your opinion?

853
01:11:19,454 --> 01:11:20,254
Let him speak!

854
01:11:20,834 --> 01:11:22,174
We don't answer to you.

855
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:25,214
The law says there's no
boxing in the city, right?

856
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:26,294
That's right, in the city.

857
01:11:26,634 --> 01:11:27,884
Where does the city end?

858
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:39,065
The winner...in the
75th round...

859
01:11:41,185 --> 01:11:43,855
Allow me to acknowledge the
man who's vision..

860
01:11:43,855 --> 01:11:47,325
...and enterprise, made possible
the staging of this noble combat...

861
01:11:47,365 --> 01:11:54,575
...in this inspiring and entirely
legal surroundings, Mr. William Cutting!

862
01:11:57,665 --> 01:12:01,795
And his young associate.

863
01:12:10,636 --> 01:12:12,926
Well done. You're a
quick learner.

864
01:12:13,346 --> 01:12:14,056
We done good.

865
01:12:14,476 --> 01:12:15,186
We done well.

866
01:12:15,806 --> 01:12:17,896
May I have your kind
attention?

867
01:12:18,356 --> 01:12:23,946
May I remind you of the wonders
of my museum on Broadway...

868
01:12:24,946 --> 01:12:28,826
...P.T.Barnum's gallery of
wonders!

869
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,706
It's a funny feeling
being taken...

870
01:12:39,706 --> 01:12:40,956
...under the wing of a dragon.

871
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:43,257
It's warmer than you think.

872
01:12:45,377 --> 01:12:47,967
That's the building of our
country right there, Mr. Cutting.

873
01:12:48,507 --> 01:12:49,847
Americans are borning.

874
01:12:50,427 --> 01:12:53,977
I don't see no Americans.
I see trespassers.

875
01:12:54,427 --> 01:12:56,437
Irish, who do jobs for a nickel...

876
01:12:56,437 --> 01:12:57,897
...that niggers do for a dime...

877
01:12:57,897 --> 01:13:00,227
...and a white man used to
get a quarter for.

878
01:13:00,227 --> 01:13:02,977
What have they done? Name one
thing they've contributed!

879
01:13:02,977 --> 01:13:03,227
Votes!

880
01:13:03,227 --> 01:13:04,687
Votes, you say?

881
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,447
They vote on who the
Archbishop tells them...

882
01:13:07,447 --> 01:13:08,567
...and who tells him?

883
01:13:08,567 --> 01:13:12,157
Their king in the pointy hat,
who sits on his throne in Rome.

884
01:13:12,987 --> 01:13:15,868
He's got mixed feelings with
regards to the Irish.

885
01:13:15,868 --> 01:13:21,128
Bill, deliver these good and
fervant folk to the polls.

886
01:13:21,538 --> 01:13:25,128
And there will be a handsome price
for each vote that goes Tammany's way.

887
01:13:28,588 --> 01:13:30,338
Miy father gave his life...

888
01:13:30,338 --> 01:13:32,218
...making this country
what it is.

889
01:13:32,218 --> 01:13:37,558
Murdered by the British, with all
of his men, July 25 juli, 1814.

890
01:13:37,558 --> 01:13:41,358
You think I'm going to help
you, befoul his legacy?

891
01:13:41,358 --> 01:13:43,318
By giving this country to them...

892
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:44,778
...who's had no hand in
fighting for it.

893
01:13:44,778 --> 01:13:46,898
Why? Because they come off the
boat crawling with lice...

894
01:13:46,898 --> 01:13:48,238
...and begging you for soup?

895
01:13:49,609 --> 01:13:52,029
You're a great one for the
fighting Bill, I know...

896
01:13:52,029 --> 01:13:53,789
...but you can't fight
forever.

897
01:13:53,789 --> 01:13:54,909
I can go down doing it .

898
01:13:54,909 --> 01:13:55,949
And you will.

899
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:01,789
What did you say?

900
01:14:02,789 --> 01:14:05,049
I said, you're turning you
back on the future.

901
01:14:07,969 --> 01:14:09,339
Not our future.

902
01:14:15,809 --> 01:14:17,389
That document makes you
a citizen...

903
01:14:17,389 --> 01:14:19,519
...this one makes you a
private in the Union army.

904
01:14:19,939 --> 01:14:21,059
Now go fight for your country.

905
01:14:21,519 --> 01:14:22,359
Next.

906
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:25,070
Sign here, son.

907
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:26,480
Or make your mark.

908
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:47,670
Here's your musket. Make sure
you keep it dry on the boat.

909
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,550
Where  are we going?

910
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:51,550
I heard Tennessee.

911
01:15:05,401 --> 01:15:07,071
Do they feed us now, you think?

912
01:15:18,121 --> 01:15:21,621
My children, my chidren.

913
01:15:22,621 --> 01:15:26,211
We must heal the divisions between us!

914
01:15:27,171 --> 01:15:33,762
This war must cease. North and
South must stand united.

915
01:15:43,442 --> 01:15:44,692
What happens at the finish?

916
01:15:45,402 --> 01:15:47,402
Then we have ourselves a rowdy dow!

917
01:15:48,782 --> 01:15:51,192
Ain't you never been to a theatre before?

918
01:15:51,362 --> 01:15:51,992
No.

919
01:15:52,782 --> 01:15:55,912
Mr Legree, lay down your whip.

920
01:15:56,822 --> 01:16:00,452
Miss Elisa join hands with mr. Shelby.

921
01:16:00,452 --> 01:16:04,252
And Topsy. Dear little Topsy.

922
01:16:04,622 --> 01:16:07,093
Cradle Uncle Tom's head.

923
01:16:07,633 --> 01:16:09,423
Leave the nigger dead.

924
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:23,273
Down with the Union!

925
01:16:26,233 --> 01:16:28,063
Down with the Union!

926
01:16:48,424 --> 01:16:49,714
For the blood of the Irish.

927
01:16:50,004 --> 01:16:51,674
Bill, get down!

928
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:01,974
Somebody's popped the Butcher!

929
01:17:43,775 --> 01:17:45,105
Who's man are you?

930
01:17:45,435 --> 01:17:46,985
Speak smart and speak up!

931
01:17:48,856 --> 01:17:50,276
What's he saying?

932
01:17:51,986 --> 01:17:54,576
I think he's making his peace with God.

933
01:17:54,576 --> 01:17:55,656
To hell with that!

934
01:17:56,116 --> 01:17:57,366
He makes his peace with me.

935
01:17:57,366 --> 01:18:00,956
I'm hearing your confession tonight,
you Irish whore!

936
01:18:00,956 --> 01:18:02,086
Who's man are you?

937
01:18:02,456 --> 01:18:03,956
We speak English in this country.

938
01:18:03,956 --> 01:18:04,796
Who's man are you?

939
01:18:04,796 --> 01:18:06,336
Do you see this knife, I'm
gonna teach...

940
01:18:06,336 --> 01:18:08,876
...you to speak English with
this knife!

941
01:18:08,876 --> 01:18:10,046
Who's man are you?

942
01:18:10,796 --> 01:18:12,346
Who's man are you?

943
01:18:28,277 --> 01:18:30,277
Well that didn't tell us very much.

944
01:18:34,157 --> 01:18:35,577
Fine waist coat.

945
01:18:36,947 --> 01:18:39,037
Shame, I don't think it can be mended!

946
01:18:40,957 --> 01:18:43,207
Will I keep it as a souvenir?

947
01:19:17,698 --> 01:19:19,658
Where's Legree? Where's Topsy?

948
01:19:20,578 --> 01:19:24,458
Jezus, let's continue.
Intermission is over.

949
01:19:42,689 --> 01:19:44,649
Now that was bloody Shakespearian.

950
01:19:45,769 --> 01:19:46,359
What?

951
01:19:46,359 --> 01:19:47,819
Do you know who Shakeapeare was, sonny?

952
01:19:49,859 --> 01:19:51,609
He was the fellow who wrote the
King James' Bible.

953
01:19:52,699 --> 01:19:54,569
Mr., I don't know what you are
talking about.

954
01:19:54,859 --> 01:19:57,119
Because you're an ignorant
Irish welp!

955
01:19:58,199 --> 01:19:59,289
Just like your father.

956
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:07,000
That's it. Tear my head off and
destruct the world.

957
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,670
Just like the other stupid Irish
in this country.

958
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,510
That's why I never ran with your dad.

959
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:14,510
Get off me you crazy bastard!

960
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:21,220
It means if you're not strong,
you'd better be smart.

961
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:24,640
I don't know if your being too clever
or too dumb.

962
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:26,900
But whatever it is, remember
this much.

963
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:31,190
For all his faults, your father was
a man who loved his people.

964
01:20:39,161 --> 01:20:43,581
Amsterdam. Amsterdam. New York is
calling you.

965
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:59,011
Look at that. What in Christ's
name is that?

966
01:21:00,761 --> 01:21:04,431
Rythms of the  dark continent,
thrown into the kettle...

967
01:21:04,431 --> 01:21:10,861
...with an Irish shindig. Stir it around a few times.
Poured out as a fine American mess.

968
01:21:11,771 --> 01:21:13,152
A jig, doing a jig!

969
01:21:15,452 --> 01:21:16,652
A little keep sake.

970
01:21:20,702 --> 01:21:21,582
Good on ya, sir.

971
01:21:21,582 --> 01:21:22,992
Come upstairs with me Bill.

972
01:21:24,832 --> 01:21:25,962
Have I ever had you before?

973
01:21:28,962 --> 01:21:30,922
So you don't call me by my
christian name.

974
01:21:32,842 --> 01:21:35,132
Bill. My god you're alright!

975
01:21:35,132 --> 01:21:37,222
I heard the news and came over
as quick as I could.

976
01:21:37,632 --> 01:21:39,762
As timely as the angel of death.

977
01:21:41,802 --> 01:21:44,772
You're not suggesting that I would
stoop to what your suggesting?

978
01:21:44,772 --> 01:21:46,643
Stop slabbering. If I thought
it was you...

979
01:21:46,643 --> 01:21:48,193
...you'd be in a wooden coat.

980
01:21:48,693 --> 01:21:50,313
I've got a hole in my shoulder
and it hurts...

981
01:21:50,313 --> 01:21:51,903
...so have a drink and shut up.

982
01:21:51,903 --> 01:21:53,403
Or shut up and get out.

983
01:21:55,073 --> 01:21:56,403
I believe I'll have a drink.

984
01:21:56,403 --> 01:21:59,323
Carefull, Tweedy the morts
are frenchified!

985
01:22:00,743 --> 01:22:01,873
No, I'm clean.

986
01:22:16,133 --> 01:22:16,883
Jenny.

987
01:22:16,883 --> 01:22:17,513
Bill.

988
01:22:36,694 --> 01:22:37,404
I'll wrap you up.

989
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:43,244
It's gotta be tight.

990
01:22:44,624 --> 01:22:45,874
Loves to make me cry.

991
01:22:47,454 --> 01:22:48,374
You can take it!

992
01:22:58,175 --> 01:22:59,475
There's my boy.

993
01:23:06,185 --> 01:23:07,015
It's alright.

994
01:23:13,445 --> 01:23:14,615
To the Butcher!

995
01:23:19,865 --> 01:23:21,405
We're all much obliged.

996
01:23:23,705 --> 01:23:24,875
Forever.

997
01:23:25,415 --> 01:23:28,125
To the Butcher!

998
01:23:37,466 --> 01:23:38,636
Why don't you get out of here, Johnny?

999
01:23:42,516 --> 01:23:43,306
Go on. Go!

1000
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,157
Is there anyone in the Five Points
you haven't fucked?

1001
01:24:03,537 --> 01:24:03,917
Yes!

1002
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:04,917
You!

1003
01:24:16,547 --> 01:24:17,507
Belt down!

1004
01:24:29,897 --> 01:24:31,027
Try it and I'll bite ya.

1005
01:24:32,277 --> 01:24:33,397
You were gonna bite me.

1006
01:24:34,447 --> 01:24:35,567
I dont think you want me.

1007
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:36,657
Find out.

1008
01:25:09,978 --> 01:25:10,688
Oh, Jenny!

1009
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:56,690
I can't sleep.

1010
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:07,460
I hope you don't mind us
laying here, sir?

1011
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,710
Whatever takes your fancy,
young friend.

1012
01:26:22,101 --> 01:26:23,681
Is your shoulder keeping you up?

1013
01:26:24,511 --> 01:26:26,391
I don't sleep too much.

1014
01:26:27,851 --> 01:26:30,441
I sleep with one eye open. I only
got one eye.

1015
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,321
How old are you Amsterdam?

1016
01:26:44,281 --> 01:26:48,121
Not too sure. Never did
figure it.

1017
01:26:49,961 --> 01:26:51,831
I'm 47.

1018
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,382
47 years old.

1019
01:27:00,092 --> 01:27:03,592
You know how I stayed alive
this long? All these years.

1020
01:27:06,392 --> 01:27:07,222
Fear!

1021
01:27:09,982 --> 01:27:12,192
The spectacle of fearsome acts.

1022
01:27:14,192 --> 01:27:17,112
Somebody steals from me, I cut
off his hands.

1023
01:27:17,112 --> 01:27:20,032
He offends me, I cut out his tongue.

1024
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:25,032
He rises against me, I cut off his
head, stick it on a pike!

1025
01:27:26,282 --> 01:27:29,373
Raise it high up, so all in the
streets can see.

1026
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:33,673
That's what preserves the order
of things.

1027
01:27:38,423 --> 01:27:39,133
Fear.

1028
01:27:42,843 --> 01:27:45,853
That one tonight. Who was he?

1029
01:27:48,433 --> 01:27:52,233
A nobody. A coward.

1030
01:27:55,153 --> 01:27:58,193
What an end that
would have been.

1031
01:28:00,073 --> 01:28:03,574
I killed the last honourable man
15 years ago.

1032
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:06,374
Since then....

1033
01:28:09,704 --> 01:28:11,204
You've seen his portrait downstairs?

1034
01:28:16,174 --> 01:28:17,844
Has your mouth been glued up with juice?

1035
01:28:17,844 --> 01:28:19,214
I asked you a question!

1036
01:28:19,214 --> 01:28:20,714
I said I've seen it, sir.

1037
01:28:26,974 --> 01:28:29,814
You got a murderous rage in you.
I like it.

1038
01:28:30,394 --> 01:28:33,524
So much life boiling up in you.
That's good!

1039
01:28:37,985 --> 01:28:41,325
The priest and me lived by the
same principles.

1040
01:28:44,655 --> 01:28:46,785
Only faith divided us.

1041
01:28:50,285 --> 01:28:51,795
He gave me this you know?

1042
01:28:57,835 --> 01:29:00,135
That was the finest beating I
ever took.

1043
01:29:01,715 --> 01:29:06,385
My face was pulp. My guts pierced.
My ribs all messed up.

1044
01:29:11,766 --> 01:29:13,436
When he came to finish me...

1045
01:29:18,656 --> 01:29:20,276
...I couldn't look him in the eye.

1046
01:29:27,366 --> 01:29:28,956
He spared me because...

1047
01:29:30,536 --> 01:29:32,416
....he wanted me to live in shame.

1048
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,836
This was a great man.

1049
01:29:37,426 --> 01:29:38,506
A great man.

1050
01:29:42,556 --> 01:29:44,677
So I cut out the eye that
looked away.

1051
01:29:48,557 --> 01:29:50,607
Sent it to him wrapped in
blue paper.

1052
01:29:52,107 --> 01:29:54,647
I would've cut them both out if I
could afford being blind.

1053
01:29:57,567 --> 01:29:59,657
I rose up again with a full heart...

1054
01:30:00,817 --> 01:30:02,777
...and buried him in his own blood.

1055
01:30:12,837 --> 01:30:13,497
Well done!

1056
01:30:17,628 --> 01:30:20,178
He was the only man I killed
worth remembering.

1057
01:30:32,898 --> 01:30:34,398
I never had a son.

1058
01:30:43,658 --> 01:30:45,618
Civilisation is crumbling.

1059
01:31:04,889 --> 01:31:05,969
God bless you!

1060
01:31:38,116 --> 01:31:39,616
If you've got anything to say...

1061
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:42,996
...now is the time to say it.

1062
01:31:44,586 --> 01:31:45,746
Who is he to you, Jenny?

1063
01:31:52,886 --> 01:31:54,346
I was 12 years old.

1064
01:31:55,716 --> 01:31:58,306
My mother was dead. I was living
in a doorway.

1065
01:32:01,686 --> 01:32:08,107
He took me in. Took care of me in
his own way.

1066
01:32:14,117 --> 01:32:15,777
After they cut out the baby...

1067
01:32:19,577 --> 01:32:22,077
He doesn't fancy girls that
scarred up.

1068
01:32:29,837 --> 01:32:33,217
You should know, in your own mind...

1069
01:32:35,587 --> 01:32:38,598
...that he never laid a hand on me
till I asked him too.

1070
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:03,368
Who are you?

1071
01:33:05,248 --> 01:33:06,668
Who are you?

1072
01:34:24,501 --> 01:34:31,711
Gentlemen, you are most welcome to
this palace of enchantment...

1073
01:34:32,211 --> 01:34:40,471
...with visions to rival the tales of
Sheherazade and the Arabian Nights!

1074
01:35:04,702 --> 01:35:06,752
Flex your head to the teutonic beauty!

1075
01:35:07,332 --> 01:35:09,922
Feast you eyes on the magnificent blue...

1076
01:35:11,082 --> 01:35:12,422
...of these creatures.

1077
01:35:13,132 --> 01:35:16,342
Gentlemen, you see our caged birds well!

1078
01:35:17,012 --> 01:35:19,632
How would you like to make them sing?

1079
01:35:20,222 --> 01:35:25,312
They could be singing for you.

1080
01:35:32,483 --> 01:35:36,113
May God put the spirit of the
holy steel in my spine...

1081
01:35:37,443 --> 01:35:40,323
...and the love of the blessed
Virgin in my heart.

1082
01:35:43,783 --> 01:35:44,663
Amen.

1083
01:35:49,503 --> 01:35:52,633
Easy now. What did you say?

1084
01:35:53,503 --> 01:35:55,253
He's not who he says he is.

1085
01:35:57,133 --> 01:35:58,673
He's not who he says he is?

1086
01:36:03,554 --> 01:36:05,764
Count you blessings he considers
you a friend!

1087
01:36:07,974 --> 01:36:12,144
The only thing he considers every day
and night is how to kill you!

1088
01:36:15,024 --> 01:36:17,614
Those eyes want me to take
them out for you!

1089
01:36:19,284 --> 01:36:21,534
I'll bury it up you fundunem where
it belongs!

1090
01:36:22,244 --> 01:36:24,574
I can read right through them!
They're empty...

1091
01:36:24,574 --> 01:36:25,624
His name is Vallon.

1092
01:36:28,454 --> 01:36:29,544
Don't do it Bill!

1093
01:36:30,124 --> 01:36:31,164
His name is Vallon!

1094
01:37:04,075 --> 01:37:06,075
Curious people these celestials.

1095
01:37:08,245 --> 01:37:09,835
You know why they use short
sleeves?

1096
01:37:10,376 --> 01:37:12,416
So everyone can see he's got
nothing stashed.

1097
01:37:13,046 --> 01:37:15,006
I hope it doesn't become a fashion.

1098
01:37:22,516 --> 01:37:23,016
Johnny?

1099
01:38:01,637 --> 01:38:02,307
Get up!

1100
01:38:18,358 --> 01:38:23,408
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have
your kind attention.

1101
01:38:23,408 --> 01:38:25,828
As some of you have surely
noticed...

1102
01:38:26,288 --> 01:38:29,958
...our friend and benifactor, Mr Cutting...

1103
01:38:30,378 --> 01:38:36,258
..is tonight wearing a waistcoat
of certain distinction!

1104
01:38:41,098 --> 01:38:44,638
May we appeal to him, to favour us...

1105
01:38:44,638 --> 01:38:47,058
...with another exciting exhibition.

1106
01:38:47,558 --> 01:38:53,729
Of skill. Courage. Daring and drama!

1107
01:39:13,839 --> 01:39:14,709
What's gonna happen?

1108
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:44,660
The spider's kiss!

1109
01:39:48,290 --> 01:39:49,250
The wheel of death!

1110
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:50,960
William Tell!

1111
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:52,040
The butterfly!

1112
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:54,380
The spider's kiss!

1113
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,500
The Butcher's apprentice!

1114
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:58,380
The Butcher's apprentice!

1115
01:39:58,630 --> 01:40:00,881
A command performance!

1116
01:40:03,141 --> 01:40:04,051
Where have you been?

1117
01:40:04,431 --> 01:40:06,681
A command performance indeed.

1118
01:40:07,181 --> 01:40:08,141
I want you to get out of here!

1119
01:40:08,721 --> 01:40:11,851
And for this, I must beg the
indulgence...

1120
01:40:11,851 --> 01:40:12,771
...of my former...

1121
01:40:12,771 --> 01:40:15,061
... assistent in matters of impailment...

1122
01:40:16,321 --> 01:40:18,611
...the Butcher's original apprentice.

1123
01:40:20,611 --> 01:40:21,821
What do you say, Jen?

1124
01:40:22,201 --> 01:40:24,451
One more time for the
sweet souvenir.

1125
01:40:25,871 --> 01:40:26,331
Come on!

1126
01:40:36,922 --> 01:40:38,342
Don't do it!

1127
01:40:50,852 --> 01:40:51,932
She'll be alright.

1128
01:40:55,732 --> 01:40:56,612
Remember this?

1129
01:40:56,772 --> 01:40:57,232
Of course!

1130
01:41:07,532 --> 01:41:11,453
You may feel more comfortable without
that garment, Miss Everdeane!

1131
01:41:13,753 --> 01:41:15,753
You'll have to filch me a
new one, Bill!

1132
01:41:30,223 --> 01:41:32,183
Anything in your pockets tonight?

1133
01:41:32,933 --> 01:41:34,813
I ain't started working yet.

1134
01:41:38,403 --> 01:41:40,573
What about that locket I
gave you?

1135
01:41:56,624 --> 01:41:58,964
Apologies my dear. Pick it up.

1136
01:42:04,724 --> 01:42:06,184
Whoopsie daisy!

1137
01:42:08,764 --> 01:42:10,304
Now its good and broke!

1138
01:42:11,974 --> 01:42:14,064
I can't seem to get anything
right tonight.

1139
01:42:22,325 --> 01:42:25,195
You got the sand to give 'm a
grand finale?

1140
01:42:34,455 --> 01:42:36,625
Maybe when you're aiming a
little straighter.

1141
01:42:47,515 --> 01:42:49,095
Enough of this heathen music.

1142
01:42:50,055 --> 01:42:52,016
Get rid of these goddamn monkeys.

1143
01:42:52,226 --> 01:42:53,146
Strike up boys!

1144
01:42:54,816 --> 01:42:57,486
This is a night for Americans!

1145
01:43:06,036 --> 01:43:06,536
Jenny!

1146
01:44:03,468 --> 01:44:04,428
Hats off!

1147
01:44:11,888 --> 01:44:15,818
We hold in our hearts the memory
of our fallen brothers...

1148
01:44:17,018 --> 01:44:19,398
...whose blood stains the very streets...

1149
01:44:19,398 --> 01:44:20,698
...we walk today.

1150
01:44:22,318 --> 01:44:27,538
Also on this night, we pay tribute
to the leader of our enemies.

1151
01:44:29,698 --> 01:44:31,408
An honourable man...

1152
01:44:32,458 --> 01:44:36,419
...who crossed over bravely.
Fighting for what he believed in.

1153
01:44:43,799 --> 01:44:47,559
To defeat my enemy, I extinguish
his life...

1154
01:44:48,509 --> 01:44:51,179
... and consume him as I consume
these flames.

1155
01:44:53,809 --> 01:44:55,689
In honour of Priest Vallon.

1156
01:44:58,149 --> 01:44:59,109
In honour of Priest Vallon!

1157
01:45:04,609 --> 01:45:06,119
That's a wound !

1158
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:19,500
I want you all to meet the son of
Priest Vallon.

1159
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:22,420
I took him under my wing...

1160
01:45:23,550 --> 01:45:25,130
...and see how I'm repaid.

1161
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,720
He saved my life one day so he
could kill me the next...

1162
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,180
...like a sneak thief.

1163
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:32,180
Instead of fighting like a man.

1164
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:37,940
A base defiler. Unworthy of
a noble name.

1165
01:45:51,491 --> 01:45:53,411
That'll do Mcgloin.
Spread him out.

1166
01:45:55,831 --> 01:45:59,211
I hate blackies. You..you get to watch.

1167
01:46:05,931 --> 01:46:07,471
This is fresh meat!

1168
01:46:10,011 --> 01:46:12,061
We need to tenderise this meat
a bit.

1169
01:46:13,521 --> 01:46:16,692
Alright, lets kiss goodnight to
that pretty face of yours!

1170
01:46:27,612 --> 01:46:28,612
No...!

1171
01:46:30,912 --> 01:46:35,082
What'll it be then. Rib or chop.
Loin or shank.

1172
01:46:35,082 --> 01:46:35,542
The liver!

1173
01:46:35,542 --> 01:46:36,042
The spleen!

1174
01:46:37,372 --> 01:46:37,922
The kidney!

1175
01:46:45,052 --> 01:46:45,552
The lung!

1176
01:46:45,882 --> 01:46:46,422
The liver!

1177
01:46:47,342 --> 01:46:47,802
The tongue!

1178
01:46:50,303 --> 01:46:51,683
The heart! The heart!

1179
01:46:51,683 --> 01:46:52,853
The heart?

1180
01:46:53,183 --> 01:46:54,773
This boy has no heart.

1181
01:46:54,773 --> 01:46:57,233
Then kill him!

1182
01:47:02,693 --> 01:47:04,363
He ain't earned the death!

1183
01:47:04,783 --> 01:47:07,113
He ain't earned the death of
my hands!

1184
01:47:09,113 --> 01:47:12,073
He'll walk amongst you marked
with shame.

1185
01:47:12,073 --> 01:47:16,793
A freak. Worthy of Barnum's
museum of wonders.

1186
01:47:17,833 --> 01:47:21,503
God's only man, speared by
the Butcher.

1187
01:48:00,835 --> 01:48:03,835
Here. Here. This way.

1188
01:48:03,835 --> 01:48:04,675
Come on.

1189
01:48:51,596 --> 01:48:53,186
I want to show you something.

1190
01:48:59,066 --> 01:49:00,856
My mother's bones share this
grave.

1191
01:49:03,946 --> 01:49:06,947
I've saved 20 cents out of every
dollar I've ever earned since ....

1192
01:49:06,947 --> 01:49:07,987
...I was thirteen.

1193
01:49:10,867 --> 01:49:12,577
That's 215 dollars.

1194
01:49:13,747 --> 01:49:15,417
For bludgeoning and the rest.

1195
01:49:20,337 --> 01:49:22,717
This is what I wanted to show you.

1196
01:49:24,717 --> 01:49:27,387
This is where we're going to go,
as soon as you get better....

1197
01:49:27,887 --> 01:49:31,427
...San Fransisco, California.

1198
01:49:34,097 --> 01:49:36,017
You can have anything you want
out there.

1199
01:49:37,767 --> 01:49:40,938
These men are pulling gold right
out of the river.

1200
01:49:41,438 --> 01:49:42,608
With their own hands.

1201
01:49:44,988 --> 01:49:48,568
We're here and need to get there.

1202
01:49:50,528 --> 01:49:51,618
Start here.

1203
01:49:52,698 --> 01:49:55,328
Go down 'round here.

1204
01:49:58,208 --> 01:49:59,498
Up to San Francisco.

1205
01:50:02,338 --> 01:50:03,588
The shortest way to go.

1206
01:50:05,378 --> 01:50:06,548
Will you go with me?

1207
01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:34,909
No need to fire that, miss.
Or even aim it.

1208
01:50:36,579 --> 01:50:38,869
An audience with yor mangled
friend is all I want.

1209
01:50:55,850 --> 01:50:57,480
I've 44 notches on my club.

1210
01:50:59,690 --> 01:51:00,940
Do you know what they are for?

1211
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:05,690
To remind me of what I owe God
when I die.

1212
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:15,580
My father was killed in battle too.

1213
01:51:17,330 --> 01:51:19,080
In Ireland, in the streets.

1214
01:51:22,041 --> 01:51:23,961
Fighting those who were taking
their privilege.

1215
01:51:24,841 --> 01:51:26,381
What only could be got and held...

1216
01:51:26,381 --> 01:51:28,171
...by the decimation of a race.

1217
01:51:29,881 --> 01:51:32,091
That war is a thousand years old
and more.

1218
01:51:34,061 --> 01:51:35,811
We never expected it to follow
us here.

1219
01:51:38,771 --> 01:51:39,391
It didn't.

1220
01:51:40,901 --> 01:51:42,401
It was waiting for us when
we landed.

1221
01:51:47,231 --> 01:51:50,491
Your father tried to carve out a
corner in this country for his tribe.

1222
01:51:53,491 --> 01:51:55,081
That was him. That was his Dead Rabbits.

1223
01:51:59,292 --> 01:52:01,542
I often wondered, if he'd lived a
bit longer...

1224
01:52:03,672 --> 01:52:05,382
...would he have wanted it to
be more.

1225
01:52:17,642 --> 01:52:19,812
Why did you rifle through his
pockets then?

1226
01:52:38,083 --> 01:52:39,333
For safekeeping.

1227
01:52:43,463 --> 01:52:44,753
I thought maybe you could do
with it.

1228
01:53:07,824 --> 01:53:09,484
Blood stays on the blade.

1229
01:54:27,066 --> 01:54:28,906
That's a sorry looking pelt.

1230
01:54:33,946 --> 01:54:37,156
And it's been so nice and quiet
for the last three months.

1231
01:54:40,076 --> 01:54:43,086
Tell me, this charge. Does it sit
on easy with you?

1232
01:54:44,916 --> 01:54:49,467
No. Not uneasy , Bill.

1233
01:54:51,137 --> 01:54:52,757
I wouldn't say that.

1234
01:54:55,597 --> 01:54:59,937
But... my allegiance is
to the law.

1235
01:55:01,937 --> 01:55:03,937
I'm paid to uphold the law.

1236
01:55:20,418 --> 01:55:22,788
What in heaven's name are you
talking about?

1237
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:32,548
You may have misgivings, but don't go believing
that, Jack. That way lies damnation.

1238
01:55:36,888 --> 01:55:38,728
I'm in no danger of
damnation, Bill.

1239
01:55:51,108 --> 01:55:52,278
Here's the thing.

1240
01:55:54,579 --> 01:55:57,789
I don't give a fuck about your moral conflicts...

1241
01:55:57,789 --> 01:55:59,249
..you meatheaded shit sack.

1242
01:56:01,869 --> 01:56:03,419
That's more or less the thing.

1243
01:56:05,959 --> 01:56:08,669
I want you to go out there. You
and nobody else.

1244
01:56:09,379 --> 01:56:10,509
None of your little minions.

1245
01:56:10,509 --> 01:56:12,129
I want you to go out there...

1246
01:56:13,889 --> 01:56:15,099
...and I want you...

1247
01:56:16,889 --> 01:56:20,269
...to punish, the person...

1248
01:56:20,979 --> 01:56:22,769
...who's responsible...

1249
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:29,360
...for murdering this poor
little rabbit.

1250
01:56:36,330 --> 01:56:37,580
Is that understood?

1251
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:43,080
Right!

1252
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:48,090
Help yourself to some decent meat
on the way out.

1253
01:57:26,131 --> 01:57:26,631
Damn it!

1254
01:57:29,501 --> 01:57:30,631
Is that you, boy?

1255
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:35,131
I didn't mean nothing by that shot
you know?

1256
01:57:36,762 --> 01:57:38,142
You scared me is all.

1257
01:57:41,642 --> 01:57:43,812
You know I'd never do you harm.

1258
01:57:45,392 --> 01:57:46,772
Come out now, lad.

1259
01:57:50,022 --> 01:57:51,732
Remember your father and me?

1260
01:57:55,862 --> 01:57:58,622
Are you to young to remember your Uncle Jack?

1261
01:58:01,242 --> 01:58:03,042
The times we had.

1262
01:58:09,752 --> 01:58:11,133
You know I won't hurt you.

1263
01:58:44,333 --> 01:58:45,584
This is bad for everybody.

1264
01:58:45,584 --> 01:58:47,334
What's next, dead politicians?

1265
01:58:49,674 --> 01:58:51,844
I could spare half a dozen
of you...

1266
01:58:52,504 --> 01:58:53,924
...easier than I can spare him.

1267
01:58:55,594 --> 01:58:58,594
Still, I think it shows dash.

1268
01:58:59,594 --> 01:59:02,474
Give the boy some time, we'll
settle with a good dust up.

1269
01:59:35,055 --> 01:59:36,015
The lads!

1270
01:59:46,935 --> 01:59:49,735
There are more of us coming off
the ships each day.

1271
01:59:50,985 --> 01:59:53,116
I heard 15,000 Irish a week.

1272
01:59:55,736 --> 01:59:57,326
And we're afraid of the Natives!

1273
02:00:00,206 --> 02:00:01,366
Get all of us together...

1274
02:00:01,366 --> 02:00:02,706
....we ain't got a gang..

1275
02:00:03,126 --> 02:00:04,126
...we got an army.

1276
02:00:04,746 --> 02:00:09,086
And all we need is a spark. One
spark, to wake us all up.

1277
02:00:27,147 --> 02:00:28,477
It was me who played you false.

1278
02:00:31,237 --> 02:00:32,607
I'd take it back if I could.

1279
02:00:32,607 --> 02:00:33,817
Take it back?

1280
02:00:38,407 --> 02:00:39,907
Johnny, I ought to kill you!

1281
02:00:54,797 --> 02:00:56,927
Get out of the Points and
don't come back.

1282
02:01:05,688 --> 02:01:06,728
Where are you going, boil?

1283
02:01:08,978 --> 02:01:09,648
Come along.

1284
02:01:10,778 --> 02:01:11,358
Come on.

1285
02:01:14,908 --> 02:01:16,698
Tell us John, what's the trouble?

1286
02:01:18,738 --> 02:01:19,908
No trouble, Bill.

1287
02:01:23,498 --> 02:01:25,168
Still hiding out with
your friends?

1288
02:01:29,168 --> 02:01:32,838
No, I'm not with them, Bill.

1289
02:01:34,088 --> 02:01:36,429
I'm with you, with the Natives.

1290
02:01:41,719 --> 02:01:44,979
You always were a Native, as far
as I'm interested, John.

1291
02:01:48,149 --> 02:01:50,069
Till you became a stag.

1292
02:01:54,739 --> 02:01:56,449
You tell me you're a Native?

1293
02:01:56,449 --> 02:01:57,739
Do you want to know what
a Native is?

1294
02:02:00,369 --> 02:02:05,829
A Native is a man, who's
willing to give his life...

1295
02:02:06,919 --> 02:02:08,289
...for his country.

1296
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:12,210
Like my father done.

1297
02:02:16,010 --> 02:02:18,640
Are you willing to do that,
my young friend?

1298
02:02:28,730 --> 02:02:30,400
John? Johnny?

1299
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:40,280
Johnny?

1300
02:02:50,751 --> 02:02:51,461
I'll get you off.

1301
02:03:05,391 --> 02:03:06,891
It hurts too much.

1302
02:03:14,191 --> 02:03:15,231
Just kill me.

1303
02:03:20,952 --> 02:03:22,242
Just kill me.

1304
02:03:24,912 --> 02:03:26,912
Please. Please.

1305
02:03:33,792 --> 02:03:36,132
Please. Please.

1306
02:03:40,182 --> 02:03:40,802
Please.

1307
02:03:46,312 --> 02:03:47,482
I'm sorry, Johnny.

1308
02:04:04,663 --> 02:04:06,793
Oh, Mary mother of God, pray
for us sinners...

1309
02:04:06,793 --> 02:04:08,753
...on the day of our death...amen.

1310
02:04:10,873 --> 02:04:12,213
Rest in peace, Ma.

1311
02:04:15,883 --> 02:04:17,053
What are you doing here, boil?

1312
02:04:24,763 --> 02:04:26,934
What's that nigger doing in
this church?

1313
02:04:32,274 --> 02:04:34,404
What's a Dead Rabbit doing with
the Natives,huh?

1314
02:04:34,404 --> 02:04:36,074
No niggers among the Natives.

1315
02:04:36,074 --> 02:04:37,574
Niggers as robbers is
one thing...

1316
02:04:37,574 --> 02:04:40,034
...but niggers in a church,
that's something else!

1317
02:04:40,784 --> 02:04:42,154
You run with the Natives, you go
pray with the Natives!

1318
02:04:42,154 --> 02:04:44,704
You're going to wind up on a stake
like your man did!

1319
02:04:45,534 --> 02:04:46,124
McGloin?

1320
02:04:47,454 --> 02:04:50,834
Father! Jezus, do you know there's
a nigger in your church?

1321
02:05:09,935 --> 02:05:11,145
Jezus!

1322
02:05:34,966 --> 02:05:36,136
The earth turns...

1323
02:05:38,136 --> 02:05:39,886
...but we don't feel it move.

1324
02:05:43,516 --> 02:05:45,186
And one night you look up...

1325
02:05:47,396 --> 02:05:51,896
...one spark and the skie's on fire.

1326
02:06:03,996 --> 02:06:05,666
It's a touching spectacle.

1327
02:06:08,327 --> 02:06:10,587
We'll come back when you're
ready for us.

1328
02:06:17,967 --> 02:06:20,387
The past is the torch that
lights our way.

1329
02:06:21,967 --> 02:06:23,887
Where our fathers have shown
us the path.

1330
02:06:25,057 --> 02:06:26,307
We shall follow.

1331
02:06:29,187 --> 02:06:32,357
Our faith is the weapon most
feared by our enemies...

1332
02:06:33,567 --> 02:06:35,697
...for thereby shall we lift our
people up...

1333
02:06:35,697 --> 02:06:37,777
...against those who will
destroy us.

1334
02:06:38,817 --> 02:06:43,198
Our name is called the Dead Rabbits,
to remind all of our suffering...

1335
02:06:43,868 --> 02:06:46,208
...and as a call to those who
suffer still...

1336
02:06:46,208 --> 02:06:47,618
...to join our ranks.

1337
02:06:48,078 --> 02:06:52,838
However so far they may have strayed
from our common home across the sea.

1338
02:06:52,838 --> 02:06:56,838
For with great numbers, must come
great strength.

1339
02:06:57,678 --> 02:06:59,468
For the salvation of our people.

1340
02:07:01,298 --> 02:07:02,218
We don't want your business.

1341
02:07:02,218 --> 02:07:03,058
How many other men live here?

1342
02:07:03,508 --> 02:07:04,388
You all have to register.

1343
02:07:04,388 --> 02:07:06,178
You can't force me to join
no army.

1344
02:07:06,558 --> 02:07:07,438
Have you got 300 dollars?

1345
02:07:07,438 --> 02:07:07,978
Of course not!

1346
02:07:07,978 --> 02:07:09,398
Who the hell's got 300 dollars?

1347
02:07:09,398 --> 02:07:12,398
If you are drafted, release from militairy
service can only be secured...

1348
02:07:12,768 --> 02:07:15,278
...for 300 dollars, according to
the conscription act.

1349
02:07:15,278 --> 02:07:15,859
300 Dollars?

1350
02:07:15,859 --> 02:07:17,109
Otherwise you have to serve!

1351
02:07:17,109 --> 02:07:18,569
Who the hell's got 300 dollars?

1352
02:07:18,569 --> 02:07:19,319
You have to serve, sir!

1353
02:07:19,319 --> 02:07:19,949
You tell me!

1354
02:07:21,869 --> 02:07:22,449
Boys!

1355
02:07:24,579 --> 02:07:26,829
I was born here, sir. You
immigrated here!

1356
02:07:28,659 --> 02:07:31,209
Sweet jezus. War does terrible
things to men.

1357
02:07:31,879 --> 02:07:33,459
Get back up town, where you
belong!

1358
02:07:33,459 --> 02:07:36,259
300 dollars. It's another rich
man's war!

1359
02:07:38,089 --> 02:07:40,129
Sir, I request an audience
with this man.

1360
02:07:42,849 --> 02:07:44,639
Don't they speak English in
New York anymore!

1361
02:07:45,139 --> 02:07:46,349
Don't understand.

1362
02:07:46,349 --> 02:07:47,389
You do speak English!

1363
02:07:49,189 --> 02:07:53,690
I wonder if miss Everdeane can angle
her rifle in another direction?

1364
02:07:58,900 --> 02:08:02,700
I wonder Mr. Vallon, if you understand
the value of this sort of publicity?

1365
02:08:05,830 --> 02:08:10,040
The Archbishop himself, shoulder to shoulder
with half the Irish in the Five Points.

1366
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:14,630
I'm offering my boy, to form an
alliance with you...

1367
02:08:14,630 --> 02:08:17,340
...against Bill Cutting and his
slate of Native candidates.

1368
02:08:18,340 --> 02:08:21,180
I'll negotiate a handsome fee, for
every Irish vote...

1369
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:23,761
...you send Tammany's way, in the
coming elections.

1370
02:08:26,311 --> 02:08:28,311
I need a new friend in the Five
Points, son.

1371
02:08:32,651 --> 02:08:34,021
I'd like that friend to
be you.

1372
02:08:38,361 --> 02:08:40,071
Now just a moment, Mr. Tweed.

1373
02:08:41,111 --> 02:08:43,031
Suppose we do get you those votes.

1374
02:08:46,621 --> 02:08:49,081
Would you back an Irish candidate
of my chosing..

1375
02:08:49,081 --> 02:08:49,791
I don't think so.

1376
02:08:49,791 --> 02:08:51,461
What if we get you all the
Irish votes?

1377
02:08:51,461 --> 02:08:55,081
Mr. Vallon, that will only happen
in the reign of Queen Dick!

1378
02:08:58,052 --> 02:08:58,882
Beg your pardon?

1379
02:08:58,882 --> 02:09:00,212
That means it will never happen.

1380
02:09:00,212 --> 02:09:02,932
Now I might be persuaded to back
an Irish candidate...

1381
02:09:02,932 --> 02:09:04,052
...for, let's say alderman.

1382
02:09:04,052 --> 02:09:04,432
Alderman?

1383
02:09:04,892 --> 02:09:06,892
We've already got an Irish
alderman.

1384
02:09:06,892 --> 02:09:07,812
So we have, that's why....

1385
02:09:07,812 --> 02:09:09,182
What's bigger than an alderman?

1386
02:09:11,892 --> 02:09:12,602
Sheriff!

1387
02:09:13,522 --> 02:09:14,272
Sheriff!

1388
02:09:14,602 --> 02:09:17,772
Alright, Mr Tweed, you back an
Irishman for sheriff...

1389
02:09:17,772 --> 02:09:19,572
...of the city and county of
New York...

1390
02:09:19,572 --> 02:09:21,572
...and we'll get him elected.

1391
02:09:21,572 --> 02:09:22,742
I love the Irish, son...

1392
02:09:22,742 --> 02:09:24,992
..but higher than alderman you
shall never climb.

1393
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:25,782
Why not?

1394
02:09:26,412 --> 02:09:29,242
For one thing, no man living can
consolidate the Irish vote.

1395
02:09:29,242 --> 02:09:29,702
I can!

1396
02:09:29,702 --> 02:09:31,332
And for another, I mean no
offence...

1397
02:09:32,003 --> 02:09:33,503
...no one's yet found an Irish
candidate...

1398
02:09:33,503 --> 02:09:35,043
...for sheriff worth voting for.

1399
02:09:38,713 --> 02:09:39,213
Monk!

1400
02:09:41,013 --> 02:09:41,423
Here.

1401
02:09:46,973 --> 02:09:49,393
Got me looking as sober as me own
grandfather!

1402
02:09:49,393 --> 02:09:50,773
He was a great man, I'm sure.

1403
02:09:51,223 --> 02:09:52,933
He was a drunken bastard.

1404
02:09:56,023 --> 02:09:57,193
Can I say what I want?

1405
02:09:58,943 --> 02:10:00,233
That's why I wanted you.

1406
02:10:01,483 --> 02:10:04,403
Our elected representatives are a
gang of thieves!

1407
02:10:04,403 --> 02:10:06,074
Who swear to better our lot...

1408
02:10:06,574 --> 02:10:08,454
...while dipping their hands deep
into our pockets.

1409
02:10:08,954 --> 02:10:13,664
I stand shoulder to shoulder with
community leaders like Bill Cutting...

1410
02:10:13,664 --> 02:10:17,754
....against any, an all in roads in
our democracy.

1411
02:10:17,754 --> 02:10:19,504
I'll see to it, that no one
takes away...

1412
02:10:19,884 --> 02:10:22,054
... what you earned by pluck and application.

1413
02:10:22,054 --> 02:10:24,384
To invading hordes of Hibernians.

1414
02:10:24,344 --> 02:10:26,184
Go to the polls and put
your mark...

1415
02:10:26,514 --> 02:10:28,554
... next to the name Walter McGinn.

1416
02:10:28,554 --> 02:10:31,224
Against the potatoes weeders, like
them over there...

1417
02:10:31,814 --> 02:10:33,224
...thieving our jobs.

1418
02:10:33,224 --> 02:10:35,894
Why should so many Irish die down
south...

1419
02:10:35,894 --> 02:10:37,024
...when the first war to win...

1420
02:10:37,024 --> 02:10:39,154
...is not down in Dixie, but
right here...

1421
02:10:39,154 --> 02:10:40,195
...in these streets!

1422
02:10:42,905 --> 02:10:44,945
Who's the finest streetfighter in
the Five Points?

1423
02:10:45,365 --> 02:10:46,325
Monk!

1424
02:10:46,705 --> 02:10:49,625
That's right and let the whole
damn city hear it!

1425
02:10:52,085 --> 02:10:53,835
That man was right born for this.

1426
02:10:53,835 --> 02:10:56,915
He's killed 44 men and laid low a
couple of hundred more.

1427
02:10:57,165 --> 02:10:58,375
Is that right?

1428
02:10:58,375 --> 02:10:58,795
Right.

1429
02:10:59,135 --> 02:11:00,505
I should have run him for mayor!

1430
02:11:03,215 --> 02:11:04,265
Alright, line 'm up.

1431
02:11:04,765 --> 02:11:06,175
It's election day!

1432
02:11:16,436 --> 02:11:17,816
Come on, you bastard. We need
your vote.

1433
02:11:18,196 --> 02:11:20,106
Bastard? I fought for you
nigger...

1434
02:11:20,446 --> 02:11:21,616
...I lost an arm for you!

1435
02:11:21,616 --> 02:11:23,366
Well, that's a start. Come on.

1436
02:11:23,366 --> 02:11:25,236
Rise and shine, rise and shine.

1437
02:11:25,826 --> 02:11:28,996
This great country of ours, even
hop fiends get their vote.

1438
02:11:30,246 --> 02:11:32,166
Less heart and more haste,
darling.

1439
02:11:32,166 --> 02:11:33,166
Where are you going ?

1440
02:11:33,166 --> 02:11:34,586
I already voted today.

1441
02:11:34,916 --> 02:11:37,126
Cast for Monk and Tammany, by god!

1442
02:11:37,376 --> 02:11:38,006
Twice.

1443
02:11:38,006 --> 02:11:38,666
Twice?

1444
02:11:38,966 --> 02:11:40,926
Only twice? You call that doing
your civic duty?

1445
02:11:41,136 --> 02:11:41,886
Come with me.

1446
02:11:42,216 --> 02:11:44,466
Oh no, you don't. Get back and
sit down.

1447
02:11:44,806 --> 02:11:46,136
Here's another one!

1448
02:11:46,306 --> 02:11:47,016
Clean him up good.

1449
02:11:47,016 --> 02:11:49,937
Shave the beards off boys and send
them back to vote again.

1450
02:11:49,937 --> 02:11:51,767
Okay boys, vote Tammany.

1451
02:11:51,977 --> 02:11:53,147
Tammany!

1452
02:11:53,147 --> 02:11:56,277
What our great city needs is a new
court house.

1453
02:11:56,277 --> 02:11:59,107
Now I propose it should be a
modest, economical structure.

1454
02:11:59,107 --> 02:12:00,197
Excuse me one moment.

1455
02:12:00,197 --> 02:12:00,607
What is it?

1456
02:12:01,157 --> 02:12:04,987
Monk's already won by 3,000 more
votes, then there are voters.

1457
02:12:04,987 --> 02:12:06,577
Only 3? Make it 20, 30.

1458
02:12:06,577 --> 02:12:08,657
We don't need a victory, we need a
Roman triumph.

1459
02:12:08,657 --> 02:12:10,617
We don't have anymore ballots.

1460
02:12:11,167 --> 02:12:13,037
Remember the first rule of
politics...

1461
02:12:13,037 --> 02:12:14,537
...ballots don't make the results...

1462
02:12:14,537 --> 02:12:17,507
..the counters do. Keep counting.

1463
02:12:49,748 --> 02:12:50,748
It's from Bill.

1464
02:12:55,038 --> 02:12:55,538
Monk?

1465
02:13:16,309 --> 02:13:18,319
Citizens of the Five Points!

1466
02:13:19,859 --> 02:13:22,319
Mr. Cutting is attempting to
draw me...

1467
02:13:22,319 --> 02:13:23,449
...into an argument...

1468
02:13:23,949 --> 02:13:25,569
...that would no doubt end in
bloodshed...

1469
02:13:25,569 --> 02:13:27,619
...and the compromising of my
office.

1470
02:13:29,159 --> 02:13:30,240
What do you think?

1471
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,370
Shall I engage in silence, this
relic of the ancient law...

1472
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:39,000
...or, shall I be your chosen
voice...

1473
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,090
...in a new testament, in a new
world?

1474
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:49,260
There you are, Bill.

1475
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:52,930
The people have spoken.

1476
02:13:55,310 --> 02:13:58,230
The very notion of violent
reprisal benumbs them.

1477
02:14:01,530 --> 02:14:02,070
Come on up.

1478
02:14:03,780 --> 02:14:04,701
Let's see if we can resolve our...

1479
02:14:04,701 --> 02:14:06,071
...grievances the democratic way.

1480
02:14:30,511 --> 02:14:34,231
That my friends, is the minority
vote.

1481
02:14:36,271 --> 02:14:38,982
Now you tasted my mutton, how do
you like it?

1482
02:14:40,562 --> 02:14:43,362
Look, I want you to see this.

1483
02:14:47,412 --> 02:14:49,202
This is you, right here!

1484
02:14:49,702 --> 02:14:53,292
Notch 45, you Irish bug bastard.

1485
02:15:04,962 --> 02:15:06,052
Why don't you burn him?

1486
02:15:06,052 --> 02:15:07,882
See if his ashes turn green.

1487
02:15:13,853 --> 02:15:15,813
Fortune favours them all!

1488
02:15:29,073 --> 02:15:30,613
You killed an elected official?

1489
02:15:31,743 --> 02:15:32,873
Who elected him?

1490
02:15:32,873 --> 02:15:34,543
You don't know what you've done
to yourself.

1491
02:15:41,633 --> 02:15:42,923
I know your works.

1492
02:15:44,713 --> 02:15:46,464
You're neither cold nor hot.

1493
02:15:47,094 --> 02:15:49,094
So because you are luke warm...

1494
02:15:49,094 --> 02:15:51,184
...I will spew you out of my
mouth.

1495
02:15:53,054 --> 02:15:55,644
You can build your filthy world
without me.

1496
02:15:55,644 --> 02:15:58,314
I took the father, now I'll take
the son.

1497
02:15:58,314 --> 02:16:00,904
You tell young Vallon, I'm going
to paint...

1498
02:16:00,904 --> 02:16:02,734
...Paradise square with his blood.

1499
02:16:03,234 --> 02:16:04,574
Two coats!

1500
02:16:05,784 --> 02:16:08,194
I'll festoon my sleeping
chamber with his guts.

1501
02:16:08,194 --> 02:16:10,614
As for you Mr. Tammany
fucking hall...

1502
02:16:10,614 --> 02:16:13,074
...you come down to the Points
once more...

1503
02:16:13,074 --> 02:16:15,994
...and you'll be dispatched by my
own hand!

1504
02:16:18,624 --> 02:16:19,834
Now get back to your
celebration...

1505
02:16:19,834 --> 02:16:21,465
...and let me eat in peace.

1506
02:16:21,465 --> 02:16:22,585
I paid you fair.

1507
02:16:47,905 --> 02:16:48,405
Down!

1508
02:16:50,405 --> 02:16:50,825
Raise!

1509
02:17:35,037 --> 02:17:36,037
You son of a bitch!

1510
02:17:41,167 --> 02:17:41,757
Challenge.

1511
02:17:44,507 --> 02:17:45,547
Challenge accepted.

1512
02:18:38,559 --> 02:18:39,729
And then it came...

1513
02:18:40,689 --> 02:18:42,319
...the first day of the draft.

1514
02:18:42,319 --> 02:18:43,069
Thomas O'neill.

1515
02:18:44,279 --> 02:18:45,109
Andrew Lewis.

1516
02:18:46,609 --> 02:18:47,659
Joseph Flynn.

1517
02:18:47,659 --> 02:18:51,029
They read out the draftees names
as if they were dead already.

1518
02:18:53,079 --> 02:18:54,409
J.B. Gleeson.

1519
02:18:55,829 --> 02:18:56,579
The O'Conell Guard.

1520
02:18:57,539 --> 02:18:58,249
The Plug Uglies.

1521
02:18:58,669 --> 02:18:58,999
As for us.

1522
02:18:58,999 --> 02:18:59,829
The Forty Thieves.

1523
02:18:59,999 --> 02:19:00,999
The tribes were gathered.

1524
02:19:02,089 --> 02:19:02,919
The Chichesters.

1525
02:19:02,919 --> 02:19:04,259
The drums were beating.

1526
02:19:04,799 --> 02:19:05,549
The Dead Rabbits.

1527
02:19:06,339 --> 02:19:07,299
The American guard.

1528
02:19:08,049 --> 02:19:09,049
The Atlantic Guard.

1529
02:19:09,389 --> 02:19:10,469
The Slaughterhouses.

1530
02:19:10,469 --> 02:19:11,760
The Bowery Boys.

1531
02:19:12,220 --> 02:19:14,020
Confederation of American Natives.

1532
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:16,980
James Mooney.

1533
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:18,690
But all we could see...

1534
02:19:19,480 --> 02:19:21,020
...was the hand in front of us.

1535
02:19:21,020 --> 02:19:21,900
Shaun O'Connell.

1536
02:19:23,650 --> 02:19:25,230
C.W. Morris.

1537
02:19:27,700 --> 02:19:28,240
When?

1538
02:19:28,700 --> 02:19:29,860
Whenever you like.

1539
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:31,280
Daybreak tomorrow.

1540
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:32,240
Ground?

1541
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:33,780
Paradise square.

1542
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:35,700
Weapons?

1543
02:19:36,950 --> 02:19:38,250
That I leave up to you.

1544
02:19:38,910 --> 02:19:40,790
Bricks, bats, axes, knives.

1545
02:19:42,540 --> 02:19:43,340
Pistols?

1546
02:19:45,671 --> 02:19:46,671
No pistols.

1547
02:19:47,921 --> 02:19:48,971
Good boy.

1548
02:19:52,681 --> 02:19:53,761
Terms are resolved.

1549
02:19:53,761 --> 02:19:54,851
Counsel is concluded.

1550
02:20:02,021 --> 02:20:03,441
To hell with your damned draft.

1551
02:20:03,811 --> 02:20:04,981
Get 'm boys.

1552
02:20:04,981 --> 02:20:06,071
Rip 'm apart.

1553
02:20:13,871 --> 02:20:15,331
Kill the rich bastards.

1554
02:20:22,632 --> 02:20:23,542
Hotel!

1555
02:20:25,802 --> 02:20:27,592
They're not getting my son!

1556
02:20:33,222 --> 02:20:35,142
Uptown town at the draft office...

1557
02:20:35,852 --> 02:20:37,892
...the cops broke a few skulls.

1558
02:20:38,522 --> 02:20:40,062
And everybody ran away.

1559
02:20:41,892 --> 02:20:43,522
But the word was spreading...

1560
02:20:44,562 --> 02:20:45,902
...in the dark.

1561
02:20:47,612 --> 02:20:50,992
Up on fifth avenue, the Schermerhorns
and their mob...

1562
02:20:50,992 --> 02:20:52,783
...breathed a little easy.

1563
02:20:52,783 --> 02:20:55,913
Just a brief blist of anger, over
Mr. Lincoln's draft.

1564
02:20:55,913 --> 02:20:57,743
Entirely justifiable in my view.

1565
02:20:58,243 --> 02:20:59,703
There are two sides to that
question.

1566
02:20:59,703 --> 02:21:02,293
Ther are several sides to that
question, Mr. Schermerhorn.

1567
02:21:02,293 --> 02:21:03,923
But only one right side.

1568
02:21:03,923 --> 02:21:06,133
As with any question, it
holds the abuse...

1569
02:21:06,133 --> 02:21:07,173
...of any executive power.

1570
02:21:07,173 --> 02:21:09,093
In any case, Mr. Greely...

1571
02:21:09,093 --> 02:21:12,053
...we can all be thankful, it
wasn't any worse.

1572
02:21:12,593 --> 02:21:14,263
It may be worse yet, sir.

1573
02:21:14,263 --> 02:21:15,973
I saw them. I don't know
what to think...

1574
02:21:15,973 --> 02:21:18,813
What is it you are so fond of
saying, Mr. Tweed?

1575
02:21:18,813 --> 02:21:20,603
Mr. Greely, you won't like this...

1576
02:21:20,603 --> 02:21:21,683
...but what is it?

1577
02:21:21,683 --> 02:21:22,773
I don't remember.

1578
02:21:22,773 --> 02:21:25,403
You can always hire one half
of the poor...

1579
02:21:25,403 --> 02:21:26,944
...to kill the other half.

1580
02:21:38,034 --> 02:21:39,374
I've come to say goodbye.

1581
02:21:40,754 --> 02:21:42,624
I've booked passage for
California.

1582
02:21:46,134 --> 02:21:48,254
Jenny, give me one more day and
I'll go with you.

1583
02:21:49,054 --> 02:21:50,344
You'll be dead by then.

1584
02:21:52,014 --> 02:21:53,264
What would you have me do?

1585
02:21:53,264 --> 02:21:54,094
I don't know.

1586
02:21:58,104 --> 02:21:59,604
This will all be finished
tomorrow.

1587
02:22:00,064 --> 02:22:01,105
No it won't.

1588
02:22:05,565 --> 02:22:07,655
This whole place is going to
burn anyway.

1589
02:22:16,785 --> 02:22:20,165
I've heard of the poor are going
from door to door...

1590
02:22:20,165 --> 02:22:24,625
...in the Five Points, asking those
supporters for further riots...

1591
02:22:25,165 --> 02:22:27,335
...to place a candle in the
window.

1592
02:22:28,795 --> 02:22:30,595
Irish, Poles, Germans.

1593
02:22:31,675 --> 02:22:34,595
Ah, Mr. Greely, the city is not mad...

1594
02:22:35,176 --> 02:22:37,556
...I prophesise a dark night.

1595
02:23:00,326 --> 02:23:01,706
Nobody goes to work today.

1596
02:23:02,036 --> 02:23:03,916
We're shutting the factories down!

1597
02:23:03,916 --> 02:23:05,796
When the sun rose next...

1598
02:23:06,216 --> 02:23:08,086
...the city had split in half.

1599
02:23:08,716 --> 02:23:10,677
From all over New York
they came...

1600
02:23:10,677 --> 02:23:13,387
...ironworkers, factory boys,
street cleaners!

1601
02:23:13,387 --> 02:23:15,267
Irish, Polish, German...

1602
02:23:15,267 --> 02:23:18,057
...anyone who never cared about
slavery in the Union.

1603
02:23:18,597 --> 02:23:20,187
Anyone who couldn't buy his way out.

1604
02:23:21,227 --> 02:23:22,357
Let the sons of the rich...

1605
02:23:22,357 --> 02:23:23,857
....go and die they cried.

1606
02:23:24,317 --> 02:23:25,647
Let the sons of the poor...

1607
02:23:25,647 --> 02:23:26,857
...stay home.

1608
02:23:28,527 --> 02:23:30,237
The earth was shaking now.

1609
02:23:31,237 --> 02:23:33,447
But I was about my father's business.

1610
02:23:48,548 --> 02:23:50,008
Oh, mighty Lord...

1611
02:23:50,838 --> 02:23:53,008
...you are the dagger in
my hand.

1612
02:23:54,138 --> 02:23:56,518
Guide my hand on this day of
vengeance.

1613
02:23:56,518 --> 02:23:58,598
We give thanks to the Lord....

1614
02:23:59,018 --> 02:24:00,558
...for He is good.

1615
02:24:01,148 --> 02:24:03,438
With you, the swift cannot flee.

1616
02:24:03,438 --> 02:24:05,358
Nor the strong escape.

1617
02:24:05,358 --> 02:24:09,568
Let my sword devour, till its thirst
is quenched with blood....

1618
02:24:09,568 --> 02:24:11,448
...and my enemy sleeps forever.

1619
02:24:11,948 --> 02:24:14,238
For you and the God of
retribution.

1620
02:24:14,238 --> 02:24:16,738
For the Lord crushes the wicked.

1621
02:24:16,738 --> 02:24:18,579
The Lord is merciful.

1622
02:24:20,289 --> 02:24:23,419
And his love endures forever.

1623
02:24:24,499 --> 02:24:25,209
Amen.

1624
02:24:25,209 --> 02:24:25,919
Amen.

1625
02:24:25,919 --> 02:24:26,709
Amen.

1626
02:24:40,059 --> 02:24:41,059
Get the women upstairs!

1627
02:24:50,529 --> 02:24:52,660
From 18th precinct. The mob is
ransacking houses...

1628
02:24:52,660 --> 02:24:54,370
....in 27th street and 7th
avenue.

1629
02:24:54,370 --> 02:24:56,080
We have no force to send.

1630
02:24:56,080 --> 02:24:57,160
From 15th precinct.

1631
02:24:57,160 --> 02:24:59,330
All the stores are closing on
8th avenue.

1632
02:24:59,330 --> 02:25:01,330
From fear of the mob in 17th
street.

on fire.

...on 3rd avenue and are arming.

1639
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:25,481
Marshall's office on 3rd avenue
is burning down.

1640
02:25:25,481 --> 02:25:26,861
The police is of no avail.

1641
02:25:26,861 --> 02:25:28,151
Show yourself, please!

1642
02:25:28,151 --> 02:25:30,071
Two coloured men brought in
almost dead.

1643
02:25:30,071 --> 02:25:31,651
There are 50 more outside.

1644
02:25:31,651 --> 02:25:32,531

The blacks are being attacked
all over the city.

1646
02:25:34,281 --> 02:25:36,241
There's the 300 dollar man!

1647
02:25:36,491 --> 02:25:36,951
Get him!

1648
02:25:37,781 --> 02:25:39,291
Did your daddy buy you out of
the army!

1649
02:25:39,581 --> 02:25:41,001
Can he buy me out of the
army too?

1650
02:25:41,701 --> 02:25:43,661
There is danger of mob
attacking armoury...

I order you to disperse.

1708
02:28:57,657 --> 02:28:58,907
Fire!

1709
02:29:34,948 --> 02:29:36,408
Fire!

1710
02:29:52,208 --> 02:29:53,088
Fire!

1711
02:30:14,029 --> 02:30:15,359
Drive them into the square.

1712
02:30:18,569 --> 02:30:19,579
Bill!

1713
02:30:32,510 --> 02:30:33,510
Bill!

1714
02:32:15,483 --> 02:32:16,363
Bastards!

1715
02:32:16,363 --> 02:32:17,493
Shang!Hold on!

1716
02:32:51,444 --> 02:32:53,274
Thank God.

1717
02:32:54,484 --> 02:32:55,864
I die a true American.

1718
02:34:59,567 --> 02:35:00,367
Tomorrow morning...

1719
02:35:00,367 --> 02:35:01,987
...get our people down to
the docks.

1720
02:35:02,697 --> 02:35:04,908
I want every man and woman
coming off the boats...

1721
02:35:05,198 --> 02:35:06,788
...given hot soup and bread.

1722
02:35:11,958 --> 02:35:14,508
We're burying a lot of votes
here tonight.

1723
02:35:33,108 --> 02:35:34,188
In the end....

1724
02:35:34,188 --> 02:35:36,068
...they put candles on the
bodies...

1725
02:35:36,068 --> 02:35:38,899
...so their friends, if they
had any...

1726
02:35:39,989 --> 02:35:41,569
...could know them in the dark.

1727
02:35:43,329 --> 02:35:45,789
The city did this free
of charge.

1728
02:35:47,869 --> 02:35:53,209
Shang, Jimmy Spoils, Hellcat.
McGloin and more.

1729
02:35:55,589 --> 02:35:57,129
Friend or foe...

1730
02:35:57,759 --> 02:35:59,549
...it didn't make no difference
now.

1731
02:36:19,650 --> 02:36:21,280
It was four days and nights...

1732
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:24,410
..before the worst of the mob
was finally put down.

1733
02:36:26,490 --> 02:36:28,950
We never knew how many New
Yorkers died...

1734
02:36:28,950 --> 02:36:31,750
...that week, before the city
was finally delivered.

1735
02:36:33,710 --> 02:36:37,630
My father told me we was all
born of blood and tribulation.

1736
02:36:39,720 --> 02:36:43,300
And so then too, was our
great city.

1737
02:36:46,971 --> 02:36:48,311
But for those of us who...

1738
02:36:48,311 --> 02:36:50,851
...lived and died in them
furious days...

1739
02:36:51,891 --> 02:36:53,731
...it was like everything we
knew...

1740
02:36:54,231 --> 02:36:56,231
...was mildly swept away.

1741
02:36:58,071 --> 02:37:01,491
And no matter what they did to
build this city up again...

1742
02:37:03,451 --> 02:37:04,991
...for the rest of time...

1743
02:37:07,158 --> 02:37:11,454
...it would be like no one even knew
we was ever here.
