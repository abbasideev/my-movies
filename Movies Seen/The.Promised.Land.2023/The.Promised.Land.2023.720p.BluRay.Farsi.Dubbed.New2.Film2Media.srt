1
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:47,042
- Your Majesty. The carriage is waiting.
- Yes please. We'll drive when I'm ready.

2
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:59,542
Ludvig Kahlen, we are ready for you.

3
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:14,709
Chancellor of Paul

4
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:21,209
So who do we have here?

5
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:25,917
Captain Kahlen has returned home after
25 years of service in the German army.

6
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:30,751
He is applying for permission to
to build on the Jutland heath.

7
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:40,251
Nice, nice drawings, soldier.
It's just a waste of your time.

8
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:45,084
- The heath cannot be cultivated.
- All land can be cultivated.

9
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:50,376
A third of the kingdom lies
deserted. It's a blemish.

10
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:56,209
I can subdue the earth. I can
build the first colony on the heath.

11
00:02:56,376 --> 00:03:01,167
This is nothing but heather
and stones and sand. Nothing can grow there.

12
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:05,667
It has been proven time and time again
of better men than you.

13
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:11,209
With all due respect, I would like to ask for
to represent the king himself.

14
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:16,626
Yes of course. Is anybody there
is nice to call on His Majesty?

15
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:22,542
We don't waste any more of the state's
money to cultivate the heath.

16
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,501
Especially not on a conceited soldier
in a shabby uniform. Get him out.

17
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:35,417
I'm not asking you for a penny.
I finance it myself.

18
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:39,459
- How?
- I have my captain's pension.

19
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:45,042
It's nothing.

20
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:52,292
Let's say you succeed
to build a colony.

21
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,459
What do you think should be the reward
for your generous offer?

22
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:05,334
A noble title with associated estates
and servants.

23
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:11,209
Would you like to wait outside please?

24
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:24,042
He is nobody. His mother was
maid in a manor house.

25
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:27,459
He became a seaman,
until he joined the German army.

26
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:31,334
He managed to stay
captain despite his low status.

27
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:35,042
- His demands are crazy.
- The requirements don't matter.

28
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:41,084
We could promise him to be emperor.
There is no one who can cultivate that land.

29
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:45,709
But as long as he's out there,
then we can say to His Majesty, -

30
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:50,292
- that we are still fighting for
his beloved heath project.

31
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:57,959
(door opens)

32
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:02,584
Captain Kahlen, come inside.
We have good news.

33
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:57,334
(thunder)

34
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,751
Help! Help me!

35
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,292
(branch breaks)

36
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:16,959
A little telmaj for a poor man
little dill all alone in the forest.

37
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:23,334
What a fine bings you are.
You must have lots of money.

38
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:38,376
(shout and whistle)

39
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:11,751
Why the hell did you choose
to build a house right in my county?

40
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:14,667
The hands of the diligent shall prevail.

41
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:27,792
- What's in the boxes?
- I wanted to know that too.

42
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,709
They came all the way from Mecklenburg.

43
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:34,917
I do not understand
all that secrecy.

44
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:38,209
Are these all my men?

45
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:43,501
I need more than that if
The house must be ready before autumn.

46
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:48,584
No enterprising men want out
to kill himself out on the heath.

47
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:54,417
I need three times as many.
Then you have to find them in the neighboring towns.

48
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:59,251
I have buttock boils the size of
swan eggs. They do not thrive on the road.

49
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:05,126
In addition, the forests are teeming with outlaws.
Before I forget. Five Riksdaler.

50
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:10,417
As county commissioner, I must be compensated for
my toil in getting everything on the list.

51
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:14,667
Plus horses to transport
all that shit to the world's arsehole.

52
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:17,417
Yes, sorry, priest.

53
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,667
Captain, may I show you something?

54
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:25,376
I have the solution
on your problem with manpower.

55
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:29,751
You have no idea how happy I am,
that you have chosen our parish.

56
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:33,334
It is high time
that God's light shines on the heath.

57
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:40,292
Come on. I think,
I have found a home for you.

58
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:54,626
Johannes Eriksen, an experienced farmer,
and his wife, Ann Barbara.

59
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:01,167
It is illegal
to hire refugees.

60
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:07,167
They have fled from a brutal master.

61
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:12,334
Eriksen can work hard, and Ann
Barbara is a skilled housekeeper.

62
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:16,126
We can work for half time, sir.

63
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:21,709
We only ask for our own chamber, so Ann
Barbara should not sleep with the men.

64
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,292
a chamber,
two meals a day, no salary.

65
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,959
You won't get a better opportunity
in your situation.

66
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:33,834
I get visits from important people
men when the house is finished.

67
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:38,459
I expect,
it is held to a high standard.

68
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:40,876
Is that understood?

69
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:53,876
It will be OK. They never will
looking for you on the heath.

70
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:22,417
Well, Bondo. I stand here as someone else
idiot and wasting the best season.

71
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:24,709
It's now that the cheeks are flaring.

72
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:30,042
Bear portraits are high fashion
i whole Nordeurope, mr. de Schinkel.

73
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:34,084
- Where is my cousin?
- She is out lunging her horse.

74
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:37,751
She does nothing but
to run around with the damn horse.

75
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:43,834
There is a Captain Kahlen who is
in the process of building a house on the moor.

76
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:47,667
"King's House" he calls it.

77
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:51,334
You said no
more crazies would come.

78
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:56,376
That it was a matter of time,
before we could buy it all.

79
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:02,126
- Bald ones?
- Yes. Ludwig Kahlen.

80
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:07,209
- Find out who he is.
- Of course.

81
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:39,709
I have had better stowage in the army.

82
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:43,251
If you had bought a cow,
had we had thicker milk.

83
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:46,542
If I have to keep the house,
do i need a cow

84
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:50,542
I have made a detailed account
above my budget out here.

85
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:54,167
If a cow was needed,
had there been a cow.

86
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,334
It does not get better.

87
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:15,626
Everything must be in neat, small rows.

88
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:21,209
The floor must be dust-free, the food
lie perfectly in the middle of the plate.

89
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:26,167
He behaves
like a fine gentleman, -

90
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:30,459
- but his clothes are worn,
and his hands are rough.

91
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:36,376
- He's strange.
- The priest says we can trust him.

92
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,667
We can't trust anyone.

93
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:43,209
We will never get away from here without Iøn.

94
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:52,001
We stay here just one season. Just
until they are not looking for us anymore.

95
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:01,084
One season at Kongenshus.

96
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:05,417
Then we head towards the coast.
I want to see the sea.

97
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,959
I want to see the sea.

98
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:23,001
Where are you going?

99
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:27,501
Out to our strange gentleman.
He shouldn't go out there alone.

100
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:47,042
- They will need marl.
- We collect clay out by the sea.

101
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:50,126
The heather must be burned,
the soil must be fertilized.

102
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:53,751
It takes at least half a year,
before anything can be cultivated.

103
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:57,667
May I ask,
what are you planning to grow?

104
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:00,501
You are welcome to ask.

105
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:03,626
But you get no answer.

106
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:21,209
(chickens cluck)

107
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:28,334
Come here!

108
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:31,709
Thanks for the damn hen, bings!

109
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:34,667
- What happens?
- It's the outlaws.

110
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,667
What the hell are you guys doing?

111
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:43,959
Now all outlaws know,
that they can just come here and steal.

112
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:46,709
Why did you let her go?

113
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:51,667
You must not get too close
the kind of. The devil watches over them.

114
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:56,709
- You saw for yourself how dark she was.
- Shut up. She is a beggar child.

115
00:16:56,876 --> 00:17:00,751
They pick them up south.
Next time you stop her.

116
00:17:00,917 --> 00:17:06,001
We shall have no curse
on us. You can stop her yourself.

117
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:10,126
Pack your things. You are done here.

118
00:17:12,126 --> 00:17:14,001
(bell rings)

119
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:18,626
You are doing something amazing.

120
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:21,959
You can already feel life out here.

121
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:33,376
Johannes. Isn't that Preisler?

122
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:39,167
Johannes. please
to look after my horse in the barn.

123
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:57,459
Captain Kahlen?

124
00:17:57,626 --> 00:18:02,126
Major Preisler. I'm here on behalf of
by Frederik de Schinkel of Hald.

125
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:06,167
Owner of 130 farms
and the county judge of the region.

126
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:11,709
Sir. de Schinkel has asked me to invite
you for dinner at the estate tonight.

127
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:14,834
It would be an honor for me.

128
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:19,501
- I hope you have some other clothes.
- I have my uniform.

129
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:29,084
One of Mr. de Schinkel's tenant farmers
ran away recently.

130
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:32,959
Rumor has it,
he is still here in the area.

131
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:37,292
Johannes Eriksen and his wife.
Does that tell you anything?

132
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:40,376
I have the men you see here.

133
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:58,709
Schinkel.
Is he the one they ran away from?

134
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:04,667
The most important man here in the area? The
man i should stay friends with?

135
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:48,959
My uncle loved dogs. He got
written into his will, -

136
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:53,459
- that Frederik was not allowed to remove
a single dog portrait.

137
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:58,417
I think he was happier
for his dogs than his own children.

138
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:01,917
Edel Helene Leising,
Frederik's cousin.

139
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:06,251
Captain Ludvig Kahlen.

140
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:11,334
Are you related to
the Norwegian Count Leising?

141
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:16,167
That is my dad. They might know
much to the Norwegian nobility?

142
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:21,501
No... Only what everyone knows.
That your father is a close friend of the king.

143
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:33,792
Here he is.

144
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:39,626
Ludvig Kahlen.
Welcome to Hald Gods.

145
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:43,251
- National judge Schinkel...
- De Schinkel.

146
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:47,417
My father's name was Schinkel, but I
have changed it to de Schinkel.

147
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:50,501
De Schinkel, sorry.

148
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:54,542
From gardener to decorated captain
is quite an achievement.

149
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:57,376
It also took me 25 years.

150
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:03,584
25 years. Do you know how long
does it take a noble to become a captain?

151
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:05,834
Six months.

152
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:10,917
You must have hated those powder puffs,
who advanced before you, -

153
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:14,459
- just because they had
the real blood in the veins.

154
00:21:14,626 --> 00:21:18,584
- Those are the rules.
- Said by a real soldier.

155
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:31,959
So... you want to try farming the heath?

156
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:35,251
I want to build
the king's first colony out there.

157
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:41,084
The heath is God's nature in all its splendor.
Why castrate a wild animal?

158
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:45,876
Didn't God just put man
on earth to create civilization?

159
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:49,209
So we're not civilized out here?

160
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:54,834
God has nothing to do with civilization
to do. God is chaos. Life is chaos.

161
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:59,084
I do not agree.

162
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:03,709
You fought in the Silesian Wars.
Was it civilized?

163
00:22:03,876 --> 00:22:06,042
No, war is chaos.

164
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:11,042
But the winner is the one who can
figure out how to control chaos.

165
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:25,209
What do you think of my fiancé?
Isn't she beautiful to look at?

166
00:22:25,376 --> 00:22:30,042
Are we engaged? I can not remember,
I have said yes, Frederik.

167
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:32,917
As if it wasn't settled.

168
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:37,792
Her father begged me to
to take her. Not that I'm complaining.

169
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:45,209
Her family wants my fortune,
but I drew the longest straw.

170
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:50,001
Getting into the noble circles
is invaluable. That's what my father said.

171
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:55,167
- Your father was right.
- He created this from nothing.

172
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,876
Two cows and a plough.

173
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:02,042
Now he just lies
and rots in the ground.

174
00:23:02,209 --> 00:23:04,459
Life is chaos, Ludvig.

175
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:10,001
Cunt, dick, shit, blood, chaos.

176
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:14,667
We can't control shit.

177
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:20,584
It is only when we recognize that
that we can enjoy our insignificant lives.

178
00:23:20,751 --> 00:23:26,626
Everything you've said since we set
us to the table, it has been ridiculous.

179
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:35,084
Pardon. My cousin needs
a lesson in civilized behavior.

180
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:39,792
Why am I here?

181
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:44,917
You are here because you have built
on my land without permission.

182
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:48,417
- Your land?
- Yes, de Schinkel's Jordan.

183
00:23:48,584 --> 00:23:52,501
The heath belongs to the king.
All uncultivated land belongs to the king.

184
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:55,834
Are you a little bit deaf?
This is my land.

185
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:59,751
- Do you have a land registry card?
- I can't bear to find it.

186
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:04,959
- Then we have to get a surveyor up here...
- Or we can ask the county judge.

187
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:08,001
The national judge judges,
it is good enough.

188
00:24:08,209 --> 00:24:12,292
We have nothing more to talk about.
Miss Edel...

189
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:17,001
Your mother was a kitchen maid
Count Raven's estate, wasn't she?

190
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,834
He was a friend of the family.

191
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:25,167
A God-given scapegoat who took
for himself of all resorting to a lap, -

192
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:29,126
- and you are
as cheated out of his nose.

193
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:32,834
It's almost creepy.

194
00:24:33,001 --> 00:24:35,834
He was the one who sent you into the army?

195
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:39,334
My father did
with his bastards.

196
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:45,834
My little half-brothers with longing
eyes and soil under the nails.

197
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:51,001
And now the bastard wants to be
a big man out on the heath.

198
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:56,251
What do you get if you succeed?
And gods?

199
00:24:57,292 --> 00:25:01,792
En fin title? "From" Bald ones?

200
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:11,209
- What is it?
- A contract.

201
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:14,042
You try your luck
on Mr. de Schinkel's land.

202
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:18,001
He will help you with men,
provisions and materials.

203
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:21,751
In return, you pay
50% of your future income.

204
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:26,792
Should colonists come, stay
the tenant farmers of Mr. de Schinkel.

205
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,792
No thank you.

206
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:32,959
I would strongly advise you
to accept the offer.

207
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:36,751
It is the king's land.
I work for the king.

208
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:38,917
Vovvov.

209
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:57,501
There are not many who dare to say
Frederik opposed in that way.

210
00:26:04,126 --> 00:26:08,709
- See you again, Captain?
- I don't see how.

211
00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:13,876
There is a harvest festival in a month.
All the powder puffs are coming.

212
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:20,042
- First Sunday in September.
- I don't think I'm invited.

213
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:25,584
You can come as my guest.
I can invite whoever I want.

214
00:26:29,084 --> 00:26:32,667
Here. So you don't forget me
in the meantime.

215
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:14,667
Why is no one working?
Where are the men?

216
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:20,292
Major Preisler knocked on my door
and told me to get out of here immediately -

217
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:25,626
- and offer your men double wages
on one of de Schinkel's farms.

218
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:28,959
And you did that without hesitation?

219
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:35,376
I have been riding all night. Will you
stop shooting the messenger?

220
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:40,709
You couldn't know
that it was his land.

221
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:45,459
We are not finding any new workers.
No one dares to go up against Schinkel.

222
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:50,334
Has everyone gone mad? I have
the king's stamp on, I must be here.

223
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:54,376
- I have the law on my side.
- It does not matter.

224
00:27:54,542 --> 00:28:00,376
Does Frederik Schinkel want something,
he keeps going until he gets it.

225
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:05,126
He's all alone out there now. He has
didn't even get the heather burned off.

226
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:09,626
He can have a maximum of 100 Riksdalers
remaining of his captain's pension.

227
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:16,251
- 100 Riksdalers? That is nothing.
- No. He never gets that land ready.

228
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:20,459
And when winter comes,
then he signs.

229
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:27,876
"Dear captain. Have fun with that
build a colony on the heath without men.

230
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:33,126
Here's a little gift,
that can create a little joy in everyday life.

231
00:28:33,292 --> 00:28:36,126
Frederik de Schinkel."

232
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:47,417
It can be decorated outside by the hens.

233
00:28:56,834 --> 00:29:00,667
I know where we can get men.

234
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:28,584
So! Come here!

235
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:31,417
Let me go, dammit!

236
00:29:36,126 --> 00:29:40,501
- What's your name, thief?
- Anmai Mus, for found.

237
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:43,209
- How old are you?
- To.

238
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:46,917
- No you are not.
- So I'm 35.

239
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:49,584
I don't know, damn it.

240
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:54,876
Where are the taters you travel
around with? Where have they camped?

241
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:01,834
Do you remember this one?

242
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:07,709
Tomorrow morning you show me
Where they are. Are you following?

243
00:30:07,876 --> 00:30:12,542
- They kill me.
- That's not my problem.

244
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:22,667
Poor little Anmai Mouse.
She only had a short and hard life.

245
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:28,959
She had not eaten for 11 days,
and hunger drove her to theft.

246
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:34,584
Her mother and father would not have
her and sold her to the lawless.

247
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:38,001
Stop. I don't want to listen to it.

248
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,751
(whistle)

249
00:31:12,084 --> 00:31:14,042
No! No!

250
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:17,376
No, no, no, let me go!

251
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:23,667
Inept blackout.
You will get your punishment later.

252
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:28,626
What do you want here, bings?

253
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:32,792
I have work for you all.

254
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:36,792
10 rigsdalers for going into the field
until autumn.

255
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:39,917
You have no mark.

256
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:42,084
Today.

257
00:31:42,251 --> 00:31:44,709
Today!

258
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:49,792
A good soldier knows well that the law
forbids our kind to work.

259
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:54,959
- You can go to jail for that.
- Do we have a deal?

260
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:11,834
20 Riksdalers.
And I want that one too.

261
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:17,667
Your medal. I've always
wanted to be a general.

262
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:22,709
You can't get that. And I am
not general. I'm the captain.

263
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:44,084
Salute General Hector!

264
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:56,542
Do you remember when we met the Devil?
out here on the heath?

265
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:59,709
In the guise of a young boy.
We were excited!

266
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:04,917
Now he's the one who spanks,
for now the general is here!

267
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:08,417
Now the general is here!

268
00:33:08,584 --> 00:33:11,667
Now working
the general and the devil...

269
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:15,376
Be sure to keep the fire going
under control.

270
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:55,584
- Hey! A penny for a night?
- No, no... so.

271
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,542
Take the stick, bings.

272
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:51,959
(latter)

273
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:56,209
When you have taken the wand,
are you part of her clan.

274
00:34:56,376 --> 00:35:01,459
You can get her for five reigsdaler.
Then we get rid of that blackout.

275
00:35:03,209 --> 00:35:06,709
We are not in the same clan. Are you following?

276
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:23,167
Freshly shot game for the harvest festival.
I shot two.

277
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:28,751
You all get to taste.
You must all live well.

278
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:33,417
But first of all,
then I must live.

279
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:38,834
- Have you seen the animals? I shot two.
- Unfortunately, I have worrying news.

280
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:43,292
Kahlen has hired a group of taters
to work for themselves.

281
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:47,292
But Preisler has also discovered
something else.

282
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:59,959
Three wagon loads as close to the shore as you can
find it. And it must be whitler.

283
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:05,876
It must be whiting.

284
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:16,751
- Sir. de Schinkel was happy with it.
- Then he can put it on himself.

285
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:22,084
Mine should be more simple.
Honorable, but still feminine.

286
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:26,501
They mean something
a military man would appreciate?

287
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:51,959
You should hold on
far away from Schinkel.

288
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:56,876
- Everyone, who is something, is coming tonight.
- Everyone, is there anything?

289
00:36:57,042 --> 00:37:01,501
Businessmen.
Folks, I'm going to trade with.

290
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:05,542
Apparently it's not the only one
reason you go there.

291
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:11,501
Don't meddle with mine
personal matters. You are a housekeeper.

292
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:16,834
Then it's as good as it gets.
The nice people must accept you as you are.

293
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:21,209
But you must remember
to hide that stitching in the crease.

294
00:37:46,251 --> 00:37:50,917
Thank God you're here.
I could hardly recognize you.

295
00:37:51,126 --> 00:37:53,584
Ludvig Kahlen.

296
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:57,376
- Captain. Heat conditions.
- De Schinkel.

297
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:02,376
Glad you came. But you can
don't be here with the lousy wig.

298
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:06,209
I can't offer it
to my other guests.

299
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:11,251
- There are no lice in my wig.
- I can see it is tingling and crawling.

300
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:15,417
Lise has brought a wig,
that you can borrow.

301
00:38:16,584 --> 00:38:19,001
Com. Immediately.

302
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,042
And...

303
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:35,459
Like that. Then you are as good as new.

304
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:37,709
Enjoy the party.

305
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:46,876
Follow me, sir.
The lady is waiting for you.

306
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,376
- Miss Edel.
- Captivating

307
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:10,084
It was a gift from your cousin.

308
00:39:11,251 --> 00:39:14,001
He is a spoiled child.

309
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:17,709
Trying desperately
to impress his father's friends.

310
00:39:17,876 --> 00:39:21,626
He drinks from morning to night
and boasts -

311
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:25,292
- all the female tyents,
he has ridden to.

312
00:39:25,459 --> 00:39:30,751
It's like he thinks I'll find
the amusing or attractive.

313
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:35,417
I have to go.

314
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:38,917
I have to get out of here.

315
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:46,542
- What does your father say?
- He only thinks about the money.

316
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:49,959
He has forbidden me to go home.

317
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:55,667
I will stay here over the winter
and try to see the good in Frederik.

318
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:59,542
He wants us married within a year.

319
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:05,292
Unless I can introduce him
for a better alternative.

320
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:12,417
Can I do that?

321
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:21,959
A man who gets the king's high
wish to come true, -

322
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:25,667
- with that title and reward,
that comes with it.

323
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:30,959
He might become worthy of
to marry you.

324
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:35,376
If that's what you're asking.

325
00:40:38,751 --> 00:40:42,042
Otherwise I thought I was obvious.

326
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:48,876
They haven't had many incoming calls
conversations with women. Have you?

327
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:53,667
This is the longest conversation,
I have had. Correct.

328
00:40:55,792 --> 00:41:00,126
And you will succeed
to build your colony out there?

329
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,501
And.

330
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:16,626
(chorus)

331
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:49,209
I apologize for the interruption,
but there is a surprise, -

332
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:53,584
- and I can't wait any longer.
It is something quite special.

333
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:15,001
This farmer ran away in the spring.

334
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:19,876
I treated him and his wife
with respect, even with love.

335
00:42:20,042 --> 00:42:23,626
As I treat all my people.

336
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:29,501
And he thanked me by
to run his way.

337
00:42:32,626 --> 00:42:36,709
He hid with Ludvig Kahlen
out on the heath, -

338
00:42:36,876 --> 00:42:40,376
- But enough about that.
It's a long story.

339
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:46,001
(chorus)

340
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:56,834
If you interfere
and legal bondeafstraffelse, -

341
00:42:57,001 --> 00:43:00,542
- you yourself are considered
who breaks the law.

342
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:05,626
Do not worry. The water is not
not nearly as hot as it looks.

343
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:20,126
(John screams)

344
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:51,584
One more time for the beautiful girls.

345
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:55,917
(John screams)

346
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:05,667
One more time for the beautiful girls.

347
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:09,876
(John complains)

348
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:23,542
It's a good idea to stop now.

349
00:44:23,709 --> 00:44:26,584
The people are not with you.

350
00:44:35,501 --> 00:44:39,042
No. Do it one more time
for the beautiful girls.

351
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:42,084
Frederick! Now that's enough.

352
00:44:42,251 --> 00:44:47,251
Do it one more time now!
Then do it for the beautiful girls!

353
00:45:03,126 --> 00:45:06,167
You killed him.

354
00:45:06,334 --> 00:45:10,834
I have every right to
to punish my own serfs.

355
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:15,917
No one could know he would perish.
What do you say, Bondo?

356
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:21,626
Yes, that's right.
It was an accident.

357
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:26,417
So, the farmer must have been
delicately designed or...

358
00:45:26,584 --> 00:45:29,709
Let him be. He is mine.

359
00:45:29,876 --> 00:45:33,876
Not anymore.
According to the law, he belongs to God now.

360
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:36,542
So take him.

361
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:55,417
Ludwig. I know,
that you use taters as labor.

362
00:45:55,584 --> 00:46:00,667
You must not house illegal taters.
You are ordered to send them away.

363
00:46:03,334 --> 00:46:06,876
Aren't the outlaws gone?
tomorrow morning, -

364
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:10,751
- then we remove them by force...
and you too.

365
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:16,834
I'll see through that,
if you sign our contract.

366
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:27,834
I am sorry.

367
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:12,584
You didn't hit me like a man
who was afraid of something.

368
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:16,917
We had a deal.
Otherwise I can't get the ground ready.

369
00:48:17,084 --> 00:48:22,292
There is no reason for you to travel.
You can work at night.

370
00:48:24,126 --> 00:48:28,751
Are you an idiot?
There is a boiled man in your field.

371
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:33,667
We sure as hell don't want to die
for your heating project.

372
00:48:55,876 --> 00:48:58,501
What do we do?

373
00:48:59,876 --> 00:49:03,667
You won't make it through the winter
without money or men.

374
00:49:03,834 --> 00:49:08,001
I don't need men.
I can do it myself.

375
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:13,584
- The land will be cultivated in the spring.
- And what about Schinkel?

376
00:49:44,584 --> 00:49:48,626
Schinkel takes trips
between the maids.

377
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:53,292
He always has one or two guards with him,
so you don't run away.

378
00:49:56,959 --> 00:50:01,876
When Johannes and I got married,
he became enraged.

379
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:05,167
And now he has killed him.

380
00:50:08,126 --> 00:50:11,959
Schinkel doesn't stop,
before he has won.

381
00:50:14,459 --> 00:50:17,834
Where do you intend to go?

382
00:50:19,626 --> 00:50:24,626
- As far away as I can get.
- I would like to ask you to stay.

383
00:50:26,459 --> 00:50:30,417
I can't both cultivate the fields
and keep the house.

384
00:50:30,584 --> 00:50:34,459
- I need you.
- Keep the house?

385
00:50:35,459 --> 00:50:40,292
My husband is dead and you are afraid
if the floor is not swept, -

386
00:50:40,459 --> 00:50:44,126
- or if everything is perfect,
as usual!

387
00:50:49,042 --> 00:50:52,167
- I can pay you.
- With what?

388
00:50:52,334 --> 00:50:55,959
- You have no more money.
- When the king hears...

389
00:50:56,126 --> 00:51:00,209
Stop talking about the king.
You've never met him.

390
00:51:00,376 --> 00:51:05,459
You'll never get to that.
He doesn't even know you exist.

391
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:57,084
What is Schinkel afraid of?

392
00:51:57,251 --> 00:52:01,251
what happens to him
if colonies come out here?

393
00:52:01,417 --> 00:52:06,459
Then he loses his power.
He becomes an insignificant little man.

394
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:13,667
I have to do three men's work,
so I have to have double rent.

395
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:16,459
And a fifth of the harvest.

396
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:22,542
A tenth.

397
00:52:27,834 --> 00:52:31,584
And I want to know
what you intend to grow.

398
00:52:43,584 --> 00:52:47,042
- What is it?
- Potatoes.

399
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:51,334
They grow them in Germany and France.
They are sailing creatures.

400
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:55,792
They can withstand almost anything.
They just must not get frost.

401
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:06,959
My mother was a kitchen maid. On an estate.

402
00:53:07,126 --> 00:53:13,084
She was in the same situation as you.
With her master.

403
00:53:14,376 --> 00:53:17,167
You are the son of a landowner?

404
00:53:17,334 --> 00:53:21,042
He was my father, yes.
But I was not his son.

405
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:26,876
(clink)

406
00:53:33,334 --> 00:53:36,001
Damned shit bowl!

407
00:53:45,501 --> 00:53:48,376
What are you doing here?

408
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:53,001
I've run away from those stupid pigs.

409
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:55,751
I don't want to be sold.

410
00:54:00,626 --> 00:54:02,876
Come on.

411
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:07,251
You have to find the others again.
You can't be here.

412
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:20,209
I can't take care of a child.
We don't even have food for ourselves.

413
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:18,542
Damned thief, damned thief.

414
00:55:18,709 --> 00:55:25,084
You have stolen my knife, and tomorrow
at seven you lose your life.

415
00:55:26,709 --> 00:55:30,751
A fool! Take it, dear father.

416
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:39,667
- It eats children, you idiot.
- No, it does not.

417
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:44,834
It is much more afraid of you,
than you are for it. Came.

418
00:55:47,251 --> 00:55:51,042
Kitchen, look! I'm holding a fool!

419
00:55:51,209 --> 00:55:54,667
I don't understand your tater words,
Anmai Go.

420
00:55:54,834 --> 00:55:58,376
Madrum... It comes from Latin.

421
00:55:58,542 --> 00:56:01,626
It is a Rotvæl word for mother.

422
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:06,751
Madrum, Gud-bings and bette papa.

423
00:56:12,876 --> 00:56:16,417
Yes that's fine. Then we work.

424
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:25,959
(thunder)

425
00:56:27,001 --> 00:56:31,209
But the miller took little Carl Andersen
and threw him into the lake.

426
00:56:31,376 --> 00:56:35,209
And then everyone knew
that the miller drowned children every night.

427
00:56:35,376 --> 00:56:40,417
- Why does no one do anything about the pig?
- It's coming. Want to hear more?

428
00:56:40,584 --> 00:56:45,376
- Yes, damn it. What a pig!
- You have to stop that banter.

429
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:50,292
Why didn't he just fly in
to the children if he could fly?

430
00:56:50,459 --> 00:56:53,417
The miller himself had four children.

431
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:17,584
(Anmai Mus hoster)

432
00:57:17,751 --> 00:57:21,751
You should drink it.
Your lungs must rest.

433
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:42,751
Her body can't fight back.
She needs food.

434
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:48,417
- Porridge and water are not enough.
- That's what we have.

435
00:57:48,584 --> 00:57:52,834
- We have the potatoes.
- We don't touch them.

436
00:57:53,001 --> 00:57:57,667
We have one goat left. We must
survive on the milk all winter.

437
00:57:57,834 --> 00:58:02,084
- There are 20 sacks of potatoes...
- We don't touch them!

438
00:58:11,042 --> 00:58:15,917
Edel's father says she's babbling about
Ludvig Kahlen in his letters home.

439
00:58:16,084 --> 00:58:18,376
Does she care about him?

440
00:58:18,542 --> 00:58:22,126
She is a realist.
She would never choose a moor farmer -

441
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:27,792
- rather than the most wealthy
man in the area. Never.

442
00:58:28,876 --> 00:58:31,834
No, she wouldn't.

443
00:58:35,126 --> 00:58:40,834
She's smarter than that.
So what does she know that we don't?

444
00:58:43,626 --> 00:58:47,876
So, he got a shipment
all the way from Germany.

445
00:58:48,042 --> 00:58:52,001
- Maybe it's potatoes.
- Potatoes?

446
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:58,917
If you don't say
that they can grow in almost any type of soil?

447
00:59:19,834 --> 00:59:22,959
Anmai Mouse, go in and rest.

448
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,876
(bell rings)

449
00:59:54,126 --> 00:59:56,751
Merry Christmas, Ludvig.

450
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:02,959
- You hoped it was Edel.
- What are you doing here, Schinkel?

451
01:00:03,126 --> 01:00:07,126
De Schinkel, Ludvig. The Schinkel.

452
01:00:10,334 --> 01:00:15,709
Are you still here? You just come
home when you get tired of the heat.

453
01:00:15,876 --> 01:00:19,584
You will always be
my little Ann Barbara.

454
01:00:23,126 --> 01:00:26,626
I actually came in good faith.

455
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:33,251
Leftovers from Christmas dinner.
There is both pork and cake.

456
01:00:33,417 --> 01:00:38,001
You probably have to gnaw a little
to get the meat off the bones.

457
01:00:42,959 --> 01:00:46,334
Get into the heat.
I have good news.

458
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:53,751
I have not been fair.

459
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:58,251
You come out here on the heath
with your big dream.

460
01:00:58,417 --> 01:01:03,834
Then I just sit up there on the property
and spoils it all for you.

461
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:15,667
- Aren't you curious?
- It's money.

462
01:01:15,834 --> 01:01:19,251
Yes please. It is 2000 Riksdalers.

463
01:01:22,126 --> 01:01:27,167
That's enough to build two colonies.
Hire as many men as you want.

464
01:01:27,334 --> 01:01:31,292
- You can live like a king.
- I will not work for you.

465
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:37,667
You don't have to work for anyone. Just
go somewhere else and cultivate the heath.

466
01:01:37,834 --> 01:01:43,459
As long as it's far away, the two of us
will be free to stare at each other.

467
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:51,084
Start over somewhere else.

468
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:54,251
Then the wallet is yours.

469
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:06,334
Then we have an agreement.

470
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:10,459
I want to go home
to my warm fireplace.

471
01:02:15,417 --> 01:02:20,042
One more thing. Of course you must
report to the Interest Chamber, -

472
01:02:20,209 --> 01:02:24,459
- that this is my land
and always has been.

473
01:04:07,751 --> 01:04:09,584
Ludwig.

474
01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:12,959
Ludwig.

475
01:04:13,126 --> 01:04:17,959
That goat is worth a hundred times more
than a fucking sack of potatoes.

476
01:04:18,126 --> 01:04:22,167
What if the harvest fails?
Ludvig, won't you... Ludvig!

477
01:04:55,751 --> 01:04:58,876
I know it's Mysling.

478
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:02,959
I can't anymore
hear her out there.

479
01:05:07,251 --> 01:05:13,167
Tell the story again. What happens,
when the colonists come, bette papa?

480
01:05:15,876 --> 01:05:20,084
When the colonists come,
then we can cultivate the whole moor, -

481
01:05:20,251 --> 01:05:23,001
- and then comes the king
and visit us.

482
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:25,251
Overbingsen.

483
01:05:28,459 --> 01:05:33,001
Yes. Then comes the overbing
and visit us.

484
01:05:35,001 --> 01:05:40,834
And then there are fireplaces
in all rooms, we get closed windows...

485
01:05:41,876 --> 01:05:45,376
And you get all the food you can eat.

486
01:05:47,167 --> 01:05:50,792
And we get animals out in the barn.

487
01:05:50,959 --> 01:05:54,917
As many animals,
which Noah had on his ark.

488
01:06:12,626 --> 01:06:14,709
(door opens)

489
01:06:20,459 --> 01:06:24,292
I have given my blanket
to Anmai Mus.

490
01:06:25,584 --> 01:06:28,459
I just need the heat.

491
01:07:08,209 --> 01:07:12,959
I know your heart belongs
another. Mine does too.

492
01:07:44,167 --> 01:07:47,084
Are there more Mussels?

493
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:08,626
- When are they coming up?
- In two or three months.

494
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:12,751
And then there will be many more of them.
Hundreds of sacks.

495
01:08:12,917 --> 01:08:16,751
- Damn it, hundreds?
- One more.

496
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:44,626
Frost!

497
01:09:57,792 --> 01:10:02,376
Carpets are not enough.
Take the heather! Take the heather!

498
01:10:24,917 --> 01:10:27,334
(thunder)

499
01:10:33,834 --> 01:10:35,917
(screams)

500
01:11:20,001 --> 01:11:23,042
Bette far, and rydling!

501
01:11:23,209 --> 01:11:26,417
Bette far, and rydling!

502
01:11:26,584 --> 01:11:29,667
A clearing, come on!

503
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:44,792
And rider, bette far!

504
01:11:56,959 --> 01:12:00,501
And it was you
there found it, Anmai Mouse.

505
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:04,751
And you were the one who found it.

506
01:12:27,251 --> 01:12:30,917
"Cultivated on the heath. L. Kahlen."

507
01:12:33,209 --> 01:12:37,834
Are you aware of what that means?
It has taken five decades.

508
01:12:38,001 --> 01:12:41,959
you behave
as if he invented the wheel.

509
01:12:42,126 --> 01:12:47,584
- It took a whole year to grow one sack.
- 80 sacks according to this.

510
01:12:48,542 --> 01:12:51,542
- His Majesty the King.
- Your Majesty.

511
01:12:51,709 --> 01:12:56,167
We have received a shipment of potatoes
from the Jutland heath.

512
01:12:56,334 --> 01:13:00,626
- It is correct...
- It is a big day for Denmark.

513
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:06,792
Get some colonists out there and worry
to send an appropriate reward.

514
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:18,876
What?

515
01:13:20,459 --> 01:13:25,042
Miss, the captain has succeeded
to grow potatoes on the heath.

516
01:13:25,209 --> 01:13:28,376
- Where did you hear that?
- Bondos kammerpige.

517
01:13:28,542 --> 01:13:34,126
They made him a royal surveyor.
50 colonists come from Germany.

518
01:13:55,251 --> 01:13:59,584
I never doubted. Never.
Neither has God.

519
01:13:59,751 --> 01:14:03,167
Speaking of Our Lord,
then I leave you for a time.

520
01:14:03,334 --> 01:14:08,251
- Tomorrow I go to Odense.
- You have your head in a bucket there.

521
01:14:08,417 --> 01:14:13,459
And to Copenhagen to collect money
into the first church on the moor.

522
01:14:13,626 --> 01:14:16,334
Cheers! Pancakes!

523
01:14:16,501 --> 01:14:18,917
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

524
01:14:52,959 --> 01:14:55,126
Lavmos...

525
01:14:56,376 --> 01:15:01,751
... peat is often stingy...

526
01:15:01,917 --> 01:15:06,417
Nutritious.
Stingy, that's something else entirely.

527
01:15:06,584 --> 01:15:09,417
- Nutritious.
- Louis.

528
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:25,209
Are you Ludvig Kahlen?

529
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:35,792
Welcome to Kongenshus.

530
01:15:35,959 --> 01:15:40,459
You who stand here today,
will go down in history -

531
01:15:40,626 --> 01:15:45,792
- as the king's first colonists
on the Danish heath.

532
01:15:45,959 --> 01:15:49,334
The building materials for your houses
on the way.

533
01:15:49,501 --> 01:15:55,417
You can camp in the valley sheltered from
the wind and recover from the journey.

534
01:15:55,584 --> 01:16:00,292
- We have bread and meat for everyone.
- What is she doing here?

535
01:16:02,959 --> 01:16:07,917
She works here. She helps
with the animals and the surveying.

536
01:16:11,626 --> 01:16:14,917
- Anmai Go, order.
- No!

537
01:16:17,876 --> 01:16:23,417
Her kind bring death and misfortune.
If we're going to stay, she's got to go.

538
01:16:36,126 --> 01:16:41,876
I make sure she doesn't come near
wives and children. She stays at the house.

539
01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:49,126
You won't see her again.

540
01:16:53,251 --> 01:16:57,709
Let time pass and they will discover
that you are not at all dangerous.

541
01:16:57,876 --> 01:17:00,709
It's like I stink of stench.

542
01:17:00,876 --> 01:17:03,792
It is not you,
there is something wrong with.

543
01:17:03,959 --> 01:17:07,459
They are afraid of you,
although they should know better.

544
01:17:07,626 --> 01:17:11,126
Just like you once
was afraid of small beetles.

545
01:17:17,917 --> 01:17:21,376
I think you said
that you don't stink.

546
01:17:22,876 --> 01:17:26,542
Stop teasing.
You're bad at it.

547
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:29,834
There's someone in here
that reeks of stench.

548
01:17:30,001 --> 01:17:35,126
- You stink of horse piss!
- What did you say?

549
01:17:35,292 --> 01:17:39,334
I have never heard...
That's the worst thing I've heard!

550
01:17:42,751 --> 01:17:46,709
Two steps to the right. There!

551
01:17:46,876 --> 01:17:50,501
And then you write 220
in this column.

552
01:17:50,667 --> 01:17:54,501
A total, total and a circle.

553
01:17:55,709 --> 01:18:00,959
Doesn't the wig guy get angry about,
that we are so close to his castle?

554
01:18:01,126 --> 01:18:04,751
Maybe, but he decides
no longer here.

555
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:29,417
Dear Frederik. You can easily
remain an important piece out here, -

556
01:18:29,584 --> 01:18:32,751
- even though colonists have arrived.

557
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:38,792
But... Ludvig Kahlen
is royal surveyor now.

558
01:18:39,792 --> 01:18:43,376
If you fight him,
then you risk everything.

559
01:18:44,917 --> 01:18:48,501
You have to
to make peace with him.

560
01:18:52,876 --> 01:18:56,876
Then say you want to get married
with me right now.

561
01:18:57,042 --> 01:19:03,167
What is holding you back? You say,
that I become an important piece.

562
01:19:03,376 --> 01:19:05,876
So say yes.

563
01:19:09,001 --> 01:19:11,417
Say yes.

564
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:19,834
Do not you think,
that I know about your plan, what?

565
01:19:20,001 --> 01:19:25,084
You probably already spread
your legs for him.

566
01:19:25,251 --> 01:19:28,417
Let go of me. Let go of me. Let go of me!

567
01:19:38,084 --> 01:19:41,584
Came. Hit me again.

568
01:19:42,626 --> 01:19:45,042
Hit me again.

569
01:19:45,876 --> 01:19:47,959
(roars)

570
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:55,417
- Mister...
- What are you doing?

571
01:19:56,959 --> 01:20:00,376
What is it?

572
01:20:00,542 --> 01:20:02,709
No no!

573
01:20:02,876 --> 01:20:06,292
Stop! Stop, stop!

574
01:20:09,084 --> 01:20:12,042
Stop, Frederik!
(the maid screams)

575
01:20:16,084 --> 01:20:20,459
You are crazy.
You are crazy.

576
01:20:40,917 --> 01:20:46,334
Kahlen and his potato Germans
gotta get off my heat, Bondo.

577
01:20:48,251 --> 01:20:50,667
He has to go.

578
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:17,501
This is the way.
There is plenty of food in there.

579
01:21:28,376 --> 01:21:30,459
(horsehair)

580
01:21:35,917 --> 01:21:39,584
- What happens?
- I think I dreamed something.

581
01:21:39,751 --> 01:21:41,834
(horsehair)

582
01:21:45,501 --> 01:21:46,751
Stay here.

583
01:21:57,334 --> 01:21:59,417
(horsehair)

584
01:22:15,792 --> 01:22:19,209
Calm, calm... calm.

585
01:22:22,209 --> 01:22:25,542
Go inside and lock the doors.

586
01:22:25,709 --> 01:22:27,459
And...

587
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:45,209
(wolf howl and scream)

588
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:48,667
(shouts and screams)

589
01:23:09,167 --> 01:23:14,126
- A clean cut. It wasn't the wolves.
- They must have smelled the blood.

590
01:23:14,292 --> 01:23:19,542
What's going on? Half of
our animals are dead. Whos behind?

591
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:22,542
Peter?

592
01:23:22,709 --> 01:23:25,167
Peter!

593
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:29,376
- Peter.
- Being!

594
01:23:30,501 --> 01:23:32,167
Being!

595
01:24:10,917 --> 01:24:13,126
What kind of horse is that?

596
01:24:13,292 --> 01:24:16,501
You have beaten
two innocent civilians killed.

597
01:24:16,667 --> 01:24:20,709
I hope you have strong evidence
for such a crazy claim.

598
01:24:20,876 --> 01:24:25,042
- But I'm just a national judge.
- They were under the king's protection.

599
01:24:25,209 --> 01:24:29,626
I think you've had visitors
by some highway robbers.

600
01:24:29,792 --> 01:24:32,251
They have ravaged the area.

601
01:24:32,417 --> 01:24:37,667
Once they have tasted blood,
then they come again, and they come again.

602
01:24:37,834 --> 01:24:41,251
- And they come again.
- Stay away from the heath.

603
01:24:41,417 --> 01:24:43,584
Is that understood?

604
01:24:45,501 --> 01:24:50,542
Chaos, Ludvig. You can make plans,
as crazy as you want.

605
01:24:50,709 --> 01:24:55,667
Life is chaos. Why is it
so hard for you to accept?

606
01:26:00,084 --> 01:26:02,959
Can I have a glass of water, please?

607
01:26:03,126 --> 01:26:07,209
You can do it.
The well is right out there.

608
01:26:07,376 --> 01:26:09,459
- What?
- Ann Barbara.

609
01:26:09,626 --> 01:26:12,751
We want to be alone.

610
01:26:14,251 --> 01:26:16,334
Of course.

611
01:26:21,501 --> 01:26:25,876
- I thought she was a housekeeper.
- So is she.

612
01:26:31,084 --> 01:26:32,917
They should not have come.

613
01:26:33,084 --> 01:26:36,584
I know,
who killed the colonists.

614
01:26:36,751 --> 01:26:41,876
Major Preisler and his friend Rømer came
with four men in chains.

615
01:26:42,042 --> 01:26:45,126
They must have taken them from the prison.

616
01:26:45,292 --> 01:26:48,001
- Are they still at the estate?
- No.

617
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:54,126
They don't stop here.
Is there somewhere else they could be?

618
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,959
Where can they hide?

619
01:26:58,792 --> 01:27:01,501
Frederik's hunting lodge.

620
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:08,584
- What are you going to do?
- It's best you go back. Now.

621
01:27:12,834 --> 01:27:14,792
Come on.

622
01:27:27,501 --> 01:27:29,584
See you.

623
01:27:37,667 --> 01:27:42,834
I know who killed Peter
and Vera. And I know where they are.

624
01:27:43,001 --> 01:27:48,334
We would never have come if we knew
They were at war with a landowner.

625
01:27:48,501 --> 01:27:51,917
- You should have said that.
- It's the king's land.

626
01:27:52,084 --> 01:27:55,459
We have the law on our side.

627
01:27:55,626 --> 01:28:01,417
The assailants are coming back.
Do you understand? We have to stop them.

628
01:28:02,709 --> 01:28:05,876
Have any of you been in the army?

629
01:28:08,042 --> 01:28:13,834
None of us lift a finger,
before you send the devil girl away.

630
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:21,501
- She has nothing to do with this.
- We don't want to listen to it, Kahlen!

631
01:28:23,792 --> 01:28:29,292
We said she brought misfortune.
Now two of our people are dead!

632
01:28:31,209 --> 01:28:35,042
Send her away or we leave.

633
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:39,209
And then you can forget everything
about your colony.

634
01:28:46,834 --> 01:28:49,584
What are you saying?

635
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:54,876
We can't just send her away.
She is our child!

636
01:28:55,042 --> 01:28:58,292
- Then let them travel.
- Now hold it.

637
01:29:02,876 --> 01:29:06,167
I have no choice.

638
01:29:07,334 --> 01:29:09,501
Yes, you have.

639
01:29:10,834 --> 01:29:14,834
But it all has to add up
Ludvig Kahlen's big plan.

640
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:20,584
You just want your noble title,
so you can mingle with the nice people.

641
01:29:20,751 --> 01:29:24,626
What do you want me to do?

642
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:27,626
I have no choice.

643
01:30:13,917 --> 01:30:18,667
It is a monastery in Odense,
where they take in homeless children.

644
01:30:18,834 --> 01:30:24,709
She gets food and a place to sleep. But
she will work for a living.

645
01:30:54,084 --> 01:30:57,959
You will be happy there,
where are you going.

646
01:30:58,126 --> 01:31:01,251
There are many other children.

647
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:06,084
So...

648
01:31:07,334 --> 01:31:08,834
And...

649
01:31:25,126 --> 01:31:28,167
You are going to have a good life.

650
01:31:28,334 --> 01:31:33,251
You have learned to read. You know all about
how to care for animals.

651
01:31:38,959 --> 01:31:41,751
Now you must be strong.

652
01:31:41,917 --> 01:31:43,876
So... Drive.

653
01:31:51,834 --> 01:31:55,667
Bette far! Bette far!

654
01:32:09,001 --> 01:32:12,667
How long are we going to stay
in this hole?

655
01:32:12,834 --> 01:32:15,501
Until the work is done.

656
01:32:15,667 --> 01:32:19,459
12 years in a penitentiary,
and he calls this a hole?

657
01:32:19,626 --> 01:32:25,209
I go in and rest. We ride
in an hour. Get your weapons ready.

658
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:30,917
(horse neigh and sound of horse hooves)

659
01:34:35,459 --> 01:34:37,834
What the hell is going on?

660
01:34:38,001 --> 01:34:42,292
The Germans attacked us.
I was the only one who got away.

661
01:34:45,959 --> 01:34:48,209
Those damn potato farmers!

662
01:34:48,376 --> 01:34:52,626
It was all done with
military precision. Led by Kahlen.

663
01:34:52,792 --> 01:34:58,167
And you're standing here drinking! You should
stay and fight, you coward!

664
01:34:59,417 --> 01:35:02,542
Give me new men,
then I'll fix him.

665
01:35:02,709 --> 01:35:07,501
- Do it! What are you waiting for?
- Did you see who killed Rømer?

666
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:10,709
Kahlen.

667
01:35:10,876 --> 01:35:16,751
He has murdered a former officer
in cold blood, and we have a witness.

668
01:35:35,001 --> 01:35:40,459
The Germans have told what
has happened. And where were you last night.

669
01:35:42,501 --> 01:35:45,917
Did you collect money for the church?

670
01:35:46,959 --> 01:35:51,376
They also said,
that you have sent Anmai Mus away.

671
01:35:59,376 --> 01:36:03,376
- Where is Ann Barbara?
- There is a letter.

672
01:36:26,959 --> 01:36:31,334
If you can prove that Kahlen
killed an officer...

673
01:36:31,501 --> 01:36:35,459
We can.
Major Preisler saw it with his own eyes.

674
01:36:35,626 --> 01:36:39,376
- We would like to help you, Schinkel.
- De Schinkel.

675
01:36:39,542 --> 01:36:43,209
No landowner wants,
that Kahlen builds his colony.

676
01:36:43,376 --> 01:36:47,334
But there is one thing
that surprises us all a little.

677
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:51,709
It is the distribution of income,
as you suggest.

678
01:36:51,876 --> 01:36:56,209
This is my land. It's only fair
that I get the majority.

679
01:36:56,376 --> 01:36:59,292
It's not your land, Schinkel.

680
01:36:59,459 --> 01:37:02,292
- You know that.
- De Schinkel.

681
01:37:02,459 --> 01:37:09,084
And if it goes as it should, it can
You get a tenth like the rest of us.

682
01:37:09,251 --> 01:37:13,084
You sit and insult me
in my own home.

683
01:37:14,084 --> 01:37:17,001
You can forget about it. Forget it!

684
01:37:26,042 --> 01:37:29,376
Sir. de Schinkel accepts
your conditions.

685
01:37:29,542 --> 01:37:34,459
He just needs to sleep on it.
But we have an agreement.

686
01:37:36,876 --> 01:37:38,959
Damn it!

687
01:37:39,792 --> 01:37:42,959
He has killed an officer.

688
01:37:44,001 --> 01:37:49,626
He succeeds in uniting Central Jutland
most powerful landowners.

689
01:37:49,792 --> 01:37:54,667
Men who usually hate each other
like the plague, in a common front!

690
01:37:54,834 --> 01:37:59,959
Against us! I'm not taking the fall
for him. I damn well don't.

691
01:38:00,126 --> 01:38:03,542
We agreed that Kahlen
did not have a format for the task.

692
01:38:03,709 --> 01:38:07,042
Perhaps we should investigate
what has happened.

693
01:38:07,209 --> 01:38:10,917
His Majesty was impressed,
how far Kahlen had come.

694
01:38:11,084 --> 01:38:15,126
His Majesty knows nothing about,
who is kahlen you idiot.

695
01:38:15,292 --> 01:38:17,834
After all, he's cranky around the clock.

696
01:38:18,001 --> 01:38:23,834
He doesn't care who
there is on the heath, as long as there is someone.

697
01:38:25,376 --> 01:38:29,459
If we say yes to the landowners
proposal, we sentence Kahlen to death.

698
01:38:29,667 --> 01:38:33,751
Without a trial,
without hearing his side of the story.

699
01:38:33,917 --> 01:38:36,667
You still haven't got it.

700
01:38:36,834 --> 01:38:41,042
When the king asks,
then nothing has changed.

701
01:38:41,209 --> 01:38:44,667
The colony is still being built.
Everything is going according to plan.

702
01:38:44,834 --> 01:38:50,251
We cannot sentence a man to death,
that never existed.

703
01:39:06,376 --> 01:39:08,709
(a fly flutters)

704
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:17,626
(shot)

705
01:39:17,792 --> 01:39:20,542
(horse neigh and shout)

706
01:39:27,126 --> 01:39:33,376
You are staying illegally
on Frederik de Schinkel's land!

707
01:39:33,542 --> 01:39:39,001
You must leave the area immediately
and sign up for Hald Gods.

708
01:39:39,167 --> 01:39:43,876
- You have until tonight to pack.
- Preisler!

709
01:39:44,042 --> 01:39:48,126
Get out of here! The colony is
under the king's protection.

710
01:39:48,292 --> 01:39:53,209
Not anymore. The earth belongs now
Mr. de Schinkel and his partners.

711
01:39:53,376 --> 01:39:58,376
The deed is signed and sealed
of the King's Interest Chamber.

712
01:40:18,001 --> 01:40:21,501
In God's name, that's enough!

713
01:40:21,667 --> 01:40:26,334
- I must ask you to disappear.
- Get out of the way, Eklund. Go home.

714
01:40:26,501 --> 01:40:30,084
You have none
powers here, Preisler.

715
01:40:30,251 --> 01:40:33,376
You are hired by a private landowner.

716
01:40:33,542 --> 01:40:37,084
What will the authorities say to
that you are a murderer?

717
01:40:37,251 --> 01:40:39,084
Anton, don't.

718
01:40:39,251 --> 01:40:43,876
That you rode in with a bunch of criminals
and murdered innocent people.

719
01:40:44,042 --> 01:40:46,751
Shut up, Anton. Go home.

720
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:50,917
The interest rate chamber may not think so
on a bunch of German peasants, -

721
01:40:51,084 --> 01:40:55,417
- but I am a man of God.
And I guarantee…

722
01:41:05,709 --> 01:41:07,417
Stop!

723
01:41:27,459 --> 01:41:31,209
De Schinkel has taken over
Royal house. Make room.

724
01:41:31,376 --> 01:41:37,001
They have arrested Ludvig Kahlen.
De Schinkel has taken over Kongenshus.

725
01:41:54,917 --> 01:41:57,376
Shut up! Let me out!

726
01:42:02,126 --> 01:42:07,251
Don't go out to him, miss.
It will only make it worse for him.

727
01:42:17,959 --> 01:42:22,167
It's crazy that it's here,
we are finished, Ludvig.

728
01:42:22,334 --> 01:42:25,709
It is completely unnecessary.

729
01:42:25,876 --> 01:42:31,167
Say it's my land
that it has always been my land, -

730
01:42:31,334 --> 01:42:34,751
- then I'll let you live.

731
01:42:34,917 --> 01:42:37,042
I promise.

732
01:42:41,501 --> 01:42:44,001
It is the king's land.

733
01:43:04,834 --> 01:43:07,126
(Kahlen complains)

734
01:43:25,251 --> 01:43:29,292
Tell them they can begin
to boil the water.

735
01:43:48,209 --> 01:43:51,834
- High school.
- Have you been hired here again?

736
01:43:52,001 --> 01:43:56,376
The Lord has asked for a glass
liqueur out. Will you make it happen?

737
01:43:56,542 --> 01:43:59,042
What are you doing here?

738
01:44:04,876 --> 01:44:07,209
(Kahlen screams)

739
01:44:13,959 --> 01:44:16,834
Let it cool down a bit.

740
01:44:19,209 --> 01:44:23,417
Sir, Miss Edel wishes
to see you in your chamber.

741
01:44:24,417 --> 01:44:27,251
Now she wants to see me
on my chamber.

742
01:44:27,417 --> 01:44:30,292
No thanks. I will be here.

743
01:44:30,459 --> 01:44:35,959
The miss wants to negotiate
the conditions of an engagement.

744
01:44:51,334 --> 01:44:57,042
You marry me and I spare
Kahlen's life. Is that how it is?

745
01:44:57,209 --> 01:44:59,084
And.

746
01:45:00,376 --> 01:45:03,459
That is my only condition.

747
01:45:05,376 --> 01:45:11,001
You are such a deceitful goose,
and one cannot trust a word, -

748
01:45:11,167 --> 01:45:15,792
- but if you show me right now,
that you mean what you say, -

749
01:45:15,959 --> 01:45:22,001
- then I promise I'll let him out,
and then the court must decide his fate.

750
01:45:25,376 --> 01:45:27,959
Does it show you?

751
01:45:28,917 --> 01:45:32,334
Now hold it.
You know what I mean.

752
01:45:44,001 --> 01:45:46,334
Just there on the floor?

753
01:45:47,459 --> 01:45:50,084
Or should we take the bed?

754
01:45:50,292 --> 01:45:55,209
We can do whatever you want.
We can also do both.

755
01:46:02,667 --> 01:46:04,376
Oh...

756
01:46:08,126 --> 01:46:12,292
I guess I just got it
one glass of wine too much.

757
01:46:12,459 --> 01:46:14,792
(Frederik coughs)

758
01:46:27,251 --> 01:46:28,959
Tel...

759
01:46:42,792 --> 01:46:45,251
Ann Barbara...

760
01:46:45,417 --> 01:46:47,834
You shouldn't be here.

761
01:46:48,001 --> 01:46:51,126
Out with you! Guard!

762
01:46:57,876 --> 01:47:01,626
You will be hanged for this, you sow!

763
01:47:06,459 --> 01:47:09,251
No, don't...

764
01:47:14,209 --> 01:47:16,751
It is for Johannes.

765
01:47:18,751 --> 01:47:20,917
(there is a knock on the door)

766
01:47:29,376 --> 01:47:30,792
(cry)

767
01:48:02,626 --> 01:48:05,126
(bell chimes and shouts)

768
01:48:12,792 --> 01:48:17,209
- The Lord is dead.
- Ann Barbara has killed him.

769
01:49:11,709 --> 01:49:14,209
Sorry, it took some time.

770
01:49:14,376 --> 01:49:18,501
I had to explain to the Interest Chamber,
how it all came together.

771
01:49:26,917 --> 01:49:29,417
The Germans have left, Ludvig.

772
01:49:29,584 --> 01:49:33,876
Miss Edel has gone home
to his family in Norway.

773
01:49:35,626 --> 01:49:39,459
You can keep the Royal Palace.
But the gods must know, -

774
01:49:39,626 --> 01:49:44,001
- if they ever send bids
for new colonists.

775
01:49:47,501 --> 01:49:49,667
Ann Barbara?

776
01:49:52,167 --> 01:49:55,292
We don't see her again.

777
01:49:57,209 --> 01:50:00,626
She sits in Aalborg for life.

778
01:50:00,792 --> 01:50:05,001
No visits.
No chance of getting out.

779
01:50:30,167 --> 01:50:34,417
Have you changed the water?
Then go in and change the water!

780
01:50:57,167 --> 01:51:01,001
I need
a strong worker in the house.

781
01:51:01,167 --> 01:51:07,209
One, who is good with animals, and who has
learned to write numbers in a surveyor's book.

782
01:51:07,376 --> 01:51:11,459
You do not know,
where can i find one like that right?

783
01:51:32,667 --> 01:51:35,751
I shouldn't have sent you away.

784
01:51:35,917 --> 01:51:39,959
I promise,
that I will never disappoint you again.

785
01:51:40,959 --> 01:51:44,709
I promise,
that I will always take care of you.

786
01:52:00,417 --> 01:52:04,626
- When will she come back?
- She's not coming back.

787
01:52:04,792 --> 01:52:07,751
She is happy where she is now.

788
01:52:07,917 --> 01:52:11,709
I think she lives on the beach
in a small house by the sea, -

789
01:52:11,876 --> 01:52:14,459
- which she has always talked about.

790
01:52:14,626 --> 01:52:18,584
If God-bings are in Heaven,
and the Germans have gone away, -

791
01:52:18,751 --> 01:52:22,376
- then there's only you and me left,
bette far.

792
01:52:22,542 --> 01:52:25,709
But we can also do it ourselves, the two of us. Does not?

793
01:53:05,959 --> 01:53:09,334
41... 18.

794
01:53:09,501 --> 01:53:12,167
16...

795
01:53:12,334 --> 01:53:17,334
I don't think it will rain.
We can let the goats out.

796
01:53:19,542 --> 01:53:22,376
(there is a knock on the door)

797
01:53:27,042 --> 01:53:31,876
Hello. Do you need to have it repaired
the windows or replaced something?

798
01:53:32,042 --> 01:53:35,292
No. We don't need anything.

799
01:53:37,667 --> 01:53:40,459
What about knives that need to be sharpened?

800
01:53:40,626 --> 01:53:44,626
We need five new windows,
and then we have a box of knives, -

801
01:53:44,792 --> 01:53:49,167
- and the barn must be closed for winter,
and then the well needs new stones.

802
01:53:49,334 --> 01:53:52,709
- She's a quant dill, huh?
- Stop.

803
01:53:56,251 --> 01:54:00,917
- And you are a qvant bings.
- You are tater?

804
01:54:04,001 --> 01:54:06,084
Anmai Go.

805
01:54:17,001 --> 01:54:19,751
Yes, further down... yes.

806
01:54:19,917 --> 01:54:22,917
Yes, move your fingers. Yes.

807
01:54:36,667 --> 01:54:41,584
Ludvig von Kahlen, we hand you over
this official decree to the effect, -

808
01:54:41,751 --> 01:54:46,334
- that you as agreed with the Interest Chamber
receives the title of lieutenant baron -

809
01:54:46,501 --> 01:54:51,709
- with land use rights
and 20 years of tax exemption.

810
01:54:51,876 --> 01:54:55,917
Your appanage will take effect,
when the colony is completed.

811
01:54:56,084 --> 01:55:01,459
- Yes, it is 2000 Riksdaler annually.
- Colonies?

812
01:55:01,626 --> 01:55:06,001
Yes. We send bids
after 400 colonists this spring.

813
01:55:07,167 --> 01:55:09,834
They'll have enough to look after.

814
01:55:12,584 --> 01:55:17,126
May we say congratulations,
from Kahlen?

815
01:55:21,084 --> 01:55:23,792
It is a huge achievement.

816
01:55:25,709 --> 01:55:28,126
(door opens)

817
01:55:29,584 --> 01:55:34,167
Then I finally got them sent off.
I've never seen two grown men -

818
01:55:34,334 --> 01:55:38,334
- be so engrossed
of a potato plant. Snaps!

819
01:55:39,376 --> 01:55:44,209
- How are the hemorrhoids?
- I don't talk about them anymore.

820
01:55:44,376 --> 01:55:49,126
People don't understand anyway
the pain i'm going through.

821
01:56:12,334 --> 01:56:17,751
You have received another rejection
to have Ann Barbara's sentence shortened.

822
01:56:23,667 --> 01:56:26,876
Unfortunately, I have more bad news.

823
01:56:27,042 --> 01:56:32,959
The female prisoners from Aalborg must
transferred to Slaveriet in Copenhagen.

824
01:56:33,126 --> 01:56:35,626
Ann Barbara too.

825
01:56:38,126 --> 01:56:43,126
You know as well as I do
what slavery means.

826
01:56:43,292 --> 01:56:46,667
Those poor things don't live long.

827
01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:51,251
I'm sorry to have to
pass it on to you.

828
01:57:06,459 --> 01:57:10,126
Could you bring the bottle
