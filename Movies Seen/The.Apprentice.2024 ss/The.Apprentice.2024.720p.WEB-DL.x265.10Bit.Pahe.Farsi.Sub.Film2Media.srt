1
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,407
<i>And I want to say this
to the television audience</i>

2
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:42,085
<i>I've made my mistakes,</i>

3
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:44,957
<i>but in all of my years
of public life,</i>

4
00:00:45,306 --> 00:00:47,308
<i>I have never profited,</i>

5
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:49,571
<i>never profited from
public service.</i>

6
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:51,486
<i>I've earned every cent.</i>

7
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,966
<i>And in all of my years of
public life,</i>

8
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:56,795
<i>I have never obstructed
justice.</i>

9
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:59,494
<i>And I think too that I can say</i>

10
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:01,713
<i>that in my years of
public life,</i>

11
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:04,064
I welcome this kind of
examination

12
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:06,283
because people have got to know
whether or not

13
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:07,763
their president's a crook.

14
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:09,373
Well, I'm not a crook.

15
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:11,636
I've earned everything I've got.

16
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,725
"Anti, Anti, Anti" by
The Consumers

17
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:20,618
There's nothing like this place.

18
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,099
There's nothing like it.

19
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,645
You know, the Vanderbilts
and the Kennedys,

20
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,105
they all came here.

21
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:31,779
Do... do you see the old guy
over there

22
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:34,371
with the pretty young model?

23
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:35,590
That's Daniel K Ludwig,

24
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:36,852
the shipping magnate,

25
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:38,177
one of the only two billionaires

26
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,637
in the United States.

27
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,077
Then over here you got
Si Newhouse.

28
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:46,572
He owns half of all
the newspapers

29
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:48,211
and magazines in the country.

30
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:51,127
Anybody who is anybody
comes here to this place.

31
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:52,650
There's nothing like it.

32
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:55,087
Why are you so obsessed
with these people?

33
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,788
Well, I mean, I'm not obsessed
with these people,

34
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,659
I just, uh...

35
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:04,619
I'm curious, you know,
about people.

36
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:06,360
There's a skill to being
a billionaire.

37
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:07,534
It's a... it's a talent,

38
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,189
you have to be born with it.

39
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:11,408
You have to have a certain
gene, you know.

40
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:14,281
It's a pretty cool place.

41
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:15,238
Yeah, and they say
I'm the youngest

42
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:16,674
member ever admitted.

43
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:18,937
That must be a big thing.

44
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:20,678
It is, it's a very big thing.

45
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:24,769
I'm just gonna go powder
my nose.

46
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:26,554
Okay, sure.

47
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:00,805
Excuse me.

48
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,374
I'm Russell.

49
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:08,335
My friend wants to know if
you'd join us for dinner.

50
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:11,294
Uh, well, I'm actually leaving,
so, uh...

51
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:13,427
He's a long-time member.

52
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:15,143
He wants to congratulate you
on passing

53
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,473
the selection committee.

54
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,041
Well, that's totally,
uh, untrue.

55
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:21,043
Sonny Liston, was, uh,
well, fine,

56
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:23,001
he was arrested, uh,
nineteen times.

57
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:24,960
But, uh, the guy was a champion

58
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:27,223
so, you can't,
uh, blame him for it.

59
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:28,921
- Well, hello there.
- How's it going?

60
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,966
- How are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

61
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,055
Have a seat.

62
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:35,362
We're not gonna bite.

63
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:39,844
There you go.

64
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,039
What's your name, handsome?

65
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:42,369
I'm Donald Trump.

66
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,458
Donald Trump, nice to meet you.
Roy Cohn.

67
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:46,808
The Roy Cohn, from all
the papers and everything?

68
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:49,245
That's right, uh, the Roy Cohn
from all the papers,

69
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:50,855
that's right.
- Yeah, you're brutal.

70
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,466
I'm brutal, that's right.

71
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,946
He's the guy who put the
Rosenbergs in the chair.

72
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,520
The Rosenbergs in
the fucking chair!

73
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,385
On that count, uh,
guilty as charged.

74
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:01,388
But, uh, whatever I do,
I do it for America.

75
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,758
- Well, uh...
- What are you drinking?

76
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:07,176
Um, I'll just have some
ice water.

77
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,873
- Ice water?
- Living on the edge, eh?

78
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:10,440
Oh, yeah.

79
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:14,270
Meet my pals, uh,
this is, uh, Carmine Galante.

80
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,577
- Nice to meet you.
- And, uh, this, uh,

81
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:19,493
voluptuous gentleman over here
with the diabetes is,

82
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,712
uh, Tony Salerno.

83
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:23,429
Can I call you Fat Tony?
Are you gonna get...?

84
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:24,822
Call me whatever the fuck
you want, Roy.

85
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:26,282
- Good.
- You're my attorney.

86
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:28,096
- Hello.
- Uh, you don't call him Fat Tony

87
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:30,175
because, uh, you might end up,
uh, in the East River

88
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,461
or something like that.
- Hello.

89
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:35,596
Uh, everybody else is not
worth naming.

90
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:39,339
I, uh, I love getting to know
people,

91
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:40,753
it's important for my business,

92
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:42,302
so, it's really nice to meet
you all.

93
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:44,431
Mr Salerno, it's really nice to
meet you.

94
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:48,130
What is your business, Donald?

95
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:49,871
Real estate. I'm, uh,

96
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:51,742
Vice President of
The Trump Organization.

97
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,135
Oh, you're Fred Trump's kid?

98
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:54,092
That's right.

99
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:55,703
He's Fred Trump's kid.

100
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:59,141
It sounds like, uh, your father
is a little tangled up.

101
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:01,230
It looks like he could use
a good lawyer.

102
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:04,189
But tell us about it.

103
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,671
Right now, the government
and the NAACP are suing us.

104
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:09,765
Uh, they're saying our
apartments are segregated.

105
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,214
This is America, you can rent to

106
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:12,937
whoever the hell
you goddamn want.

107
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:14,828
But our lawyer wants us to pay
a huge fine to settle

108
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:16,332
and we can't,
it's gonna bankrupt us

109
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:17,744
and ruin the company, so...
- You tell the feds

110
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:18,552
to fuck 'emselves.

111
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:19,726
Damn straight!

112
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:20,902
File a lawsuit.

113
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,120
Always file a lawsuit,

114
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:23,294
fight 'em in court.

115
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,166
Uh, make 'em prove

116
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,385
you're discriminating.

117
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:27,691
Well, I guess, uh...

118
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:31,391
might have to get us, uh,
a new lawyer.

119
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:32,740
Of course, it, uh, helps if

120
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:34,176
Nixon and the Attorney General

121
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,569
are your pals.

122
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:39,181
Well, are you available?
I mean...

123
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:40,898
Uh, what are you, some kind of
a faggot?

124

Yeah.

144
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:49,904
The rent.

145
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,428
You got it? Is that all?

146
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:53,734
I think so.

147
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:54,909
You think so?

148
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:58,478
Yeah. Yeah.

149
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,092
And if I count it
and it's not there,

150
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:01,655
what am I supposed to do?

151
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,546
It's just the one month.
I just hurt my back,

152
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,810
I just hurt myself, that's all,

153
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,082
and I had to go to hospital.

154
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,399
You know what that's like.

155
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:08,594
Let's hope you're alive
next month.

156
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:10,185
Get the rent. Get the rent.

157
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,927
Or if not, this is it.

158
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:15,538
Mrs Thompson.

159
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:17,453
You bloodsuckers.

160
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:22,022
Half?

161
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:33,904
You're not real.

162
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,297
I am very, very real.

163
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:36,733
You're in my head!

164
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:38,343
Mr Granger, please.

165
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,606
Come on.

166
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,826
Fuck you!

167
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:47,309
Fuck you!

168
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,050
Fucker!

169
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:08,286
These NAACP faggots
call me racist.

170
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,940
Frederick, please, enough.

171
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:11,812
Mary, they call me a racist.

172
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:13,248
How can I be racist

173
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:15,816
when I have a black driver,
Mary?

174
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,730
No language.

175
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:17,687
How can that be?

176
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:18,861
Pleasant conversation.

177
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:20,037
I'm not racist.

178
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:21,430
No politics.

179
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,346
You think that's funny, Freddy?

180
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Would you get your elbow

181
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:26,608
off of the table, please?

182
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:27,654
Yes, Sir.

183
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:32,746
Dad, the truth is
we're being sued,

184
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,399
we need the lawsuit behind us,

185
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,934
and I need to bid on
the Commodore,

186
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:37,422
and I think with Roy,
we have a chance.

187
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:40,231
Not this crap about your hotel, please.

188
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:43,583
Roy Cohn is not the guy
that's gonna help us, okay?

189
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:44,932
He's a crook.

190
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,455
He's been indicted three times.

191
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,283
He's never been convicted,
by the way.

192
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:50,000
The man's a genius.
He ran McCarthy's show

193
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:51,416
when he was basically
a teenager,

194
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,003
and he's pals with Nixon
himself. He's vicious.

195
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,526
You don't think I've tried
pulling strings

196
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,986
with Beame and Rockefeller?

197
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,509
They're no help.

198
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,250
The government wants to kill us.

199
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:01,185
Just, just take the meeting,
that's all I'm saying.

200
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,254
Just, just meet with him to
discuss, that's all.

201
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:06,344
I think maybe Donnie's right.

202
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:09,217
Why not meet with Cohn,

203
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:11,088
get a second opinion?

204
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:14,004
Says the airline pilot.

205
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:17,007
My first-born son

206
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,141
is a goddamn bus driver
with wings.

207
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:21,708
Frederick, please.

208
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:23,468
Do you know what kind of an
embarrassment

209
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:24,580
that is for us?

210
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:25,973
Whenever... whenever I'm asked

211
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:27,757
about my family,

212
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:29,933
I don't mention you, Freddy.

213
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:32,283
That's how embarrassed I am
about you.

214
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:33,720
Frederick, enough.

215
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:38,028
Do you like the music?

216
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:39,202
I do.

217
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:40,596
Oh, hey, how are you?

218
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,139
- Good, how are you?
- Good to see you.

219
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:43,686
Oh, my God, you look beautiful.

220
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,601
- So do you.
- Why didn't you call me?

221
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:48,169
- I'm busy.
- Oh, she's busy.

222
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,519
Oh, my God.

223
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:53,304
Oh, my God, the stories I can
tell you about her.

224
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:55,108
You really know your way
around here, huh?

225
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:56,699
Well, come here often enough,

226
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:58,266
you get to know a few people.

227
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,616
Oh, I can see that.

228
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,070
Maybe loosen up a little,
Donnie,

229
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:04,489
you look like a security guard.

230
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,014
My God, those summers
were the worst.

231
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:09,016
I mean, I would spend
the whole time

232
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,018
counting the planes taking off
from Idlewild.

233
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:13,020
I was like that the whole time.

234
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:16,588
He used to make me pick
the nails off the floor

235
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,808
to save money.
- He still does that, Freddy.

236
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:20,941
Even now.

237
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,638
He would say to me,
"You keep an eye,

238
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:24,616
anybody who takes too long
on their smoke break,

239
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
you tell me about it."

240
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:27,121
And he would give me a quarter

241
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:29,427
for every...
every guy that I tattled on.

242
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,474
It was me against them.

243
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:37,871
Well, you probably got rich, huh?

244
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:39,786
Probably got rich those summers.

245
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,179
I want you to be happy.

246
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:44,224
Let me get another drink.

247
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:45,268
No, no, come on, come on.

248
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,357
We're alright, thank you,

249
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:47,595
thank you very much.
- Okay,

250
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:48,969
I don't need my little brother.

251
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:50,511
You think I don't have money?
I got money.

252
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:52,035
I know you do,
but it's my treat, okay?

253
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,148
Take your hat.
You're gonna need this.

254
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:16,126
Vic, I'm thinking a three-storey
atrium, alright?

255
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,911
And this whole side
all the way down,

256
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:19,739
I want it cladded in mirrored
glass, okay?

257
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:21,697
So, when you're across
42nd Street

258
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:23,525
or you're coming up
the Park Avenue ramp

259
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,416
and you look up, you're gonna
see the Chrysler Building,

260
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,267
the Grand Central Station,

261
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:27,572
all the landmarks

262
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,226
reflected in that glass.

263
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,551
It's gonna change the whole
ambience

264
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:31,575
of the neighbourhood.

265
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:32,815
It's gonna be a beautiful thing.

266
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:33,839
What do you think?

267
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:35,362
Yeah.

268
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:36,407
We're done.

269
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:38,453
We're done? Vic?

270
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,368
What, what, what are you saying?

271
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:41,935
If you were serious,
I'd be talking

272
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:43,414
to your father, not you.

273
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:45,503
Who the hell wants to build
a luxury hotel

274
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:46,677
on 42nd Street?

275
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:47,809
I do, okay?

276
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:49,137
I will eat, breathe, and sleep,

277
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,161
and shit this job
until it's done.

278
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:54,121
This is 1,600 rooms right
next to Grand Central.

279
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:56,015
Hey, how you doing?
You wanna have some fun?

280
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,753
This is my wife here,
you wanna fuck my wife?

281
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,276
- Uh, no, I'm fine, thank you.
- Her tight ass pussy's

282
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,431
all yours, 40 bucks.

283
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:01,605
I'm alright, thank you.

284
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:02,956
You saying my wife ain't hot?

285
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,570
Hey, guy, guy, come on.
No loitering.

286
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,420
New York is the greatest city
in the world,

287
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:08,024
and when it comes back,
and it will big time,

288
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:09,768
there's gonna be one hell of
a lot of money.

289
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:12,182
People are gonna get rich,
Vic, like you wouldn't believe.

290
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,534
Come on, Vic, think outside
the box, alright?

291
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,363
I can't deal with you until you
get the feds off your back.

292
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,322
You got that?

293
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:25,413
Vic.

294
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:26,587
It's gonna be great!

295
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:51,526
David, how are you?

296
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:56,879
How you doing?

297
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,272
How you doing?

298
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,467
Donald Trump from
the other night, remember?

299
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:01,275
Right, of course.

300
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,103
Mr Cohn, great suit.

301
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,863
Uh, Donald Trump,
I met you the other night.

302
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,497
Uh, Russ, could you
get my table, please?

303
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:07,779
Uh, listen, about the lawsuit,

304
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:09,196
I wanted to talk to you about...

305
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,826
uh, you know,
from before, with my father.

306
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,808
Look, uh, I'm here to have fun,
okay, kid?

307
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,375
Don't ruin my night.

308
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:16,072
Now, I gotta take a piss.

309
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,693
Mr Cohn, Sir,
you have to represent us.

310
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,782
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

311
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:33,148
Well, I'm sorry to follow you to
the bathroom,

312
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:35,657
but you, you, you, you have to
represent us.

313
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:37,877
The DOJ is trying to ruin
our lives.

314
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,891
It's, it's, it's a disgrace,
it's an injustice.

315
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,049
I'm trying to take a leak.

316
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:41,968
They're gonna force us to rent

317
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:43,404
to welfare cases and,

318
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:44,685
and they're gonna ruin
the buildings.

319
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:45,869
Please, I'm begging you, Sir.

320
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,451
I'm, I'm standing in
a bathroom here

321
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,323
with, with, with this guy,

322
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:52,369
and I'm... and I'm begging you
from the heart

323
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:54,676
to just please, as the only guy,

324
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,721
the only guy that's got the guts
and the balls

325
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,507
to take on these bullies,
to consider this case.

326
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:09,560
Well, uh...

327
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,129
I never liked bullies.

328
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:18,091
The liberals hate capitalism
and, uh, strength

329
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:20,441
and everything that people like
us stand for,

330
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:22,791
truth, justice,
and the American way.

331
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,706
Okay, what they wanna do is

332
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,578
they wanna take money from,
uh, you and me

333
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:31,408
and, uh, spread it around to,
uh, deadbeats on welfare.

334
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:32,844
- Uh...
- I'm fine, thank you.

335
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,431
They're worse than Nazis,
believe me.

336
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:35,673
I, I, I don't do that.

337
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:37,260
Oh. Well, uh, I got news
for you, kid,

338
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:39,025
you do if you want me to listen.

339
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,595
Cin-cin.

340
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:48,556
Drink up, Donnie Boy.

341
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:58,044
So, uh, I don't have all night.

342
00:15:58,218 --> 00:15:59,741
Okay, so...

343
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:01,917
the suit says we violated
the Fair Housing Act.

344
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:03,291
Don't tell me what the law is,

345
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,094
uh, tell me who the judge is.

346
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,574
Edward Neaher.

347
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:08,921
That's bad, he's a...
he's a boy scout.

348
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:10,360
That's bad?

349
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:12,101
It's not good.

350
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:13,992
You know what, Donald,
this whole civil rights deal,

351
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:16,279
it stinks,
the way herring stinks.

352
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:19,369
You tell me, how many,
uh, stuffed shirt leftists

353
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:21,589
want their little Johnnies
and Janes in school

354
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:23,286
with little negroes?

355
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:25,853
Zero.

356
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:29,466
Right? And they say I'm, uh,
Lucifer incarnate.

357
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,990
At least I'm honest,
right, babe?

358
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:32,164
It's true.

359
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,208
Well, the other night,

360
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:34,296
you were talking about...

361
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:35,341
Come on, drink up.

362
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,083
I mean, uh, I, I was, uh...

363
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:39,911
you were talking about the,
um, suing the government.

364
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,653
I mean, were you serious
about that, or...?

365
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:44,627
I'm serious as a heart attack.

366
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,179
Okay, to you.

367
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:47,658
Thank you.

368
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:49,051
To Donald.

"Rock Your Baby" by George McRae

370
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:54,361
I'm... I'm telling you, Roy,
I'm gonna...

371
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,189
I'm gonna take New York.

372
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:59,366
I'm gonna take New York
and bring it back.

373
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,021
I'm gonna do it. You watch.

374
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:04,197
You watch. I'm gonna take
that Commodore,

375
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:06,938
I'm gonna make it the best
fucking hotel in the city.

376
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:08,810
I'll take the Penn Central,

377
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:11,073
I'll take the Yards,
the Hudson Yards.

378
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,032
I've got all these ideas,
and that's...

379
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:14,598
that's the problem
with my father.

380
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:15,880
You know what, Donald?
You are...

381
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:16,905
People...

382
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,319
You're gorgeous, you know that?

383
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:19,995
You're a real thoroughbred.

384
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:23,346
- Roy...
- You're one of a kind, okay?

385
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,522
I'm telling you,
you're one of a kind.

386
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:27,283
- I think, uh...
- You know, you're not

387
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:28,830
too bad yourself.

388
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:30,924
Well, uh, I mean, I'm not much
to look at, but...

389
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:32,877
You're pretty good, you know,
you're good.

390
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,706
I bet you fuck a lot,
don't you, Donald?

391
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:41,625
You look like somebody who,
uh, fucks a lot.

392
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,411
I think you're right.

I feel sorry for him.

399
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:09,958
Yeah, I can see that.

400
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,612
Go see if he's okay.

I'm not, uh, Bunny Lindenbaum

402
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:18,053
- Right.
- Powerful people, they hire me

You're the client,
but you work for me.

when I say it, 100 percent.

409
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:32,459
Absolutely, totally.

410
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:34,156
Totally, whatever you say.

411
00:18:34,939 --> 00:18:37,116
And, uh, if you throw up on my
scarlet piping,

412
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,161
uh, you're a dead duck.

<i>Come on in, Donald.</i>

419
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:23,988
No. No, I'm telling you,
it was not in his briefcase,

420
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,208
it wasn't alleged to be
in his briefcase.

421
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,993
I was in court, I saw
the complaint, and you didn't.

422
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:30,865
Did you?

423
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:32,606
Okay.

424
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,020
No, you're not listening to me.

425
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:35,129
No.

426
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,740
Just get the goddamn injunction

427
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:38,742
and, uh, shut up already.

428
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,181
Uh, where were we?

429
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:44,195
Murdoch prepping his bid for
the New York Post.

430
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:46,141
Needs due diligence on
owner, Dolly Schiff.

431
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:48,012
Due diligence?
Uh, what's to know?

432
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,797
She's a communist cunt.

433
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,365
Tell Rupert that she's a robber

Thank you, Rosario.

435
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,690

Phelps divorce.

437
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:58,588
When is that?
- A week Monday.

438
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:01,025
Because I wanna be armed to
the goddamn teeth

439
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,245
when I put her yutz of
a husband on the stand.

440
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:05,291
Morning, sweetheart.

441
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:06,745
We also have
to deal with

442
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:08,137
the latest subpoena
from the IRS.

443
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:09,947
Those geniuses at the IRS.

444
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:11,795
I mean, it's a total vendetta.
- Fucking IRS.

445
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,474
Charlie, come here, you schmuck.

446
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,974
- Who let the mutt in here?
- That's Charlie Brown.

447
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,518
Give him a... give him a kiss,
Charlie.

448
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:20,044
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

449
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:22,917
Nice. Be careful, uh, he might
try and blow you.

450
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:25,224
91.

451
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:27,574
92.

452
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,403
Uh, well, that's the lawsuit,

453
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:32,361
in case you wanna take a look.
- 94.

454
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:33,815
All about the Fair Housing
Act...

455
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:35,210
I'm... I'm doing my sit-ups,
Donald,

456
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,234
hang on.

457
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:37,453
95.

458
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:40,239
96.

459
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:43,633
Don't touch them, please.

460
00:20:43,938 --> 00:20:46,027
Oh, I'm sorry.
- 98...

461
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:49,551
- 199...
- Wow.

462
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:50,945
Got quite a collection, Roy.

463
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:53,164
200.

464
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:55,142
President Nixon,
that's pretty incredible.

465
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,274
Nixon? Yeah, he's a good friend.

466
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,604
He's a close personal friend.

467
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:59,103
Did you wanna read the...
uh, lawsuit?

468
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:00,235
I don't need to read
the lawsuit.

469
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,782
I told you, it stinks.

470
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,264
Smells like, uh, my armpit
smells right now.

471
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:07,091
Yeah. I mean, in reality,
I mean,

472
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,659
I mean, we do rent
to black people.

473
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:11,226
- You do?
- Yeah, 10 percent

474
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,489
of our buildings go to black
people.

475
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:15,354
It's just... it's just they have
to make

476
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,188
four times the amount of
the rent

477
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:18,581
in... in terms of the income

478
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,017
to, to be approved.

479
00:21:20,191 --> 00:21:21,517
Sounds to me like they're
discriminating

480
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,325
against you.
- That's right, they are.

481
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:26,459
And, uh, it should be called
the Unfair Housing Act.

482
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:29,505
It's your building, uh, you can
do whatever the hell you want.

483
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,942
Sure sounds nice when you
say it, Roy, you know.

484
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:33,116
Where's my cheque?

485
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:34,902
Oh, I got it right here.

486
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:40,690
Okay, uh, we're in business.

487
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:42,997
You got a great name. Trump.

488
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:46,130
Well, may end up on that wall
one day.

489
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:48,761
- You could be on that wall.
- It'd be nice.

490
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,385
Yeah, you could be on
that wall, why not?

491
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,358
How do you mix with all those
people?

492
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:54,574
Everybody wants to suck
a winner's cock

493
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:56,388
is what it comes down to.

494
00:21:56,576 --> 00:21:59,796
I've been indicted three times,
I won 36-0.

495
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,842
Government 0, Roy Cohn 36.

496
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:03,713
- I'm a winner.
- How do you win?

497
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:05,280
You wanna know how to win?

498
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:07,587
I'm gonna let you in on
a little secret.

499
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:09,110
There's rules.

500
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:11,460
Roy Cohn's three rules of
winning.

501
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,812
The first rule is the simplest,

502
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:17,945
attack, attack, attack.

503
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:22,645
Civil Rights, Katz.

504
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,971
<i>I hope the putz you're
schtupping's got real money,</i>

505
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:26,997
<i>because, uh, after
I get you fired,</i>

506
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:28,434
<i>you're sure gonna need it.</i>

507
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,913
Excuse me?

508
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:32,220
Unless you drop
your baseless litigation,

509
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:35,919
I am countersuing the Justice
Department for $100 million,

510
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:38,376
<i>and you are gonna rue the day
that you ever filed this suit.</i>

511
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Who is this?

512
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:40,596
It's Roy Cohn, calling on behalf

513
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,578
of my client, Donald J. Trump.

514
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:49,890
Always let it ring twice.

515
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:56,940
To whom do I owe the pleasure?

516
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:58,812
<i>Mr Cohn, this is J. Stanley
Pottinger,</i>

517
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:00,379

Wow, I'm sure your mother's
very proud.

520
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:06,820
<i>How dare you threaten one of
my attorneys?</i>

521
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:08,450
<i>I should have you disbarred
for speaking to her that way.</i>

522
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:10,606
Stan, Stan, bubala,
why don't you calm down?

523
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,802
That never happened.
<i>- Barbara Katz has worked for me</i>

524
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:14,523
<i>for 20 years.
You threatened her.</i>

525
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:16,090
<i>And now she...</i>
- Sounds like

526
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:18,024
maybe she's hormonal,
or something like that.

527
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:19,539
<i>What did you say?</i>

528
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:22,052
Rule two, admit nothing.

529
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:23,924
Deny everything.

530
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,099
Objection.

531
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:26,433
Uh, the Civil Rights Division

532
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:28,189
did not file a lawsuit.

533
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:32,149
Frankly, it compiled a, uh,
48-page, uh, press release,

534
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:33,673
as far as I can tell.

535
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,023
Now, the government has
failed to spell out

536
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:39,069
one single fact concerning
alleged

537
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:42,421
discriminatory practices
against blacks by the Trumps.

538
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:44,988
Uh, I motion to have this case
dismissed

539
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:47,077
on summary judgement.
- Overruled.

540
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:50,777
Councillor, continue.

541
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,082
Thank you, Your Honour.

542
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:53,606
Agent Green, what led you

543
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,303
to believe that you were denied

544
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:58,001
a lease at Trump Properties
based on your race?

545
00:23:58,175 --> 00:23:59,935
Well, not only did
the newspaper advertise...

546
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:02,353
That's Walter, DOJ,
he runs the show.

547
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,114
I saw three
Caucasian couples

548
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:05,487
approved before me.

549
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:07,271
- Objection, speculation.
- Mr Cohn...

550
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,162
How can you say for sure they
were Caucasian?

551
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:11,101
Mr Cohn, please allow
Agent Green

552
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:12,625
to answer the question.

553
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,429
I've seen Puerto Ricans
whiter than my tush

554
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,498
after a long winter.

555
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:18,805
Your Honour...

556
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:22,330
- Mr Cohn.
- Marvin, how are you?

557
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:23,786
Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

558
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:24,830
How do you feel about your
chances?

559
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,029
Uh, the government's case

560
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:27,727
is phoney as a
three-dollar bill.

561
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:30,033
Uh, let's just say we're in
a very strong position.

562
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:32,688
Mr Trump, do you think you
can beat the US government?

563
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:33,926
I feel very good about this.

564
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,014
One more question, Mr Trump.

565
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:36,387
Mr Trump, one more question.

566
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:38,738
We're really gonna win,
aren't we?

567
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,436
Are you out of your mind?
Of course not.

568
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:44,613
- What?
- Donald, uh,

569
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,310
your case is a total dog.

570
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,095
But, but you said they had
no evidence.

571
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:50,837
Your leasing agents marked
black applications with a C.

572
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:53,753
That C didn't stand for cotton
candy now, did it?

573
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,887
Raul, I'm late for a little, uh, rendezvous.

574
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,061
Step on it.

575
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:01,761
Roy, you said we'd win
hands-down.

576
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:05,678
Rule three, this is the most
important rule of all, okay?

577
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:06,853
No matter what happens...

578
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:08,307
Does he have to drive this fast?

579
00:25:08,463 --> 00:25:09,527
...no matter what they say
about you,

580
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,031
no matter how beaten you are,

581
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:13,599
you claim victory and never
admit defeat.

582
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:16,166
Never admit defeat, Donald.

583
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,777
You want to win,
that's how you win.

584
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:26,960
Walter, my good friend,
what a nice surprise.

585
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:29,832
It's, uh, nice to see you too,
Roy.

586
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:33,619
Your bulldog, Katz, uh,
she's being tough on us.

587
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:35,446
Barbara is one of our best.

588
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:38,972
You know, uh,
this case isn't fair.

589
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,713
You and I both know that.

590
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:41,670
Well, you know what, Roy,

591
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:43,193
justice is complicated.

592
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,108
- Justice is complicated?
- Yeah.

593
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,981
You know what could get
complicated, Walter?

594
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,854
Is a, uh, a married man

595
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:54,596
committing certain indiscretions

596
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:57,599
with the, uh, cabana boys in
Cancun.

597
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:10,307
The last I checked,

598
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,483
homosexuals were barred from

599
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,311
federal civil service.

600
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:21,710
What do you want, Roy?

601
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:23,251
Why don't you do the right thing

602
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:25,496
and make this case go away?

603
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:27,237
You know I can't do that.

604
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,198
Imagine your wife

605
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:33,766
reading in the Post that, uh...

606
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,898
- Roy...
- ...her husband's a fairy.

607
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:38,553
Is that what you want?

608
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,041
Say hello to Mira and the kids.

609
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:54,545
- What? I'm not gonna bite.
- That was tremendous.

610
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:55,831
Why don't you sit down?

611
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,924
You're all the way over
in Alaska. Come here.

612
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:03,099
Well...

613
00:27:04,797 --> 00:27:05,841
What?

614
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:07,756
I don't know, Roy. I mean, I...

615
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,891
I'm pretty sure what
I just saw was, uh...

616
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:17,723
I, I, I don't even know what...
what to think of that.

617
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:18,941
I mean, I'm...

618
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,552
I'm speechless.

619
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:25,600
Here's the thing, Donald, uh,

620
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,429
you played, uh, you played
sports, right?

621
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:31,954
So, they probably taught you,
uh,

622
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,565
play the ball, not the man.

623
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:37,133
But, uh, you see, in reality,

624
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:38,831
it's the total opposite.

625
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:41,660
You play the man, not the ball.

626
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:45,576
Okay? To get what you want,
forget the ball.

627
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:47,143
You get the man.

628
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,059
This is a nation of men,
not laws.

629
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,891
And, uh, you don't care?

630
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:57,501
It's an advantage...

631
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:01,636
to, uh, not care what people
think of you.

632
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:04,117
Fuck what people think of you.

633
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:07,033
There is no right and wrong.

634
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:09,513
There is no, uh, morality.

635
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:13,735
There is no truth
with a capital "T".

636
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:16,259
It's a construct.

637
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:18,566
It's a fiction. It's man-made.

638
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:21,177
None of it matters except
winning.

639
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:22,743
That's it.

640
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,495
<i>To leave office before my term
is completed is abhorrent</i>

641
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:37,063
<i>to every instinct in my body.</i>

642
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:40,066
<i>But as president,
I must put the interests</i>

643
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,763
<i>of America first.</i>

644
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:43,678
<i>I shall resign the presidency</i>

645
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:45,375
<i>effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

646
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:47,269
<i>It is the first priority</i>

647
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:48,727
<i>of my presidency</i>

648
00:28:48,901 --> 00:28:51,077
<i>to sustain and strengthen</i>

649
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:54,515
<i>the mutual trust and respect...</i>

650
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,344
<i>which must exist...</i>
- Hello?

651
00:28:57,518 --> 00:28:58,911
<i>Never answer your own phone,</i>

652
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:02,044
uh, like some loser.
Get a secretary.

653
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:04,003
- How's it going?
<i>- Listen, the judge, uh,</i>

654
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:05,744
<i>called with news about
the suit.</i>

655
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:08,007
Well, what did they say?

656
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:09,201
Well, the government folded

657
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:10,357
like a cheap tent.

658
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:12,489
<i>Uh, we settled with no fine,</i>

659
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:14,491
<i>no admission of discrimination.</i>

660
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:16,145
<i>Uh, so you won big, kiddo.</i>

661
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,669
Roy, that's...
<i>that's incredible. I... I...</i>

662
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:20,996
Now get ready, I'm gonna pick
you up in about an hour, okay?

663
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,214
<i>You're... you're a genius.</i>

664
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,110
Uh...

665
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:31,552
Listen, uh, Judy, about
a hundred reporters

666
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:33,526
were crawling up my ass
to get this interview,

667
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:35,077
and I gave you the exclusive.

668
00:29:35,904 --> 00:29:37,036
There you go.

669
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:40,474
Uh, yes, hello, Judy, uh, this
is Donald Trump.

670
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:43,042
Very excited... very excited
to talk to you.

671
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:44,933
Be excited,
don't say you're excited.

672
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:46,282
<i>So, Donald, now that the
lawsuit is behind you,</i>

673
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:47,370
<i>what do you want to do next?</i>

674
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:48,569
Uh, well...

675
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,919
I intend to acquire
the Commodore,

676
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:53,400
and, uh, I'm planning on making
it the, the best

677
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:55,881
uh, and the finest building
in... in the city,

678
00:29:56,055 --> 00:29:57,926
maybe... maybe the country.

679
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,885
In the world, Judy,
in the world.

680
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,558
It's gonna be the finest
building in the world.

681
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:03,323
It's gonna be a spectacular
hotel.

682
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:05,151
Absolutely spectacular.

683
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:06,369
First class.

684
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:07,544
And, uh...

685
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:09,459
<i>That sounds very ambitious.</i>

686
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,611
<i>Where do you get the drive?
You're still so young, Donald.</i>

687
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:13,768
I've got, I've got flair
and I'm smart, so I...

688
00:30:13,942 --> 00:30:15,552
I think that's gonna
make me successful.

689
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:18,164
- Slow down, slow down...
- But I also wanna stay humble.

690
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:19,643
I'm...

691
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:22,385
Uh, sorry Judy, listen let's,
uh, do rest in person,

692
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,605
and, uh, bring a photographer, okay?

693
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:27,477
Sorry, Roy.

694
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:29,194
- Uh, no, I mean, listen...
- You caught me off guard.

695
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:30,898
It's you're life.
Uh, you got a ways to go,

696
00:30:31,003 --> 00:30:32,874
but, uh, you're learning.

697
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:35,050
You know, I should've talked
to Dad,

698
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:36,617
before announcing
the Commodore.

699
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:38,943
He'll be convinced when he
reads about it

700
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,273
in the Times, okay?

701
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:41,859
- Well...
- You create your own reality.

702
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:42,883
It's not that easy.

703
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:44,581
Truth is a malleable thing.

704
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:46,385
- But he's...
- These are too tight, I think.

705
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:47,802
Alright, well... I'm sorry.

706
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:50,065
You have kind of a big ass,
you know that?

707
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,327
You gotta work on that.

708
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:53,329
We... we try something else.

709
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,897
Look, my dad is tough, Roy.

710
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:57,527
He's very tough.
- Well, that's why you gotta

711
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:59,311
spread the news,
like it's already happening.

712
00:30:59,335 --> 00:31:01,255
It's just, you can't push him
around very easily.

713
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:04,210
Fine, okay, fine, then, uh,
let him push you around.

714
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:05,384
Is that what you want?

715
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,472
No, I don't.

716
00:31:06,603 --> 00:31:07,648
Look.

717
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:10,956
Very, very fine fabric. Brioni.

718
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,522
What is that, merino wool?

719
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:14,655
Looks expensive.

720
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:15,656
How much is this?

721
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,614
- $1,100.
- Okay, that's...

722
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:20,226
Okay, we'll take it,
and a matching shirt and tie.

723
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,943
- I... I can't pay for this.
- Forget it, okay?

724
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,577
Forget it. Listen, here.

725
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:26,362
I don't need your money.

726
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,320
You'll pay me back, uh,
with your friendship, okay?

727
00:31:29,452 --> 00:31:30,845
Quid pro quo. Uh...

728
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,108
you be a friend to me,
I'll be a friend to you.

729
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:36,677
Okay? That's, uh,
that's... that's the pact, okay?

730
00:31:37,373 --> 00:31:38,853
If you look like
a million bucks,

731
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:40,550
I look like a million bucks.

732
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:44,784
Is this a guy, uh, is this a guy
from Flushing,

733
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,600
or is this a guy from
5th Avenue?

734
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:48,273
You know what I'm saying?
- No, 5th Avenue.

735
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:49,448
- That's right.
- 5th Avenue's where we wanna be.

736
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:50,472
- That's right.
- Exactly.

737
00:32:08,883 --> 00:32:11,103
We're over 20 minutes,
can't we at least...

738
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:13,081
I've already explained,
this is a members-only club.

739
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:14,212
Only members are allowed inside.

740
00:32:14,236 --> 00:32:15,455
They can become members.

741
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:16,989
They can file the papers right
now.

742
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,216
I've asked you once to leave.

743
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,676
I want to speak to your boss.

744
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:22,181
- I am the boss. The answer's no.
- You're not the boss.

745
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:23,115
- I am the boss.
- I want to speak

746
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:24,464
with the real boss.

747
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:26,118
- I'm sorry you're upset.
- Excuse me.

748
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:29,251
Um, what's the issue?

749
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:31,785
I'm sorry, Mr Trump, I was just
trying to get them to leave.

750
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,256
Well, actually, they're on
the list.

751
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:36,041
We don't need your help.

752
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:38,043
And what list would that be?

753
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:41,002
The, uh, Roy Cohn list.

754
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,484
My apologies, Mr Trump.

755
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:47,530
Why don't you take
your coat off?

756
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:51,882
Thank you very much.

757
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:54,407
Hi ladies,
let me get those coats for you.

758
00:32:57,932 --> 00:32:59,194
I'm Donald Trump.

759
00:32:59,455 --> 00:33:01,414
You're such a...
what is the word?

760
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:03,329
- Gentleman.
- Stereotype.

761
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:05,548
A man who thinks women
need his help.

762
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:08,247
Well, you, uh, you were totally
failing without me,

763
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:10,640
so, I guess you needed my
help a little bit.

764
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:13,469
What's the catch, gentleman?

765
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:16,907
No catch.

766
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:18,257
Enjoy your night.

767
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:23,349
Thank you.

768
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:33,272
Ladies, may I get you anything
else tonight?

769
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,709
- I'm good, thank you.
- I'm good too.

770
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,667
The cheque, please.

771
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:39,365
Mr Trump took care of it.

772
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:40,539
Oh.

773
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:42,890
Well, then.

774
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,588
Mr Trump has a crush on
somebody.

775
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:47,002
Thank you. Alright.

776
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,348
Shall we get out
of here?

777
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:50,202
Yes.

778
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:52,204
"Yes Sir, I Can Boogie"
by Baccara

779
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,135
- Excuse me?
- Hello?

780
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,441
Hey, come on, come on.

781
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,269
Excuse me?

782
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:16,619
He... he's not even...
he looked at me.

783
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:21,494
Excuse me?

784
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,429
- Do you need a ride?
- We don't need a ride.

785
00:34:24,453 --> 00:34:26,194
It looks really cold
out there, and, uh...

786
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:28,153
- I'm not cold.
- Let me give you a ride.

787
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:31,895
- Come on.
- Listen, come on.

788
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:34,594
<i>♪ Sure makes me wonder ♪</i>

789
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:39,120
<i>♪ If you know what
you're looking for ♪</i>

790
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:40,687
You didn't tell me your name.

791
00:34:44,778 --> 00:34:46,127
Ivana Zelnícková.

792
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:50,827
Ivana Zelnícková?

793
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,265
- Zelnícková.
- Zelnícková.

794
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:01,142
Thank you for the ride.

795
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:05,059
I really wanna see you again, okay?

796
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:07,931
I'd love to, uh, I'd love to
take you to dinner.

797
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,544
Thank you, Donald, but...
I have a boyfriend.

798
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:13,676
So what? He doesn't let you eat?

799
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:16,375
Goodnight, Donald.

800
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:24,122
He's spicy.

801
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:29,562
"Donald J. Trump is tall,
lean, and blonde,

802
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:31,564
with dazzling white teeth,

803
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:34,697
and looks ever so much like
Robert Redford."

804
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:39,224
I'm so proud of you, my love.

805
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:42,705
I'm so proud.

806
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:46,796
They even called me, uh, controversial.

807
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:50,191
Donald, it would have been
appropriate

808
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:54,152
for you, um, to talk to me
before you announced

809
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:55,936
your Commodore plan.

810
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,112
Now it looks like

811
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:00,767
I don't run my own
goddamn company.

812
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:01,941
Well...

813
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:03,683
not if you back me up.

814
00:36:05,554 --> 00:36:09,254
Donald, the Chrysler Building
is in foreclosure.

815
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:11,275
- Well, the Chrysler Building...
- And you wanna open

816
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:12,581
a hotel around the corner.
- I, I understand,

817
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:13,625
the Chrysler Building
is a landmark,

818
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:14,998
so, it's absolutely fine.

819
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,846
It's like adding a deckchair
to the Titanic.

820
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,350
Dad, sooner or later
you might have to

821
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:19,917
accept the fact
that I could be right,

822
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,155
and maybe I know what I'm doing.

823
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,528
Look, Donald,

824
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,094
I respect what you've done, son.

825
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:25,389
I really hope so. I hope so.

826
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:27,010
I hope so, Dad, I really do.

827
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:29,448
Donald...

828
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:31,798
I gotta go.

829
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:36,411
Really, Frederick?

830
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,683
Hey, Russell, uh, where's Roy?

831
00:36:47,857 --> 00:36:50,686
Donald, what's a nice boy like
you doing at a party like this?

832
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:56,170
How do you know Roy?

833
00:36:57,606 --> 00:36:59,129
He's, uh, he's my lawyer.

834
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:00,304
Hmm.

835
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:01,610
Mine too.

836
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:05,048
I'm in real estate.

837
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,223
Hmm.

838
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:07,834
What do you do?

839
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:09,792
I'm an artist.

840
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:10,966
Oh.

841
00:37:12,491 --> 00:37:13,492
What do you make?

842
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:16,234
Anything I can sell.

843
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:19,106
Making money is art.

844
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:20,933
It's true.

845
00:37:20,977 --> 00:37:22,414
It is. It is.

846
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:24,590
Are you successful?

847
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:30,117
Roy.

848
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,291
There he is, the, uh,

849
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:32,815
the boy with the golden hair.

850
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:35,731
I say, uh, if you're indicted,
you're invited.

851
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:38,168
Uh, the suit looks great.

852
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:39,692
Come on, let's, uh,
let's mingle.

853
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,521
Dick, uh, how are you?
This is Donald Trump.

854
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:44,827
- Oh, how's it going?
- New friend, new client.

855
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:46,612
Uh...

856
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,657
Listen, Roy, I hear Ed Koch
is gonna run.

857
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:50,505
Oh, well, he'll never win,
he's a total homo.

858
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,053
He's a homo?

859
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:54,857
- That's what I heard, right?
- Listen, Abe's worried,

860
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,641
he wanted me to talk to you.
- Okay, call me tomorrow,

861
00:37:56,665 --> 00:37:58,014
I'm at the party right now, okay?

862
00:37:58,188 --> 00:38:00,147
Dick is the, uh, deputy mayor.

863
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:02,280
So, he's a good friend.

864
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:05,065
Gentlemen, I want you to meet
a, uh, real prince.

865
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,719
- This is Donald Trump.
- Mr Murdoch.

866
00:38:06,893 --> 00:38:08,068
Nice to meet you.

867
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:10,133
- George Steinbrenner.
- Of course. It's a great honour.

868
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:11,308
He knows who you are, George.

869
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:12,353
I mean, are you kidding me?

870
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:13,377
Sir, I used to play ball.

871
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:14,616
Coach said I could've gone pro.

872
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,640
What the hell happened?

873
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:17,164
Well, I realised why play

874
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:18,750
on the field when I
can just own the stadium?

875
00:38:18,774 --> 00:38:20,907
- I like that.
- Talk to you later.

876
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:22,778
Rupert is gonna be key for you.

877
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:26,042
You wanna get quoted in the
Post and all the papers a lot,

878
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:27,870
you know, keep your name in
the papers.

879
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:29,045
Oh, that's my accountant.

880
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:31,918
- Uh, really?
- Uh, listen,

881
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:35,051
you'd better work on
the, uh, Commodore pitch, okay?

882
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:37,025
Brush up on that, because
I got you a sit-down

883
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:38,533
with the CEO of Hyatt.

884
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:40,579
- Jay Pritzker?
- Yeah, Pritzker, who else?

885
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:41,971
Roy, that's amazing.

886
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:44,583
- Roy, that's...
- Okay?

887
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:46,454
- That's incredible.
- Estelle!

888
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:59,424
On behalf of the, uh, sadistic,
inhumane conservatives

889
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:02,209
in this country, I wanna
welcome, uh, all of you.

890
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:06,605
It's great to see so many old
friends and, uh, new ones.

891
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:08,520
I love this country.

892
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:11,784
I think of America as my most
important client.

893
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:14,264
Some of you are my clients,
and I hate to break it to you,

894
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,354
but America is more important.

895
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:18,878
We are the last line of defence

896
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:20,793
between a free world

897
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:23,926
and a, uh, totalitarian
hellscape.

898
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,460
God bless America!

899
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:27,843
God bless America!

900
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:30,933
- God bless America!
- God bless America!

Where is Roy? Have you seen him?

907
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:15,717
- I think he went upstairs.
- Okay. Alright.

908
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:17,153
I guess I'll look around.

909

Get the fuck away... away
from me!

911
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:02,198
Well, gentlemen, this is
a monumental opportunity.

912
00:41:02,372 --> 00:41:03,722
The Grand Central area is one of

913
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:05,941
the most important
locations in the city.

914
00:41:06,115 --> 00:41:08,596
The Chrysler Building is there,
the Pan Am Building is there,

915
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,945
the whole area is monumental.

916
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,643
And the key to the whole area

917
00:41:11,817 --> 00:41:13,471
is the old Commodore Hotel,

918
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:15,013
which is just sitting there
boarded up

919
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:16,778
and waiting to be transformed.

920
00:41:16,952 --> 00:41:18,563
I wanna make it something
very special,

921
00:41:18,737 --> 00:41:20,390
I wanna build an incredible,

922
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:21,914
glorious, glamorous hotel

923
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:23,152
that's gonna put people to work

924
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:24,240
in the construction trades,

925
00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:25,439
it's gonna save hotel jobs.

926
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:27,053
It's been a brutal year
for New York,

927
00:41:27,223 --> 00:41:29,269
we're... we're one step away
from depression,

928
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:31,619
and we have to bring it back.

929
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:33,099
Thank you.

930
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:35,797
Commodore Hotel is a great idea,

931
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:38,539
but not only is it in shambles,

932
00:41:38,713 --> 00:41:40,585
but everything around it
as well.

933
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:44,023
Everything on that city block

934
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:46,895
is going to need to be rebuilt.

935
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:48,418
I'd love to do that.

936
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:50,551
I think that destination's
a great word.

937
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:52,597
You know, it brings people
to... to Manhattan.

938
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:53,965
A lot of Europeans are waiting

939
00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:55,077
to come back to the city.

940
00:41:56,122 --> 00:41:58,603
Mr Pritzker, any questions?

941
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,170
Just one.

942
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:04,086
Between the unions and taxes...

943
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:06,785
how will you make money?

944
00:42:08,134 --> 00:42:12,442
Um... well, that's a... that's
a really interesting question.

945
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:13,792
Um...

946
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:15,794
well, there won't be
any taxes, Jay,

947
00:42:15,968 --> 00:42:19,449
because, uh, we're gonna get
a tax abatement from the mayor,

948
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:23,149
who is begging developers
to build, okay?

949
00:42:23,366 --> 00:42:25,388
And if I tell him that the CEO
of Hyatt is committing,

950
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:27,414
then I can get him to waive
the property taxes.

951
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:30,219
The city is broke,
and you're saying

952
00:42:30,243 --> 00:42:31,592
they're gonna forego taxes?

953
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:34,726
I'm saying I got the City
Planning Commission

954
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,075
in my pocket.

955
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:42,037
You keep dreaming, Donald.

956
00:42:59,141 --> 00:43:00,360
<i>Hello?</i>

957
00:43:01,013 --> 00:43:03,015
Russell, it's Donald, uh,
can you let me in?

958
00:43:03,189 --> 00:43:05,191
I, I, I need to talk to Roy.

959
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:09,803
Russell.

960
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:14,026
<i>Easy, easy.</i>

961
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,201
<i>You're gonna...</i>
- Roy...

962
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:16,724
<i>You're gonna break my intercom.</i>

963
00:43:16,898 --> 00:43:18,857
Roy, can you let me in?
I, I, I need your help.

964
00:43:19,118 --> 00:43:21,120
<i>Boy, you fucked
the dog, didn't you?</i>

965
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:24,166
Listen, I, I, I...

966
00:43:25,994 --> 00:43:26,994
Sorry.

967
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,823
I really need your help on this.

968
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:30,869
Okay, I'll, uh, I'll call
the mayor.

969
00:43:31,043 --> 00:43:32,087
What's my ask?

970
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:38,050
Waive Hyatt's property taxes.

971
00:43:41,314 --> 00:43:43,142
Waive Hyatt's property taxes?

972
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,143
- Yeah.
- Oh, so...

973
00:43:44,317 --> 00:43:45,492
you, you want, uh...

974
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:46,687
you want me to ask them for

975
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:48,495
a $160 million abatement?

976
00:43:49,757 --> 00:43:51,157
Yeah. Well, with you it can
be done.

977
00:43:51,324 --> 00:43:52,324
You're nuts.

978
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:53,413
With you it can be done.

979
00:43:53,587 --> 00:43:54,867
You're Roy Cohn,
you're Roy Cohn.

980
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,285
The Roy Cohn.

981
00:43:56,764 --> 00:43:58,364
- It's just not gonna happen.
- I mean...

982
00:43:58,418 --> 00:43:59,917
I'll do anything for you.
What-whatever you want.

983
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:01,377
You know, I can't, uh, turn,

984
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:04,467
uh, you know, loaves into
fishes here, you know?

985
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:06,054
I know, but I'm begging you
for this.

986
00:44:06,078 --> 00:44:07,398
I believe in this, Roy, and
I'm...

987
00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:09,777
I'm begging you, please. Just...

988
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:11,213
just make a call.

989
00:44:11,387 --> 00:44:12,787
Okay, call me in the morning, okay?

990
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:13,607
- Call me in the morning.
- Roy, I love you.

991
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:14,781
Be glad he owes me.

992
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,784
I love you!

993
00:44:17,437 --> 00:44:18,437
Okay.

994
00:44:18,568 --> 00:44:20,092
Thank you. Have a good night.

995
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:21,266
Goodnight.

996
00:44:21,397 --> 00:44:23,051
Ha... have a good night.

997
00:44:25,488 --> 00:44:26,888
Let's just hope
we're not

998
00:44:26,968 --> 00:44:28,709
made fools of in there.

999
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:31,451
Everyone's on board, Dad,
this is just a formality.

1000
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:32,713
Yeah, right.

1001
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:34,541
Uh, it was only a year ago

1002
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:37,500
that President Ford told
New York City to drop dead.

1003
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:40,112
New York City, drop dead.

1004
00:44:40,547 --> 00:44:42,331
Now, my client, Mr Trump,

1005
00:44:42,505 --> 00:44:44,594
is trying to give this city
a much needed,

1006
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:47,815
uh, blood infusion and,
uh, resuscitate the corpse

1007
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,425
of New York City. And I urge you

1008
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,427
to support my client
in doing so.

1009
00:44:51,645 --> 00:44:52,646
Thank you.

1010
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,256
Thank you, Mr Cohn.

1011
00:44:54,953 --> 00:44:57,738
Let's go through the last run of
comments on this issue.

1012
00:44:57,956 --> 00:44:59,479
Deputy Mayor Richard Morgan

1013
00:44:59,653 --> 00:45:01,655
will provide the mayor's view
of this proposal.

1014
00:45:03,962 --> 00:45:05,267
Thank you, Chairman.

1015
00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:07,182
I'll keep this brief.

1016
00:45:07,356 --> 00:45:08,880
Uh, Mayor Beame,

1017
00:45:09,054 --> 00:45:10,272
and the rest of City Hall

1018
00:45:10,446 --> 00:45:12,710
fully support Mr Trump's plans.

1019
00:45:12,884 --> 00:45:14,363
This is a damn rip off.

1020
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:16,061
The rich don't need another
tax break!

1021
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:17,734
- Order!
- Especially this man.

1022
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:19,542
- Okay, okay... okay.
- Come on, Chairman.

1023
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,240
While it is true that there
is support

1024
00:45:21,414 --> 00:45:23,198
for Mr Trump's proposal,

1025
00:45:23,372 --> 00:45:25,548
it is also true that the city is
being forced to cut

1026
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,594
vital services to the poor.

1027
00:45:27,768 --> 00:45:29,988
We will move to a vote after
a short recess.

1028
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:37,691
You said they were on board.

1029
00:45:37,865 --> 00:45:39,345
Now you're wasting my time.

1030
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:40,999
What did I tell you?

1031
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:43,828
What did I tell you?

1032
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:51,096
What happened, Roy?

1033
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,447
You thought, uh, the rules
don't apply to you.

1034
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,058
Well, what are we gonna do now?

1035
00:45:57,232 --> 00:45:58,625
They're gonna vote any minute.

1036
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,763
Watch your head.

1037
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:13,074
It's my playroom.

1038
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:17,383
I can record, uh,
everything and,

1039
00:46:17,557 --> 00:46:20,516
you know, keep a record
in case I need it.

1040
00:46:29,525 --> 00:46:33,051
This is the patch bay, and,
uh, you run these cables,

1041
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:34,661
uh, to any room in the house,

1042
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:36,968
and, uh, you can listen in.

1043
00:46:37,272 --> 00:46:38,796
I got Onassis.

1044
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,493
I got Cardinal Cooke.

1045
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,060
Oh, I got everybody.

1046
00:46:43,017 --> 00:46:44,366
Park your butt here.

1047
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:49,850
The chairman came to
see me one day...

1048
00:46:51,156 --> 00:46:52,940
with a little problem.

1049
00:46:57,597 --> 00:46:59,425
Michael, uh, can I have a word?
- Yeah.

1050
00:47:05,605 --> 00:47:07,713
<i>- Where d'you put the money?
- I put it in a fund</i>

1051
00:47:07,737 --> 00:47:09,417
<i>that I thought no-one would
take a look at.</i>

1052
00:47:09,478 --> 00:47:10,586
<i>Now they're starting to go
through the books.</i>

1053
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:11,610
<i>How much?</i>

1054
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:13,656
<i>50k.</i>

1055
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,634
<i>I-I don't want this thing
coming back to haunt me.</i>

1056
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:17,138
Have you no decency?

1057
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:19,749
Oh, you know,
I've heard that before.

1058
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:26,278
You have to be willing to do
anything to anyone to win.

1059
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:32,632
This has been one of
the toughest votes we've had.

1060
00:47:32,806 --> 00:47:35,287
There's a lot of strong feelings
on both sides.

1061
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:38,812
You have to be willing to
exploit your enemies

1062
00:47:38,986 --> 00:47:40,422
and instil fear.

1063
00:47:42,424 --> 00:47:45,993
Our responsibility is to do
what's best for New York.

1064
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:48,213
The truth is, the city needs
investment.

1065
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:51,651
Therefore, we grant approval
for Mr Trump's tax abatement.

1066
00:47:55,742 --> 00:47:58,658
- This is a final decision...
- This is corruption!

1067
00:47:58,832 --> 00:48:00,355
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

1068
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:03,228
I will ask you to maintain order
in this house!

1069
00:48:13,455 --> 00:48:14,761
Well, that's illegal, right?

1070
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:16,067
Oh, it's illegal?

1071
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,199
Donald, wake up.

1072
00:48:19,548 --> 00:48:21,420
You know, when I tried
the Rosenbergs,

1073
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:24,510
I wanted so badly

1074
00:48:24,814 --> 00:48:26,686
to see those pinko kikes fry

1075
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,166
for what they did.

1076
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,430
Now, uh, Judge Kaufman
had no trouble

1077
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:32,910
sending Julius to the chair,

1078
00:48:33,084 --> 00:48:35,303
but, uh, Ethel was a mother

1079
00:48:35,477 --> 00:48:36,477
with young kids.

1080
00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:38,219
They wanted her to live.

1081
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:41,527
As if that's some sort of
special immunity

1082
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:43,572
for betraying your country.

1083
00:48:44,182 --> 00:48:45,531
So, during the trial,

1084
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:47,402
I'd slip out at lunch
to a phone booth

1085
00:48:47,576 --> 00:48:49,535
and, uh, call Kaufman.

1086
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:51,929
You know, technically
ex parte conversations,

1087
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:55,845
they're not allowed, but, uh,
when democracy is at stake,

1088
00:48:56,846 --> 00:49:00,285
you're damn right I'm willing to
violate a few technicalities.

1089
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,331
I don't care if she's a mother
with young kids.

1090
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:07,857
She betrayed our country
and she has to die.

1091
00:49:08,336 --> 00:49:11,949
You have to set an example
and put this woman to death.

1092
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,386
She's a traitor.

1093
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:19,347
Do you understand what
I'm telling you?

1094
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:26,852
I mean, America's
the biggest client, right?

1095
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:28,139
That's right.

1096
00:49:29,357 --> 00:49:33,057
You have to be willing to do
anything for America.

1097
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:35,146
To safeguard democracy.

1098
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:45,938
Huh?

1099
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:48,681
"Yes, Sir, I Can Boogie"
by Baccara

1100
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,204
Is this for me?

1101
00:49:50,378 --> 00:49:53,207
<i>♪ But I need a certain song ♪</i>

1102
00:49:54,426 --> 00:49:56,428
Make it five here.

1103
00:49:56,602 --> 00:50:00,171
<i>♪ Boogie woogie

1104
00:50:02,216 --> 00:50:04,262
<i>♪ Yes, Sir, I can boogie ♪</i>

1105
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:10,050
- Hello?
<i>- Ivana, it's Donald.</i>

1106
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:15,055
<i>- Hi, Donald.</i>
- What's going on?

1107
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:16,361
You wanna go to dinner?

1108
00:50:16,535 --> 00:50:17,535
<i>Donald, I like you,</i>

1109
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:18,866
and the flowers are beautiful,

1110
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,234
but I cannot do this.

1111
00:50:20,408 --> 00:50:21,559
I can't.
<i>- You're hurting my heart.</i>

1112
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:22,647
<i>I can't sleep, I can't eat.</i>

1113
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:23,455
I'm off for a job in Aspen,

1114
00:50:23,629 --> 00:50:24,456
and I need to pack.

1115
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:25,761
A job?

1116
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:27,937
Like, are you, like...

1117
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:30,027
Listen, Donald,
I'm getting engaged.

1118
00:50:30,592 --> 00:50:32,632
- You're getting engaged?
<i>- And I love my boyfriend.</i>

1119
00:50:33,595 --> 00:50:34,595
Well, just...

1120
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:56,009
Alright, so, here's the idea.

1121
00:50:56,183 --> 00:50:57,663
We've got like
a rock band going here,

1122
00:50:57,706 --> 00:50:59,273
and like she gets
all the attention,

1123
00:50:59,447 --> 00:51:00,903
and you guys are great,
you're supporting her, though.

1124
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:02,146
Okay.

1125
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,149
Yeah, just... push your
tits towards me.

1126
00:51:05,323 --> 00:51:06,323
There you go.

1127
00:51:06,454 --> 00:51:07,605
The arrogance, the arrogance.

1128
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:09,022
Sexy. Here we go.

1129
00:51:10,284 --> 00:51:11,284
Yeah, okay.

1130
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:15,985
Beautiful.

1131
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:18,031
Come a little bit forward here.

1132
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:19,641
There you go. Okay.

1133
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:27,084
Great job.

1134
00:51:29,912 --> 00:51:31,088
You look good.

1135
00:51:31,262 --> 00:51:33,046
Donald, what are you doing here?

1136
00:51:34,743 --> 00:51:36,919
I heard, uh, Aspen real estate
is hot.

1137
00:51:38,138 --> 00:51:39,139
Bullshit.

1138
00:51:39,357 --> 00:51:40,140
It's true.

1139
00:51:40,314 --> 00:51:41,489
I have a lot of, uh...

1140
00:51:41,794 --> 00:51:42,969
unfinished business.

1141
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:47,016
You wanna go to dinner?

1142
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:50,019
I'm gonna make a run
after the shoot,

1143
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:52,631
and... maybe you can join me.

1144
00:51:54,067 --> 00:51:55,242
You... you wanna ski?

1145
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:56,635
Do you know how to ski?

1146
00:51:57,288 --> 00:51:58,288
Sure.

1147
00:51:59,507 --> 00:52:00,682
I'll meet you here.

1148
00:52:00,856 --> 00:52:02,031
Meet me at the slopes.

1149
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:03,859
No, no, no, I'll meet you here.

1150
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:06,688
I'll get my skis, then I'll meet
you here.

1151
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:26,708
Do...

1152
00:52:26,882 --> 00:52:28,145
do you like modelling?

1153
00:52:35,021 --> 00:52:36,414
I like the money.

1154
00:52:37,284 --> 00:52:38,851
You make good money on that?

1155
00:52:39,025 --> 00:52:40,505
I make decent money,

1156
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:42,479
but what I really want is
my own fashion line.

1157
00:52:42,637 --> 00:52:44,073
I want clothes, jewellery,

1158
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,815
shoes... with my name.

1159
00:52:48,077 --> 00:52:51,603
My biggest dream is to have
my own interior design firm.

1160
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:53,779
I have a whole vision.

1161
00:53:02,831 --> 00:53:03,831
What?

1162
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:07,096
Uh, no, you're just not

1163
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:09,664
like, uh, the women
I normally meet.

1164
00:53:11,362 --> 00:53:12,928
Because I want something
more than a man

1165
00:53:13,102 --> 00:53:14,147
and a ring?

1166
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:17,803
Yeah.

1167
00:53:17,977 --> 00:53:19,283
Well, cheers to that.

1168
00:53:24,026 --> 00:53:26,028
You're really not gonna
drink anything?

1169
00:53:26,377 --> 00:53:29,162
I don't like anything to slow
me down.

1170
00:53:31,773 --> 00:53:32,773
Uh...

1171
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:35,299
Okay, I don't mean to laugh.

1172
00:53:35,473 --> 00:53:37,126
Well, in life

1173
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:39,433
there are two types of people.

1174
00:53:41,566 --> 00:53:43,045
There are killers,

1175
00:53:43,263 --> 00:53:44,830
and there are losers.

1176
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:50,618
But it's good not to be
a killer, no?

1177
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:57,234
Killer means winner.

1178
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:01,062
Oh.

1179
00:54:04,284 --> 00:54:05,459
So...

1180
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:11,073
Are you a killer, Donald?

1181
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:19,908
Are you going to kill me?

1182
00:54:26,524 --> 00:54:27,924
<i>It's called
the Big Apple,</i>

1183
00:54:28,047 --> 00:54:30,005
<i>the greatest city in the world.</i>

1184
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:32,138
<i>Now there seems to be
something rotten</i>

1185
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:33,357
<i>in the core of the fruit.</i>

1186
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:35,359
<i>The city can barely afford to</i>

1187
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:37,099
<i>pay its bills, says Ed Koch,</i>

1188
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,492
<i>the mayoral candidate.</i>

1189
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:40,407
We don't know yet the sacrifices

1190
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:41,930
we need to make

1191
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:43,932
to get this city back
on its feet again.

1192
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:45,586
<i>And as the crime is surging,</i>

1193
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,109
<i>it might even have to lay off</i>

1194
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,981
<i>those who fight crime.</i>

1195
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:50,995
<i>But this won't stop young

1196
00:54:51,157 --> 00:54:52,637
<i>Donald Trump, from pursuing</i>

00:54:52,811 --> 00:54:53,899
<i>his dream project:</i>

<i>a 1,500-room luxury hotel</i>

1199
00:54:56,467 --> 00:54:58,077
<i>at the Grand Central terminal.</i>

1200
00:54:58,251 --> 00:55:00,166
New York right now is at
a great turning point,

1201
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,622
it's gonna go one way
or the other,

1202
00:55:01,646 --> 00:55:02,473
and I'm gonna make
damn well sure

1203
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:03,822
it goes the right way.

1204
00:55:03,996 --> 00:55:05,606
I wanna make it
a fabulous place again.

1205
00:55:12,613 --> 00:55:13,614
Oh my God.

1206
00:55:25,278 --> 00:55:26,888
It's a 19-year open audit.

1207
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:28,170
So, what they're telling me is

1208
00:55:28,194 --> 00:55:29,543
I'm supposed to remember now,

1209
00:55:29,717 --> 00:55:31,719
in March 1977,

1210
00:55:31,893 --> 00:55:33,330
uh, who I had dinner with

1211
00:55:33,504 --> 00:55:36,115
in February 1958,

1212
00:55:36,289 --> 00:55:38,073
and, uh, you know,
what colour tie

1213
00:55:38,247 --> 00:55:39,945
they were wearing,
and... exactly.

1214
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:41,686
Listen, let me call you back.

1215
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:46,517
The, uh, clowns at the IRS

1216
00:55:46,691 --> 00:55:48,823
are crawling up my ass again.

1217
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:50,172
That's terrible.

1218
00:55:52,044 --> 00:55:55,003
Uh, Roger, meet Donald Trump.

1219
00:55:55,177 --> 00:55:56,677
- Hi. Good to meet you.
- How you doing?

1220
00:55:56,701 --> 00:55:58,243
Roger Stone.
Sorry, I'm all wet.

1221
00:55:58,267 --> 00:55:59,347
That's, uh, that's alright.

1222
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:00,443
He's all wet.

1223
00:56:00,531 --> 00:56:01,706
Huge fan of your work.

1224
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,098
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

1225
00:56:03,272 --> 00:56:05,100
Roger here is into politics.

1226
00:56:05,274 --> 00:56:07,929
His specialty is, uh,
dirty tricks.

1227
00:56:08,234 --> 00:56:09,714
Uh, well, no comment.

1228
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,281
Roger, uh, be a mensch,

1229
00:56:12,456 --> 00:56:13,500
uh, get me a Paloma.

1230
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:14,675
Sure.

1231
00:56:15,981 --> 00:56:18,549
So... how's things?

1232
00:56:18,723 --> 00:56:21,421
Well, uh, listen, things are...

1233
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:24,163
things are good,
and I, uh, I met someone.

1234
00:56:24,337 --> 00:56:25,338
You met someone?

1235
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:26,992
That's great. Good for you.

1236
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:29,603
Well, she's a...
she's a tough cookie.

1237
00:56:29,995 --> 00:56:31,388
Well, she better not
mess with you,

1238
00:56:31,562 --> 00:56:33,738
because she'll have to
answer to me.

1239
00:56:36,001 --> 00:56:37,132
We're gonna get married.

1240
00:56:38,743 --> 00:56:39,961
You're gonna get married?

1241
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:42,311
You're gonna get married?

1242
00:56:42,486 --> 00:56:43,574
What do you mean?

1243
00:56:43,965 --> 00:56:45,271
I love her, Roy.
- Are you nuts?

1244
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:46,838
Are you out of your
goddamn mind?

1245
00:56:47,012 --> 00:56:48,452
- Well, I'm in love.
- Donald, let me

1246
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:49,535
put it to you this way.

1247
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:50,929
Would you sign a contract

1248
00:56:51,103 --> 00:56:52,974
giving away half your assets?

1249
00:56:53,584 --> 00:56:54,889
Roy, a contract?

1250
00:56:55,063 --> 00:56:56,703
That's what a marriage is,
it's a contract

1251
00:56:56,804 --> 00:56:58,110
between two parties.

1252
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:00,262
My parents have been married
for 40 years, Roy,

1253
00:57:00,286 --> 00:57:02,636
and I don't know what...
nobody had a contract.

1254
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:06,466
Listen, the matrimonial game
is a zero-sum game.

1255
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,903
Trust me. I almost married
Barbara Walters

1256
00:57:09,077 --> 00:57:10,470
and then I wised up.

1257
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,650
- Right.
- You're gonna need protection.

1258
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:27,966
It's not the Magna Carta,

1259
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,881
it's just a standard prenup.

1260
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:33,319
That's all.

1261
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:34,798
Yeah.

1262
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:37,497
"In the event of separation,

1263
00:57:37,671 --> 00:57:40,413
spouse will receive $20,000
annual."

1264
00:57:40,587 --> 00:57:41,587
Right.

1265
00:57:42,415 --> 00:57:43,634
That's not too bad.

1266
00:57:46,071 --> 00:57:47,701
- We're not gonna separate.
- Okay, let me finish.

1267
00:57:47,725 --> 00:57:48,845
You just sign it at the end.

1268
00:57:48,987 --> 00:57:50,031
Let me finish.

1269
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:51,468
Please, take your time.

1270
00:57:51,642 --> 00:57:53,165
- I will, trust me.
- Good.

1271
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:03,262
Return all the gifts?

1272
00:58:04,393 --> 00:58:05,873
Is this a joke?

1273
00:58:06,047 --> 00:58:07,847
- Does it say that?
- Is what a joke?

1274
00:58:07,962 --> 00:58:10,051
Uh, we, we, we don't have to
do that.

1275
00:58:10,225 --> 00:58:11,444
Well, legally a gift, uh,

1276
00:58:11,618 --> 00:58:13,228
doesn't constitute marital
property,

1277
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:15,206
so, in the case of divorce...
- You agree with that?

1278
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:16,599
...or the dissolution of
a marriage.

1279
00:58:16,623 --> 00:58:18,320
- A gift?
- Well...

1280
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,124
You don't need to bullshit me
with this legal language.

1281
00:58:20,148 --> 00:58:22,150
I can get a two-dollars lawyer
like you as well.

1282
00:58:22,324 --> 00:58:24,302
- Ivana, you can keep the gifts.
- I, I don't need that.

1283
00:58:24,326 --> 00:58:26,126
Well, we don't have to...
just keep the gifts.

1284
00:58:26,154 --> 00:58:27,286
- Forget it.
- It's fine.

1285
00:58:27,852 --> 00:58:30,289
- Oh my God...
- Uh... buyer beware.

1286
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:35,512
Ivana, hey...

1287
00:58:37,078 --> 00:58:38,427
Ivana!

1288
00:58:38,602 --> 00:58:39,753
Look, forget the gift clause, alright?

1289
00:58:39,777 --> 00:58:41,126
Roy got carried away.

1290
00:58:41,474 --> 00:58:43,563
Listen, I'll give you,
uh, 50,000 now,

1291
00:58:43,737 --> 00:58:46,435
like a signing bonus, alright?
Come on.

1292
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:48,481
The wedding is in two days.

1293
00:58:48,786 --> 00:58:51,702
$100,000 in my account
before the wedding.

1294
00:58:52,224 --> 00:58:53,399
75.

1295
00:58:54,966 --> 00:58:55,966
100,000 or I go.

1296
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:56,924
Ivana, please.

1297
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:58,317
Let's talk about this.

1298
00:58:58,491 --> 00:59:00,014
Come on, don't do this.

1299
00:59:00,188 --> 00:59:01,905
Go find someone else, Donald.
I'm not a trophy wife.

1300
00:59:01,929 --> 00:59:03,864
You're gonna ruin your life
if you don't marry me.

1301
00:59:03,888 --> 00:59:05,498
Come on.

1302
00:59:05,672 --> 00:59:07,500
- One second. Listen, I'm...
- Why is that?

1303
00:59:07,674 --> 00:59:09,154
Because I'm rich, I'm handsome,

1304
00:59:09,328 --> 00:59:11,001
I have a great family...
- Oh my God, oh my God.

1305
00:59:11,025 --> 00:59:12,176
I'm going to be in the
number-one building in New York.

1306
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,854
Listen to me.

1307
00:59:14,028 --> 00:59:15,876
You're gonna have a life
you can't even dream of, Ivana,

1308
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:16,988
with me.

1309
00:59:17,292 --> 00:59:18,467
I love you.

1310
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:22,559
I love you, okay?

1311
00:59:22,863 --> 00:59:24,212
I wanna have children with you,

1312
00:59:24,386 --> 00:59:25,779
I want us to grow old together.

1313
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:36,659
Better.

1314
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:38,836
Hey!

1315
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:39,793
Congratulations!

1316
00:59:39,967 --> 00:59:41,012
Fuck you!

1317
00:59:52,153 --> 00:59:53,590
Thank you very much for coming.

1318
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:54,852
Thank you.

1319
00:59:56,418 --> 00:59:57,594
Uh, here.

1320
00:59:57,768 --> 00:59:58,768
Cheers.

1321
00:59:58,899 --> 01:00:00,059
She thinks she's gonna put me

1322
01:00:00,161 --> 01:00:01,728
in the movies now.

1323
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:03,382
She thinks I look like
Robert Redford.

1324
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:04,949
Thank you, thanks for coming.

1325
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:07,014
Your building is almost as
beautiful as your wife.

1326
01:00:07,038 --> 01:00:08,213
Well, almost.

1327
01:00:08,387 --> 01:00:09,712
And it's gonna get even
more beautiful.

1328
01:00:09,736 --> 01:00:11,259
You two must have
a lot of money.

1329
01:00:11,433 --> 01:00:12,696
Here they are.

1330
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:14,828
- Oh. There he is.
- Ah, the two lovebirds.

1331
01:00:15,002 --> 01:00:17,788
You look, uh, you look
marvellous.

1332
01:00:18,571 --> 01:00:19,616
Hey there.

1333
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:25,143
- Excuse me.
- See you in a second.

1334
01:00:25,752 --> 01:00:27,754
I don't think somebody's over
the prenup.

1335
01:00:27,928 --> 01:00:29,688
- Oh, she'll come around.
- I don't think so,

1336
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,236
but, uh, that's alright.

1337
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:32,410
Means I'm doing my job.

1338
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:33,847
Somebody's gotta protect you.

1339
01:00:34,021 --> 01:00:35,414
Exactly.

1340
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:37,372
Look at this.
I mean, you got everybody.

1341
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:39,374
You got the mayor,

1342
01:00:39,548 --> 01:00:41,333
uh, city council president,

1343
01:00:41,507 --> 01:00:43,161
all the major developers here.

1344
01:00:43,335 --> 01:00:45,946
Everybody's lining up to kiss
your ring now, kiddo.

1345
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,732
You've arrived... you know that?

1346
01:00:49,994 --> 01:00:51,299
Thank you, Roy.

1347
01:00:53,388 --> 01:00:54,433
I love you.

1348
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:58,263
You're practically my family.

1349
01:00:58,437 --> 01:00:59,873
Oh, thank you for saying that.

1350
01:01:00,047 --> 01:01:01,353
I hope we're not tired yet,

1351
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:03,311
we're just getting started,
you know.

1352
01:01:03,485 --> 01:01:04,573
Drink up, everybody.

1353
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:06,140
Hey, good to see you.

1354
01:01:06,314 --> 01:01:08,055
Good to see you.
It's been a long time.

1355
01:01:08,447 --> 01:01:09,578
- Roy.
- How are you?

1356
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,121
- I'm good, how are you?
- Uh, good.

1357
01:01:11,145 --> 01:01:12,451
Very nice to see you.

1358
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:13,820
Uh, you should be very proud of
your son.

1359
01:01:13,844 --> 01:01:15,628
I'm extremely proud.

1360
01:01:15,802 --> 01:01:17,412
Extremely proud.

1361
01:01:17,586 --> 01:01:19,414
You know, Roy,
I've been meaning to tell you,

1362
01:01:19,588 --> 01:01:22,243
I, I, I... I wanted to thank you

1363
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,898
for all you've done for Donald.
I appreciate it.

1364
01:01:25,072 --> 01:01:26,272
Well, I haven't done anything.

1365
01:01:26,334 --> 01:01:27,684
Uh, he doesn't need my help.

1366
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:29,816
Oh.

1367
01:01:31,862 --> 01:01:34,255
Little Donnie needs
all the help he can get.

1368
01:01:35,082 --> 01:01:37,389
We had to ship him off to
military school

1369
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:39,957
when the teachers found his
switchblade collection.

1370
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:41,611
Yeah, well, uh, you know,

1371
01:01:41,654 --> 01:01:43,264
I saw West Side Story

1372
01:01:43,438 --> 01:01:45,527
and it was a great movie,
West Side Story.

1373
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,139
You know what, Fred?
Uh, I just fixed

1374
01:01:48,313 --> 01:01:49,706
what others couldn't.

1375
01:01:50,184 --> 01:01:51,795
Well, I appreciate it, Roy.

1376
01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:53,448
Thank you for doing that.

1377
01:01:54,885 --> 01:01:56,364
I really do.

1378
01:01:56,538 --> 01:01:58,603
- Thanks for coming, Roy.
- See you in a second, Roy.

1379
01:01:58,627 --> 01:02:00,020
Appreciate it.

1380
01:02:00,499 --> 01:02:02,153
Uh...
- He's an asshole.

1381
01:02:02,588 --> 01:02:04,895
Well, no, he's got a client
he's, uh... he's dealing with.

1382
01:02:05,069 --> 01:02:06,786
Um, how's it going, Dad?
- No, it didn't seem right.

1383
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:08,637
It's... it's going fine,
it's great.

1384
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:10,727
I don't know any of
these people.

1385
01:02:11,205 --> 01:02:12,729
Like, who's that guy?

1386
01:02:12,903 --> 01:02:15,142
Well, uh, these are, uh,
these are very important people.

1387
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:16,839
I wrote a few things down in
case you wanted...

1388
01:02:16,863 --> 01:02:19,736
I should do a... a speech,
you know, a...

1389
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:21,172
toast or whatever.

1390
01:02:21,346 --> 01:02:22,956
We're okay, Freddy, don't worry.

1391
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:24,915
Don't worry about a speech.
- Nah.

1392
01:02:27,004 --> 01:02:30,485
What, uh, what happened
with, uh, TWA?

1393
01:02:30,964 --> 01:02:32,879
I don't like to fly anymore.

1394
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:37,797
Well, that's great, Freddy.

1395
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:42,236
Alright, well, look, I, uh,
I gotta go see Ivana, so, um...

1396
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:46,458
Hey, tell her, uh,
tell her gratulujeme.

1397
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,503
That's 'congratulations'
in Czech.

1398
01:02:48,677 --> 01:02:50,003
- Okay, I will, I will.
- I looked it up

1399
01:02:50,027 --> 01:02:51,439
in case you wanted me
to do a speech.

1400
01:02:51,463 --> 01:02:52,745
Gratulujeme, everybody.

1401
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,945
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- Freddy...

1402
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:56,444
- Hold on, it's on your suit.
- Can you just, uh...

1403
01:02:56,468 --> 01:02:57,991
Leave it. Put it down.

1404
01:02:58,165 --> 01:02:59,863
- Sorry.
- Sit down. Sit down.

1405
01:03:00,037 --> 01:03:01,299
You gave me a wet glass.

1406
01:03:01,734 --> 01:03:03,301
You're looking at me
like it's my fault.

1407
01:03:03,475 --> 01:03:05,042
You gave me a wet glass!
- Have a seat.

1408
01:03:05,216 --> 01:03:07,174
Oh shit, you're mad with me now.

1409
01:03:08,306 --> 01:03:10,026
I ruined everything,
now you're mad with me.

1410
01:03:10,134 --> 01:03:12,136
I'm not mad.
Listen to me, I'm not mad.

1411
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:15,269
- I'm sorry, Donnie.
- I'm not fucking mad.

1412
01:03:15,487 --> 01:03:16,705
Listen to me.

1413
01:03:19,056 --> 01:03:21,841
It's my fucking night,
it's my fucking night.

1414
01:03:22,015 --> 01:03:25,105
Can't you fucking keep it
together, for once?

1415
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:28,587
Stop pissing your fucking life
down the river.

1416
01:03:30,328 --> 01:03:31,768
You were supposed to be
at my dinner.

1417
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:33,046
You were supposed to be
at my dinner,

1418
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:34,462
you're my older brother.

1419
01:03:35,724 --> 01:03:36,987
Stand up.

1420
01:03:39,598 --> 01:03:41,556
Don't be such a fucking bum.

1421
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:47,084
- Ready?
- Ready.

1422
01:03:49,695 --> 01:03:51,871
I got it!

1423
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:54,656
I got it!

1424
01:04:04,753 --> 01:04:08,757
Five, four, three, two, one.

1425
01:04:08,932 --> 01:04:10,585
Happy New Year!

1426
01:04:19,116 --> 01:04:21,858
<i>Every major tax cut

1427
01:04:22,032 --> 01:04:23,685

1433
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:39,223
Listen, don't sell Koch
too hard.

1434
01:04:39,397 --> 01:04:41,094
I know how to handle him, thanks.

1435
01:04:41,268 --> 01:04:42,922
Oh, you know how to
handle him, do you?

1436
01:04:45,272 --> 01:04:46,795
Listen, this is gonna be
a cinch.

1437
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:49,320
Just, uh, let me handle it.

1438
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:52,734
I really think this is gonna be
one of the most

1439
01:04:52,758 --> 01:04:54,301
exceptional buildings
anywhere in the world, and,

1440
01:04:54,325 --> 01:04:55,998
frankly, there's never
been anything like it.

1441
01:04:56,022 --> 01:05:00,113
68 storeys tall, 28 sides,
a million square feet,

1442
01:05:00,287 --> 01:05:02,135
every unit will have amenities
like you wouldn't believe,

1443
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:04,204
and the higher floors have
exceptional views

1444
01:05:04,378 --> 01:05:05,727
over Central Park.
- Huh.

1445
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,947
The lobby, the floors will
all be marble.

1446
01:05:08,121 --> 01:05:09,601
Pink Paradiso marble from Italy.

1447
01:05:09,775 --> 01:05:12,082
It'll have the largest,
uh, atrium in the world,

1448
01:05:12,256 --> 01:05:14,649
a 60-foot waterfall spanned
by shops

1449
01:05:14,823 --> 01:05:16,303
and retail and restaurants,

1450
01:05:16,477 --> 01:05:18,653
and I think it's gonna be
something very special.

1451
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:20,153
Frankly, there's never been
anything like it.

1452
01:05:20,177 --> 01:05:21,417
And what are you gonna call it?

1453
01:05:22,831 --> 01:05:25,225
- Trump Tower.
- Trump Tower?

1454
01:05:25,399 --> 01:05:27,880
Oh, that's interesting.

1455
01:05:28,054 --> 01:05:29,751
Look, he has a great
track record,

1456
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:33,103
so, we think this is a very
reasonable ask.

1457
01:05:33,277 --> 01:05:36,019
Well, I... I... as I frequently
say about his buildings,

1458
01:05:36,193 --> 01:05:38,021
the merit's a fine thing,
it's just we're not

1459
01:05:38,195 --> 01:05:40,545
gonna give you the tax breaks.
Why would we?

1460
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,721
I, I mean, I can't let you
get rich

1461
01:05:42,895 --> 01:05:45,506
on the backs of the people of
New York and their treasury.

1462
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,267
I can't do that, Donald.
- Well, Mr Mayor, I mean...

1463
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:48,833
- first of all...
- Look, Mr Mayor, my client...

1464
01:05:48,857 --> 01:05:50,313
Well, you're not,
you're not, Mr Mayor,

1465
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:51,948
because I'm building
a 68-storey building

1466
01:05:52,122 --> 01:05:54,080
that's gonna employ 5,000
construction workers.

1467
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:56,517
And we have heard stories
about the construction workers

1468
01:05:56,691 --> 01:05:58,345
working on your projects.

1469
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:00,584
They don't get paid. They have
liens against you, Donald.

1470
01:06:00,608 --> 01:06:02,108
I'm trying to employ people
in New York

1471
01:06:02,132 --> 01:06:04,395
and turn us back around,
towards the future.

1472
01:06:04,569 --> 01:06:06,353
And you're being a very
unfair guy,

1473
01:06:06,527 --> 01:06:07,940
'cause frankly, what do you
know about me?

1474
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,158
What do you know about
the amount

1475
01:06:09,182 --> 01:06:10,531
of money that I made on my own?

1476
01:06:10,705 --> 01:06:12,118
You don't know anything,
to be perfectly honest,

1477
01:06:12,142 --> 01:06:13,839
Mr Mayor.
You don't know me at all.

1478
01:06:14,013 --> 01:06:15,928
But you will. You'll never
forget me after this,

1479
01:06:16,102 --> 01:06:17,930
'cause I won't forget what
you just did.

1480
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:20,498
Trump Tower will be built
with or without you!

1481
01:06:21,325 --> 01:06:22,717
- Okay.
- You're about to be sued,

1482
01:06:22,891 --> 01:06:23,718
Mr Mayor.

1483
01:06:30,899 --> 01:06:32,205
Hm.

1484
01:06:33,206 --> 01:06:36,383
I think we should attend
the Park Gala next month.

1485
01:06:36,557 --> 01:06:38,646
Tables are $10,000

1486
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:40,953
and we get to the house
committee.

1487
01:06:41,127 --> 01:06:42,694
Why would I give money
to those snobs?

1488
01:06:42,868 --> 01:06:44,428
It's gonna make the park
more beautiful.

1489
01:06:44,478 --> 01:06:47,046
It's ridiculous, okay?
Trees don't need money to grow.

1490
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,198
The city really should let
developers build over the park,

1491
01:06:49,222 --> 01:06:50,963
'cause it's prime real estate.

1492
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:53,376
And stop trying to be friends
with these Park Avenue phonies.

1493
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,880
They don't care about you.

1494
01:06:55,054 --> 01:06:56,553
I mean, the way you're posing
for the cameras,

1495
01:06:56,577 --> 01:06:58,338
it's like you're, you're begging
for attention.

1496
01:06:58,362 --> 01:07:00,035
Donald, I'm posing because they
want to shoot me.

1497
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:01,408
- Oh, really?
- Don't get jealous.

1498
01:07:01,582 --> 01:07:03,169
- Don't get jealous.
- I'm not jealous, okay?

1499
01:07:03,193 --> 01:07:04,822
If anybody's jealous,
they're jealous of me.

1500
01:07:04,846 --> 01:07:06,346
You are getting jealous.
You're getting a little jealous.

1501
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:07,970
No, no, no. They're jealous
of me, Ivana,

1502
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,697
because nobody's tried...
- Because you're with me.

1503
01:07:09,721 --> 01:07:11,481
on any scale of what I'm trying
to do in the city.

1504
01:07:11,505 --> 01:07:12,526
- Because you're with me.
- No-one's built what I've built

1505
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:14,117
at my age, alright?

1506
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:15,988
I cannot sit.

1507
01:07:16,162 --> 01:07:18,730
It's just, it's Koch, okay?
He's being a piece of work,

1508
01:07:18,904 --> 01:07:21,167
and that's the problem.
He's not gonna budge, alright?

1509
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:22,864
Here, let me help you
with the shoes.

1510
01:07:23,604 --> 01:07:25,432
He just wants a bit more money.
That's it.

1511
01:07:25,606 --> 01:07:28,000
Ivana, I gave him $50,000.

1512
01:07:28,696 --> 01:07:30,568
- What does Roy say?
- Roy's useless!

1513
01:07:30,742 --> 01:07:32,742
What do you mean, what he said?
By the way, the FBI

1514
01:07:32,787 --> 01:07:34,528
raided his house this morning.

1515
01:07:34,702 --> 01:07:36,661
He owes them $7 million
in taxes.

1516
01:07:36,835 --> 01:07:38,943
But it doesn't matter, I don't
need Roy, I don't need anybody.

1517
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:40,767
I'm gonna go on television
and tell the people

1518
01:07:40,795 --> 01:07:43,115
what a loser Koch is, okay,
and that he's a one-line artist

1519
01:07:43,276 --> 01:07:45,516
that doesn't care about anything
other than looking good.

1520
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:47,256
What's the matter with him?

1521
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,605
What's the matter with him?
Why are you crying?

1522
01:07:48,629 --> 01:07:50,370
Don Jr, come here. Come here.

1523
01:07:50,544 --> 01:07:51,904
Come here. Come here,
look at me...

1524
01:07:51,937 --> 01:07:52,957
- Hey bubba.
- Look at me, look at me.

1525
01:07:52,981 --> 01:07:54,418
Look at me, look at me. You see?

1526
01:07:54,592 --> 01:07:56,681
Everything's okay.
Don Jr, everything's okay.

1527
01:07:56,855 --> 01:07:59,292
Look over there. You see New
York City? That's your city.

1528
01:07:59,466 --> 01:08:01,686
Listen, you're a New
York City kid.

1529
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,340
Do you see right there... yes?

1530
01:08:03,514 --> 01:08:04,621
That one, that one,
is that one your favourite?

1531
01:08:04,645 --> 01:08:05,385
Which one's your favourite?

1532
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:06,559
I think he's just tired.

1533
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:07,996
Donald...

1534
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:09,868
It's okay.

1535
01:08:10,042 --> 01:08:11,478
I guess I'm terrible
with babies.

1536
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:13,239
I dunno what you want me to say.

1537
01:08:13,263 --> 01:08:14,438
Who is that?

1538
01:08:14,612 --> 01:08:16,052
- My name's Freddy...
- Freddy!

1539
01:08:16,222 --> 01:08:17,634
Hey, will you tell
this guy who I am?

1540
01:08:17,658 --> 01:08:19,356
- He knows.
- I'm his brother.

1541
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:21,210
When, uh, when, when did you get
into town?

1542
01:08:21,923 --> 01:08:23,490
Uh, just a couple days ago.

1543
01:08:23,664 --> 01:08:25,797
I've been calling you,
but you didn't return my calls.

1544
01:08:25,971 --> 01:08:28,147
- Mm. You don't look too good.
- Yeah.

1545
01:08:28,321 --> 01:08:31,890
- Are you sick?
- I brought this for Don Jr.

1546
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:34,390
Maybe I can go give it to him.
- Uh, that's okay, that's okay.

1547
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:36,000
Listen, I'll, I'll give it
to him, alright?

1548
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:37,591
I'll give it to him.

1549
01:08:37,765 --> 01:08:39,613
What's going on?
I didn't know you were in town.

1550
01:08:39,637 --> 01:08:41,508
Look, Donnie, I know,
I know, uh,

1551
01:08:41,813 --> 01:08:45,947
you know, I know I'm a loser
and, uh, all that, but, uh,

1552
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:48,602
you know, my, my grip's,
kind of, uh,

1553
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:50,648
kind of slipping a little bit,
you know?

1554
01:08:50,822 --> 01:08:55,348
And, uh, it's, it's getting
kind of, uh, you know,

1555
01:08:55,522 --> 01:08:58,264
things are getting a little bit,
uh, scary, and uh...

1556
01:08:58,438 --> 01:09:01,398
- Hm.
- I... you know, I wanna, I wanna,

1557
01:09:01,572 --> 01:09:03,748
I wanna change and...
- Mm-hm.

1558
01:09:05,706 --> 01:09:07,839
Just, just take it easy, okay?
It's gonna be alright.

1559
01:09:08,013 --> 01:09:10,294
We're gonna figure this out.
I'll, I'll help you, alright?

1560
01:09:10,407 --> 01:09:12,452
- Yeah.
- Okay? Alright.

1561
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,720
It's alright, buddy.
We're gonna figure this out.

1562
01:09:16,413 --> 01:09:18,415
- Alright? Don't worry.
- Freddy, how are you?

1563
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:21,505
- Wow, you... Ivana, hi.
- He got a toy for...

1564
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,071
I didn't know you were
in the city.

1565
01:09:23,246 --> 01:09:25,726
- Should I make up the guestroom?
- Yeah.

1566
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:29,208
Um, well, I mean, you know,
we also have, uh,

1567
01:09:29,382 --> 01:09:31,317
didn't you say your family's
coming to town, right?

1568
01:09:31,341 --> 01:09:33,430
You know, why don't you stay
at a hotel tonight?

1569
01:09:33,604 --> 01:09:36,607
Here, get, get a hotel
for, for, for tonight,

1570
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:38,696
and then, uh,
let's talk tomorrow.

1571
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:41,002
You know, we'll, we'll sort
something out, alright?

1572
01:09:43,135 --> 01:09:45,006
Just, just for tonight, alright?

1573
01:09:46,094 --> 01:09:47,898
Come on, Freddy, don't put
this on me, alright?

1574
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:50,442
I mean, you think it's easy for
me to watch you waste your life?

1575
01:09:59,456 --> 01:10:00,457
Poor Freddy.

1576
01:10:05,462 --> 01:10:07,614
<i>Donald Trump's
biggest accomplishment to date</i>

1577
01:10:07,638 --> 01:10:09,030
<i>is the Grand Hyatt.</i>

1578
01:10:09,727 --> 01:10:12,033
<i>Now an even more ambitious plan
is in the works,</i>

1579
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,863
<i>a bold new skyscraper,
a prime Fifth Avenue location,</i>

1580
01:10:16,037 --> 01:10:18,214
<i>neighbouring the famous
Tiffany's store.</i>

1581
01:10:18,518 --> 01:10:20,017
Taller? Well,
it could've been taller.

1582
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:21,601
It could've been
a lot taller, actually.

1583
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:24,045
I wanted to build taller
than the Twin Towers.

1584
01:10:24,785 --> 01:10:26,439
I may still do that,
I don't know.

1585
01:10:26,613 --> 01:10:28,833
- We're still building, so...
- We were gonna do taller,

1586
01:10:29,007 --> 01:10:30,847
but it's not gonna be
as beautiful as this one.

1587
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:32,445
It's most important what
is inside

1588
01:10:32,619 --> 01:10:34,230
than what was gonna be outside.

1589
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:36,362
<i>Trump's vision is shared
by his wife, Ivana,</i>

1590
01:10:36,536 --> 01:10:38,973
<i>a former fashion model
turned interior designer.</i>

1591
01:10:39,147 --> 01:10:40,366
Like, come over here.

1592
01:10:41,149 --> 01:10:43,108
The floor, the floor is gonna
be pink marble.

1593
01:10:43,282 --> 01:10:44,607
Gonna be pink marble,
I'm gonna bring

1594
01:10:44,631 --> 01:10:46,372
a whole mountain from Italy.

1595
01:10:46,546 --> 01:10:49,375
Ivana's gonna design the floors,
I'm gonna design the ceilings.

1596
01:10:49,549 --> 01:10:52,378
<i>But it's his feud
with outspoken Mayor Ed Koch</i>

1597
01:10:52,552 --> 01:10:55,076
<i>that may make him best known
to New Yorkers.</i>

1598
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,166
Well, he's a one-line artist,
uh, I, I mean, you know,

1599
01:10:58,341 --> 01:10:59,821
uh, when it
<i>comes to running the city,</i>

1600
01:10:59,994 --> 01:11:01,779
<i>he's about as bad
as anybody I've seen.</i>

1601
01:11:01,953 --> 01:11:04,521
<i>I would say he's got no talent
and only moderate intelligence.</i>

1602
01:11:06,653 --> 01:11:10,091
Is this an appropriate way to
talk about an elected official?

1603
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:13,051
Ed Koch has been a disaster
for New York and, uh,

1604
01:11:13,225 --> 01:11:14,792
he's done a lousy job
as the mayor.

1605
01:11:14,966 --> 01:11:16,533
Anybody that lives in New York
knows it.

1606
01:11:16,707 --> 01:11:18,747
And people understand that
in order to be successful

1607
01:11:18,796 --> 01:11:20,426
you have to have
a certain instinct to win.

1608
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:23,888
Donald, you're a mover,
you are a doer.

1609
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:27,457
If you could make America
perfect, how would you do it?

1610
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:31,939
Well, I think that America's
a country that has tremendous,

1611
01:11:32,113 --> 01:11:34,377
tremendous potential. I think
that much like the mind,

1612
01:11:34,551 --> 01:11:37,293
I think America's using very,
very little of its potential.

1613
01:11:37,467 --> 01:11:39,686
I really feel that. But I also
feel that it's a country

1614
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:43,211
that gets no respect
from other countries.

1615
01:11:43,386 --> 01:11:45,388
None. Zero.

1616
01:11:45,562 --> 01:11:48,608
And uh, and that's a shame,
isn't it?

1617
01:11:49,696 --> 01:11:52,699
Tell me this, what if you lost
your fortune today?

1618
01:11:52,873 --> 01:11:54,673
What would you do?
- Well, then maybe I'll run

1619
01:11:54,701 --> 01:11:57,356
for president, I don't know.
- Well, you'd do very well.

1620
01:11:57,748 --> 01:11:59,668
Well, I'm only kidding obviously
when I say that,

1621
01:11:59,837 --> 01:12:02,492
I'm just being facetious, but...
- No, it's a good answer.

1622
01:12:08,715 --> 01:12:10,171
Listen, you're gonna love
Atlantic City.

1623
01:12:10,195 --> 01:12:12,328
I got this guy Sullivan,
uh, he's a killer.

1624
01:12:14,504 --> 01:12:16,767
Simon! Find a way
through, alright?

1625
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:18,246
We gotta get to the heliport.

1626
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:19,857
Oh, it's that gay cancer.

1627
01:12:24,644 --> 01:12:27,299
He just wiped his face all over
the fucking glass.

1628
01:12:28,779 --> 01:12:30,563
Get out of my face.

1629
01:12:30,737 --> 01:12:32,173
Run 'em over, Simon.

1630
01:12:33,174 --> 01:12:34,350
Come on, Simon!

1631
01:12:35,002 --> 01:12:36,002
I'm kidding.

1632
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:48,668
Atlantic City
is just beginning.

1633
01:12:48,929 --> 01:12:52,063
It's virtually untouched land.

1634
01:12:52,237 --> 01:12:53,499
There's so much potential.

1635
01:12:53,673 --> 01:12:55,588
Atlantic City has peaked,
Donald.

1636
01:12:55,762 --> 01:12:57,242
Once other states
legalise gaming,

1637
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:59,157
you'll have competition
lining up,

1638
01:12:59,331 --> 01:13:01,048
plus you don't know the first
thing about running a casino.

1639
01:13:01,072 --> 01:13:02,658
I know a lot about running
a casino, Roy.

1640
01:13:02,682 --> 01:13:03,988
I'm not worried about that.

1641
01:13:04,162 --> 01:13:05,357
Why don't you finish
Trump Tower first?

1642
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,165
Done. Basically finished.

1643
01:13:07,339 --> 01:13:09,012
I think your balls
are swelling a little too much.

1644
01:13:09,036 --> 01:13:10,342
It's gonna be fine, Roy.

1645
01:13:10,647 --> 01:13:12,997
You gotta... you gotta think
about the future.

1646
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:15,913
The future's coming.
The future's here right now.

1647
01:13:16,087 --> 01:13:18,655
- I am think...
- The future is in Atlantic City.

1648
01:13:30,318 --> 01:13:32,451
I see now, this is what
a goldmine looks like.

1649
01:13:32,669 --> 01:13:34,714
In human flesh.
- Unbelievable.

1650
01:13:34,888 --> 01:13:36,020
Unbelievable, huh?

1651
01:13:36,194 --> 01:13:36,803
People see what
you're building...

1652
01:13:36,977 --> 01:13:37,977
He's excited.

1653
01:13:38,109 --> 01:13:39,189
You know how excited he is?

1654
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:39,937
Yeah. That's his excited face!

1655
01:13:42,287 --> 01:13:44,724
Woo! Hey, did you win?

1656
01:13:44,898 --> 01:13:47,423
Did you win?
You look like a winner.

1657
01:13:47,727 --> 01:13:49,250
- Where are you from?
- Georgia.

1658
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,817
Georgia's my favourite.

1659
01:13:51,383 --> 01:13:52,665
- There she is.
- How many machines?

1660
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:53,689
67 machines.

1661
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:54,517
Well, we're gonna put in

1662
01:13:54,691 --> 01:13:56,170
3,000, alright?

1663
01:13:56,344 --> 01:13:57,539
And then we'll pack every
grandma in the world

1664
01:13:57,563 --> 01:13:58,803
in this place.

1665
01:13:58,956 --> 01:14:00,516
We're gonna suck this place dry.
- Yeah!

1666
01:14:00,653 --> 01:14:02,414
Applying for a gaming licence
is gonna take, uh,

1667
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,459
eight, ten months minimum.
- Not if you're this guy.

1668
01:14:04,483 --> 01:14:05,702
See, they're always losing.

1669
01:14:05,876 --> 01:14:07,156
They're always losing
back there.

1670
01:14:07,225 --> 01:14:08,487
Look, this, this uh,

1671
01:14:08,661 --> 01:14:10,533
this place
is about as much Las Vegas

1672
01:14:10,707 --> 01:14:13,120
- as my Aunt Libby is Grace Kelly.
- Fantastic is what it is.

1673
01:14:13,144 --> 01:14:14,424
It's gonna better
than Las Vegas.

1674
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,713
It's totally cheap and grubby

1675
01:14:16,887 --> 01:14:18,454
and it's gonna be bad
for your brand.

1676
01:14:18,628 --> 01:14:19,909
Roy, you know, you're being so
negative all the...

1677
01:14:19,933 --> 01:14:23,023
What is this? Is this free food?
Wow.

1678
01:14:23,284 --> 01:14:24,808
Uh, I might have to
get in there.

1679
01:14:25,286 --> 01:14:26,853
Cheese balls over here.

1680
01:14:27,288 --> 01:14:29,769
Hoo-hoo, they look nice and hot.

1681
01:14:30,117 --> 01:14:31,771
- What are you doing?
- You want one?

1682
01:14:31,945 --> 01:14:33,643
No, it looks totally disgusting.

1683
01:14:33,817 --> 01:14:35,296
Cheese balls.

1684
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,560
Listen, what do you think
about midget boxing?

1685
01:14:37,734 --> 01:14:39,257
I think people will love it.

1686
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:41,471
I don't think very much
about midget boxing, Donald.

1687
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,130
When I do Trump Tower,
people love it.

1688
01:14:43,304 --> 01:14:45,045
Everything I do is turning
to gold, alright?

1689
01:14:45,219 --> 01:14:46,588
Everything's gonna work out.
It's fine.

1690
01:14:46,612 --> 01:14:48,266
But this is, this is not
a goldmine.

1691
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,748
You're expanding too fast, okay?
- Oh, here we go.

1692
01:14:51,922 --> 01:14:54,577
You're gonna be overleveraged
and you're gonna have debt, uh,

1693
01:14:54,751 --> 01:14:56,927
up to your ears
and I don't advise it.

1694
01:14:57,971 --> 01:14:59,930
I know what I'm doing, okay?

1695
01:15:00,452 --> 01:15:02,812
You've been negative the whole
day. I mean, what's going on?

1696
01:15:02,933 --> 01:15:04,282
Well, I'm getting a little tired

1697
01:15:04,456 --> 01:15:06,153
of you not listening
to me anymore.

1698
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:08,460
I do listen to you.
Just act a little bit more

1699
01:15:08,634 --> 01:15:10,636
like my attorney
and less like my dad,

1700
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,730
'cause I already got one,
he's a pain in the ass.

1701
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:18,731
Fine. You know, uh, you know
what lawyers do, Donald?

1702
01:15:19,297 --> 01:15:20,733
They charge their clients.

1703
01:15:24,432 --> 01:15:25,432
Okay.

1704
01:15:26,565 --> 01:15:27,565
Send me the bill.

1705
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:29,263
That make you feel better?

1706
01:15:29,437 --> 01:15:30,717
Good, fine.
I'll send you a bill.

1707
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:32,179
Great.

1708
01:15:32,745 --> 01:15:34,897
I can pay you, 'cause I have
money, 'cause I'm successful.

1709
01:15:34,921 --> 01:15:36,662
- Right.
- Alright?

1710
01:15:36,836 --> 01:15:38,118
- I'm sorry. Mr Trump?
- And, uh, who, who, who, uh...

1711
01:15:38,142 --> 01:15:39,578
Listen, I'm worried about you.

1712
01:15:40,753 --> 01:15:42,073
You're stressed,
you're sensitive.

1713
01:15:42,233 --> 01:15:43,277
I mean, what's going on?

1714
01:15:44,801 --> 01:15:45,845
Telephone for you.

1715
01:15:47,499 --> 01:15:48,499
Yes.

1716
01:15:50,023 --> 01:15:51,023
Mom.

1717
01:15:52,678 --> 01:15:53,678
What's going on?

1718
01:16:00,599 --> 01:16:01,599
What?

1719
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,564
When?

1720
01:16:16,789 --> 01:16:19,749
He maketh me lie down
in the green pastures,

1721
01:16:19,923 --> 01:16:22,012
he leadeth me beside
the still waters.

1722
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,231
He restoreth my soul.

1723
01:16:25,493 --> 01:16:27,974
He leadeth me in the path
of righteousness

1724
01:16:28,148 --> 01:16:30,455
for his name's sake.

1725
01:16:30,629 --> 01:16:33,240
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

1726
01:16:34,111 --> 01:16:36,243
I will fear no evil,

1727
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:37,723
for thou art with me.

1728
01:16:37,897 --> 01:16:40,334
Thy rod, thy staff,
they comfort me.

1729
01:16:42,467 --> 01:16:43,667
Preparest a table before me...

1730
01:16:46,732 --> 01:16:49,082
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

1731
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:51,780
Amen.

1732
01:17:25,031 --> 01:17:26,031
What?

1733
01:17:27,294 --> 01:17:28,513
I'm fine, Ivana.

1734
01:17:30,297 --> 01:17:31,603
You don't need to be fine.

1735
01:17:32,778 --> 01:17:33,778
Okay.

1736
01:17:38,958 --> 01:17:41,352
<i>Look at me.
Do you like what you see?</i>

1737
01:17:41,918 --> 01:17:45,661
<i>Good, because it's not me,
it's a recording of me...</i>

1738
01:17:51,014 --> 01:17:52,014
Hey...

1739
01:17:56,193 --> 01:17:59,065
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- You don't need to be fine.

1740
01:17:59,239 --> 01:18:01,807
I'm fine. Stop! Don't!

1741
01:18:01,981 --> 01:18:04,636
Don't fucking...
Don't fucking come near me!

1742
01:18:12,905 --> 01:18:14,994
It's gonna be okay, Donald.

1743
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:19,346
Donald...

1744
01:18:32,969 --> 01:18:36,059
Please stop looking at me,
and stop touching me.

1745
01:18:45,895 --> 01:18:48,941
"Always On My Mind" by
Pet Shop Boys

1746
01:18:58,124 --> 01:18:59,473
Hello. Thank you.

1747
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,915
Mr Trump, how does it feel
to be the golden boy

1748
01:19:06,089 --> 01:19:07,220
of New York City?

1749
01:19:07,394 --> 01:19:08,787
Fantastic. I feel great.

1750
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:10,049
Just fantastic. Thank you.

1751
01:19:18,275 --> 01:19:19,667
Is it glamorous
or is it glamorous?

1752
01:19:19,842 --> 01:19:21,362
- I think it's glamorous.
- What is it?

1753
01:19:21,495 --> 01:19:22,690
When you're willing to spend
the kind of money

1754
01:19:22,714 --> 01:19:23,976
that I've spent...

1755
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:26,196
Are you gonna perform tonight?
Great.

1756
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:27,458
Smile.

1757
01:19:30,591 --> 01:19:32,680
A lot of people said Trump Tower
could not be done,

1758
01:19:32,855 --> 01:19:34,813
and uh, in fact our loser mayor
tried everything

1759
01:19:34,987 --> 01:19:36,748
to deny the city this great
building, and he's lost.

1760
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,034
He's simply lost.

1761
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:39,644
We've got the best people
buying in;

1762
01:19:39,818 --> 01:19:41,187
Carson, Spielberg,
Prince Charles and Diana.

1763
01:19:41,211 --> 01:19:42,734
Everybody wants a piece
of Trump.

1764
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:45,084
Fantastic, fantastic.
Oh, I think I see Mr Cohn!

1765
01:19:45,302 --> 01:19:46,627
- Oh, alright.
- How are you, Randy?

1766
01:19:46,651 --> 01:19:48,174
- Very well.
- Here he is.

1767
01:19:48,348 --> 01:19:50,022
- How you doing tonight?
- I'm good, I'm very excited.

1768
01:19:50,046 --> 01:19:51,656
It's, uh, very exciting.

1769
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,440
Call you.

1770
01:19:53,614 --> 01:19:55,921
I've never met anyone
who reminds me more of myself.

1771
01:19:56,095 --> 01:19:58,924
Donald, he's got grit,
he is, uh,

1772
01:19:59,098 --> 01:20:01,448
relentless in the pursuit
of perfection.

1773
01:20:01,622 --> 01:20:03,102
Look at this, it's a masterpiece

1774
01:20:03,276 --> 01:20:05,409
uh, marble waterfalls...

1775
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:07,846
Listen, I could've built it
taller than the Twin Towers,

1776
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,606
if I wanted.
- Gentlemen, enjoy your night.

1777
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:11,110
It's good
to see you, Randy.

1778
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:13,547
Donald, could, could I talk
to you for a minute?

1779
01:20:13,721 --> 01:20:15,177
- Yeah, sure. How are you?
- I've been trying to call you.

1780
01:20:15,201 --> 01:20:16,788
You look like shit.
Can I get an iced water?

1781
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,291
No. I know it's a bad time,
I just...

1782
01:20:18,465 --> 01:20:19,705
What's going on? Are you tired?

1783
01:20:19,771 --> 01:20:21,686
I'm just, uh, overworked,
is all.

1784
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:25,168
Alright. Well, maybe you should
try these.

1785
01:20:25,342 --> 01:20:26,386
What are those?

1786
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,085
Diet pills.
I got 'em from my doctor.

1787
01:20:29,259 --> 01:20:30,695
They're amazing for everything.

1788
01:20:30,869 --> 01:20:32,697
Energy, sleep.
I don't need to sleep anymore.

1789
01:20:33,176 --> 01:20:35,221
Are you, you sure
that's a good thing?

1790
01:20:35,569 --> 01:20:36,764
Well, I can't do deals
when I sleep,

1791
01:20:36,788 --> 01:20:38,529
so yeah, that's a good thing.

1792
01:20:38,703 --> 01:20:41,749
Listen, uh, I just, uh, I need
to ask you a little favour.

1793
01:20:41,924 --> 01:20:44,100
- Sure.
- I was wondering if you might

1794
01:20:44,665 --> 01:20:46,711
be able to put Russell up
at the Hyatt?

1795
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:49,061
Why?

1796
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:52,238
The country house is...
it's too cold for him.

1797
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,545
Uh, he has pneumonia.

1798
01:20:54,937 --> 01:20:56,329
Get him a blanket.

1799
01:20:57,113 --> 01:21:00,072
Russell's a good kid and he's,
he's very loyal, uh,

1800
01:21:00,246 --> 01:21:01,769
and it'd mean a lot to me.

1801
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:04,860
Listen, he never helped me,
but I'll do it for you,

1802
01:21:05,034 --> 01:21:06,339
no problem, alright?

1803
01:21:06,513 --> 01:21:07,645
Come over here for a second.

1804
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:11,170
- What?
- Do you think she looks good?

1805
01:21:11,257 --> 01:21:14,086
Oh sure. She looks
like a real beauty queen.

1806
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:17,046
I mean, every night she comes
home telling me what to do.

1807
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:19,135
I feel like I'm married
to a business partner.

1808
01:21:19,526 --> 01:21:22,268
I don't, I don't feel anything.
I look at her and it's, like...

1809
01:21:23,139 --> 01:21:24,270
Whatever.

1810
01:21:24,444 --> 01:21:25,764
At least I got her
to do her tits.

1811
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:27,012
Oh yeah?

1812
01:21:27,186 --> 01:21:28,405
They're amazing.

1813
01:21:29,275 --> 01:21:31,147
Ah, Akio-san!

1814
01:21:31,321 --> 01:21:33,062
- Hey, how are you?
- There you are.

1815
01:21:33,236 --> 01:21:35,476
Listen, uh, I want,
I want you to see this, uh...

1816
01:21:42,462 --> 01:21:44,682
What is it with Roy?
He always looks sick.

1817
01:21:46,205 --> 01:21:47,293
No, he's fine.

1818
01:21:47,772 --> 01:21:49,121
Wonderful to see you.

1819
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:50,906
Oh no, no...

1820
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,733
- How are you, huh?
- Wonderful.

1821
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,648
- What do you think?
- I love this lobby.

1822
01:21:54,822 --> 01:21:56,302
- I planned it myself.
- Oh...

1823
01:21:56,476 --> 01:21:57,956
Well, I let her do all
the easy stuff.

1824
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,109
- So, tell me, how do you like?
- Oh, I love it.

1825
01:22:01,133 --> 01:22:02,482
- How we doing, Dad?
- Oh, hey.

1826
01:22:02,656 --> 01:22:05,877
- How's the view?
- It's alright.

1827
01:22:06,051 --> 01:22:08,053
I wonder what the electric bill
is for that?

1828
01:22:08,227 --> 01:22:10,838
That, that seems impractical.

1829
01:22:11,013 --> 01:22:12,362
Don't worry about that, Dad.

1830
01:22:14,581 --> 01:22:16,409
You know what this reminds
me of?

1831
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:19,456
When I built, uh, Trump Tower
on Coney Island.

1832
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:20,892
Trump Village.

1833
01:22:21,153 --> 01:22:23,242
You built Trump Village,
I built Trump Tower.

1834
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:25,679
- Right.
- This is Trump Tower.

1835
01:22:25,853 --> 01:22:27,638
Right. That's what I meant.

1836
01:22:28,682 --> 01:22:31,903
But when I, when I built that
high rise in, uh,

1837
01:22:32,077 --> 01:22:33,861
in Trump Village, uh,

1838
01:22:34,036 --> 01:22:36,125
boats could see it
20 miles out to sea.

1839
01:22:36,299 --> 01:22:38,388
This is very different
than that, Dad, okay?

1840
01:22:38,562 --> 01:22:40,172
This is... this is
the big league.

1841
01:22:40,346 --> 01:22:42,566
- The big time.
- Oh, well.

1842
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:44,046
You know, um...

1843
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:48,180
I've been meaning to say,
you know, uh...

1844
01:22:48,441 --> 01:22:51,792
I know that I've been tough
on you, right?

1845
01:22:52,837 --> 01:22:55,492
But look at you now, huh?

1846
01:22:56,058 --> 01:22:58,103
You're a killer. A king.

1847
01:22:58,756 --> 01:22:59,756
Right?

1848
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,500
Right?

1849
01:23:05,067 --> 01:23:06,459
Mm.

1850
01:23:08,635 --> 01:23:09,635
Mm.

1851
01:23:13,727 --> 01:23:14,859
Try some caviar.

1852
01:23:15,555 --> 01:23:16,556
It's the best.

1853
01:23:25,217 --> 01:23:26,392
You're gorgeous.

1854
01:24:07,868 --> 01:24:08,868
Hey.

1855
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:14,658
I got you a gift.

1856
01:24:25,886 --> 01:24:27,323
The G-spot.

1857
01:24:27,975 --> 01:24:29,847
The G-spot.

1858
01:24:33,503 --> 01:24:35,423
"Experiment with your G-spot
as you may have done

1859
01:24:35,592 --> 01:24:37,811
with your clitoris,
and if and when you learn

1860
01:24:37,985 --> 01:24:41,989
to masturbate that way..."
Oh, that's... great.

1861
01:24:42,338 --> 01:24:44,340
That's, uh, great.

1862
01:24:46,342 --> 01:24:48,996
- Wanna go upstairs?
- Listen, uh...

1863
01:24:49,693 --> 01:24:51,912
I gotta tell you, I'm, uh...

1864
01:24:53,697 --> 01:24:54,959
What? Tell me.

1865
01:24:55,133 --> 01:24:57,179
I'm just not attracted
to you anymore.

1866
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:02,097
Donald...

1867
01:25:04,403 --> 01:25:06,971
Really, I mean,
every time I, uh,

1868
01:25:07,624 --> 01:25:09,321
kiss you I feel like, you know,

1869
01:25:10,975 --> 01:25:12,585
it's my duty or something.

1870
01:25:12,759 --> 01:25:15,153
I mean, it's, uh...
- Donald...

1871
01:25:15,327 --> 01:25:16,807
And I'm touching you,
I'm touching

1872
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:19,723
those fake plastic tits.
I mean, I feel weird.

1873
01:25:19,897 --> 01:25:21,028
They were your idea.

1874
01:25:21,812 --> 01:25:22,813
You made me do it.

1875
01:25:22,987 --> 01:25:25,207
Well, maybe they were a mistake.

1876
01:25:27,644 --> 01:25:30,168
Donald. Donald...

1877
01:25:30,473 --> 01:25:32,170
Can you tell me
what is happening?

1878
01:25:32,823 --> 01:25:34,955
You are behaving like an animal
and you're hurting me.

1879
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,770
- Why are you doing this?
- Ivana, I, I...

1880
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:38,239
You don't care how
it makes me feel?

1881
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:39,663
Ivana, I'm just trying
to be honest.

1882
01:25:39,699 --> 01:25:41,440
I'm, I'm... really,
I'm telling you...

1883
01:25:41,614 --> 01:25:43,268
Oh my God. I don't know
what's happening.

1884
01:25:43,442 --> 01:25:45,072
Is it because of the stupid
pills that you're taking?

1885
01:25:45,096 --> 01:25:46,465
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I think what's happening is

1886
01:25:46,489 --> 01:25:47,929
you're getting a bit
of a bigger head

1887
01:25:47,968 --> 01:25:49,408
because you're forgetting
your story.

1888
01:25:49,492 --> 01:25:51,189
- You came over here to...
- My story?

1889
01:25:51,363 --> 01:25:53,974
from Eastern Czechoslo-fucking-
vakia or whatever the fuck it is

1890
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,629
and you married me.
- And where did you come, Donnie?

1891
01:25:56,803 --> 01:25:59,154
Where did you come from, hm?
Queens.

1892
01:25:59,328 --> 01:26:02,592
Have you looked at yourself
in the mirror, huh? Have you?

1893
01:26:02,766 --> 01:26:05,464
- I have. What's your point?
- Your face look like an orange.

1894
01:26:05,638 --> 01:26:07,423
- Okay, okay.
- And you're getting fat.

1895
01:26:07,597 --> 01:26:09,207
- Right.
- You're getting ugly!

1896
01:26:09,381 --> 01:26:10,837
You're a rude and terrible,
terrible person.

1897
01:26:10,861 --> 01:26:12,381
You're getting bald!
You're disgusting!

1898
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:14,778
Bald?! I'm not fucking bald!

1899
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,171
Uh!

1900
01:26:17,955 --> 01:26:19,261
Oh, fuck!

1901
01:26:19,435 --> 01:26:20,435
Donald!

1902
01:26:20,914 --> 01:26:22,655
Fuck!

1903
01:26:24,918 --> 01:26:26,442
Donald!

1904
01:26:27,965 --> 01:26:30,750
Am I fucking on that G-spot?
Huh?

1905
01:26:30,924 --> 01:26:33,927
Is that your G-spot? Huh?

1906
01:26:34,101 --> 01:26:37,540
Did I find it?
Did I fucking find it? Huh?

1907
01:26:37,714 --> 01:26:39,672
How does that feel?
Does that feel good?

1908
01:26:39,977 --> 01:26:41,587
Huh?

1909
01:26:41,761 --> 01:26:43,241
Yeah...

1910
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:53,425
<i>Two new casinos
in Atlantic City</i>

1911
01:26:53,599 --> 01:26:55,427
<i>in just two years.</i>

1912
01:26:55,601 --> 01:26:59,170
<i>Donald Trump has been on
an impressive shopping spree.</i>

1913
01:26:59,344 --> 01:27:02,739
<i>There seem to be no limits
to the expansion of his empire.</i>

1914
01:27:02,913 --> 01:27:04,349
Japan? It's the best.

1915
01:27:04,523 --> 01:27:06,283
A lot of money,
a lot of money in Japan, huh?

1916
01:27:06,351 --> 01:27:09,224
<i>From the sea to the sky,</i>

1917
01:27:09,398 --> 01:27:12,270
<i>some say the age of Trump
has begun.</i>

1918

Trump Tower, Trump City,
Trump Plaza, Trump Castle.

1919
01:27:15,578 --> 01:27:17,208
- Does ego come into it?
- It sells, Mike, it sells.

1920
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:19,538
It has nothing to do
with the ego, it sells.

1921
01:27:20,713 --> 01:27:23,368
Here he comes, folks.
DJT!

1922
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:30,723
Wow, so many people here.
I can't believe it.

1923
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:32,812
- How's it going, Dan?
- Ah...

1924
01:27:42,169 --> 01:27:44,235
It's all thanks to my wife.
She's a hell of a manager.

1925
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,956
She even cleans
the floors herself.

1926
01:27:47,523 --> 01:27:48,523
He's so funny.

1927
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:51,527
We've got record numbers, alright?

1928
01:27:51,701 --> 01:27:53,572
We'll talk.
You're gonna be very happy.

1929
01:27:53,746 --> 01:27:54,530
Very happy.

Nothing, nothing.

01:28:20,425 --> 01:28:21,861
Nothing, I'm just, uh...

1941
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,429
I'm so overwhelmed, you know.
I've got a lot going on,

1942
01:28:24,603 --> 01:28:26,581
you know, these people are
crawling up my ass down there.

1943
01:28:26,605 --> 01:28:28,540
We got these coin machines.
they're supposed to wait

1944
01:28:28,564 --> 01:28:31,088
eight hours, they've gotta
replace 'em in two hours.

1945
01:28:31,262 --> 01:28:32,979
There's never been people
that are playing that fast

1946
01:28:33,003 --> 01:28:34,091
and that hard.

1947
01:28:35,048 --> 01:28:37,224
Like I told you, fellas,
we're gonna be number one.

1948
01:28:37,399 --> 01:28:38,799
Number one, nobody competes
with it.

1949
01:28:38,922 --> 01:28:40,378
Donald, we need to talk
about the figures...

1950
01:28:40,402 --> 01:28:41,683
And by the way,
here's the difference.

1951
01:28:41,707 --> 01:28:43,100
We're talking about
Atlantic City,

1952
01:28:43,274 --> 01:28:45,276
not Las Vegas. Great job.
- Donald...

1953
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:46,949
Wait, what do we have
in Atlantic City?

1954
01:28:46,973 --> 01:28:48,148
We've got the ocean!

1955
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:49,865
We've got the ocean right here, fellas.

1956
01:28:49,889 --> 01:28:51,609
We're gonna also make
this the boxing mecca.

1957
01:28:51,674 --> 01:28:53,652
I was talking to Don King
about bringing Mike Tyson

1958
01:28:53,676 --> 01:28:55,417
and various, uh, situations
over here

1959
01:28:55,591 --> 01:28:57,438
because that's gonna be a lot
of money, you know what I mean?

1960
01:28:57,462 --> 01:28:58,874
I think like a prize fighter.
I don't like to tell people

1961
01:28:58,898 --> 01:29:00,596
where I wanna go,
what I wanna do.

1962
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:02,356
I wanna just roll with the
punches, you know what I mean?

1963
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:04,184
And I think that's gonna be good
for Atlantic City.

1964
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:06,055
That's great, but we've been
hearing the exact same thing

1965
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:08,952
since you nearly defaulted on
your loan payment last quarter.

1966
01:29:09,126 --> 01:29:10,364
Yeah, but there's never been
anything like this

1967
01:29:10,388 --> 01:29:11,998
of this magnitude, this quality.

1968
01:29:12,172 --> 01:29:13,759
The Taj Mahal's gonna be
the eighth wonder of the...

1969
01:29:13,783 --> 01:29:15,583
Alright, you listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

1970
01:29:15,698 --> 01:29:17,264
If you don't make
a goddamn payment

1971
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:18,918
by the end of this month,

1972
01:29:19,092 --> 01:29:21,138
my bankruptcy attorneys
are gonna be up your ass.

1973
01:29:21,486 --> 01:29:23,053
My credit is good,
my credit is solid

1974
01:29:23,227 --> 01:29:24,907
and you fellas have nothing
to worry about.

1975
01:29:25,055 --> 01:29:26,317
Last warning, Donald.

1976
01:29:26,491 --> 01:29:27,884
I've got people to answer to.

1977
01:29:39,112 --> 01:29:40,723
Do you gamble, Roger?

1978
01:29:40,897 --> 01:29:42,614
You like to gamble, huh?
Play a little slot machine?

1979
01:29:42,638 --> 01:29:44,093
I like to make money,
not lose it.

1980
01:29:44,117 --> 01:29:45,530
Well, let me tell you something.
There's gonna be

1981
01:29:45,554 --> 01:29:47,009
a lot of grandmothers
in Atlantic City

1982
01:29:47,033 --> 01:29:48,141
that are gonna be very happy
with that.

1983
01:29:48,165 --> 01:29:49,340
- Oh yeah.
- Okay?

1984
01:29:49,514 --> 01:29:51,908
- The budget, $1 billion.
- Wow!

1985
01:29:52,082 --> 01:29:54,476
- Yeah, you gotta come stay.
- Very Eastern flair, huh?

1986
01:29:54,911 --> 01:29:56,608
- This is something.
- Well, it is, it is.

1987
01:29:56,782 --> 01:29:58,044
Yes?

1988
01:29:58,218 --> 01:29:59,263
I've got Roy on the phone.

1989
01:29:59,437 --> 01:30:01,004
Uh, tell him I'll call him back.

1990
01:30:01,178 --> 01:30:02,634
Listen, Reagan's making
this country so fucking rich,

1991
01:30:02,658 --> 01:30:03,876
you can't lose!
- Well...

1992
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:05,443
I'm telling you, Donald!

1993
01:30:05,704 --> 01:30:07,247
Yeah, he stands for all
the things you care about.

1994
01:30:07,271 --> 01:30:09,012
Lower taxes,
cutting regulations.

1995
01:30:09,926 --> 01:30:11,806
- A powerful military...
- Well, I, I like that.

1996
01:30:11,841 --> 01:30:13,732
- Like it used to be. Right?
- Yes, we need that.

1997
01:30:13,756 --> 01:30:15,322
- We do.
- We need that.

1998
01:30:15,497 --> 01:30:17,499
Hey, in fact, we have a brand
new campaign slogan.

1999
01:30:17,673 --> 01:30:18,717
Listen to this.

2000
01:30:19,065 --> 01:30:22,765
"Let's make America
great again."

2001
01:30:23,374 --> 01:30:24,374
Wow.

2002
01:30:26,246 --> 01:30:27,857
Hm.

2003
01:30:28,031 --> 01:30:29,380
Well, I like the 'again' part.

2004
01:30:29,554 --> 01:30:31,077
You know, it points
to a great past.

2005
01:30:31,382 --> 01:30:33,253
It does. Not many people
see that.

2006
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,517
Well, I do, okay?
'Cause I love this country,

2007
01:30:35,691 --> 01:30:38,084
and I'm tired of seeing
this country getting ripped off

2008
01:30:38,258 --> 01:30:39,477
like you wouldn't believe.

2009
01:30:39,651 --> 01:30:41,610
It's losing $200 billion
a year, Roger.

2010
01:30:41,784 --> 01:30:43,612
$200 billion.
Does Reagan know that?

2011
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,920
'Cause all these, these oil
sheikhs, and the Japs,

2012
01:30:45,962 --> 01:30:47,505
and the welfare queens,
and the union thugs,

2013
01:30:47,529 --> 01:30:49,049
they're sucking us dry.
- You're right.

2014
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:50,769
It's time to get smart and it's
time to get tough,

2015
01:30:50,793 --> 01:30:51,944
because otherwise there's not
gonna be a country

2016
01:30:51,968 --> 01:30:53,248
and there's not gonna be
a world.

2017
01:30:53,317 --> 01:30:54,637
- And you know who's tough?
- You.

2018
01:30:54,753 --> 01:30:56,276
The Soviets. They get it,
believe me.

2019
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:57,930
You're talking about tough
and strong

2020
01:30:58,104 --> 01:30:59,845
Listen, you want me to read,
you know,

2021
01:31:00,019 --> 01:31:01,649
about the missiles, it's gonna
take me an hour and a half.

2022
01:31:01,673 --> 01:31:03,414
I probably know most
of that anyway, so...

2023
01:31:03,588 --> 01:31:05,740
Donald, I'm telling you, I,
I love how passionate you are.

2024
01:31:05,764 --> 01:31:07,307
Have you thought about
running for office?

2025
01:31:07,331 --> 01:31:08,743
Well, look,
I'd run very well, right?

2026
01:31:08,767 --> 01:31:10,334
I mean, but uh, no, no.

2027
01:31:10,508 --> 01:31:12,118
- No?
- Come on, Roger,

2028
01:31:12,292 --> 01:31:14,270
let me tell you something.
Government is for losers.

2029
01:31:14,294 --> 01:31:15,905
- Come on, you'd do great!
- Hey...

2030
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:17,733
I know politicians, Roger, okay?

2031
01:31:17,907 --> 01:31:20,170
I know politicians better than
anyone, and some of them

2032
01:31:20,344 --> 01:31:22,825
are smart, very few, but most
are dumber than a rock.

2033
01:31:22,999 --> 01:31:24,522
Let's be honest, okay?

2034
01:31:24,696 --> 01:31:26,631
I give money to politicians
so they do what I want.

2035
01:31:26,655 --> 01:31:28,831
They're all very corrupt
and stupid, okay?

2036
01:31:29,005 --> 01:31:30,645
And you know that, Rog.
But you know what?

2037
01:31:30,746 --> 01:31:32,443
I'd love a blow job
on Air Force One.

2038
01:31:32,617 --> 01:31:34,297
I think that'd be
pretty fabulous, alright.

2039
01:31:34,445 --> 01:31:35,881
Hey, I'm sure
it's happened before.

2040
01:31:36,055 --> 01:31:38,207
- Can you make that happen? Huh?
- Yeah, well, hey, hey,

2041
01:31:38,231 --> 01:31:39,929
call me if you change
your mind, okay?

2042
01:31:40,103 --> 01:31:41,602
Well, listen, you get me on
that Air Force One, we'll talk.

2043
01:31:41,626 --> 01:31:43,106
- Okay.
- Alright.

2044
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,692
Tell Ronnie he's got my support.

2045
01:31:44,716 --> 01:31:46,326
- You got it.
- Hang on one second. Yes?

2046
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,479
- Uh, Roy's on the phone again.
- I'll call him later.

2047
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:49,939
- Yeah.
- Anyway...

2048
01:31:50,113 --> 01:31:52,332
Hey, uh, Donald, before I go,
have you, uh,

2049
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:54,726
have you seen Roy lately?
- Uh...

2050
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:58,121
No, I'm gonna call him back and,
uh, we're gonna talk. Why?

2051
01:31:58,295 --> 01:31:59,296
You haven't heard?

2052
01:31:59,905 --> 01:32:01,211
Heard what?

2053
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:04,910
Well, uh, Russell has AIDS.

2054
01:32:05,084 --> 01:32:06,608
- He's sick as a dog.
- Mm.

2055
01:32:08,305 --> 01:32:10,220
That's, uh... wow,
that's terrible.

2056
01:32:10,394 --> 01:32:11,787
Hey, he still your lawyer?

2057
01:32:12,309 --> 01:32:13,615
Well, he's not my lawyer per se.

2058
01:32:13,789 --> 01:32:15,201
I mean, I have a number
of attorneys, right?

2059
01:32:15,225 --> 01:32:16,245
Different lawyers,
different things.

2060
01:32:16,269 --> 01:32:17,836
- Mm.
- But, um...

2061
01:32:18,228 --> 01:32:20,709
- That's really terrible, Roger.
- Yeah, yeah.

2062
01:32:20,883 --> 01:32:22,232
Well, the world's a mess.

2063
01:32:22,406 --> 01:32:23,712
- Goodbye Donald.
- Yep.

2064
01:32:29,065 --> 01:32:30,065
Fiona?

2065
01:32:34,984 --> 01:32:35,984
Come over here.

2066
01:32:37,421 --> 01:32:38,553
Uh...

2067
01:32:39,336 --> 01:32:40,555
what did Roy say?

2068
01:32:41,338 --> 01:32:43,470
Not too much, but he's called
three times.

2069
01:32:44,471 --> 01:32:45,647
Does he sound sick?

2070
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,432
Little bit, yeah.
He's got a cough.

2071
01:32:49,476 --> 01:32:51,076
Alright, if he calls again,
just tell him

2072
01:32:51,217 --> 01:32:53,217
I'm out of the office, alright?
And if he shows up,

2073
01:32:53,306 --> 01:32:57,267
put him in the conference room
by himself, okay?

2074
01:32:57,441 --> 01:32:59,182
- Will that be all?
- That's it, thank you.

2075
01:33:21,204 --> 01:33:22,485
- Hey, thank you very much.
- Donald!

2076
01:33:22,509 --> 01:33:23,859
Roy!

2077
01:33:24,033 --> 01:33:25,295
Long time no see.

2078
01:33:25,469 --> 01:33:27,471
Is this some kind
of a goddamn joke?

2079
01:33:27,819 --> 01:33:28,864
What is that?

2080
01:33:29,299 --> 01:33:30,996
This? This is how you thank me?

2081
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:33,999
The manager at the Hyatt
kicked Russell out.

2082
01:33:34,347 --> 01:33:36,132
Alright, that's probably
a mistake.

2083
01:33:36,306 --> 01:33:38,308
Oh, fuck you, Donald!

2084
01:33:39,309 --> 01:33:40,353
Fuck you!

2085
01:33:41,093 --> 01:33:43,052
Uh, your office
sent me the bill.

2086
01:33:43,792 --> 01:33:46,098
- It's a mistake.
- Don't you try me.

2087
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:48,535
Remember who taught you
this stuff.

2088
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:50,886
I'll call 'em, alright?
I'll just, uh, I'll fix it.

2089
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:54,803
You ungrateful fucking
cock-sucking nobody!

2090
01:33:56,979 --> 01:33:59,024
- Roy...
- I made you.

2091
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:01,244
Don't you forget that.
I made you.

2092
01:34:01,418 --> 01:34:02,941
I'm pretty sure
I made myself, okay.

2093
01:34:03,115 --> 01:34:04,745
- Uh, no. You were a loser then,
- Hey, listen, listen...

2094
01:34:04,769 --> 01:34:06,858
- and you're still a loser!
- Okay, Roy, listen,

2095
01:34:07,032 --> 01:34:08,381
I'm running a business
here, okay?

2096
01:34:08,555 --> 01:34:10,229
Guests complained about
Russell's condition,

2097
01:34:10,253 --> 01:34:11,994
which you lied about,
by the way, alright?

2098
01:34:12,168 --> 01:34:13,299
So that's what happened.

2099
01:34:14,736 --> 01:34:15,737
It's not my fault.

2100
01:34:17,956 --> 01:34:19,697
What are you, what are you
trying to say?

2101
01:34:19,871 --> 01:34:22,308
I hear he's sick. Really sick.

2102
01:34:22,482 --> 01:34:23,919
Yeah, he's got pneumonia.

2103
01:34:24,093 --> 01:34:25,533
- He's got pneumonia?
- That's right.

2104
01:34:25,616 --> 01:34:27,115
Is that the name for it
now on the street?

2105
01:34:27,139 --> 01:34:28,575
Watch out. Maybe you'll get it.

2106
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:30,229
You know, you don't want that.

2107
01:34:32,231 --> 01:34:33,450
What, are you scared of me?

2108
01:34:33,798 --> 01:34:35,017
No, just...

2109
01:34:35,191 --> 01:34:36,551
- Little cold out, you know.
- Huh.

2110
01:34:42,851 --> 01:34:44,896
Good to see that you have, uh,

2111
01:34:45,767 --> 01:34:49,292
lost the last traces of, uh,
decency you once had.

2112
01:34:49,858 --> 01:34:52,425
Well, I learned from the best,
Roy, what can I say?

2113
01:34:52,599 --> 01:34:53,688
I love you too.

2114
01:35:02,827 --> 01:35:04,394
You've got some feelings
now suddenly?

2115
01:35:04,568 --> 01:35:05,830
You're the fucking devil!

2116
01:35:06,004 --> 01:35:07,614
I don't recognise you anymore, okay?

2117
01:35:07,789 --> 01:35:09,288
You're the fucking devil!
Get the fuck out of here!

2118
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:11,140
- You scare me.
- You fucking old man!

2119
01:35:11,314 --> 01:35:12,141
You're no saint.

2120
01:35:12,315 --> 01:35:13,359
You're not God.

2121
01:35:17,189 --> 01:35:18,713
Why don't you go save him?

2122
01:35:19,801 --> 01:35:20,976
Save him over there.

2123
01:35:22,499 --> 01:35:23,848
Don't get sick, Roy!

2124
01:35:41,126 --> 01:35:44,739
- Dad! There's the big man.
- Oh!

2125
01:35:44,913 --> 01:35:46,629
- Look at this guy, huh?
- Ah, hey, how are you?

2126
01:35:46,653 --> 01:35:47,935
- He looks great.
- Look at this guy!

2127
01:35:47,959 --> 01:35:49,352
You look good, Dad.
You look great.

2128
01:35:49,526 --> 01:35:51,528
- Ah, good.
- This is Erwin.

2129
01:35:51,702 --> 01:35:54,096
This man's got 195 IQ, alright?

2130
01:35:54,270 --> 01:35:56,098
The best. Erwin, where'd you
go to school?

2131
01:35:56,272 --> 01:35:57,795
- Columbia.
- Oh boy.

2132
01:35:57,969 --> 01:35:59,929
- He's a New Yorker!
- You're a smarty pants, huh?

2133
01:35:59,971 --> 01:36:02,278
- He's my new Roy Cohn.
- Oh.

2134
01:36:02,452 --> 01:36:04,236
Alright. Go ahead.
And listen, Dad,

2135
01:36:04,410 --> 01:36:06,410
I bought some land under
the Empire State Building.

2136
01:36:06,543 --> 01:36:08,588
- Oh boy.
- Erwin, you love the Empire

2137
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:10,218
State Building, right?
- The best building.

2138
01:36:10,242 --> 01:36:12,027
How many units can you put
in there?

2139
01:36:12,201 --> 01:36:14,594
Don't worry about it.
Listen, take a look at that.

2140
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:16,249
Erwin's got a couple of things
to say.

2141
01:36:16,335 --> 01:36:17,695
- Okay.
- Yeah, Mr Trump, my office

2142
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:19,948
had a request
relating to the trust.

2143
01:36:20,122 --> 01:36:22,994
This will allow us to avail
ourselves of some

2144
01:36:23,168 --> 01:36:25,954
new tax breaks and reduce
the overall, uh,

2145
01:36:26,128 --> 01:36:27,825
taxation on the trust.
- Okay, the trust.

2146
01:36:27,999 --> 01:36:30,567
So, with your signature here,
we'll be putting Donald in

2147
01:36:30,741 --> 01:36:33,439
as the trustee for the trust.
And that will allow you

2148
01:36:33,613 --> 01:36:35,766
to not have to worry yourself.
- Save you a lot of taxes, Dad.

2149
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,052
- Okay.
- Absolutely.

2150
01:36:37,226 --> 01:36:38,575
- For the trust.
- That's right.

2151
01:36:38,749 --> 01:36:41,099
- And you want me to sign here?
- Yes I do.

2152
01:36:41,273 --> 01:36:43,536
- Oh really?
- Mom, what are you doing?

2153
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:45,843
We don't have time.
I gotta get back into the city.

2154
01:36:46,017 --> 01:36:47,734
Listen Mom, we don't have time.
Dad, go ahead.

2155
01:36:47,758 --> 01:36:49,301
- Is that the tea?
- Please sign right there.

2156
01:36:49,325 --> 01:36:51,109
- This is for the...
- Donald, what is this?

2157
01:36:51,283 --> 01:36:52,826
- This is for the trust, Mary.
- Oh. Well, let me take a look.

2158
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:54,939
- For the, um...
- It's just a formality.

2159
01:36:55,113 --> 01:36:57,768
- But who are you?
- This is, this is my attorney.

2160
01:36:58,377 --> 01:37:01,685
- This is your siblings' trust.
- I understand, but listen...

2161
01:37:01,859 --> 01:37:03,818
You're jeopardising your,
your siblings' trust.

2162
01:37:03,992 --> 01:37:05,471
No, I'm not jeopardising
anything.

2163
01:37:05,645 --> 01:37:08,083
I have some loans, they need
to be guaranteed.

2164
01:37:08,257 --> 01:37:10,912
I gotta just get these Taiwan
bankers off my back.

2165
01:37:11,086 --> 01:37:12,391
- What...
- Okay?

2166
01:37:12,565 --> 01:37:14,365
I just need to show the bankers
that I'm good.

2167
01:37:14,872 --> 01:37:17,266
Your father
is a little confused.

2168
01:37:17,788 --> 01:37:21,487
He's not the right person
to be signing this document.

2169
01:37:21,748 --> 01:37:23,533
That's why we should have,

2170
01:37:23,794 --> 01:37:25,074
as you should know
as a lawyer...

2171
01:37:25,230 --> 01:37:26,928
- Mom.
- Sound mind deciding...

2172
01:37:27,102 --> 01:37:28,712
Who's gonna look after
this family, okay?

2173
01:37:28,886 --> 01:37:30,845
Who's gonna look after
this family when he,

2174
01:37:31,019 --> 01:37:33,021
when he can't fucking spell
his name?

2175
01:37:33,499 --> 01:37:36,894
- Language! Donald...
- Let's go Erwin, come on.

2176
01:37:37,068 --> 01:37:38,948
- Mom, you don't understand.
- What is the rush?

2177
01:37:39,592 --> 01:37:41,152
I'm looking out
for the family, alright?

2178
01:37:41,203 --> 01:37:42,876
- Language, Donald.
- I'm looking out for the family.

2179
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,922
I'm pretty much sure that nobody
else is doing that.

2180
01:37:44,946 --> 01:37:47,557
Not Elizabeth, not Mary,
not fucking Freddy...

2181
01:37:47,731 --> 01:37:51,648
No! You do not speak his name!

2182
01:37:51,822 --> 01:37:53,911
You have no right!

2183
01:37:54,085 --> 01:37:55,391
It's time for you to go.

2184
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:29,902
Okay, you need to stop
consuming these immediately.

2185
01:38:29,991 --> 01:38:31,311
I thought they were
like vitamins.

2186
01:38:31,427 --> 01:38:33,429
It's amphetamines.
It's cheap speed.

2187
01:38:33,603 --> 01:38:35,643
Erectile dysfunction's one
of the many side-effects.

2188
01:38:35,735 --> 01:38:37,615
I don't have that problem,
but, you know, I eat.

2189
01:38:37,781 --> 01:38:39,435
I mean, we all like to eat,
doc, right?

2190
01:38:39,609 --> 01:38:41,129
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, did you see this?

2191
01:38:41,219 --> 01:38:43,047
Are you seeing this?
It keeps growing.

2192
01:38:43,221 --> 01:38:45,286
Everything is growing, and I'm
not talking about my hair.

2193
01:38:45,310 --> 01:38:46,510
Well, have you tried exercise?

2194
01:38:46,616 --> 01:38:48,016
- No, no, absolutely not.
- Why not?

2195
01:38:48,139 --> 01:38:49,595
You know that's gonna kill you,
right, doc?

2196
01:38:49,619 --> 01:38:51,926
First of all, the body
is like a battery.

2197
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:53,623
It has finite energy,
it runs out.

2198
01:38:53,797 --> 01:38:56,843
- Okay. That's not true.
- That is totally the truth.

2199
01:38:57,018 --> 01:38:58,498
- Totally the truth.
- Okay. Donald...

2200
01:38:58,671 --> 01:39:00,717
And the problem that
I'm having is, I'm just...

2201
01:39:00,891 --> 01:39:02,980
I, I need to stop growing,
that's all.

2202
01:39:04,286 --> 01:39:06,418
Okay. We have surgical options.

2203
01:39:06,592 --> 01:39:08,768
- That sounds great.
- Okay, yeah.

2204
01:39:09,421 --> 01:39:13,164
So, with an incision
here, here and here...

2205
01:39:13,338 --> 01:39:15,906
we're gonna get rid of the, uh,
the ab fat

2206
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,880
and we're gonna get
the love handles gone too.

2207
01:39:17,995 --> 01:39:19,214
Oh, I hate the love handles.

2208
01:39:19,388 --> 01:39:20,519
What about my hair?

2209
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:24,871
Okay, you've got some male
pattern baldness. Um...

2210
01:39:25,046 --> 01:39:27,613
- And that's normal, right?
- It is, absolutely, okay?

2211
01:39:27,787 --> 01:39:29,006
But it doesn't have to be,

2212
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:29,876
you know?
- Okay.

2213
01:39:30,051 --> 01:39:30,877
You'll talk to our

2214
01:39:31,052 --> 01:39:32,053
in-house specialist.

2215
01:39:32,227 --> 01:39:33,706
About a scalp reduction?

2216
01:39:34,533 --> 01:39:35,882
We''re gonna cover
that up easily.

2217
01:39:36,057 --> 01:39:37,362
- Okay.
- Okay?

2218
01:39:37,536 --> 01:39:38,905
Getting old sucks.
Do you know what I mean?

2219
01:39:38,929 --> 01:39:40,211
- Yes.
- Do you ever feel that way?

2220
01:39:40,235 --> 01:39:42,063
Well, a lot of my patients do.

2221
01:39:42,237 --> 01:39:43,368
One more question.

2222
01:39:45,414 --> 01:39:46,850
What do you think about AIDS?

2223
01:39:47,546 --> 01:39:49,266
- What do...
- What do you think about AIDS?

2224
01:39:49,374 --> 01:39:51,526
- What do I think about it?
- Yeah. How do people get it?

2225
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:53,291
'Cause it's not just
homosexuals, doc.

2226
01:39:53,465 --> 01:39:54,466
- Right.
- You know?

2227
01:39:55,076 --> 01:39:58,253
The research indicates
HIV, uh, spreads

2228
01:39:58,427 --> 01:40:00,690
through the exchange of blood
or semen.

2229
01:40:00,864 --> 01:40:02,779
- Semen, yeah.
- Yes.

2230
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:04,476
Well, and what if they
touch you?

2231
01:40:04,781 --> 01:40:06,367
What if somebody touches you...
- That's okay.

2232
01:40:06,391 --> 01:40:07,716
- Or if they breathe on you?
- They can,

2233
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:08,959
they can breathe on you.

2234
01:40:09,177 --> 01:40:10,221
That's okay.

2235
01:40:11,396 --> 01:40:12,396
Okay.

2236
01:40:13,137 --> 01:40:15,270
The legal establishment
in the state of New York

2237
01:40:15,444 --> 01:40:18,751
wants to take away Roy Cohn's
licence to practice law.

2238
01:40:19,143 --> 01:40:21,798
<i>They say he's dishonest.
They want to disbar him</i>

2239
01:40:21,972 --> 01:40:25,106
<i>for allegedly playing fast
and loose with clients' money.</i>

2240
01:40:26,194 --> 01:40:27,282
<i>How are you, Roy?</i>

2241
01:40:27,717 --> 01:40:30,372
I'm terrific, uh, Mike.
It''s great to see you.

2242
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,240
This is what
the disciplinary committee

2243
01:40:32,374 --> 01:40:34,202
of the bar says about you.

2244
01:40:34,376 --> 01:40:37,118
<i>A total lack of moral character
and professional fitness,</i>

2245
01:40:37,292 --> 01:40:39,163
<i>and a cruel public use
of your illness.</i>

2246
01:40:39,337 --> 01:40:43,124
That's a pack of lies, because
I've never used my illness, uh,

2247
01:40:43,298 --> 01:40:44,864
<i>to plead for anything.</i>

2248
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:47,432
<i>I've called them a bunch
of yoyos, and, uh,</i>

2249
01:40:47,606 --> 01:40:49,869
<i>that's what they are, Mike.
They're a bunch of yoyos.</i>

2250
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:53,003
<i>Mm-hmm. When I tell friends
that I'm going to</i>

2251
01:40:53,177 --> 01:40:54,657
<i>do a profile on you,</i>

2252
01:40:54,874 --> 01:40:57,486
<i>the question on everyone's
mind is that,</i>

2253
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:59,531
<i>and I'm sure you know
what I'm going to say,</i>

2254
01:41:00,358 --> 01:41:02,317
<i>do you have AIDS?</i>

2255
01:41:02,491 --> 01:41:05,015
Oh. No. I mean, that's easy.

2256
01:41:05,929 --> 01:41:09,498
I have liver cancer, uh,
which, uh,

2257
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:14,459
<i>they found moves
in strange directions,</i>

2258
01:41:14,633 --> 01:41:15,852
<i>uh, but that...</i>

2259
01:41:16,026 --> 01:41:18,855
categorically I do not
have AIDS.

2260
01:41:19,029 --> 01:41:22,163
I'm sure you know why people ask
about AIDS, Roy Cohn,

2261
01:41:22,772 --> 01:41:24,904
because they believe
you're a homosexual.

2262
01:41:28,169 --> 01:41:29,735
Well, uh, that's a lie.

2263
01:41:30,736 --> 01:41:34,218
<i>Every facet of my personality,
my, uh,</i>

2264
01:41:34,392 --> 01:41:37,482
aggressiveness, my toughness,
and, uh,

2265
01:41:37,656 --> 01:41:39,789
everything along those lines,
is just

2266
01:41:39,963 --> 01:41:42,270
<i>totally, uh, incompatible...</i>

2267
01:42:13,692 --> 01:42:15,085
Hello, it's Roy.

2268
01:42:15,564 --> 01:42:17,522
<i>Roy, it's Donald. How are you?</i>

2269
01:42:20,569 --> 01:42:21,570
Donald.

2270
01:42:22,005 --> 01:42:23,224
<i>How are you?</i>

2271
01:42:23,659 --> 01:42:25,095
I'm great, how are you?

2272
01:42:28,881 --> 01:42:31,319
<i>Listen, I, I watched,
uh, Mike Wallace.</i>

2273
01:42:32,494 --> 01:42:34,713
Right. Well, how'd I do?

2274
01:42:35,758 --> 01:42:36,889
<i>You owned it.</i>

2275
01:42:39,588 --> 01:42:40,850
<i>Did I look, uh,</i>

2276
01:42:41,851 --> 01:42:42,939
did I look weak?

2277
01:42:43,113 --> 01:42:44,593
<i>Well, listen,</i>

2278
01:42:44,941 --> 01:42:46,464
he's an asshole, you know?

2279
01:42:46,638 --> 01:42:48,466
Frankly, he asked
nasty questions.

2280
01:42:49,424 --> 01:42:50,424
How's Russell?

2281
01:42:51,817 --> 01:42:53,950
Oh, uh, Russell died.

2282
01:42:54,733 --> 01:42:56,561
<i>I'm sorry, Roy. I didn't know.</i>

2283
01:43:07,703 --> 01:43:09,183
You're not sounding very good.

2284
01:43:11,968 --> 01:43:15,363
<i>New York is a mess.
I mean, these bankers, uh,</i>

2285
01:43:15,537 --> 01:43:16,537
<i>they got no feel</i>

2286
01:43:16,581 --> 01:43:17,974
for the deal, and, uh,

2287
01:43:18,148 --> 01:43:20,063
everyone's crawling up my ass
about the debt.

2288
01:43:20,237 --> 01:43:23,458
<i>Don't even get me started about
Ivana. I mean, she's a bitch.</i>

2289
01:43:23,849 --> 01:43:25,634
So, you thought, uh...

2290
01:43:26,722 --> 01:43:31,248
give old Roy a call and ask
for some free legal advice?

2291
01:43:32,075 --> 01:43:35,209
I mean, is there anyone better?
Come on.

2292
01:43:41,171 --> 01:43:42,477
<i>I miss you, Roy.</i>

2293
01:43:45,349 --> 01:43:47,003
You're the only guy that cared.

2294
01:43:48,222 --> 01:43:50,093
You're the only guy
that gave a shit

2295
01:43:51,790 --> 01:43:52,790
about me.

2296
01:43:57,492 --> 01:43:59,407
<i>Listen, I have this property
in Florida,</i>

2297
01:43:59,581 --> 01:44:01,428
<i>you're gonna love it.
I think you should come down.</i>

2298
01:44:01,452 --> 01:44:03,367
- Yeah?
<i>- Let's get you to the ocean.</i>

2299
01:44:08,677 --> 01:44:10,722
How do you feel, though?
You feel alright, no?

2300
01:44:11,462 --> 01:44:14,465
Oh, sure, I, I feel
like a million bucks.

2301
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:16,119
'Cause you don't look that bad.

2302
01:44:16,424 --> 01:44:18,556
You know, if I have my way,
I'll be as thin as you.

2303
01:44:19,253 --> 01:44:20,950
I'm gonna do this procedure.

2304
01:44:22,168 --> 01:44:25,433
You know, they, they suck
the fat from under your skin.

2305
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:28,914
And also, don't tell anybody,
but...

2306
01:44:30,394 --> 01:44:32,135
Might get 'em to remove
my bald patch.

2307
01:44:32,309 --> 01:44:37,749
You, uh, you look like the fella
from, uh, Miami Vice.

2308
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:39,969
Who dressed you,
for crying out loud?

2309
01:44:40,143 --> 01:44:42,014
It's this broad
I'm banging, Carly.

2310
01:44:42,188 --> 01:44:46,236
She has, uh...
great big natural tits.

2311
01:44:47,106 --> 01:44:50,066
Wanna see? Look at that.
Look at that.

2312
01:44:51,981 --> 01:44:53,112
She's a ten.

2313
01:44:57,682 --> 01:44:58,682
Okay.

2314
01:45:00,206 --> 01:45:01,793
It was built to be the winter
White House.

2315
01:45:01,817 --> 01:45:03,122
Wow.

2316
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:06,082
These walls are all
silk tapestries,

2317
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:09,390
and, uh, the ceiling
is all gold.

2318
01:45:09,781 --> 01:45:11,174
It's pretty impressive.

2319
01:45:11,348 --> 01:45:13,524
And they wanted a condo,
can you believe that?

2320
01:45:13,872 --> 01:45:16,135
What, uh, what happened
to your leg?

2321
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:18,442
I didn't pay 'em on time,
that's what happened.

2322
01:45:18,616 --> 01:45:21,315
Ivana wants to turn
this into Camelot.

2323
01:45:21,489 --> 01:45:23,142
I mean, that's what she said.
I was like,

2324
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,517
"Please don't, please don't
compare us to the Kennedys."

2325
01:45:29,671 --> 01:45:30,671
Oh...

2326
01:45:31,194 --> 01:45:32,543
I got you a little, uh,

2327
01:45:33,327 --> 01:45:34,632
a little birthday gift.

2328
01:45:35,067 --> 01:45:36,417
For me?

2329
01:45:36,591 --> 01:45:37,940
It's your birthday.

2330
01:45:38,114 --> 01:45:39,637
Oh, you didn't have
to do that, Donald.

2331
01:45:39,811 --> 01:45:42,771
Come on. 59, but who's counting?

2332
01:45:43,162 --> 01:45:44,425
Huh?

2333
01:45:44,773 --> 01:45:47,906
Tiffany diamonds and, uh,
look what it says.

2334
01:45:49,821 --> 01:45:50,821
Trump.

2335
01:45:51,954 --> 01:45:53,259
What do you think? Are you...

2336
01:45:53,564 --> 01:45:55,305
Oh, well, uh...

2337
01:45:55,479 --> 01:45:56,872
Yeah, that's terrific.

2338
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:58,569
Yeah, they're gonna look good.

2339
01:46:00,745 --> 01:46:03,182
Oh, look at this.
Did you see this?

2340
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:09,232
Donald got me, uh, diamond
cufflinks for my birthday.

2341
01:46:19,111 --> 01:46:20,330
Beautiful, right?

2342
01:46:20,504 --> 01:46:23,289
My darling,
this is cheap pewter.

2343
01:46:23,464 --> 01:46:24,987
The stone is zirconia.

2344
01:46:25,857 --> 01:46:26,858
They're fake.

2345
01:46:34,475 --> 01:46:35,563
Donald has no shame.

2346
01:46:45,703 --> 01:46:49,054
Everyone, I just, uh,
I just wanna say a few words.

2347
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:55,496
Tonight we're celebrating
a really great guy, Roy Cohn.

2348
01:46:57,019 --> 01:47:01,458
Roy's tough. Some say vicious,
even scary.

2349
01:47:01,632 --> 01:47:03,547
I mean, look at him.

2350
01:47:04,243 --> 01:47:06,396
That's not exactly a face you
wanna bring home to your mother,

2351
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,160
am I right?

2352
01:47:08,334 --> 01:47:12,164
But, um, you know, with Roy
it's about friendship, right?

2353
01:47:12,338 --> 01:47:14,732
He has to like you,
and if he doesn't, forget it.

2354
01:47:15,037 --> 01:47:18,432
He has to like you, right?
Thank God he liked me.

2355
01:47:19,171 --> 01:47:20,932
And, I mean, I don't know,
I mean, he must've thought

2356
01:47:20,956 --> 01:47:23,524
I was a baby or something,
'cause, you know, I don't drink,

2357
01:47:23,698 --> 01:47:25,743
I don't smoke,
I don't take drugs.

2358
01:47:25,917 --> 01:47:27,852
I have other problems which
I don't wanna tell you about,

2359
01:47:27,876 --> 01:47:29,051
but, uh...

2360
01:47:29,225 --> 01:47:31,096
for whatever reason,
he liked me.

2361
01:47:32,663 --> 01:47:36,667
But the truth is, as, uh,
tough as Roy is,

2362
01:47:36,841 --> 01:47:38,190
and he is brutal,

2363
01:47:38,626 --> 01:47:41,977
he, uh, truly is a loyal guy.

2364
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:46,938
It's a matter of honour
with him.

2365
01:47:48,026 --> 01:47:50,986
And, um, frankly he's a hero.

2366
01:47:52,901 --> 01:47:54,293
Happy birthday, Roy.

2367
01:47:54,511 --> 01:47:56,426
- Happy birthday, Roy.
- This is to you,

2368
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:58,297
and uh, mazel tov.

2369
01:48:02,954 --> 01:48:03,954
Well, uh...

2370
01:48:15,227 --> 01:48:17,491
I don't know what to say. Um...

2371
01:48:28,197 --> 01:48:29,807
Thank you, Donald.

2372
01:48:30,634 --> 01:48:35,465
24-carat American patriot
and a friend.

2373
01:48:35,639 --> 01:48:39,121
I know you're gonna go on
to do, uh, a lot of things

2374
01:48:39,295 --> 01:48:41,645
that would make me, uh,
very proud.

2375
01:48:51,046 --> 01:48:53,396
- Thank you.
- Well, it's not over yet, Roy.

2376
01:48:54,179 --> 01:48:56,399
What? My life?

2377
01:48:56,573 --> 01:48:58,357
Let's hope not.
Maybe not tonight.

2378
01:48:58,532 --> 01:49:00,621
Stay alive for
a little longer, Roy.

2379
01:49:48,494 --> 01:49:50,801
I gotta go, uh, to bed, I think.

2380
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:55,588
Sorry.

There he is, huh? The greatest
writer of all time.

2406
01:52:01,105 --> 01:52:02,265
- How you doing?
- Sorry Tony,

2407
01:52:02,367 --> 01:52:03,586
I was with a contractor.

2408
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,675
- It's all good.
- Well, here we go.

2409
01:52:05,849 --> 01:52:07,849
- Here we are.
- Where do you wanna start?

2410
01:52:07,982 --> 01:52:09,782
Let's see if this is gonna be
a negative book.

2411
01:52:09,853 --> 01:52:12,769
Well, honestly I'm amazed that
you asked me to write this book,

2412
01:52:12,943 --> 01:52:14,823
Mr Trump, considering
the article I wrote on you

2413
01:52:14,989 --> 01:52:16,531
wasn't exactly flattering.
- Yeah, well,

2414
01:52:16,555 --> 01:52:18,142
you put me on the cover
of New York Magazine,

2415
01:52:18,166 --> 01:52:20,057
and you can write.
That's the most important thing.

2416
01:52:20,081 --> 01:52:22,362
Now you just have to be nice
to me because I'm paying you.

2417
01:52:22,518 --> 01:52:23,562
Sure you are.

2418
01:52:24,259 --> 01:52:26,740
So, I was looking through some
of your interviews,

2419
01:52:26,914 --> 01:52:30,221
and I'm finding it hard
to settle on a grand narrative

2420
01:52:30,395 --> 01:52:32,876
for the book.
Yes, you like making deals...

2421
01:52:33,050 --> 01:52:34,730
Well, I'm gonna stop you right
there, Tony.

2422
01:52:34,878 --> 01:52:38,752
I don't, I don't like making
deals. Do you understand?

2423
01:52:38,926 --> 01:52:41,885
I love making deals.
I love making deals.

2424
01:52:42,059 --> 01:52:43,234
The bigger the better.

2425
01:52:43,408 --> 01:52:45,062
- But to what end?
- To what end?

2426
01:52:45,236 --> 01:52:47,369
Deals are the end. I mean,
that's like asking Da Vinci

2427
01:52:47,543 --> 01:52:49,284
why he, why he painted
the Mona Lisa.

2428
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:51,634
You consider yourself an artist?

2429
01:52:51,808 --> 01:52:53,786
Well, I am an artist, Tony,
and deals are my art form.

2430
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:55,333
Look, making deals
is an art form,

2431
01:52:55,507 --> 01:52:56,787
and I wanna put this
in the book.

2432
01:52:56,944 --> 01:52:58,423
It's something that
you're born with.

2433
01:52:58,597 --> 01:53:00,010
You either have it
or you don't have it, okay?

2434
01:53:00,034 --> 01:53:01,731
And if you don't have it,
don't do deals.

2435
01:53:01,905 --> 01:53:04,065
Just get a beautiful job,
have a nice family and relax.

2436
01:53:05,822 --> 01:53:07,345
The Art of the Deal.

2437
01:53:07,519 --> 01:53:08,651
That sounds good.

2438
01:53:09,608 --> 01:53:10,888
You know, I like that. That's...

2439
01:53:11,045 --> 01:53:12,394
I think people will buy
into that.

2440
01:53:12,568 --> 01:53:14,352
Well, let's see, Tony.
I'd buy that book.

2441
01:53:14,526 --> 01:53:16,964
Okay, let's go back
to your childhood.

2442
01:53:17,268 --> 01:53:19,096
Uh, living in Queens,
what was that like?

2443
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:20,291
Well, I had a great childhood.

2444
01:53:20,315 --> 01:53:21,664
Very normal, uh,

2445
01:53:21,838 --> 01:53:23,318
wonderful parents,
supportive parents.

2446
01:53:23,361 --> 01:53:24,885
And, you know, my dad was tough,

2447
01:53:25,059 --> 01:53:27,191
and, uh, he helped me develop
a killer instinct.

2448
01:53:28,236 --> 01:53:29,019
And?

2449
01:53:29,193 --> 01:53:30,586
And, uh, yeah, frankly,

2450
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:32,327
you know, I don't,
I don't wanna,

2451
01:53:32,501 --> 01:53:34,174
I don't like to talk too much
about the past, Tony.

2452
01:53:34,198 --> 01:53:36,198
You dwell on the past,
you go right down the tubes.

2453
01:53:36,374 --> 01:53:38,134
This is just to give the reader
some context.

2454
01:53:38,289 --> 01:53:39,289
Tony...

2455
01:53:41,336 --> 01:53:43,381
Don't, don't, don't come here
busting my balls

2456
01:53:43,555 --> 01:53:46,167
looking for some deep shit, alright?

2457
01:53:46,341 --> 01:53:48,188
I hate when everybody tries
to dig around your life

2458
01:53:48,212 --> 01:53:49,292
looking for some deep shit.

2459
01:53:49,387 --> 01:53:50,780
We're all animals.

2460
01:53:51,128 --> 01:53:52,714
Everybody wants to get rich
and have other people

2461
01:53:52,738 --> 01:53:54,828
suck their cock.
Everybody wants to win, Tony.

2462
01:53:55,002 --> 01:53:56,082
And that's the truth of it.

2463
01:53:57,047 --> 01:53:59,615
- But that won't read well.
- Well, that's the truth of it.

2464
01:53:59,789 --> 01:54:01,789
But it's not the truth
we're looking for right now.

2465
01:54:01,922 --> 01:54:03,184
Right now people need to think

2466
01:54:03,358 --> 01:54:04,838
there's some sort
of special sauce.

2467
01:54:05,012 --> 01:54:06,903
Principles, a set of rules
that make you different.

2468
01:54:06,927 --> 01:54:08,469
Well, that's easy,
'cause I have my rules.

2469
01:54:08,493 --> 01:54:09,886
I got three rules, okay?

2470
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:11,380
They're my three rules
of winning.

2471
01:54:11,714 --> 01:54:15,022
Rule one, the world is a mess, okay?

2472
01:54:15,196 --> 01:54:16,893
The world is a mess, Tony.

2473
01:54:17,894 --> 01:54:20,418
You have to fight back,
you have to have a tough skin.

2474
01:54:20,592 --> 01:54:22,290
Attack, attack, attack.

2475
01:54:22,464 --> 01:54:25,119
If somebody comes after you
with a knife,

2476
01:54:25,641 --> 01:54:28,426
you shoot 'em back
with a bazooka, okay?

2477
01:54:28,644 --> 01:54:31,212
Rule two, what is truth, Tony?

2478
01:54:31,386 --> 01:54:32,517
What is truth?

2479
01:54:32,996 --> 01:54:35,303
You know what's truth?
What you say is truth,

2480
01:54:35,477 --> 01:54:37,696
what I say is truth,
what he says is truth.

2481
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:41,178
What is the truth in life?
Deny everything, admit nothing.

2482
01:54:41,570 --> 01:54:43,354
You know what's true?
What I say is true.

2483
01:54:43,528 --> 01:54:45,704
And third of all,
and most important,

2484
01:54:45,879 --> 01:54:48,794
no matter how fucked you are,

2485
01:54:49,099 --> 01:54:52,276
you never, ever, ever
admit defeat.

2486
01:54:52,450 --> 01:54:53,712
You always claim victory.

2487
01:54:54,844 --> 01:54:55,844
Always.

2488
01:54:56,890 --> 01:54:58,770
You know, that sounds
like the US foreign policy

2489
01:54:58,848 --> 01:55:00,676
for the past quarter century.

2490
01:55:00,850 --> 01:55:03,244
Well, unlike that,
this actually works.

2491
01:55:04,985 --> 01:55:06,769
And I won a lot, Tony.
I won a lot.

2492
01:55:06,943 --> 01:55:08,094
And even when they said
I didn't,

2493
01:55:08,118 --> 01:55:09,182
I still turned it into a win,

2494
01:55:09,206 --> 01:55:10,326
and that was the difference.

2495
01:55:11,121 --> 01:55:13,645
So, how'd you come by
these set of rules?

2496
01:55:15,604 --> 01:55:17,954
Well, I have an instinct, Tony.
I have a killer instinct.

2497
01:55:18,781 --> 01:55:20,087
I always have.

2498
01:55:23,003 --> 01:55:26,354
Listen, Tony, you have to have
a natural ability.

2499
01:55:26,702 --> 01:55:28,443
I'm a big believer
in natural ability,

2500
01:55:28,617 --> 01:55:30,725
and a lot of that is genetics.
You have to be born with it,

2501
01:55:30,749 --> 01:55:33,013
you know, and some people
aren't and some people are,

2502
01:55:33,187 --> 01:55:34,405
and that's the difference.

2503
01:55:37,887 --> 01:55:38,888
You have to have it.
