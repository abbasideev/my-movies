1
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,256
Allow me to be frank
at the commencement

2
00:01:51,383 --> 00:01:53,426
You will not like me.

3
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:57,721
The gentlemen will be envious
and the ladies will be repelled.

4
00:01:57,722 --> 00:02:03,394
You will not like me now and you will
like me a good deal less as we go on.

5
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:05,230
Ladies,

6
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:06,940
an announcement.

7
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,651
I am up for it.

8
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:11,444
All the time.

9
00:02:11,903 --> 00:02:14,071
That is not a boast
or an opinion.

10
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:16,365
It is bone-hard medical fact.

11
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:18,409
I put it round, you know.

12
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,579
And you will watch me putting
it round and sigh for it.

13
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,457
Don't.

14
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,417
It is a deal of
trouble for you

15
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:30,129
and you are better off watching and
drawing your conclusions from a distance

16
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,425
than you would be if I got
my tarse up your petticoats.

17
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:36,469
Gentlemen,

18
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:38,471
do not despair.

19
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:40,931
I am up for that as well.

20
00:02:40,932 --> 00:02:43,426
And the same warning applies.

21
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:46,937
Still your cheesy erections
till I've had my say,

22
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:49,940
but later when you shag,
and later you will shag,

23
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:52,067
I shall expect it of you,

24
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:55,446
and I will know if
you have let me down.

25
00:02:55,447 --> 00:02:57,282
I wish you to shag

26
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:01,599
with my homuncular image
rattling in your gonads.

27
00:03:01,953 --> 00:03:03,997
Feel.

28
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,415
how it was for me,
how it is for me.

29
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,001
And ponder.

30
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,279
Was that shudder the
same shudder he sensed?

31
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:16,076
Did he know something
more profound?

32
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:20,179
Or is there some wall of wretchedness
that we all batter with our heads

33
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,094
at that shining
live-long moment?

34
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:26,519
That is it.

35
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:28,454
That is my prologue.

36
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,315
Nothing in rhyme.

37
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:34,985
No protestations of modesty. You
were not expecting that, I hope.

38
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:37,030
I am John Wilmot.

39
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:39,156
Second Earl of Rochester.

40
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:43,036
And I do not want
you to like me.

41
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,014
Wren's upset. The clergy approved the
most conventional design for the cathedral.

42
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:07,225
Now he feels there's no
room for artistic manoeuvre.

43
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:09,519
Put a sub-clause
in the warrant.

44
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,025
"Variations in the design are to be
ornamental rather than essential."

45
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:17,235
Then he can do what he wants.

46
00:04:17,236 --> 00:04:19,072
Next.

47
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:23,033
There are representations for
you to be more careful in public.

48
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:25,077
Perhaps a bodyguard.

49
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:27,537
- Whose ideia is that?
- Your brother.

50
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:29,165
Ha!

51
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:33,043
No-one's going to kill me if it
means having him on the throne.

52
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:36,296
- Next.
- Danby says the army is costing too much.

53
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:38,548
It's Danby's job to
balance the books.

54
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:42,761
If he thinks it's good economics to disband
the army and be invaded by the French,

55
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:44,555
he can look for
another position.

56
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,973
Anything else?

57
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:49,434
You asked me to remind you
about the Earl of Rochester.

58
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:51,479
When did I banish him?

59
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:53,481
Three months ago.

60
00:04:53,606 --> 00:04:55,902
- For how long?
- A year.

61
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:59,278
Bring him back. Now.

62
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:03,991
John.

63
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:10,031
Be attentive to your wife.
She's not accustomed to London.

64
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:14,292
Mother, I shall in all things
endeavour to serve her.

65
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:16,003
and you.

66
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:22,218
Serve God.

67
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:42,007
You must not fear London.

68
00:05:43,114 --> 00:05:45,368
It is not London I fear.

69
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:56,376
You abducted me in a coach like this
when I was still a virgin heiress.

70
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:58,805
And did you like abduction?

71
00:06:00,131 --> 00:06:02,174
Passionately.

72
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:07,179
Speak of it.

73
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:10,140
John! This is not the place.

74
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:12,308
Speak to me of abduction.

75
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:14,186
I was 18.

76
00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:18,107
And worth two and a
half thousand a year.

77
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:19,984
You ambushed me,

78
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,318
bundled me from my coach,

79
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,997
and drove me away.

80
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,162
The King thrust you
in the tower for it.

81
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:38,555
And I dug in my heels and spurned
and shunned the other men.

82
00:06:40,004 --> 00:06:43,338
I would only embrace
my dear abductor.

83
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,977
Dryden's new play.

84
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:39,270
Here, Chas, grab a wodge.

85
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:42,539
Dryden couldn't
write a laundry list.

86
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:44,818
Rochester!

87
00:07:44,985 --> 00:07:47,112
- Johnny!
- Johnny.

88
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,280
We were pining for you

89
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:51,282
Even now we're pining.

90
00:07:51,283 --> 00:07:54,285
When I wake in the country,
I dream of being in London,

91
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:57,079
and then when I get here,
it's full of people like you.

92
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,999
- Johnny.
- This reign's a shambles, do you not think?

93
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,670
My father risked life and limb hiding
that thing Charles up an oak tree.

94
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:06,130
Has he forgiven you?

95
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:09,300
He's forgiven me. I
shan't forgive him.

96
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:12,011
Why did he banish
you this time?

97
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:15,723
Well, it is a fine morning. I'm
walking through the galleries.

98
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:19,518
The King is walking through the
galleries. I'm splendidly alone.

99
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,693
The King is surrounded
by a slow-moving troop.

100
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:26,485
of Mediterraneans.

101
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:31,030
- The wife's family.
- And he must make show of me.

102
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:33,999
Behold, the Earl of
Rochester, the wit.

103
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:38,037
The poet. Pray, let us
have some of your muse.

104
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:40,082
What am I to do?

105
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,418
Then I recall in my pocket I have a
sketch of something rustic with nymphs.

106
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:46,805
I pull it out and deliver.

107
00:08:47,547 --> 00:08:53,552
"In the isle of Britain, long since famous grown
For breeding the best cunts in Christendom..."

108
00:08:53,553 --> 00:08:58,808
Rat me, thinks I, this is not
the piece of paper I had supposed.

109
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:02,061
The King's eyes are more
piercing than I can remember.

110
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:06,344
The jaws of his entourage
are decidedly earthbound.

111
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:10,569
This piece of paper is not covered merely
with the thump and slop of congress.

112
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,825
This poem is an attack
on the monarchy itself.

113
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:19,578
Culminating in depiction
of the royal mistress

114
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:25,409
striving to flog the flaccid royal
member into a state of excitement.

115
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:32,091
"This you'd believe had I but time to tell
you, The pains it cost to poor laborious Nelly.

116
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:35,594
Whilst she employs hands,
fingers, mouth and thighs,

117
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:39,182
Ere she can raise
the member she enjoys.

118
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:42,601
All monarchs I hate, and
the thrones they sit on,

119
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:47,106
From the hector of France
to the cully of Britain."

120
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:49,275
It's damn good,
though, Johnny.

121
00:09:49,276 --> 00:09:53,070
Course it's good. That's not the point.
The point is he couldn't appreciate it.

122
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:56,782
It took me nearly an hour to
write it, just to please him.

123
00:09:56,783 --> 00:10:01,078
Three months in the fucking country at the
height of the season. Missed all the good plays.

124
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,580
Boring old Rowley.
We love you, Johnny.

125
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:06,667
Give us a stanza and we'll
laugh in the King's place.

126
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:09,671
To Etherege, I drink a pledge.

127
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:12,131
His life has run the gamut.

128
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:14,758
He's penned naught good
since She Would If She Could.

129
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,094
He would if he
could but he cannot

130
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:21,932
Well, Johnny, it is a damn well said
thing, but it ain't true, do you see?

131
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:23,559
Oh, but it is true, Georgie.

132
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:30,315
You think you can still enjoy the town's
esteem for something you wrote seven years ago.

133
00:10:30,316 --> 00:10:32,609
You can't be promising
for ever George

134
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:34,903
Sooner or later you
must do something

135
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:38,657
But that's what I'm saying.
I have written a new play.

136
00:10:38,658 --> 00:10:40,451
Oh.

137
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:43,036
Written a new play has he?

138
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:49,793
All those afternoons he was pretending to slope
off and roger his mistress like a decent chap,

139
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:52,045
he was lurking in his rooms,

140
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:54,507
poking away at a play.

141
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:56,821
That is disgusting, George.

142
00:10:56,968 --> 00:10:59,095
Disgusting and shameful.

143
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:01,680
What's it about, your play?

144
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:03,491
A satire on Dryden?

145
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:06,704
Pox o' Dryden.
It's about you.

146
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:11,607
And in your play, do you
tell the truth about me?

147
00:11:11,608 --> 00:11:14,318
- Well, I've attempted to show you.
- Yes?

148
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:17,613
- Well, I enjoy your company.
- You've made me endearing.

149
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:21,117
- Well, only the public can.
- Don't smarm around, George.

150
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:24,253
You're an endearing
sort of chap.

151
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:28,332
So, you haven't
told the truth.

152
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,168
Good.

153
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:33,825
We don't want to go
frightening people.

154
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:38,884
Now, how about a real play?

155
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:41,625
The Duke's have the new Otway.

156
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,851
Oh, I have high hopes
of young Tom Otway.

157
00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:52,488
Let me finish him off, sir.

158
00:11:52,523 --> 00:11:57,903
This fellow is my servant. He has just
filched two shillings from my coat pocket.

159
00:11:57,904 --> 00:11:59,804
A thief and a rogue.

160
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:01,872
My lord you express i

161
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:05,411
Haven't quite got the hang
of the reign yet, have you?

162
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:07,913
- I will not employ a thief.
- Then I will.

163
00:12:07,914 --> 00:12:11,416
- How much was your master paying you?
- Six shillings a week, sir.

164
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,461
Who talks of thieving?

165
00:12:13,586 --> 00:12:15,463
George, give him £5.

166
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:19,299
Buy a brown livery and report
to me at the Duke's Theatre.

167
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,842
He will steal your gold.

168
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:22,678
I hope so.

169
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:27,766
If he turned honest after coming into my orbit,
then I am not the malicious planet I had hoped.

170
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:29,685
Now begone, sir.

171
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:43,014
- And er how will your lordship be paying?
- Credit.

172
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:48,328
I only use coin vulgarised with the
monarch's head for transactions with servants.

173
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:50,246
I am ever your humble servant.

174
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:54,542
No, Sr. Ratcliffe, you are
the very prince of drapery.

175
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:56,962
The prince is always happy
to see the King's head.

176
00:12:56,963 --> 00:13:00,543
But not to carry i
around in his pocket

177
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:02,802
Credit then.

178
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:04,720
Billy.

179
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:07,139
Join us.

180
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:09,141
Johnny.

181
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,936
This is Billy Downs

182
00:13:13,145 --> 00:13:16,607
Billy this is the
Earl of Rochester

183
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:21,537
How old are you, Sr. Downs?

184
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:24,281
18, my lord.

185
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:35,220
Young man, you will
die of this company.

186
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:38,554
Do not laugh. I'm serious.

187
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:46,177
Sr. Ratcliffe, this
hangs very well.

188
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:49,180
My lord, I saw you just
now with the gent's servant.

189
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:51,933
Did you think I dispensed
wisely in the matter?

190
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:56,187
If the fool run off with the gold, then
you prove a point, but at your loss.

191
00:13:56,188 --> 00:14:01,109
If he return in your livery, then you've
gained a servant who is a known cheat.

192
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,196
So you prove a different point,
but again at your own expense.

193
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:07,365
You summarise well, Sr. Downs.

194
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:10,201
And in such a manner, I
deduce you were trained

195
00:14:10,202 --> 00:14:14,664
at one of the "count the angels
on a pinhead" Cambridge colleges.

196
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:16,499
King's, was it not?

197
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:18,752
It was, my lord.

198
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:20,678
King's, yes.

199
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:23,214
And yet you do not draw
the moral of the incident.

200
00:14:23,215 --> 00:14:25,342
Which is?

201
00:14:25,551 --> 00:14:33,571
That any experiment of interest in life will be
carried out at your own expense. Mark it well.

202
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:38,605
My lord!

203
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:42,234
My Lord Rochester.

204
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:44,278
You've come back.

205
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:46,578
In your livery, my lord.

206
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:49,115
Then you are turned honest.
I cannot support that.

207
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:51,617
I regret the deed's honesty.

208
00:14:51,618 --> 00:14:53,078
My lord.

209
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,956
But I considered that if I performed
it and fell into your service,

210
00:14:56,957 --> 00:15:00,291
I would have
more enjoyment of life.

211
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:05,047
You see, this fellow has
the hang of the reign.

212
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:07,758
I like this fellow
exceedingly. What is your name?

213
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,969
Alcock.

214
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:13,515
Like master, like servant.

215
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,185
Well, Alcock,

216
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,732
you shall drink and shag more than
any serving man in the kingdom.

217
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:27,236
Go at once and spend the rest of the
money on a whore, a large, greasy one.

218
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:29,531
Then when you are
done, return here to me.

219
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:31,575
Now begone.

220
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:42,920
Rochester! Disgrace!

221
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:45,172
Rochester!

222
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,468
Rochester! Missed
you Lord Rochester!

223
00:15:49,384 --> 00:15:51,428
He is risen!

224
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:56,683
My lord!

225
00:15:56,808 --> 00:15:57,726
My lord!

226
00:15:57,893 --> 00:15:59,936
Impertinent bastard!

227
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:14,951
Johnny!

228
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:17,621
My Lord Rochester!

229
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,782
Rochester, you
are a cunt, sir!

230
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:27,547
I smell a rotten odour

231
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:34,858
I'll suck it for you Johnny
if you promise not to marry me!

232
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:55,813
Johnny said
"cunt" to the King!

233
00:16:56,034 --> 00:16:58,202
I'm going to brazen
my arse at them.

234
00:16:58,203 --> 00:17:00,103
They've all seen it.

235
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:03,040
Well, they can bloody
well put up with it again.

236
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,253
Johnny said
"cunt" to the King!

237
00:17:06,545 --> 00:17:08,712
Johnny said
"cunt" to the King.

238
00:17:08,713 --> 00:17:11,495
Johnny said
"cunt" to the King!

239
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:17,264
My lord.

240
00:17:17,555 --> 00:17:19,599
Dear Jane.

241
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:26,084
Give you your first
London spurt of the summer.

242
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,108
- I brought the wife with me.
- Bit of a waste.

243
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:32,023
Shooting good
jism up the lawful.

244
00:17:32,278 --> 00:17:34,447
Ladies and gallants all,

245
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:36,825
the King!

246
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:55,884
Oh, freeze my piss, if the
royal finger ain't beckoning me.

247
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:57,220
How exciting.

248
00:18:13,278 --> 00:18:15,321
Did you miss me?

249
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,323
I missed the money.

250
00:18:17,532 --> 00:18:19,325
Good.

251
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:22,854
Don't like a whore
with sentiment.

252
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:59,281
I could have ignored your poem, Johnny,
but I made a fuss about it for a reason.

253
00:18:59,282 --> 00:19:01,533
I won't hide
anything from you.

254
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:06,288
The country's on the brink. People are
still reeling from the fire, the plague.

255
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:10,292
The Catholics are plotting the
Dutch are a bunch of bastards

256
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:13,295
and the French are ten times
worse and there's no money

257
00:19:13,296 --> 00:19:18,133
I can only get funds by crawling to
Parliament or plotting against them.

258
00:19:18,134 --> 00:19:22,304
And I don't want to lock antlers with
them head on in the way my father did.

259
00:19:22,305 --> 00:19:24,955
"Head on?" That's quite good.

260
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:30,312
When you first came to court
Johnny you were a boy of 18

261
00:19:30,313 --> 00:19:34,484
A certain flippancy a
whiff of impertinence

262
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,360
This was acceptable

263
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:40,822
But we're ten years down the
road and the view is different

264
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:42,921
The tone has to change.

265
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:46,055
I have to look
responsible, sober.

266
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:48,664
I want you with me.

267
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:51,333
That's why I brought you back.

268
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:53,336
I want you to
take on a new role.

269
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:56,297
Here? In the playhouse?

270
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:58,437
No, the House of Lords.

271
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:02,844
Your father spirited me out of
England when my life was at stake,

272
00:20:02,845 --> 00:20:04,846
so I looked after
him and after you.

273
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:07,849
- You put me in the Tower.
- And I let you out

274
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,353
The time has come for
you to pay your dues.

275
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:13,848
People listen to you, Johnny.

276
00:20:14,357 --> 00:20:18,360
If you took your seat in the
Lords, you could make great speeches

277
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:20,699
that would influence events.

278
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:24,909
Anyone can oppose.

279
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:26,993
It's fun to be against things.

280
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:33,226
But there comes a time when you have
to start being for things as well.

281
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,433
Your Majesty.

282
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:55,439
Sr. Etherege.

283
00:20:55,606 --> 00:20:57,441
Take a nibble?

284
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:01,111
I've had my dinner,
thank you, madam.

285
00:21:01,112 --> 00:21:02,905
George!

286
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:05,657
Is this thy plighted faith?

287
00:21:05,658 --> 00:21:07,451
Is this thy truth?

288
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:09,453
Oh too unkind!

289
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:12,184
False and unconstant youth!

290
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:17,335
- Madam, believe not but my
brother's just. ROCHESTER: Who's she?

291
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:19,080
She's Lizzie Barry.

292
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:21,089
And she just won't do.

293
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,758
You wrong his honour
by this mean distrust.

294
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,136
Well.

295
00:21:26,262 --> 00:21:32,267
That does alleviate my griefs and give
my wearied soul a soft and kind reprieve.

296
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:38,278
Which ever to forget would be as
hard and as impossible as to reward.

297
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:42,099
Serving you my
happiness secures.

298
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,232
Since equally with yours
my hopes are crossed.

299
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,794
Of all but sorry
and sad despair.

300
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:18,605
Lizzie. Lizzie!

301
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:26,739
On stage.

302
00:22:26,864 --> 00:22:28,698
You must take your
bow for the public.

303
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:31,701
Why do you persist in doing the
opposite of what you are told?

304
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:37,707
If girls like you do not do what they are told,
then it is all up with our sex on the stage.

305
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:41,085
You cannot ignore the
advice of them that know!

306
00:22:41,086 --> 00:22:43,688
Now, acknowledge
your audience.

307
00:22:43,714 --> 00:22:45,746
They can kiss my arse.

308
00:22:53,223 --> 00:22:56,317
She's a good fuck,
but she costs.

309
00:22:57,728 --> 00:23:01,522
She gives a nice gobble, but she
won't do the full wibbly-wobbly.

310
00:23:01,523 --> 00:23:03,232
- She does it with me.
- She does not!

311
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:05,652
Mary, if I may say so.

312
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:10,740
a statuesque performance.

313
00:23:10,741 --> 00:23:13,211
Bursting with Grecian promise.

314
00:23:14,745 --> 00:23:18,581
Sra. Barry, the work we did
beforehand, did it mean nothing to you?

315
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:20,583
That is correct, Sr. Harris.

316
00:23:20,584 --> 00:23:24,587
Molly, I cannot teach those who
will not be disposed to learn.

317
00:23:24,588 --> 00:23:27,089
- Sr. Etherege, how do you do, sir?
- Well, Sr. Harris.

318
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,093
- Was not my Lord Rochester in wih you?
- Darted off

319
00:23:30,128 --> 00:23:31,927
Did you care for the play?

320
00:23:31,928 --> 00:23:34,096
The play was well enough.

321
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:36,683
Most of the acting, too.

322
00:23:47,611 --> 00:23:49,654
Sra. Barry.

323
00:23:50,614 --> 00:23:52,657
She has been dismissed.

324
00:23:53,116 --> 00:23:55,284
I bring word from
Sr. Betterton.

325
00:23:55,285 --> 00:23:59,525
- I've had such already.
- This is quite another.

326
00:24:06,421 --> 00:24:08,631
You have obtained
a reprieve for me.

327
00:24:08,632 --> 00:24:11,636
Yes, madam, but
there is a price.

328
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:20,434
This is your first season
on the London stage.

329
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:22,062
It is, my lord.

330
00:24:22,145 --> 00:24:23,980
Sra. Barry,

331
00:24:24,147 --> 00:24:27,942
you must acquire the trick of
ignoring those who do not like you.

332
00:24:27,943 --> 00:24:33,448
In my experience, those who do not like you fall
into two categories, the stupid and the envious.

333
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:37,952
The stupid will like you in five
years' time, the envious never.

334
00:24:37,953 --> 00:24:40,746
With my training you
will become the best

335
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:44,458
the most fascinating
actress on the London stage

336
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:47,727
I shall come to the
theatre tomorrow.

337
00:24:49,464 --> 00:24:53,217
What are you up to,
Johnny? She can't act.

338
00:24:53,218 --> 00:24:56,470
She has neither the cadence
of the heroic nor the posture.

339
00:24:56,471 --> 00:25:01,475
I will wager you 20 guineas she will
become the finest actress on our stage.

340
00:25:01,476 --> 00:25:04,144
This is the prick
talking, not the head.

341
00:25:04,145 --> 00:25:06,188
Knob her and have done.

342
00:25:06,189 --> 00:25:07,816
Is it a wager?

343
00:25:07,983 --> 00:25:10,192
My dear friend, you
do not have 20 guineas.

344
00:25:10,193 --> 00:25:11,778
Is it a wager?

345
00:25:12,028 --> 00:25:14,029
We've missed the fuck.
Can we get a drink?

346
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,825
There's a new toping house
hard by called Deaf Marion's.

347
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:21,328
The Cambridge boy knows
his books by heart.

348
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:23,373
Lead on, King's.

349
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:37,387
Alcock.

350
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:39,681
My lord.

351
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:42,850
Something rotten
has got into my guts.

352
00:25:42,851 --> 00:25:44,852
I trust it's not me, my lord.

353
00:25:44,853 --> 00:25:47,897
No, Alcock, it
is not. Not yet.

354
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:51,900
We should mark the front lawn
at Adderbury for pall-mall.

355
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:53,485
I had always thought
it a foolish game.

356
00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:55,487
Depends on who you play with.

357
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:58,490
The King plays with a common
prostitute, not his wife.

358
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:01,994
The Portuguese have little
flair for outdoor pursuits.

359
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:04,399
Except navigating, of course.

360
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:08,000
I mean that the etiquette
of it is singular.

361
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:10,044
I know what you mean.

362
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:13,005
You must always be ace,
king and jack, my dear.

363
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:15,549
But heaven has not
disposed your cards so.

364
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,759
Johnny!
It's your shot!

365
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,429
I'm not playing!

366
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,513
Oh, but you are, John.

367
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:24,142
You are if I say you are.

368
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:35,610
The most advanced scientific
instrument in western Europe.

369
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:41,283
It costs 60000 pounds It tells the
time in every corner of the globe

370
00:26:41,284 --> 00:26:43,328
Understand?

371
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,747
That is achievement.

372
00:26:46,122 --> 00:26:49,958
The man who did that was not continually
pissed for the last three years.

373
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:52,279
What do you want from me?

374
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:58,258
Writing something profound that will
stand as a monument to my reign.

375
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:00,489
You're my literary giant.

376
00:27:00,553 --> 00:27:02,305
Dryden? Plodder.

377
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:04,473
But look what he's achieved.

378
00:27:04,474 --> 00:27:06,266
Elizabeth had her Shakespeare.

379
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:08,311
You can be mine.

380
00:27:08,603 --> 00:27:13,607
Give me a major work of literature
and I'll give you 500 guineas.

381
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:16,390
When would you
like it? Friday?

382
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:19,905
Don't fuck it up, John.

383
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:21,741
I love you.

384
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:35,296
Sra. Barry!

385
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:38,882
I cannot let you have long.
I must prepare Tamburlaine.

386
00:27:38,883 --> 00:27:40,967
There's a great
deal of setting up

387
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:42,303
Sra. Barry.

388
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:45,012
and a deal of taking down.

389
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,393
My Lord Rochester.

390
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:51,194
I'm come as I said I would.

391
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:53,730
Will you have
me lift my skirt?

392
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:58,318
Or do you have a mind to raise
it by your own endeavours?

393
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,965
I'm come to train
you in your acting.

394
00:28:01,989 --> 00:28:03,331
So you said when we first met,

395
00:28:03,366 --> 00:28:07,243
but your reputation being what it is,
I thought you meant something different.

396
00:28:07,244 --> 00:28:09,537
I have, I hope,
many reputations.

397
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:11,956
I am come, I say,
to train you.

398
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:14,168
in your stage acting

399
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:17,754
Never in my life have I heard
you spoken of as an actor.

400
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:21,049
That does not deter me from
spreading my insights to others

401
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:25,158
- I thought it would not.
- Then we shall begin

402
00:28:25,346 --> 00:28:28,264
You are familiar with
the plays of Sr. Etherege?

403
00:28:28,265 --> 00:28:30,850
- There are but two my lord
- Not for long, I fear.

404
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:33,353
The Comical Revenge
or Love In A Tub

405
00:28:33,354 --> 00:28:36,606
Have you seen Senhora.
Betterton playing Graciana?

406
00:28:36,607 --> 00:28:38,025
Yes, I'm her understudy.

407
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,069
Indeed.

408
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:42,147
Act Two, Scene Two.

409
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,615
I shall play Beaufort.

410
00:28:44,907 --> 00:28:46,991
Graciana, why do you
condemn your love?

411
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:50,912
Your beauty without that, alas,
would prove but my destruction.

412
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:54,973
An unlucky star prognosticating
ruin and despair.

413
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,794
You mistake.

414
00:28:57,002 --> 00:29:00,171
'Tis not my love I
blame, but my discretion.

415
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:04,092
Here the active flame should yet
a longer time have been concealed.

416
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:07,387
Too soon too soon I
fear i was revealed

417
00:29:07,388 --> 00:29:09,973
Our weaker sex
glories in surprise.

418
00:29:09,974 --> 00:29:13,142
We boast the sudden
conquests of our eyes.

419
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:16,271
But men esteem a foe
that dares contend

420
00:29:16,272 --> 00:29:19,524
One that with noble courage
does defend a wounded heart.

421
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:23,152
The victories they gain, they prize
by their own hazard and their pain.

422
00:29:23,153 --> 00:29:26,531
That was not Elizabeth Barry.
That was Sra. Betterton.

423
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:29,644
An understudy must
imiate not create

424
00:29:29,827 --> 00:29:32,453
- Yesterday you created
- Yesterday I was dismissed.

425
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:35,957
- But you played truthfully
- It costs too much to play the truth.

426
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:38,459
I do not think you have
considered this speech at all

427
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,620
Well, how would
you have me do it?

428
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:45,009
Let us consider now.

429
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:49,804
What does it mean, that speech
that Sra. Betterton mangled so?

430
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:54,017
Graciana means that she has given away
the secrets of her heart too freely.

431
00:29:54,018 --> 00:29:57,020
Something that a gentlewoman
must not do to a gentleman.

432
00:29:57,021 --> 00:29:59,522
- Why not?
- Because men will take love for granted

433
00:29:59,523 --> 00:30:01,555
and then not prize it.

434
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:04,944
And is our author right?
Do you believe that?

435
00:30:04,945 --> 00:30:08,030
I believe men are hurdles
that must be negotiated.

436
00:30:08,031 --> 00:30:11,033
Is that all? Do you
never feel passion for us?

437
00:30:11,034 --> 00:30:15,079
I've counterfeited passion in
gentlemen's beds if that is your meaning.

438
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,540
Counterfeit will not
serve you on the stage

439
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:20,544
Yesterday I was jeered and
taunted by 400 ruffians.

440
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:22,545
I know that will not serve me.

441
00:30:22,546 --> 00:30:26,757
And so you will take their word against both
of ours and traffic in falsehood from now on?

442
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,552
I don't know

443
00:30:28,802 --> 00:30:32,680
Then let us gain knowledge.
To the speech again.

444
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:34,725
You played it sweetly

445
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:40,013
Graciana is not innocent or
she would not have such insight

446
00:30:40,689 --> 00:30:42,899
If you had ever loved a man

447
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,443
you would say that
speech with regret

448
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,695
Because you would
fear the loss of him.

449
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:50,058
And supposing I have loved?

450
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:53,651
Then show me in the speech.

451
00:30:54,828 --> 00:30:57,789
Sir, you mistake.

452
00:30:58,832 --> 00:31:00,833
'Tis not my love I blame.

453
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:02,878
But my discretion.

454
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:07,340
Here the active flame should yet
a longer time have been concealed.

455
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:10,760
Too soon, too soon I
fear it was revealed.

456
00:31:10,761 --> 00:31:15,348
Our weaker sex glories in surprise. We
boast the sudden conquests of our eyes.

457
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:18,476
But men esteem a foe
that dares contend.

458
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:21,896
One that with noble courage
does defend a wounded heart.

459
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:26,233
The victories they gain, they prize
by their own hazard and their pain.

460
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:27,944
Well?

461
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:30,255
Was there improvement?

462
00:31:30,447 --> 00:31:31,906
Did you think so?

463
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:34,491
I wish to know your thoughts.

464
00:31:36,912 --> 00:31:38,622
It was better.

465
00:31:38,914 --> 00:31:40,831
But now you're too angry.

466
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,418
Of course I'm fucking angry! You walk
into this theatre in your 30-shilling boots

467
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:47,797
telling me how I should set about
my work! I warn you, I have a temper.

468
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:51,050
And I have been known to strike
out with the first object at hand.

469
00:31:51,051 --> 00:31:55,430
If that be a property blade, some have
sharper edges than is needful, so have a care.

470
00:31:55,465 --> 00:31:57,474
Ah.

471
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,601
To die onstage at the
hands of a beautiful woman.

472
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:02,229
I am no such!

473
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:08,193
I think I can make you an actress
of truth, not a creature of artifice.

474
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:10,237
I can do this.

475
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:15,573
But I cannot train you unless
you give a little towards me.

476
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:20,032
It's not in my nature to give.

477
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:22,498
I have my talent and
I'm jealous of it.

478
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:27,211
And though I give you credit that you and
you alone in all the town have seen it,

479
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:33,217
I am not so dazzled by the lord and
master in you that I cannot resent you.

480
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:34,844
Yes.

481
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,846
You are right.

482
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:40,724
I am intent on doing something
that no other has yet done.

483
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,728
And I lost my purpose
yesterday with fear of the pit.

484
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:45,892
But I will conquer them.

485
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:49,733
And it shall not be said when
I have my fame and my £2 a week

486
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:54,154
that Lord Rochester took to me and touched
me with the shining wing of his genius

487
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:57,241
and so turned me into a little
corner of his greatness. No!

488
00:32:57,242 --> 00:33:01,245
I shall be valued for me and for what
I knew I could do upon this stage!

489
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:05,749
And for what l, Lizzie Barry how I I
took the heat of my own soul and moulded it

490
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:10,254
and turned it into a wondrous
thing and so triumphed.

491
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,756
If I can help you
to that triumph,

492
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:17,261
I'm not so devoted to the trumpeting of my
own works that I would wish to take credit.

493
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:18,888
So you say now.

494
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:24,434
But in the ale house, when the play is
done, and the talk is of my Cleopatra,

495
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:28,564
will you not glide towards your cronies
with a "l taught her that piece of business"

496
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:32,776
or "She could not be heard in the gallery
until I instructed her in a trick or two"?

497
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,444
Madam I offer my services

498
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:39,199
If you see no advantage in them,
they can as easy be withdrawn.

499
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,203
You could buy my slit
for a pound a night, sir.

500
00:33:43,204 --> 00:33:45,248
I would not mind that.

501
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:48,709
But I think you
would not have it so.

502
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:53,213
What I think you want is power
over me, which I do bridle at.

503
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:56,758
For it is only I who can
do what you say I can do.

504
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:01,263
If you wish to play a part in
this I would strongly know why

505
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:04,266
Ask yourself what you
want from the theatre.

506
00:34:04,267 --> 00:34:07,185
I want the passionate
love of my audience

507
00:34:07,186 --> 00:34:10,772
I want when I make a sweep of my
arm to carry their hearts away.

508
00:34:10,773 --> 00:34:14,277
And for when I die, for them to
sigh for never seeing me again.

509
00:34:14,312 --> 00:34:16,529
Till the next afternoon.

510
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,824
There is your answer.

511
00:34:20,783 --> 00:34:24,009
I want to be one
of that multitude.

512
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:28,332
I wish to be moved.

513
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:31,836
I cannot feel in life.

514
00:34:32,211 --> 00:34:36,339
I must have others do it
for me here in the theatre.

515
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,468
You are spoken of as a man
with a stomach for life.

516
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:42,563
I am the cynic
of our golden age.

517
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,850
This bounteous dish, which our
great Charles and our great God

518
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:54,361
have, more or less in equal measure, placed
before us, sets my teeth permanently on edge.

519
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,196
Life has no purpose. It is
everywhere undone by arbitrariness.

520
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:03,200
I do this and it matters not
a jot if I do the opposite.

521
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,244
But in a playhouse,

522
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:09,874
every action, good or
bad, has its consequences.

523
00:35:10,124 --> 00:35:14,850
Drop a handkerchief and it
will return to smother you.

524
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:17,936
The theatre is my drug.

525
00:35:18,132 --> 00:35:25,048
And my illness is so far advanced that
my physic must be of the highest quality.

526
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:28,392
Oh, my lord,

527
00:35:29,852 --> 00:35:34,446
on those conditions, I
endeavour to do what you want.

528
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:42,864
What I want is that we meet again
tomorrow to consider Ophelia.

529
00:35:42,865 --> 00:35:44,909
Ophelia?

530
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:52,199
Sr. Betterton will revive Hamlet
next month and you will play Ophelia.

531
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:54,605
Ophelia then if you wish.

532
00:35:55,878 --> 00:35:59,881
But let us not neglect the
lesson in Sr. Etherege's speech.

533
00:35:59,882 --> 00:36:01,926
And what is that?

534
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:06,969
That women should ever
view men with suspicion.

535
00:36:10,393 --> 00:36:13,561
I shall be happy to
return and address our work

536
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:18,354
with that instruction written
on the inside of my skull.

537
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:28,619
Do me now. JANE: How?

538
00:36:28,911 --> 00:36:30,955
Mouth.

539
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,848
Trembling,

540
00:36:50,057 --> 00:36:51,850
confused,

541
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,853
despairing, limber,

542
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:57,147
dry,

543
00:36:58,315 --> 00:37:00,150
A wishing, weak,

544
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,861
unmoving lump I lie.

545
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,658
This.

546
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,661
dart of love,

547
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,586
whose piercing
point, oft tried,

548
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:17,609
With virgin blood 1
0,000 maids have dyed,

549
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:22,840
Now languid lies in
this unhappy hour.

550
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,884
Shrunk up.

551
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,887
and sapless,

552
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,021
like a withered flower.

553
00:37:32,558 --> 00:37:35,982
I have a feeling
this is going nowhere

554
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:38,225
I have that feeling too.

555
00:37:39,064 --> 00:37:41,108
I've met this woman.

556
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:44,319
Lizzie Barry

557
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:46,488
That new actress?

558
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:50,450
- She ain't no looker
- There is spirit in her.

559
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:53,578
When a gent sees the spirit
and not the eyes or the tits,

560
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,899
then a gent is in trouble

561
00:37:58,584 --> 00:38:00,877
Would you call
me a cynic, Jane?

562
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:06,582
I'd call you a man who pretends
to like life more than he does.

563
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:09,303
Is that a cynic?

564
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:13,427
I'm just a moll-sack,
I don't do questions

565
00:38:15,475 --> 00:38:17,519
If I am a cynic,

566
00:38:18,478 --> 00:38:24,318
how have I fallen in love with a
plain woman, whom I do not know?

567
00:38:24,484 --> 00:38:26,528
You saw her on stage.

568
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:30,293
All the colours and
them poems they say.

569
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,367
Gives them a glow

570
00:38:33,493 --> 00:38:36,495
- You've seen her out of the theatre?
- No.

571
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:38,831
Well, then it's not
her. It's the theatre.

572
00:38:38,832 --> 00:38:40,542
That or

573
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:43,462
Or what?

574
00:38:46,465 --> 00:38:49,115
They say men fall three times.

575
00:38:49,968 --> 00:38:52,012
First is calf love.

576
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,738
Second is the one you marry.

577
00:38:55,974 --> 00:38:58,018
And third?

578
00:38:58,477 --> 00:39:00,103
Third

579
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,474
Third is your deathbed bride.

580
00:39:04,983 --> 00:39:07,985
You sniff her, you
sniff your own shroud.

581
00:39:07,986 --> 00:39:10,030
Ah.

582
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:12,569
How you have cheered me.

583
00:39:13,992 --> 00:39:16,036
Go home and sleep.

584
00:39:16,411 --> 00:39:18,913
- I don't want to sleep.
- Then go home and think.

585
00:39:18,914 --> 00:39:21,499
- I don't ever want to think again.
- John.

586
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,751
Don't make me care for you.

587
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:29,006
I'd rather you came your fetch over
my face than leave me with that,

588
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:31,051
a lump of caring.

589
00:39:34,513 --> 00:39:36,611
Now go home and forget.

590
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:52,827
Much wine had passed
wih grave discourse

591
00:39:52,948 --> 00:39:56,174
Of who fucks who
and who does worse

592
00:39:56,868 --> 00:40:01,664
When I who still take care to see
Drunkenness relieved by lechery

593
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:07,671
Went out into St James' Park To
cool my head and fire my heart

594
00:40:08,964 --> 00:40:14,802
But though St James has the honour
on 'Tis consecrate to prick and cunt

595
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:22,936
There by a most incestuous birth Strange
woods spring from the teeming earth

596
00:40:24,312 --> 00:40:33,822
And nightly now beneath their shade
Are buggeries rapes and incests made

597
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:29,419
Sr. Huysmans.

598
00:41:30,878 --> 00:41:35,757
Perhaps a bottle and a glass would be
handsome adornments to your composition?

599
00:41:35,758 --> 00:41:41,102
They are not appropriate objects
in a family portrait, my lord.

600
00:41:47,395 --> 00:41:51,566
Sr. Huysmans, here
is another thought.

601
00:41:51,816 --> 00:41:54,401
You see that monkey yonder
dancing to the fiddle?

602
00:41:54,402 --> 00:41:58,864
Can't help but notice how
human these creatures are

603
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:03,410
I would sit that monkey on
a pile of solemn volumes,

604
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:08,415
and place in her hand a scrap of paper as if
it were a poem she'd just written, do you see?

605
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:16,215
And while she is offering the poem to
me, I am crowning her with the bays.

606
00:42:18,384 --> 00:42:22,763
I find Lady Rochester a more
elegant and interesting subject.

607
00:42:22,764 --> 00:42:25,390
You are wide of
the point, sir.

608
00:42:25,391 --> 00:42:28,769
Elegance, interest, all
very well in their way.

609
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,645
But what do they illuminate?

610
00:42:30,646 --> 00:42:33,315
Am I not then an apt
partner for you to sit with?

611
00:42:33,316 --> 00:42:35,734
You are apt, Elizabeth.
You are very apt.

612
00:42:35,735 --> 00:42:37,777
But you would rather be
painted with a monkey?

613
00:42:37,778 --> 00:42:40,239
It is of a muchness.

614
00:42:40,406 --> 00:42:43,575
You are both apt in
your different ways.

615
00:42:43,576 --> 00:42:48,788
In this portrait I am no better than a
monkey who knows the names of his ancestors.

616
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:51,209
And I?

617
00:42:53,544 --> 00:42:58,888
A gaudy female monkey, gloating
over the opulence of your cage.

618
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,144
I love London.

619
00:43:11,103 --> 00:43:14,105
Everyone catches its
generous spirit so quickly.

620
00:43:14,106 --> 00:43:15,942
Indeed.

621
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:20,613
I do not mean to upset people,
Alcock, but I have to speak my mind,

622
00:43:20,648 --> 00:43:23,382
because what is in my mind
is always more interesting

623
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:26,117
than what is happening in
the world outside my mind.

624
00:43:26,118 --> 00:43:30,778
Makes you impossible to live
with, though, do you see?

625
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:36,127
Did I once praise you
for your blunt manner?

626
00:43:36,128 --> 00:43:39,330
It was your reason
for employing me.

627
00:43:40,633 --> 00:43:44,636
It could as easy be your
grounds for dismissal.

628
00:43:44,637 --> 00:43:47,807
Now, get me the monkey.

629
00:44:09,662 --> 00:44:11,705
John.

630
00:44:13,165 --> 00:44:19,151
John, I could bear our marriage more
easily if there were no pretence.

631
00:44:19,171 --> 00:44:24,175
If I were merely a housekeeper
and a conduit for the noble line.

632
00:44:24,176 --> 00:44:30,181
But when you're away you write so
beguilingly of how you love me and.

633
00:44:30,182 --> 00:44:32,600
I do not think you
mean to torture me,

634
00:44:32,601 --> 00:44:35,186
but it is a torture to be
informed of passion from a distance

635
00:44:35,187 --> 00:44:38,767
and then in the flesh
to be so reviled.

636
00:44:39,191 --> 00:44:42,610
You know I always mean to
be well when we are together,

637
00:44:42,611 --> 00:44:47,198
but after a few weeks, I
find I have no gift for it.

638
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:50,071
In my mind I am
somewhere else.

639
00:44:50,703 --> 00:44:54,205
Then cut me out of your heart
completely and have done.

640
00:44:54,206 --> 00:44:58,209
Do not command me to do
something beyond my power.

641
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:01,379
Is the fault mine? If
I were a better wife.

642
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,715
would you not need the
whorehouse and the inn?

643
00:45:03,716 --> 00:45:07,218
Every man needs the
whorehouse and the inn.

644
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:13,224
But it's not the inn or a whore that I
see in your eyes. It's some other creature.

645
00:45:13,225 --> 00:45:15,269
The playhouse.

646
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,275
An actress.

647
00:45:23,235 --> 00:45:28,957
And when your eyes shone the other
day, they were shining for her.

648
00:45:29,741 --> 00:45:31,785
They were.

649
00:45:35,747 --> 00:45:41,715
I see I am more of an obstacle to
your London life than I supposed.

650
00:45:41,753 --> 00:45:44,361
I'll be gone by the morning.

651
00:45:56,768 --> 00:45:58,812
My lord.

652
00:46:05,861 --> 00:46:08,445
How is Ophelia in this scene?

653
00:46:09,364 --> 00:46:12,283
Well, she's mad.
She's out of her wits.

654
00:46:12,284 --> 00:46:15,369
There are many ways
to be out of your wits.

655
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:16,997
Yes.

656
00:46:17,372 --> 00:46:19,416
Well, there's grief.

657
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:21,418
And drink.

658
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,420
And love.

659
00:46:23,712 --> 00:46:25,422
So I hear.

660
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:29,384
These different states,
how would you show them?

661
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,428
Show them?

662
00:46:32,387 --> 00:46:34,767
Their physical manifestation.

663
00:46:37,893 --> 00:46:39,686
Close your eyes.

664
00:46:42,397 --> 00:46:44,441
Close your eyes.

665
00:47:13,303 --> 00:47:16,222
Oh, what a noble mind
is here o'erthrown

666
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:20,226
The courtier's, soldier's,
scholar's eye, tongue, sword and I

667
00:47:20,227 --> 00:47:21,693
Again

668
00:47:21,728 --> 00:47:25,189
Oh, what a noble mind
is here o'erthrown.

669
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:28,566
- The courtier's, soldier's.
- Again.

670
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:34,281
Oh, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown.
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye.

671
00:47:34,282 --> 00:47:35,450
Again

672
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:37,871
- Eye tongue sword
- Again!

673
00:47:37,911 --> 00:47:41,413
- Oh, what a noble mind is here
o'erthrown. is here o'erthrown

674
00:47:41,414 --> 00:47:43,124
The courtier's,
soldier's, scholar's.

675
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:45,396
- Again.
- What was wrong?

676
00:47:45,627 --> 00:47:48,421
You know what
was wrong. Again.

677
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:51,590
She has done this speech
20 times this afternoon.

678
00:47:51,591 --> 00:47:53,592
And she will do it 20 more.

679
00:47:53,593 --> 00:47:57,179
No-one has worked like this
in the history of the theatre

680
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:01,600
- Exactly.
- Oh, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown

681
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:06,591
The courtier's, soldier's,
scholar's, eye, tongue, sword.

682
00:48:07,107 --> 00:48:09,150
and I

683
00:48:09,442 --> 00:48:12,111
of ladies most
deject and wretched

684
00:48:12,112 --> 00:48:15,602
that sucked the honey
of his music vows

685
00:49:14,674 --> 00:49:18,803
O, what a noble mind
is here o'erthrown.

686
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:22,223
The courtier's,

687
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:24,349
soldier's, scholar's,

688
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:26,227
eye, tongue,

689
00:49:26,686 --> 00:49:28,730
sword,

690
00:49:29,689 --> 00:49:31,733
and I,

691
00:49:31,983 --> 00:49:34,963
of ladies most
deject and wretched

692
00:49:36,696 --> 00:49:40,616
that sucked the honey
of his music vows

693
00:49:43,244 --> 00:49:45,288
O, woe is me.

694
00:49:47,749 --> 00:49:50,069
To see what I have seen.

695
00:49:51,252 --> 00:49:53,296
O, see what I see.

696
00:49:54,255 --> 00:49:57,924
And there's some fennel
for you and columbine.

697
00:49:57,925 --> 00:50:00,245
And there's rue for you.

698
00:50:03,264 --> 00:50:05,452
And here's some for me.

699
00:50:08,769 --> 00:50:12,690
We may call it herb
of grace o' Sundays.

700
00:50:20,281 --> 00:50:24,994
O, you must wear your
rue with a difference.

701
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:31,834
He is gone

702
00:50:32,043 --> 00:50:33,836
He is gone

703
00:50:36,297 --> 00:50:38,341
And we.

704
00:50:38,633 --> 00:50:40,176
cast away, moan.

705
00:50:41,302 --> 00:50:43,688
God have mercy on his soul

706
00:50:45,306 --> 00:50:47,515
And of all ye Christian souls

707
00:50:47,516 --> 00:50:50,232
No-one likes a
clever bastard.

708
00:50:51,312 --> 00:50:53,356
I pray God

709
00:50:54,815 --> 00:50:56,859
God be wi' ye

710
00:51:21,133 --> 00:51:25,596
Well, Lizzie, my
congratulations.

711
00:51:27,139 --> 00:51:29,642
Thank you, Sr. Harris.

712
00:51:34,146 --> 00:51:36,481
Will you take the air with me?

713
00:51:36,482 --> 00:51:38,192
I was thinking.

714
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,194
a drink.

715
00:51:43,155 --> 00:51:46,267
Lord Rochester left
at the curtain.

716
00:51:49,161 --> 00:51:51,371
Then I shall take
the air alone.

717
00:51:51,372 --> 00:51:53,499
Good night.

718
00:52:02,007 --> 00:52:04,051
Go on!

719
00:52:18,524 --> 00:52:20,567
My lord.

720
00:52:22,027 --> 00:52:24,488
Hurry!

721
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,906
Argh!

722
00:52:41,547 --> 00:52:42,965
John

723
00:52:43,048 --> 00:52:45,550
Madam, this
driveway will not do.

724
00:52:45,551 --> 00:52:47,625
Good afternoon, my lord.

725
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:49,762
You sent no warning
of your arrival.

726
00:52:49,763 --> 00:52:52,557
The road is not functional
and the grounds are a swamp.

727
00:52:52,558 --> 00:52:59,063
If you were here more often, you'd know
that Oxfordshire is not a dry county.

728
00:52:59,064 --> 00:53:04,110
It is a good thing that John devote himself to
the House. I will not hear him reproved for it.

729
00:53:04,111 --> 00:53:08,531
lunderstood that he was devoting
himself to an engagement in the theatre.

730
00:53:08,532 --> 00:53:13,060
That would not be appropriate
for a man of breeding.

731
00:53:25,549 --> 00:53:27,516
Anyone can drink.

732
00:53:27,551 --> 00:53:31,305
Only a few can match
my determination.

733
00:53:31,555 --> 00:53:36,351
We who are nobility rise
above the calls of the flesh.

734
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,604
It is true.

735
00:53:38,812 --> 00:53:41,564
We have our strength
of will, do we not?

736
00:53:41,565 --> 00:53:43,442
I hope we do.

737
00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:50,631
But supposing we are perverse,

738
00:53:51,074 --> 00:53:54,244
and use our will to bad ends?

739
00:53:54,578 --> 00:53:57,756
Then we search deep
inside ourselves,

740
00:53:59,082 --> 00:54:02,127
and we tear out the evil.

741
00:54:12,095 --> 00:54:14,222
Tear deeper, Mother.

742
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,204
Lizzie Barry!

743
00:54:39,164 --> 00:54:41,208
Lizzie Barry!

744
00:54:43,543 --> 00:54:45,587
Lizzie Barry!

745
00:54:49,257 --> 00:54:53,761
I ran away from your love
and now I run towards it

746
00:54:53,762 --> 00:54:57,144
Test my love in
any way you see fit!

747
00:54:57,265 --> 00:54:59,309
Test me!

748
00:55:00,644 --> 00:55:02,190
I will not fail!

749
00:55:57,867 --> 00:55:59,619
15.

750
00:55:59,953 --> 00:56:05,165
Get back some of the money I
lost on Lizzie "Horseface" Barry.

751
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:08,986
Yes, how is that little
caper going, Johnny?

752
00:56:09,212 --> 00:56:12,216
I hear she charges
by the minute.

753
00:56:15,718 --> 00:56:18,720
Come on, Johnny. All
gentlemen together.

754
00:56:18,721 --> 00:56:21,503
You're not a
gentleman, George.

755
00:56:21,724 --> 00:56:25,227
You were trained as a lawyer.
And you write plays for money.

756
00:56:25,228 --> 00:56:30,232
Oh, yes. And what about your commission
from the King? Does that not count?

757
00:56:30,233 --> 00:56:32,109
That is quite different.

758
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:34,153
"Different"? Of course.

759
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:39,533
May one enquire how the
great work progresses?

760
00:56:39,534 --> 00:56:42,245
Written the first line yet?

761
00:56:42,453 --> 00:56:48,417
I, at least, do not plagiarise the wit
of my friends and pass it off as my own.

762
00:56:48,418 --> 00:56:50,648
Come on, Johnny, be fair.

763
00:57:00,826 --> 00:57:02,786
Sit!

764
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:10,460
<i>What was the wager?</i>

765
00:57:10,878 --> 00:57:13,380
The wager was 15 guineas.

766
00:57:15,883 --> 00:57:19,886
My Lord, the actress
Elizabeth Barry's outside.

767
00:57:19,887 --> 00:57:21,930
She will wait.

768
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:25,183
She's very insistent.

769
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:28,403
She is a whore
and she will wait!

770
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:44,036
It's a made hand!

771
00:57:44,202 --> 00:57:46,495
I was not good in the
play this afternoon.

772
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,540
I craved reassurance.

773
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:52,503
All I could think
about was you.

774
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:59,008
You see, that is where there
is still imbalance between us.

775
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:04,179
Because you demand so much of
me and so little of yourself.

776
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:09,018
You took my small gift and
polished it until it shone.

777
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:12,929
Yet your own great gift
you just throw away.

778
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:16,568
There.

779
00:58:16,735 --> 00:58:18,989
You see? I went too far.

780
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:24,723
A trait which in you is
fascinating, but in me is a fault.

781
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:49,058
"And wit was his
vain, frivolous pretence,

782
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:52,459
of pleasing others
at his own expense."

783
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,113
Lizzie Barry.

784
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:10,622
Read me some more.

785
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:40,836
<i>KING CHARLES II: I keep
coming back to the French</i>

786
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:44,340
- There they are, the envy of Europe.
- They keep a nice class of brothel.

787
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:47,342
Of course. They're a bunch of
cunts. That's not the point.

788
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:52,347
I need money and they can provide it, and I
won't hide it from you, Johnny, things are bad.

789
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:55,642
I can't get money out of Louis
unless I dissolve Parliament

790
01:00:55,643 --> 01:00:58,562
and I can't get money out of
Parliament unless I fight Louis.

791
01:00:58,563 --> 01:01:00,356
Well, choose.

792
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:03,066
Ineed money from both of them.

793
01:01:03,067 --> 01:01:04,826
You spoke of a big challenge.

794
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:07,863
Louis's sent in a new
ambassador. Cultivated type.

795
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:09,866
Here's my plan.

796
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:13,577
Your great work, we stage
it to welcome him to London.

797
01:01:13,578 --> 01:01:15,662
Big gesture of friendship.

798
01:01:15,663 --> 01:01:17,873
And we show we're
better than they are.

799
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:21,084
A spectacle with some
really profound writing.

800
01:01:21,085 --> 01:01:22,878
You're the man for it.

801
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,846
Will you do it for me?

802
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:28,341
At Betterton's next spring
when the season's finished.

803
01:01:28,342 --> 01:01:30,351
You're desperate.

804
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:33,597
What we need to
celebrate is life itself.

805
01:01:33,598 --> 01:01:37,518
Well, I'm obviously
the man for that.

806
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:41,354
Good. I'll send Chiffinch to
talk to you about the money.

807
01:01:41,355 --> 01:01:44,441
Costumes, settings,
something really splendid.

808
01:01:44,442 --> 01:01:45,902
Splendid, yes.

809
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,404
And unusual.

810
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:51,407
There, John.

811
01:01:51,442 --> 01:01:53,409
Fruit.

812
01:01:53,868 --> 01:01:57,244
Fruit from South
America growing here.

813
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,881
Dazzles the mind.

814
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:05,062
Do you see what can be done
with knowledge and application?

815
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:19,310
"I eat to swive and
swive to eat again."

816
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:27,610
Ink! Ink!

817
01:02:27,645 --> 01:02:29,612
Bring me ink!

818
01:02:36,118 --> 01:02:38,829
Not "drink", lump. Ink!

819
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:43,500
Alcock, did I not leave
you in the country?

820
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:45,599
I walked back, my lord.

821
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:53,052
Back again?

822
01:02:53,087 --> 01:02:55,019
Back again.

823
01:02:55,054 --> 01:02:57,056
Sceptres bear. Fear.

824
01:03:11,904 --> 01:03:15,740
I'm worried. This French business
couldn't be more important.

825
01:03:15,741 --> 01:03:17,743
What's he doing?

826
01:03:19,745 --> 01:03:21,712
He's writing.

827
01:03:21,747 --> 01:03:26,431
<i>- For the first time since I've known him
- But what?</i>

828
01:03:27,211 --> 01:03:29,234
Sublime thoughts.

829
01:03:29,269 --> 01:03:31,257
Philosophy in verse.

830
01:03:32,258 --> 01:03:35,760
I believe he is on
the verge of greatness.

831
01:03:35,761 --> 01:03:37,763
<i>You've read some?</i>

832
01:03:38,764 --> 01:03:41,258
He shares everything with me.

833
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:46,962
You should wear
more jewellery.

834
01:03:47,272 --> 01:03:50,274
<i>LIZZIE: I cannot
provide for i on my wages</i>

835
01:03:50,275 --> 01:03:52,485
<i>CHARLES II: Does
not the Earl provide?</i>

836
01:03:52,486 --> 01:03:54,696
The Earl is not one
of life's providers.

837
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,664
But the King is.

838
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:01,119
If you want the best, you
may receive it from me.

839
01:04:02,204 --> 01:04:04,706
I shall be everything
you wish me to be.

840
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:09,283
I wish you to be my eyes
and ears on his earlship.

841
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:11,714
I am his lover.

842
01:04:13,215 --> 01:04:15,667
But I am your true subject.

843
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:20,011
Then you'll serve
me in this matter?

844
01:04:20,722 --> 01:04:22,724
Yes, I will.

845
01:04:25,727 --> 01:04:28,814
And we shall both profit.

846
01:05:36,965 --> 01:05:42,012
Does the writing of the
play go well, my lord?

847
01:05:43,972 --> 01:05:48,185
Alcock, try not to be a cunt.

848
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:52,480
We will do this until
you get it right.

849
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:54,982
My lord, Alice
Twooney has sent word.

850
01:05:54,983 --> 01:05:57,985
Her child is sick
and she shan't come.

851
01:05:57,986 --> 01:06:00,240
What was to be her role?

852
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:04,351
<i>- She was playing little Clytoris.
- Of course</i>

853
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:05,869
Alcock!

854
01:06:08,997 --> 01:06:12,208
- This is your moment. You will stand in for her.
- No, my lord.

855
01:06:12,209 --> 01:06:15,002
- I beg your pardon.
- I'm Alcock.

856
01:06:15,003 --> 01:06:18,049
Little Clytoris
is beyond my range.

857
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:20,175
Molly.

858
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:23,303
I am not a visible person.

859
01:06:23,678 --> 01:06:25,722
Do not cross me.

860
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:32,687
Madam, your dildos are not to
compare with what I've seen.

861
01:06:32,854 --> 01:06:35,282
Indeed, they're paltry ware.

862
01:06:35,857 --> 01:06:39,110
Short dildos leave the
pleasure half undone.

863
01:06:39,145 --> 01:06:42,363
I'm sorry, my lord,
I do have a question.

864
01:06:42,364 --> 01:06:49,586
Are you sure this entertainment will be
fitting for both the occasion and the company?

865
01:06:49,788 --> 01:06:53,707
Molly, the entire piece has been
devised with the French in mind.

866
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:59,296
In Paris, fornication in the streets
with total strangers is compulsory.

867
01:06:59,297 --> 01:07:03,300
Oh, beg pardon, my lord, my
most southerly venture is Epsom.

868
01:07:03,301 --> 01:07:05,095
<i>HARRIS: My lord!</i>

869
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:06,804
I asked for no interruptions.

870
01:07:06,805 --> 01:07:09,098
My suit is one of
the utmost urgency.

871
01:07:09,099 --> 01:07:12,309
The stage direction at the
end of this scene requires,

872
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:15,312
in my opinion, some
authorial exposition.

873
01:07:15,313 --> 01:07:17,315
It seems
straightforward enough.

874
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:19,192
Yes. Um.

875
01:07:19,317 --> 01:07:22,319
"Then dance six
naked men and women,

876
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:26,031
the men doing obedience
to the women's cunts,

877
01:07:26,032 --> 01:07:27,791
kissing and
touching them often.

878
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:31,328
The women in like manner
to the men's pricks,

879
01:07:31,329 --> 01:07:34,087
kissing and
dandling their cods,

880
01:07:34,207 --> 01:07:35,799
and then fall to fucking,

881
01:07:35,834 --> 01:07:41,338
after which the women sigh and the
men look simple, and so sneak off."

882
01:07:41,339 --> 01:07:43,675
<i>The end of the second act</i>

883
01:07:43,842 --> 01:07:45,635
A strong scene.

884
01:07:45,802 --> 01:07:50,764
An eminently playable scene, and,
though I say it myself, a climactic one.

885
01:07:50,765 --> 01:07:54,768
And will the kind of equipment
that young lady has in her hand

886
01:07:54,769 --> 01:07:57,527
be available to
gentlemen for.

887
01:07:58,273 --> 01:08:03,277
strapping around the middle
for the execution of this scene?

888
01:08:03,278 --> 01:08:07,188
I had not envisaged
you to be so encumbered.

889
01:08:07,282 --> 01:08:12,203
I feel the scene should
be given in the flesh.

890
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:16,624
And will we give two
performances on the day?

891
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:18,626
No, Sr. Harris.

892
01:08:18,835 --> 01:08:21,795
Oh, I am glad to hear
that from the author.

893
01:08:21,796 --> 01:08:26,550
With the dress rehearsal, the court performance
and the public showing, I envisage three.

894
01:08:26,551 --> 01:08:31,471
Right. I don't know if you've met
my regular understudy, Sr. Lightman.

895
01:08:31,472 --> 01:08:33,807
He's a most dependable fellow.

896
01:08:33,808 --> 01:08:36,476
Sir, you have the honour
of playing my understudy.

897
01:08:36,477 --> 01:08:42,151
Well, I shall take this opportunity
to withdraw from the engagement.

898
01:08:42,483 --> 01:08:45,619
You are one of
life's understudies!

899
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:03,690
If tonight goes wrong, we'll
be at war within a week.

900
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:08,176
Have faith.

901
01:09:08,342 --> 01:09:13,662
Whatever else may go wrong, your
words will command admiration.

902
01:09:14,682 --> 01:09:16,684
They always do.

903
01:09:19,187 --> 01:09:22,315
Lizzie. You're looking pale.

904
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:26,638
Molly, work the magic
of your art on Sra. Barry.

905
01:09:36,787 --> 01:09:39,347
There's the French ambassador.

906
01:09:46,464 --> 01:09:48,257
No. Makes me weepy.

907
01:09:50,468 --> 01:09:54,804
* All you ladies of Merrie England who
have been to kiss the duchess's hand

908
01:09:54,805 --> 01:09:58,427
* Pray did you lately
observe in the show

909
01:09:58,517 --> 01:10:01,761
* A noble Italian
called Signor Dildo?

910
01:10:03,147 --> 01:10:05,982
I weep, but from
a different end.

911
01:10:05,983 --> 01:10:09,945
* Who helped to conduct
her over the Main

912
01:10:10,404 --> 01:10:13,698
* But now she cries out,
"To the Duke I will go"

913
01:10:13,699 --> 01:10:17,620
* "I have no more
need for Signor Dildo!"

914
01:10:41,435 --> 01:10:45,189
* The good Lady Southesk
broke into a laugh

915
01:10:45,689 --> 01:10:48,711
Very good, this
Italian workmanship.

916
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,862
People pay more for quality.

917
01:10:52,029 --> 01:10:55,032
* The fops were undone,
did their graces but know

918
01:10:55,067 --> 01:10:57,283
* The discretion and
vigour of Signor Dildo

919
01:10:57,284 --> 01:11:00,787
I'd like to meet the
man who wrote this.

920
01:11:00,788 --> 01:11:04,674
* Then away with these
nasty devices and show

921
01:11:04,917 --> 01:11:07,543
* How you rate the just
merits of Signor Dildo

922
01:11:07,544 --> 01:11:12,216
* Ooh, aah, Signor Dildo

923
01:11:12,341 --> 01:11:14,415
* Ooh, aah, Signor Dildo

924
01:12:18,532 --> 01:12:22,578
Thus in the zenith
of my lust I reign.

925
01:12:22,703 --> 01:12:26,373
I eat to swive and
swive to eat again.

926
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:31,795
<i>Let other monarchs who their sceptres bear
to keep their subjects less in love than fear</i>

927
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:34,339
<i>be slaves to crowns</i>

928
01:12:34,548 --> 01:12:39,784
My nation shall be free. My
pintle only shall my sceptre be.

929
01:12:39,845 --> 01:12:42,888
<i>My laws shall act more
pleasure than command</i>

930
01:12:42,889 --> 01:12:47,477
and with my prick, I'll
govern all the land.

931
01:12:47,603 --> 01:12:49,645
Chas, tell me this
ain't happening.

932
01:12:49,646 --> 01:12:53,399
He's gonna get his prick out any
second. I can feel it in my water.

933
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:57,903
It's very amusing, because in
France he would be executed for this.

934
01:12:57,904 --> 01:13:02,366
<i>The King commands all men
from humid cunt to humane arsonist</i>

935

<i>Buggery we choose and
buggery we'll allow</i>

936

<i>I do proclaim the manly arse so

937
01:13:10,417 --> 01:13:12,044

938
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:16,690
CHARLES II: Lord Rochester,
this portrayal of yours.

939
01:13:17,257 --> 01:13:20,134
would it be based on
a particular monarch?

940
01:13:20,135 --> 01:13:21,928
No, Your Highness.

941
01:13:22,262 --> 01:13:28,100
My character is far too fantastic a
creation ever to have drawn breath.

942
01:13:28,101 --> 01:13:31,312
Now resume your seat.
You're intruding on my stage.

943
01:13:31,313 --> 01:13:33,773
No, you're intruding on mine.

944
01:13:33,774 --> 01:13:39,404
I hand you a chance to show your shining
talent and what do you give me in return?

945
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:45,034
A pornographic representation of a royal
court where the men deal only in buggery

946
01:13:45,035 --> 01:13:49,330
and the women's sole object
of interest is the dildo!

947
01:13:49,331 --> 01:13:51,627
A monument to your reign.

948
01:13:52,959 --> 01:13:54,252
Johnny!

949
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:13,200
Disappear? People
don't disappear.

950
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,235
Monsieur Barrillon.

951
01:14:19,402 --> 01:14:26,606
Your Majesty, it is with regret that I
must make my return to France tout de suite.

952
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:46,262
I hate racing.

953
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:49,139
The sport of kings?
The sport of peasants!

954
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:52,184
Come on, Georgie. You
like it when you win.

955
01:14:52,185 --> 01:14:56,095
I must have seen the
backside of £60 today.

956
01:14:56,106 --> 01:14:58,190
<i>I could have bought a horse.</i>

957
01:14:58,191 --> 01:15:03,112
Vanishing Spark. Why did you let me
bet on a horse called Vanishing Spark?

958
01:15:03,113 --> 01:15:04,437
What the fuck?

959
01:15:05,698 --> 01:15:07,492
Johnny?

960
01:15:08,451 --> 01:15:09,953
<i>Gents</i>

961
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:13,412
spare a drink for
a couple of chums?

962
01:15:13,873 --> 01:15:15,332
Where've you been?

963
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:19,177
Our show was such a
success in the capital,

964
01:15:19,379 --> 01:15:23,382
we had to undertake an
extensive tour of the provinces.

965
01:15:23,383 --> 01:15:27,811
Now, where's the
fucking drink?

966
01:15:27,846 --> 01:15:30,722
Come on, Charlie,
get out your winnings.

967
01:15:30,723 --> 01:15:33,691
<i>CHARLIE: This is i gentlemen!</i>

968
01:15:33,726 --> 01:15:39,690
This is the residence of the whore
personally recommended by Sr. Dryden himself,

969
01:15:39,691 --> 01:15:41,817
<i>who glories in the
name of Molly Noakes</i>

970
01:15:41,818 --> 01:15:44,027
Well, what are we waiting for?

971
01:15:44,028 --> 01:15:46,822
<i>- Open up, keepers of the gate!
- Molly!</i>

972
01:15:46,823 --> 01:15:48,700
Molly!

973
01:15:48,783 --> 01:15:50,827
- Molly.
- Molly!

974
01:15:51,077 --> 01:15:53,328
- Gentlemen?
Where's Molly?

975
01:15:53,329 --> 01:15:55,831
We want Molly
and we want her fast.

976
01:15:55,832 --> 01:15:59,334
Young man, you are
pissing on my top boots.

977
01:15:59,335 --> 01:16:02,838
Yes, fellow. But you are
a whorehouse doorstep man

978
01:16:02,839 --> 01:16:06,131
and we are the
cream of the country.

979
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,818
I am Constable of the Watch.

980
01:16:09,846 --> 01:16:12,347
Dryden can't even
write a shag map.

981
01:16:12,348 --> 01:16:15,442
You, sir, are a
rogue and a liar.

982
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:17,687
Murder!

983
01:16:17,812 --> 01:16:18,896
<i>Help!</i>

984
01:16:30,867 --> 01:16:33,244
Now, then, gentlemen.

985
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:38,832
I do believe there's been
a small species of error.

986
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:41,210
<i>We are Johnny! Johnny!</i>

987
01:16:41,377 --> 01:16:42,962

988
01:16:43,296 --> 01:16:44,881
No!

989
01:16:46,799 --> 01:16:47,425
Argh!

990
01:16:48,301 --> 01:16:49,468
Argh!

991
01:16:49,802 --> 01:16:52,013

992
01:17:15,912 --> 01:17:17,955
Johnny, please.

993
01:17:22,918 --> 01:17:24,962
Johnny!

994
01:17:38,434 --> 01:17:40,478
I told you.

995
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:47,878
<i>CHARLES II: It's

01:17:50,946 --> 01:17:52,364
<i>Find him</i>

998
01:17:52,448 --> 01:17:53,657
Your Majesty.

01:18:07,463 --> 01:18:10,465
<i>I find myself at

<i>But I will rise again to right this
injustice and take back your heart</i>

1004
01:18:31,487 --> 01:18:36,081
The mercury cures the pox,
but it scrambles the mind.

1005
01:18:37,993 --> 01:18:40,286
Poses a problem for
a gent, does it not?

1006
01:18:40,287 --> 01:18:41,996
The prick or the brain?

1007
01:18:41,997 --> 01:18:44,792
Shh. Johnny, shush.

1008
01:19:03,185 --> 01:19:09,261
He's been seen in Cheapside,
accompanied by a serving man and a whore.

1009
01:19:09,692 --> 01:19:12,193
If he's very drunk,
he'll be no problem.

1010
01:19:12,194 --> 01:19:14,487
If he's a bit
drunk, be careful.

1011
01:19:14,488 --> 01:19:16,740
What if he's sober?

1012
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:19,376
You've got the wrong man.

1013
01:19:22,204 --> 01:19:24,248

Listen well.

1016
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:32,005
For I got a doctor's
cure to sell.

1017
01:19:32,172 --> 01:19:36,927
Mouth, stomach,
knees and toes.

1018
01:19:37,219 --> 01:19:41,348
All be cured by Dr. Bendo.

1019
01:19:45,727 --> 01:19:47,980
Little chicken.

1020
01:19:56,572 --> 01:19:58,490

01:20:38,697 --> 01:20:42,284
In flatuo. In flatuo.

1026
01:20:42,701 --> 01:20:46,955
The French, Parliament,
his syphilitic earlship.

1027
01:20:47,456 --> 01:20:51,876
I'm being pissed on from half
a dozen directions at once,

1028
01:20:51,877 --> 01:20:55,379
and it don't accord
with my majestic dignity.

1029
01:20:55,380 --> 01:21:00,050
We have three confirmed sightings.
Our sources are impeccable.

1030
01:21:00,051 --> 01:21:02,095
Take me to them. Now.

1031
01:21:03,054 --> 01:21:05,556
I've shut up shop for the day.

1032
01:21:05,557 --> 01:21:08,231
I had to turn 40 people away.

1033
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:13,063
I think it mean work cozening
citizens of their money.

1034
01:21:13,064 --> 01:21:15,108
We made £80 today.

1035
01:21:15,317 --> 01:21:18,068
We are here for
our recreation.

1036
01:21:18,069 --> 01:21:20,571
<i>We're here cos we
can't show our faces.</i>

1037
01:21:20,572 --> 01:21:24,576
Do you ever think on
our Lord Jesus Christ?

1038
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:31,582
He was cast like me
into the wilderness.

1039
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:33,945
He was scorned and reviled.

1040
01:21:35,587 --> 01:21:38,255
He was betrayed
by his followers.

1041
01:21:38,256 --> 01:21:43,761
I believe that in most respects, his life
was of a different character from yours.

1042
01:21:43,762 --> 01:21:47,598
He would have brought
Billy Downs back from death.

1043
01:21:47,599 --> 01:21:50,489
Ach, these are
wandering thoughts.

1044
01:21:57,609 --> 01:21:59,361
Leave me.

1045
01:22:02,614 --> 01:22:04,616
Go!

1046
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:16,419
Johnny!

1047
01:22:18,797 --> 01:22:20,263
Johnny!

1048
01:22:20,298 --> 01:22:22,717
<i>Argh! Johnny!</i>

1049
01:22:25,804 --> 01:22:27,389
Leave him alone!

1050
01:22:28,807 --> 01:22:30,850
On your knees.

1051
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,863
I'm not impressed.

1052
01:22:45,323 --> 01:22:48,903
It has taken you six
months to find me.

1053
01:22:48,993 --> 01:22:53,497
You think in six months I've given
you more than five minutes' thought?

1054
01:22:53,498 --> 01:22:56,500
Those Parliament bastards
are trying to shaft me again

1055
01:22:56,501 --> 01:22:59,711
<i>wih the new bill to
exclude my successors</i>

1056
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:01,130
Subtle.

1057
01:23:01,297 --> 01:23:07,344
Instead of chopping kings' heads off,
you pick and choose the ones you want.

1058
01:23:07,345 --> 01:23:10,431
That's my civil war. Not you.

1059
01:23:18,147 --> 01:23:24,194
Sr. Etherege is packing out the Dorset Gardens
with you as the greatest spark on Earth.

1060
01:23:24,195 --> 01:23:29,199
The East End is throwing down its
purse for you to be a quack doctor.

1061
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:34,913
And the town has you branded as a coward
who leaves his friend to die in a brawl.

1062
01:23:34,914 --> 01:23:37,061
All men would be cowards.

1063
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:39,209
if they only had the courage.

1064
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:41,921
The boy died and you ran off.

1065
01:23:42,171 --> 01:23:45,355
I have to go too
far, do you see?

1066
01:23:46,175 --> 01:23:49,219
I must always exceed or I
do not feel like I'm alive.

1067
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:54,516
And that's why the great epic about my reign
became a squalid little play about knobbing.

1068
01:23:54,517 --> 01:23:56,903
And that's why Downs died.

1069
01:24:01,733 --> 01:24:05,355
I thought about putting
you in the Tower.

1070
01:24:08,739 --> 01:24:12,847
I even considered putting
your head on a spike.

1071
01:24:13,661 --> 01:24:16,863
But I've decided
on something worse.

1072
01:24:17,665 --> 01:24:19,853
<i>I'm going to ignore you</i>

1073
01:24:21,085 --> 01:24:26,189
I will no longer encourage
any hope in my breast for you.

1074
01:24:26,799 --> 01:24:29,342
I am condemning you to be you,

1075
01:24:29,343 --> 01:24:31,663
<i>for the rest of your days</i>

1076
01:25:02,209 --> 01:25:04,307
How I hate the country.

1077
01:25:16,724 --> 01:25:18,476
Drink.

1078
01:25:19,727 --> 01:25:21,020
Drink!

1079
01:25:36,243 --> 01:25:38,244
The shelves are
empty, my lord.

1080
01:25:38,245 --> 01:25:40,409
Go to the cellars, cunt!

1081
01:25:41,749 --> 01:25:44,687
I said, find me
a fucking drink.

1082
01:26:31,006 --> 01:26:35,051
Are you unable to discharge
your duties as housekeeper?

1083
01:26:35,052 --> 01:26:38,632
<i>I fear this
is the last my lord</i>

1084
01:26:39,556 --> 01:26:42,517
Elizabeth, why has the
cellar not been replenished?

1085
01:26:42,518 --> 01:26:43,811
Leave us.

1086
01:26:45,062 --> 01:26:46,438
Leave us!

1087
01:26:46,522 --> 01:26:48,649
My lady.

1088
01:27:04,248 --> 01:27:08,042
I am ever your last resort. When your
mistress has kicked you into the street

1089
01:27:08,043 --> 01:27:11,254
and the last whore in Covent
Garden refuses to attend to you,

1090
01:27:11,255 --> 01:27:13,256
then and only then
do you come to me!

1091
01:27:13,257 --> 01:27:18,428
I think you will never be a contented
woman until you are a much-respected widow.

1092
01:27:18,463 --> 01:27:22,056
And I am hard at work on doing
you that last good service.

1093
01:27:22,057 --> 01:27:27,959
I don't want you to die! I want
you to live, and live differently!

1094
01:27:29,356 --> 01:27:31,400
- Ow!
- Stop it!

1095
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:40,868
Elizabeth!

1096
01:27:42,452 --> 01:27:45,997
Why? If it's good for you,
is it not good for me, too?

1097
01:27:45,998 --> 01:27:51,324
- It is not good for me.
- Why then do you pursue that path?

1098
01:27:52,212 --> 01:27:55,150
When were you
last a sober man?

1099
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:02,222
Three years.

1100
01:28:03,223 --> 01:28:05,225
No, four.

1101
01:28:06,727 --> 01:28:08,729
Four years ago.

1102
01:28:09,730 --> 01:28:12,607
Five. Five.

1103
01:28:12,733 --> 01:28:16,223
And are you not,
John, a rational man?

1104
01:28:16,737 --> 01:28:19,739
Has not your intellect
been widely praised?

1105
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:22,242
It has.

1106
01:28:22,451 --> 01:28:24,493
So, this man of intellect,

1107
01:28:24,494 --> 01:28:26,461
this rational man,

1108
01:28:26,496 --> 01:28:31,500
knowing that five years of constant drinking
have rendered his body feeble and his spirit low,

1109
01:28:31,501 --> 01:28:33,468
<i>what would this
man of intellect do?</i>

1110
01:28:33,503 --> 01:28:37,006
- You seek to trap me like a cunning lawyer!
- What would he do?

1111
01:28:37,007 --> 01:28:39,801
He would desist! Cunt!

1112
01:28:39,843 --> 01:28:42,178
Yes, he would desist.
And those he loved,

1113
01:28:42,179 --> 01:28:45,181
would they not show their love
by beseeching him to desist?

1114
01:28:45,182 --> 01:28:48,120
It is not so
simple, my darling.

1115
01:29:28,725 --> 01:29:31,477
I've heard men say that
the devil is in you.

1116
01:29:31,478 --> 01:29:35,766
If that be so, I know
how he made his entrance.

1117
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:49,098
He has suffered much both in
sickness and in reputation.

1118
01:29:50,747 --> 01:29:52,791
You're a man of God.

1119
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:55,668
Bring my son to him.

1120
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:05,970
My son,

1121
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:10,265
God has seen fit to visit
these terrible diseases on you.

1122
01:30:10,266 --> 01:30:15,771
But it torments me less as a mother to
see you die in agony in the arms of God.

1123
01:30:15,772 --> 01:30:18,066
than live an atheist.

1124
01:30:18,274 --> 01:30:19,901
Mother.

1125
01:30:45,969 --> 01:30:49,097
If God wants men
to have faith,

1126
01:30:51,224 --> 01:30:54,226
why does he not make us
more disposed to believe?

1127
01:30:54,227 --> 01:30:57,480
Most men are so disposed.

1128
01:30:58,231 --> 01:30:59,941
But not me.

1129
01:31:00,149 --> 01:31:03,235
Because you set your
reason against religion.

1130
01:31:03,236 --> 01:31:04,904
I despised reason.

1131
01:31:05,238 --> 01:31:07,282
You clung to reason.

1132
01:31:08,241 --> 01:31:13,147
You laughed in the face of
God with the aid of reason.

1133
01:31:14,247 --> 01:31:16,675
Speak me that speech again.

1134
01:31:18,251 --> 01:31:20,325
Those words from Isaiah.

1135
01:31:24,257 --> 01:31:28,261
"And he is despised
and rejected of men.

1136
01:31:29,762 --> 01:31:31,806
A man of sorrows.

1137
01:31:33,266 --> 01:31:35,670
and acquainted with grief."

1138
01:31:36,269 --> 01:31:39,147
And we hid our faces from him.

1139
01:31:40,773 --> 01:31:43,276
God, raise me from this bed

1140
01:31:43,568 --> 01:31:45,558
<i>to do what I must do</i>

1141
01:31:48,531 --> 01:31:51,950
We've taken soundings. It's very
close. We may be 15 votes short.

1142
01:31:51,951 --> 01:31:54,995
The House cannot give way
to the King on this matter!

1143
01:31:54,996 --> 01:31:57,118
Then get me 15 votes.

1144
01:31:57,123 --> 01:31:59,457
And I believe it will not!

1145
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:01,043
Hear, hear!

1146
01:32:09,302 --> 01:32:12,388
The Earl of Rochester.

1147
01:32:14,015 --> 01:32:16,058
<i>Coward!</i>

1148
01:32:17,393 --> 01:32:20,146
<i>Coward</i>

1149
01:32:27,153 --> 01:32:29,196
My lord.

1150
01:32:30,656 --> 01:32:36,161
the bill before us would seek to bar the
King's brother from succeeding to the throne

1151
01:32:36,162 --> 01:32:39,520
on the grounds that
he is a Catholic.

1152
01:32:40,666 --> 01:32:44,128
<i>And for this reason
i has been said</i>

1153
01:32:44,503 --> 01:32:48,941
that no good Protestant
can speak against this bill.

1154
01:32:49,925 --> 01:32:56,015
And yet, sir, I cannot forbear to
offer some objections against it.

1155
01:32:57,433 --> 01:33:03,898
But the question will arise in the
minds of some lords here present.

1156
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:07,590
as to whether I am indeed.

1157
01:33:08,944 --> 01:33:10,946
a good Protestant.

1158
01:33:14,408 --> 01:33:16,417
No man here

1159
01:33:16,452 --> 01:33:18,454
will question, I hope,

1160
01:33:20,956 --> 01:33:22,958
my goodness.

1161
01:33:23,918 --> 01:33:27,963
in any one of the three
chief pursuits of our age,

1162
01:33:27,998 --> 01:33:29,964
the scribbling of verses,

1163
01:33:29,965 --> 01:33:32,384
the emptying of bottles,

1164
01:33:33,469 --> 01:33:35,831
and the filling of wenches.

1165
01:33:37,973 --> 01:33:41,976
There may be those with a
claim to be as good as I,

1166
01:33:41,977 --> 01:33:46,190
but taking these three
pursuits simultaneously.

1167
01:33:47,066 --> 01:33:49,317
and, sir, I
have so taken them,

1168
01:33:49,318 --> 01:33:55,658
and can vouch that considerable
manual dexterity is required,

1169
01:33:56,825 --> 01:34:01,914
I cannot be equaled,
let alone bettered.

1170
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:11,048
So, let not my
goodness be questioned.

1171
01:34:19,348 --> 01:34:24,254
<i>It is not so many years since
our present king's father</i>

1172
01:34:24,436 --> 01:34:30,710
was killed on a kind of stage,
outside the walls of this very building.

1173
01:34:31,527 --> 01:34:38,409
And, in time, his murderers were
condemned and themselves executed.

1174
01:34:39,284 --> 01:34:41,328
But.

1175
01:34:41,412 --> 01:34:45,624
were they condemned
without being heard?

1176
01:34:48,794 --> 01:34:50,838
They were not.

1177
01:34:52,297 --> 01:34:59,303
In spite of the certainty of their guilt and
the horrid weight of their cowardly crime,

1178
01:34:59,304 --> 01:35:03,600
they were allowed the
due process of law.

1179
01:35:05,811 --> 01:35:09,313
But what is suggested
before this House.

1180
01:35:09,314 --> 01:35:13,902
is that we condemn that
murdered king's second son

1181
01:35:13,986 --> 01:35:18,094
with less shrift than
was given to his killers.

1182
01:35:20,325 --> 01:35:24,496
My lord, let us have justice.

1183
01:35:26,331 --> 01:35:34,298
<i>When the time arrives for our good
and present king to be taken from us</i>

1184
01:35:36,842 --> 01:35:43,248
let then his Catholic brother be
impeached in this House in the normal way.

1185
01:35:44,349 --> 01:35:50,935
And if he be found wanting, then let
his head be chopped off at the neck.

1186
01:35:52,691 --> 01:35:56,271
<i>if the House feel
that is what he meris</i>

1187
01:35:58,697 --> 01:36:00,741
<i>For my part</i>

1188
01:36:00,907 --> 01:36:06,704
I shall believe my oath of allegiance
to the throne to be a thing inviolable.

1189
01:36:06,705 --> 01:36:11,208
and that whatever the faith
of the successor to the throne,

1190
01:36:11,209 --> 01:36:17,132
his pre-eminence in the
royal lineage must hold sway

1191
01:36:17,215 --> 01:36:20,218
over all other considerations.

1192
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:24,264
Sir,

1193
01:36:24,723 --> 01:36:27,142
my humble motion.

1194
01:36:28,226 --> 01:36:30,366
is that the monarchy.

1195
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:32,272
be upheld.

1196
01:36:33,231 --> 01:36:40,572
and this meddlesome and fractious
bill be thrown out forever.

1197
01:36:40,739 --> 01:36:42,782
Hear, hear!

1198
01:36:45,243 --> 01:36:49,087
<i>Kings are kings! You
can't pick and choose!</i>

1199
01:36:49,247 --> 01:36:51,699
<i>Throw it out! Throw it out!</i>

1200
01:36:52,751 --> 01:36:54,794
<i>He spoke for us all!</i>

1201
01:37:15,857 --> 01:37:17,859
Johnny.

1202
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,362
You did it.

1203
01:37:21,363 --> 01:37:24,277
You finally did
something for me.

1204
01:37:24,366 --> 01:37:26,368
I didn't do it for you.

1205
01:37:26,403 --> 01:37:28,370
I did it for me.

1206
01:37:31,873 --> 01:37:34,542
Your Majesty, we won.

1207
01:37:34,876 --> 01:37:36,503
By 40 votes.

1208
01:37:44,803 --> 01:37:46,805
There you are, Johnny.

1209
01:37:48,306 --> 01:37:50,308
You did it.

1210
01:37:53,937 --> 01:37:55,396
Molly.

1211
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:58,982
I've brought in the Earl
to gawp at my triumph.

1212
01:37:58,983 --> 01:38:02,319
Authors have a place, senhor.
Etherege. It is in the garret.

1213
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,446
I do not like them
cluttering up my theatre.

1214
01:38:04,447 --> 01:38:07,991
Lizzie won't see him. She won't
see Johnny. This is the only way.

1215
01:38:07,992 --> 01:38:09,993
I don't want her upset.

1216
01:38:09,994 --> 01:38:12,496
I could have written
a splendid play.

1217
01:38:12,497 --> 01:38:14,499
No, you couldn't.

1218
01:38:14,534 --> 01:38:16,466
The Man Of Mode.

1219
01:38:16,501 --> 01:38:20,279
The spirit of the age
caught for all time.

1220
01:38:20,505 --> 01:38:22,298
I did it.

1221
01:38:22,507 --> 01:38:26,507
You didn't, because
you don't have the gift.

1222
01:38:29,013 --> 01:38:30,682
Gentle George.

1223
01:38:37,522 --> 01:38:41,300
- What is he doing here?
- Don't blame me.

1224
01:38:41,526 --> 01:38:43,986
John, I'll see you
after. I'll be at Long's.

1225
01:38:43,987 --> 01:38:47,115
Very well. Lockett's?

1226
01:38:47,532 --> 01:38:50,034
Long's.

1227
01:38:52,537 --> 01:38:54,539
Long's.

1228
01:39:01,546 --> 01:39:03,866
I saw the first two acts.

1229
01:39:05,550 --> 01:39:07,552
And you didn't like me?

1230
01:39:07,587 --> 01:39:09,519
To the contrary.

1231
01:39:09,554 --> 01:39:12,954
I could bear your
brilliance no longer.

1232
01:39:16,561 --> 01:39:19,062
Sr. Harris, you are playing me.

1233
01:39:19,063 --> 01:39:22,275
The understudy has
become the actor.

1234
01:39:22,525 --> 01:39:25,986
My lord, I heard news of
your death six months ago

1235
01:39:25,987 --> 01:39:28,071
and experienced
a spasm of regret.

1236
01:39:28,072 --> 01:39:32,576
But your subsequent resurrection
has quite cured my grief.

1237
01:39:32,577 --> 01:39:37,248
I am nature, and you are art.

1238
01:39:39,584 --> 01:39:41,960
Let us see how we compare.

1239
01:39:41,961 --> 01:39:45,172
Sr. Harris has a quick change
and you will let him be.

1240
01:39:45,173 --> 01:39:48,174
Here we have him,
your Restoration gent.

1241
01:39:48,175 --> 01:39:50,176
He's not pissed
his breeches today

1242
01:39:50,177 --> 01:39:57,183
and he can walk in a straight line for 200
yards without falling on his face and retching.

1243
01:39:57,184 --> 01:39:59,186
Now,

1244
01:39:59,687 --> 01:40:02,440
look you upon this picture

1245
01:40:02,565 --> 01:40:04,191
<i>and on this</i>

1246
01:40:04,609 --> 01:40:07,110
<i>He has not washed
He cannot walk</i>

1247
01:40:07,111 --> 01:40:13,658
And he most certainly will not be able to raise
either the price of his dinner or his own pintle.

1248
01:40:13,659 --> 01:40:15,660
I must be got
into my nightgown.

1249
01:40:15,661 --> 01:40:17,996
This is what I envy
in you stage people.

1250
01:40:17,997 --> 01:40:20,332
You make time
seem so important.

1251
01:40:20,367 --> 01:40:22,668
<i>I must change my clothes now!</i>

1252
01:40:23,210 --> 01:40:25,728
<i>I must make my entrance now!</i>

1253
01:40:26,714 --> 01:40:29,507
But life is not a
succession of urgent nows.

1254
01:40:29,508 --> 01:40:32,218
It is a listless trickle
of Why should I's.

1255
01:40:32,219 --> 01:40:33,888
You're on.

1256
01:40:36,724 --> 01:40:39,836
<i>Five minutes
only, Sra. Barry.</i>

1257
01:40:45,232 --> 01:40:48,764
Inever wanted you for
a mistress, Lizzie.

1258
01:40:49,236 --> 01:40:51,556
I wanted you for my wife.

1259
01:40:54,742 --> 01:40:57,722
You have no
understanding, do you?

1260
01:40:59,747 --> 01:41:04,751
It was not being your mistress
that I was tired of, John.

1261
01:41:04,752 --> 01:41:06,652
I was tired of you.

1262
01:41:07,254 --> 01:41:10,006
I did not wish
to be your wife.

1263
01:41:10,041 --> 01:41:12,759
I do not wish to
be anyone's wife.

1264
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:16,604
I wish to continue
being the creature I am.

1265
01:41:16,764 --> 01:41:19,766
London walks into
this theatre to see me.

1266
01:41:19,767 --> 01:41:23,604
Not George's play,
nor Sr. Betterton.

1267
01:41:23,687 --> 01:41:27,273
They want me, and they want
me over and over again.

1268
01:41:27,274 --> 01:41:32,420
I will not swap my certain
glory for your undependable love.

1269
01:41:35,783 --> 01:41:37,992
I wanted you to have my child.

1270
01:41:37,993 --> 01:41:39,828
I had your child.

1271
01:41:40,788 --> 01:41:42,831
A daughter.

1272
01:41:42,998 --> 01:41:45,792
When the theatres were
closed in the summer.

1273
01:41:45,793 --> 01:41:50,296
By the start of the season I was flat
enough to play Desdemona in a nightgown.

1274
01:41:50,297 --> 01:41:53,541
<i>Two minutes,
Sra. Barry, please.</i>

1275
01:41:54,301 --> 01:41:56,345
What is her name?

1276
01:41:57,304 --> 01:41:58,889
Elizabeth.

1277
01:41:59,306 --> 01:42:01,350
Elizabeth?

1278
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:05,106
The child of our passion.

1279
01:42:07,314 --> 01:42:14,032
When I bred my other children, I placed
no value on human life at all, and.

1280
01:42:14,321 --> 01:42:16,485
now you send me away.

1281
01:42:17,324 --> 01:42:21,258
And I cannot go back
to where I was before.

1282
01:42:22,830 --> 01:42:27,646
I shall never forgive you
for teaching me to love life.

1283
01:42:28,836 --> 01:42:33,232
If I taught you that, then
our account is settled.

1284
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:36,259
Your lesson to me
was my livelihood.

1285
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:39,198
And mine to you
was life itself.

1286
01:42:39,346 --> 01:42:42,218
We have no need
to meet again.

1287
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:45,561
Lizzie.

1288
01:42:45,853 --> 01:42:47,896
If you are in London,

1289
01:42:48,146 --> 01:42:50,356
and you have half a
crown in your pocket,

1290
01:42:50,357 --> 01:42:52,401
you may see me there.

1291
01:42:52,734 --> 01:42:54,403
For the rest,

1292
01:42:55,362 --> 01:42:57,863
I hope I shall always
be in your heart,

1293
01:42:57,864 --> 01:43:00,325
sometimes in your thoughts,

1294
01:43:00,367 --> 01:43:03,078
but never in your debt.

1295
01:43:40,991 --> 01:43:42,993
I am 33.

1296
01:43:43,994 --> 01:43:45,996
years old.

1297
01:43:48,457 --> 01:43:50,500
I am dying.

1298
01:43:53,003 --> 01:43:55,941
I have tried to
speak the truth.

1299
01:43:58,008 --> 01:44:00,677
But I have been betrayed.

1300
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,522
Elizabeth.

1301
01:44:15,483 --> 01:44:19,863
speak to me of abduction.

1302
01:44:24,034 --> 01:44:26,036
I was 18.

1303
01:44:28,538 --> 01:44:32,250
And worth two and a
half thousand a year.

1304
01:44:33,543 --> 01:44:35,545
You ambushed me,

1305
01:44:37,505 --> 01:44:41,613
bundled me into your
coach and rattled me away.

1306
01:44:42,052 --> 01:44:44,054
The King thrust.

1307
01:45:22,258 --> 01:45:32,602
* If underneath
death's cold wing

1308
01:45:34,771 --> 01:45:40,985
* His restless soul should fly

1309
01:45:41,277 --> 01:45:45,139
He charmed the tenderest
virgins with delight.

1310
01:45:45,281 --> 01:45:49,497
And with his style did
fiercest blockheads fright.

1311
01:45:49,786 --> 01:45:54,756
* Beyond the grasp of fools

1312
01:45:54,791 --> 01:46:03,633
* T'would meet with
the bliss they deny

1313
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:06,803
* So stand for him

1314
01:46:06,838 --> 01:46:09,771
* Kneel for him

1315
01:46:09,806 --> 01:46:15,478
* As he lies low
in kneaded clay

1316
01:46:15,812 --> 01:46:21,693
* Pray for him
who prayed too late

1317
01:46:21,859 --> 01:46:27,782
* That he might
shine on Judgement Day

1318
01:46:28,324 --> 01:46:31,064
So, there he lies at the last.

1319
01:46:31,327 --> 01:46:33,371
The deathbed convert.

1320
01:46:33,538 --> 01:46:35,373
The pious debauchee.

1321
01:46:37,333 --> 01:46:40,889
Could not dance half
a measure, could I?

1322
01:46:41,838 --> 01:46:46,842
Give me wine, I'd drain the dregs and
toss the empty bottle at the world.

1323
01:46:46,843 --> 01:46:49,094
Show me our Lord
Jesus in agony,

1324
01:46:49,095 --> 01:46:54,355
and I mount the cross and steal
his nails for my own palms.

1325
01:46:55,852 --> 01:47:03,067
There I go, shuffling from the
world, my dribble fresh upon a Bible.

1326
01:47:04,861 --> 01:47:09,282
I look upon a pinhead.
and I see angels dancing.

1327
01:47:11,868 --> 01:47:13,911
Well?

1328
01:47:15,371 --> 01:47:17,415
Do you like me now?

1329
01:47:20,877 --> 01:47:22,920
Do you like me now?

1330
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:30,428
Do you like me now?

1331
01:47:35,391 --> 01:47:37,435
Do you like me now?
