00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:51,642
Can I help you?

180
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:53,978
Uh, sorry.

181
00:08:58,182 --> 00:08:59,684
(cash register dings)

182
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:01,519
(entry bell chimes)

183
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,531
Hey, do you want a hand?

184
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:16,066
Fine.

185
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:18,101
You don't look fine.

186
00:09:18,134 --> 00:09:20,036
Well, I am.

187
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:29,713
- Are you Eloise?
- Yeah.

188
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:31,681
Yeah, you-you look
like an Eloise.

189
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:33,517
Well, Ellie.

190
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,485
I'm Jocasta.

191
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,320
Did they spell your surname
wrong or something?

192
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:39,456
Oh, no, I've just decided
to drop it because I feel like

193
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:40,824
it's way more singular
to be known

194
00:09:40,857 --> 00:09:42,292
by just your Christian name.

195
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:44,127
You know, like,
so famous in your work

196
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,729
that you can actually
just go by Kylie.

197
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:47,797
- Minogue?
- Jenner.

198
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:49,398
Oh.

199
00:09:49,431 --> 00:09:52,535
Okay, bad example, but...
how many Jocastas do you know?

200
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:53,602
None.

201
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,271
Exactly, babes.

202
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:59,408
You don't mind I snagged
the bed by the window, do you?

203
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:01,410
- No.
- If we don't end up throttling each other,

204
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:03,579
we could maybe talk about
switching next term.

205
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:04,813
Yeah.

206
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:07,082
- So, where are you from?
- Uh, Redruth.

207
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:08,417
It's in Cornwall.

208
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,351
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:12,087
You know, Cornwall,
in the countryside.

210
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,188
No, no, I-I heard you, babes.

211
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:14,523
I'm just, I'm sorry.

212
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:17,626
Uh...

213
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,194
what about you?

214
00:10:19,228 --> 00:10:20,829
Manchester originally,
but I, uh,

215
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:22,598
moved down here in my gap year.

216
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:25,300
Uh, I had an internship
at an atelier in Savile Row.

217
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,836
Oh, wow. I've just been in
Redruth making my own clothes.

218
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,306
I had a hunch you made that.
(chuckles)

219
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,441
Yeah, this is Bouchra Jarrar.

220
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:36,210
Before she sold out
and moved to Lanvin, obviously.

221
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:37,812
- Smoke?
- No.

222
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,447
Is it allowed in here?

223
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,283
Oh, I-I just took
the batteries out of the alarm.

224
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:45,720
I can go outside if you really
have a problem with it.

225
00:10:45,753 --> 00:10:47,221
No.

226
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:48,723
- No, it's fine.
- I tried vaping.

227
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:52,493
I just think it makes you look
like so much more of a cunt.

228
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,629
Yeah, totally.

229
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:58,599
So, what does your dad do?

230
00:10:58,632 --> 00:11:00,233
Uh, I don't know him.

231
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:02,202
Oh, tell me about it.

232
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:04,204
- And your mum?
- My mother's dead.

233
00:11:04,237 --> 00:11:07,741
Well, I knew we'd find
some common ground eventually.

234
00:11:07,774 --> 00:11:10,877
Yeah, I was only 15
when she died.

235
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:12,512
What about you?

236
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,847
Seven.

237
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,349
Oh, wow, that is young.

238
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:18,185
Although I guess
it's maybe easier at that age.

239
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:22,623
Not that it's a competition,
though, is it? (chuckles)

240
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:25,525
- (distant door opens)
- (chatter in hall)

241
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,128
Ooh, fresh blood!

242
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:31,531
(door opens)

243
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,636
Oh, my God, wow, is that
a bloody Bouchra Jarrar?

244
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:38,437
Oh, good eye.

245
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:40,673
Yeah, well, before she sold out
and moved to Lanvin, obviously.

246
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:41,907
- Yeah.
- Obviously. (chuckles)

247
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:42,908
Oh.

248
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:45,277
Oh, this is my roomie, Eloise.

249
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:46,612
OTHERS:
Hi.

250
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:49,382
Yeah, she literally made
the outfit she's wearing.

251
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:52,385
How amazing. All of us
turn up in our Sunday best,

252
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:54,387
and she's here
rocking her own design.

253
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,488
(laughter)

254
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:57,390
I'm thinking we should call her
Brass Balls Ellie.

255
00:11:57,423 --> 00:11:58,891
ASHLEY:
And what will we call you?

256
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:00,526
Oh, well, by tomorrow morning,

257
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,528
you'll know me only
as Hurricane Jocasta.

258
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:04,897
Ooh. So you guys know
each other from before?

259
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:06,432
Oh, yeah, we go way back.

260
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:07,967
- What is it, like 15 minutes?
- (chuckles)

261
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,834
Yeah, something like that.

262
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:11,937
JOCASTA:
We're in the Dead Mums Club.

263
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:13,939
- LARA: Oh.
- Fuck leukemia, am I right?

264
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:16,374
- That's awful.
- JOCASTA: Yeah.

265
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:17,809
It's pretty shit.
I'm not gonna lie.

266
00:12:17,842 --> 00:12:20,812
But, I don't know, I feel like
it kind of fuels my work.

267
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:21,880
- So...
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:12:21,913 --> 00:12:23,949
What happened to your mum?

269
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:27,686
Uh, she wasn't well... mentally.

270
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:32,424
She... she killed herself.

271
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:34,592
ASHLEY:
(gasps) Sorry.

272
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:36,895
We shouldn't have asked.

273
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:38,496
It was a long time ago.

274
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,433
- You're, like, so brave.
- So brave.

275
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:44,234
Yeah, I had a-a great-uncle
commit suicide... hung himself.

276
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:45,469
ASHLEY:
Oh, God.

277
00:12:45,502 --> 00:12:47,471
So, yeah, I know exactly
what it's like.

278
00:12:47,504 --> 00:12:49,373
ASHLEY:
Also so brave.

279
00:12:49,406 --> 00:12:50,908
- LARA: So brave also.
- CAMI: Yeah.

hungover on our first day?

JOCASTA: Oh, hush.
That's future you talking.

00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:16,533
- You know what, fuck her.
- (laughter)

Uh, no one.

1058
00:54:30,936 --> 00:54:33,139

Look, we're at the pub,

1059
00:54:33,172 --> 00:54:35,007
a whole bunch of us, having fun.

1060

Yeah, Hurricane Jocasta.

Everyone, really.
The whole class.

1063
00:54:39,879 --> 00:54:42,314
- Something's wrong.
- No. (chuckles)

1064
00:54:42,348 --> 00:54:45,851
Ellie, I can hear it
in your voice.

1065
00:54:45,885 --> 00:54:48,686
Gran, I really am at the pub.

1066
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,389
I'm working here.

1067
00:54:50,422 --> 00:54:53,325
Working there? Why?

1068
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:55,961
- I moved out the halls.
- Oh, no. What...

1069
00:54:55,995 --> 00:54:57,896
I needed to get
a place of my own.

1070
00:54:57,929 --> 00:54:59,696
Did-did something happen?

1071
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,732
- Did you see her again?
- No.

1072
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:04,135
No, Mum's not here with me.

1073
00:55:04,169 --> 00:55:06,137
Then what is it?

1074
00:55:06,171 --> 00:55:08,006
What's wrong?

1075
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:09,207
Please tell me.

1076
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,841
Look, I should go back in.

1077

something to prove,

1078

but it's okay to ask for help.

1079
00:55:16,114 --> 00:55:18,283
She didn't.

1080
00:55:18,316 --> 00:55:20,919
Gran, I have to go.

1081
00:55:20,952 --> 00:55:23,955
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

1082

Everything all right, Ellie?

1083
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:29,194
Or do I call you Eloise,

1084
00:55:29,227 --> 00:55:31,862
like the old song?

1085
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,931
I don't know that song.

1086
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:35,465
And how do you know my name?

1087
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,733
I make it my business to know

1088
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:40,137

around here.

1089
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,439

No.

1093

Handsy?

1099
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,201
Yeah.

01:31:51,212 --> 01:31:52,914
BARTENDER:
Jesus.

1756
01:31:52,947 --> 01:31:54,215
(Eloise sobbing)

1757
01:31:54,249 --> 01:31:56,051
- What happened?
- DRIVER: He just stopped

1758
01:31:56,084 --> 01:31:58,353
in-in the middle of the street.

1759
01:31:58,386 --> 01:32:00,888
Oh, Lindsey, you poor bastard.

1760
01:32:00,921 --> 01:32:03,190
Call an ambulance, pet.

1761
01:32:03,223 --> 01:32:04,525
Now!

1762
01:32:04,558 --> 01:32:07,094
And tell 'em
he used to be police.

1763
01:32:07,127 --> 01:32:10,030
- That'll make them hurry.
- Right. Okay.

1764
01:32:10,064 --> 01:32:11,865
Lindsey?

1765
01:32:11,899 --> 01:32:14,134
- He's police?
- Yeah, he's ex-vice.

1766
01:32:14,168 --> 01:32:16,403
He used to be a copper in Soho
for years and years,

1767
01:32:16,437 --> 01:32:20,474
working the red light district,
and now look at him.

1768
01:32:20,507 --> 01:32:24,478
Then his name's not Jack?

1769
01:32:24,511 --> 01:32:25,612
Jack?

1770
01:32:25,646 --> 01:32:27,548
No, love.

1771
01:32:27,581 --> 01:32:29,383
That's Lindsey.

1772
01:32:29,416 --> 01:32:31,185
(whimpering, panting)

1773
01:32:31,218 --> 01:32:33,020
BARTENDER:
Yeah, he looks very bad.

1774
01:32:33,053 --> 01:32:34,487
I reckon you're a copper
or something.

1775
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:37,223
(echoing): <i>I reckon
you're a copper or something.</i>

1776
01:32:37,256 --> 01:32:38,458
Do you, now?

1777
01:32:38,491 --> 01:32:41,160
(echoing):
<i>Do you, now?</i>

1778
01:32:41,194 --> 01:32:44,497
(echoing): <i>I'd get out
while you can, girl.</i>

1779
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:46,866
CAROL:
Ellie?

1780
01:32:48,368 --> 01:32:50,169
Ellie!

1781
01:32:54,674 --> 01:32:56,943
(siren blaring)

1782
01:32:56,976 --> 01:32:58,511
ELOISE (sobbing):
<i>I've let you down.</i>

1783
01:32:58,544 --> 01:33:00,113
<i>I've let Mum down.</i>

1784
01:33:00,146 --> 01:33:02,648
PEGGY (over phone):
You haven't let anyone down.

1785
01:33:02,682 --> 01:33:05,551
- You never could.
- Okay.

1786
01:33:05,585 --> 01:33:07,687
Ellie, I don't know
what's happened,

1787
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:11,123
but it's okay to come home.

1788
01:33:11,156 --> 01:33:13,125
You haven't failed anyone.

1789
01:33:13,158 --> 01:33:14,426
(sobbing)

1790
01:33:14,459 --> 01:33:16,995
I'll-I'll come and get you
first thing tomorrow.

1791
01:33:17,028 --> 01:33:19,998
No, Gran, I can't stay
another night.

1792
01:33:20,031 --> 01:33:22,534
Well, uh, I'll get someone
to drive me now.

1793
01:33:22,567 --> 01:33:24,469
- JOHN: Ellie?
- (siren wailing)

1794
01:33:24,503 --> 01:33:26,338
- Ellie?
- PEGGY: Hello?

1795
01:33:27,305 --> 01:33:29,207
PEGGY:
Hello?

1796
01:33:29,241 --> 01:33:30,942
Look, I have someone
who can help.

1797
01:33:30,976 --> 01:33:32,144
- JOHN: El!
- I'll call you.

1798
01:33:32,177 --> 01:33:33,412
PEGGY:
Ellie? Eloise?

1799
01:33:33,445 --> 01:33:35,414
- JOHN: Ellie!
- John!

1800
01:33:35,447 --> 01:33:37,449
John!

1801
01:33:37,482 --> 01:33:39,184
Ellie.

1802
01:33:40,185 --> 01:33:41,086
Thank God.

1803
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:43,588
I saw the flashing lights,
and I thought...

1804
01:33:43,622 --> 01:33:45,022
I'm scared here.

1805
01:33:45,055 --> 01:33:46,557
I'll take you back to yours.

1806
01:33:46,590 --> 01:33:49,126
No, I want to go home.
Home, home.

1807
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:51,195
I-I need to get out of London.

1808
01:33:51,228 --> 01:33:53,164
Can you help me get
to the train station?

1809
01:33:53,197 --> 01:33:55,299
Forget the train.
I'll drive you.

1810
01:33:55,332 --> 01:33:57,067
You have a car?

1811
01:33:57,101 --> 01:33:59,036
How else am I supposed to get

1812
01:33:59,069 --> 01:34:01,372
to North London
from South London?

1813
01:34:02,339 --> 01:34:04,275
ELOISE:
<i>Right, I'm gonna go in there,</i>

1814
01:34:04,308 --> 01:34:07,445
<i>get my things and never see
that fucking room ever again.</i>

1815
01:34:07,478 --> 01:34:09,447
JOHN: <i>Do you want me
to come up and help?</i>

1816
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,215
ELOISE: <i>No, better not.
Ms. Collins would probably</i>

1817
01:34:11,248 --> 01:34:13,184
<i>kill you if she sees you again.</i>

1818
01:34:13,217 --> 01:34:17,188
Maybe if I plead, she might
give me some of my deposit.

1819
01:34:17,221 --> 01:34:18,355
Fuck.

1820
01:34:23,493 --> 01:34:27,197
If I'm not back in 15 minutes,
maybe come check on me.

1821
01:34:28,298 --> 01:34:30,233
Okay.

1822
01:34:32,101 --> 01:34:34,304
(sirens wailing in distance)

1823
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:41,244
(door opens, closes)

1824
01:34:45,715 --> 01:34:48,184
Ms. Collins, it's me, Ellie.

1825
01:34:48,218 --> 01:34:50,520
MS. COLLINS:
Just coming, deary.

1826
01:34:53,489 --> 01:34:56,592
(gasps) You look like
you've had a fright.

1827
01:34:56,625 --> 01:34:58,594
I need your help.

1828
01:34:59,595 --> 01:35:00,629
Just you, is it?

1829
01:35:00,662 --> 01:35:02,531
Yeah.

1830
01:35:02,564 --> 01:35:04,500
I'll put the kettle on. Come in.

1831
01:35:04,533 --> 01:35:07,269
("Alfie" by Cilla Black playing)

1832
01:35:07,302 --> 01:35:12,508
Your music upstairs got me
breaking out my old records.

1833
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:16,378
Oh, I picked up
a letter of yours by mistake.

1834
01:35:16,411 --> 01:35:18,146
It's in that pile.

1835
01:35:31,192 --> 01:35:32,393
(Ms. Collins chuckles)

1836
01:35:32,426 --> 01:35:34,830
Don't judge me
on the cigarettes.

1837
01:35:34,863 --> 01:35:37,799
All that hoo-ha last night
got me going again.

1838
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:39,166
Sorry.

1839
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,135
Oh, it's not your fault.

1840
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:43,538
I was always on the edge
of starting again.

1841
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,573
So...

1842
01:35:47,608 --> 01:35:49,377
How can I help you?

1843
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:52,280
Ms. Collins,
I-I'm really sorry to do this.

1844
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:54,181
I-I didn't want
to be this person,

1845
01:35:54,215 --> 01:35:55,817
but I'm leaving tonight.

1846
01:35:55,851 --> 01:35:57,685
Oh.

1847
01:35:57,718 --> 01:35:59,420
Are you, now?

1848
01:35:59,453 --> 01:36:02,556
I'm not having
a very good time here, and I...

1849
01:36:02,589 --> 01:36:05,225
I really need to go back home,
and I promise...

1850
01:36:05,258 --> 01:36:06,693
I promise I'll pay you
for the mirror,

1851
01:36:06,726 --> 01:36:09,396
- but I really need some of my deposit.
- Slow down.

1852
01:36:09,429 --> 01:36:11,731
I don't want to beg,
but this has been a disaster.

1853
01:36:11,765 --> 01:36:14,434
(chuckling):
Hush. Slow down.

1854
01:36:14,467 --> 01:36:16,336
Drink your tea.

1855
01:36:22,442 --> 01:36:25,813
You went to the police,
didn't you?

1856
01:36:25,846 --> 01:36:29,716
About the room upstairs, hmm?

1857
01:36:29,749 --> 01:36:31,351
Yeah.

1858
01:36:32,752 --> 01:36:36,122
A nice police lady came round

1859
01:36:36,156 --> 01:36:39,725
asking questions about you.

1860
01:36:39,758 --> 01:36:43,162
About your well-being.

1861
01:36:43,195 --> 01:36:46,565
Welfare check, she called it.

1862
01:36:46,599 --> 01:36:49,468
Had me worried.

1863
01:36:49,501 --> 01:36:52,705
You'd been saying
a girl died up there.

1864
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:56,175
- Sorry.
- Oh.

1865
01:36:56,208 --> 01:36:58,878
It's funny 'cause...

1866
01:36:58,912 --> 01:37:02,348
there is some truth in it.

1867
01:37:02,381 --> 01:37:03,549
(chuckles)

1868
01:37:03,582 --> 01:37:07,486
I hadn't thought about it
until you brought it up, but...

1869
01:37:07,519 --> 01:37:11,590
a girl did die up there,
I suppose.

1870
01:37:11,624 --> 01:37:13,491
The young me...

1871
01:37:14,392 --> 01:37:18,396
...that came to this big city.

1872
01:37:20,732 --> 01:37:22,333
Sandie.

1873
01:37:23,468 --> 01:37:26,638
MS. COLLINS: <i>I had hopes
and dreams like you.</i>

1874
01:37:26,671 --> 01:37:28,941
I wanted to be a singer.

1875
01:37:28,974 --> 01:37:30,843
I wanted to perform.

1876
01:37:30,876 --> 01:37:32,644
To act.

1877
01:37:32,677 --> 01:37:37,281
<i>Being a whore is a bit like
being an actress, I suppose.</i>

1878
01:37:38,249 --> 01:37:41,319
You have to pretend
you're someone else.

1879
01:37:41,352 --> 01:37:44,389
Someone that's not you.

1880
01:37:44,422 --> 01:37:46,491
I'd pretend
I was somewhere else.

1881
01:37:46,524 --> 01:37:48,191
LINDSEY (echoing):
<i>It's too late for you.</i>

1882
01:37:48,225 --> 01:37:50,427
That this wasn't
happening to me.

1883
01:37:51,595 --> 01:37:54,531
MS. COLLINS and SANDIE:
<i>Try and forget all those...</i>

1884
01:37:54,564 --> 01:37:57,267
<i>all those men.</i>

1885
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:59,971
<i>Their faces.</i>

1886
01:38:00,004 --> 01:38:01,438
I'd blank them out.

1887
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:04,341
I had to.

1888
01:38:05,742 --> 01:38:08,311
<i>Make like they were nothing.</i>

1889
01:38:09,513 --> 01:38:15,552
So, yes, you could say
Sandie died in that room.

1890
01:38:17,587 --> 01:38:20,892
She died in that room
a hundred times.

1891
01:38:20,925 --> 01:38:22,558
And then one night...

1892
01:38:24,861 --> 01:38:26,595
...the man who put me there...

1893
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:31,701
...the man who put me to work...

1894
01:38:34,437 --> 01:38:36,739
...the man who stole my dream...

1895
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:40,276
(echoing yell)

1896
01:38:40,911 --> 01:38:41,978
...well...

1897
01:38:42,012 --> 01:38:44,313
(gasping)

1898
01:38:44,948 --> 01:38:46,682
...I put a knife in him...

1899
01:38:50,619 --> 01:38:52,221
...a hundred times.

1900
01:38:56,059 --> 01:38:57,960
And do you know what, Ellie?

1901
01:38:57,993 --> 01:39:00,662
Oh, I can call you Ellie,
can't I?

1902
01:39:00,695 --> 01:39:01,763
Yeah.

1903
01:39:01,797 --> 01:39:03,631
It felt right, Ellie.

1904
01:39:06,735 --> 01:39:09,337
All those bastards

1905
01:39:09,370 --> 01:39:11,740
- <i>who came ringing my bell,</i>
- (doorbell ringing)

1906
01:39:11,774 --> 01:39:14,309
<i>creeping up my stairs,</i>

1907
01:39:14,342 --> 01:39:17,046
they sent me to hell, so...

1908
01:39:17,079 --> 01:39:19,380
I sent them to theirs.

1909
01:39:23,886 --> 01:39:25,720
The papers call them

1910
01:39:25,754 --> 01:39:28,057
<i>missing persons.</i>

1911
01:39:28,090 --> 01:39:31,492
As far as I'm concerned,
they were already lost.

1912
01:39:33,061 --> 01:39:37,297
So they don't know
where they are.

1913
01:39:38,398 --> 01:39:40,835
I say they didn't know
who they were.

1914
01:39:40,869 --> 01:39:42,369
(board sliding)

1915
01:39:42,402 --> 01:39:44,705
I was doing everyone a favor.

1916
01:39:44,738 --> 01:39:48,375
MS. COLLINS and SANDIE:
I wasn't gonna be used anymore.

1917
01:39:48,408 --> 01:39:51,012
I wasn't gonna let
this city break me.

1918
01:39:51,045 --> 01:39:53,547
I'm so sorry.

1919
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:54,681
Why?

1920
01:39:54,715 --> 01:39:57,018
It's not your fault.

1921
01:39:57,051 --> 01:40:00,021
No, I mean I understand.

1922
01:40:00,054 --> 01:40:02,456
I know what you've been through.

1923
01:40:02,489 --> 01:40:03,657
Oh.

1924
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:05,826
Do you, now?

1925
01:40:05,859 --> 01:40:09,395
Yeah, I didn't mean to get you
in trouble with the police.

1926
01:40:09,428 --> 01:40:11,697
Oh, it's all right.

1927
