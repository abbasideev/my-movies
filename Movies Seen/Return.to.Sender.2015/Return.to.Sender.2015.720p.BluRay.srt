1
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,010
Hey! How was it? How'd it go?

2
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,546
Dr. Cyper is amazing.

3
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,715
You'd think he was cutting the crusts
off his kid's sandwich.

4
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,338
So you really want to leave
all of this for that?

5
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:12,089
If I qualify for this transfer
I'll still... Is this yours?

6
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:16,292
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
- I will still be "all this" adjacent.

7
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:18,828
I don't know why you want
to be a surgical nurse.

8
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:22,296
You know, I can take my kids barfing on me,
I can take the patients whizzing on me,

9
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:26,769
but the minute you pull out
a scalpel... I'm like... gross!

10
00:01:27,737 --> 00:01:29,473
Yeah, it can be awfully revolting.

11
00:01:31,274 --> 00:01:33,710
Did Mrs. Disantos die?

12
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:50,460
Tony, I'm so sorry about your mother.

13
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,498
You were always so good
to come and stay with her.

14
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,237
I hope it's some comfort
that she didn't suffer much.

15
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:04,205
No.

16
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,211
No. There's no comfort at all.

17
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:12,682
I wish she had suffered good and long.

18
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:16,813
Yeah, I wish she had to lay
in that bed for 29 years

19
00:02:16,913 --> 00:02:19,028
and listen to me tell her how...

20
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:21,111
ugly...

21
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:23,320
stupid...

22
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,901
and lazy she is.

23
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:29,065
Yeah, I'm not going to the store
to get your pills.

24
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:33,169
I'm not rubbing the cramps
out of your legs.

25
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:37,941
I'm not putting gas
in your fucking car anymore.

26
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,478
Holy crap! I mean, for five months?

27
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:44,748
He reads her the newspaper,
he brushes her hair,

28
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:46,883
he brings her azaleas from her garden?

29
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:48,652
I thought he loved his mother,
didn't you?

30
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,938
- I thought he was 45!
- Shut up!

31
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,491
- He fooled us both. He's 29?
- Twenty-nine?

32
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,678
Hey, wait! I heard that you were
going out on some kind of blind date.

33
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,546
I mean, really,
you're keeping that from me?

34
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:01,831
It's nothing, really.

35
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,901
A decompressive craniectomy
is nothing, really.

36
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:08,588
Compared to this. It is big news!
And I feel a little left out.

37
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:11,007
Well, Nancy, the way big news
travels around here

38
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,743
I'm sure you'll hear all about it.

39
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:18,715
You sure have a lot of holes
in your face.

40
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,617
I have holes all over.

41
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:22,852
Nice. Any more down there?

42
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,287
Excuse me.

43
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:26,022
Would you mind?

44
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:46,876
Dammit.

45
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:50,680
You can use one of those.

46
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:54,551
No, that's okay.
I'll just wait 'til later.

47
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:57,187
Well...

48
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,889
You have to sign the receipt.

49
00:04:20,776 --> 00:04:22,612
Okay.

50
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:27,750
Thank you.

51
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:34,023
Daddy?

52
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,139
Daddy?

53
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:14,497
Get off me, you stupid dog!

54
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:16,965
Benny, come here! Come!

55
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,191
- Did he get you?
- Yeah, he tore my dress. Stupid dog.

56
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,524
Well, he's not stupid,
he's just being protective, that's all.

57
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:29,313
- I'm your daughter.
- You're a stranger to him, is all.

58
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,084
Come on, Benny.

59
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,388
You know, Miranda, I've been thinking.

60
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:42,525
I really should go with you tomorrow.
Go down and look at that house.

61
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,394
Oh, yeah, look at it
or try to talk me out of it?

62
00:05:45,494 --> 00:05:50,900
Come on. I know better
than to try to talk you out of it.

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,703
But these realtors are kind
of slick, you know.

64
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:55,938
They'd do anything to make a sale.

65
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:58,441
So you've got to check
the heating system.

66
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,610
And the foundations, and the roof.

67
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,382
- Yeah.
- And...

68
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,719
Oh, I'm sorry about Benny.
There's a trick to him. Bribery.

69
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:13,289
Get him some meat
and he'll be your friend forever.

70
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,493
Hello!

71
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:19,896
Miranda.

72
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:22,199
I want him to stop bothering me.

73
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:29,305
- It's so good to see you, Karen.
- Same here.

74
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,745
You owe me a dress, dog.

75
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,370
Miranda, somebody's choking.

76
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:47,223
Sorry.

77
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:49,625
No one can get their arms around him.

78
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:52,929
Okay. Okay, sir.
The Heimlich maneuver isn't working.

79
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:55,698
Just... I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna help you.

80
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:57,367
I'm gonna help you breathe.

81
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:01,470
Someone give me a steak knife.
It's okay, sir.

82
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:05,775
I'm gonna help you breathe.

83
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,880
I need a straw. I need a straw.

84
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:23,120
It's gonna be okay.

85
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:29,532
Hold my hand squeeze tight.
Squeeze all you want. Okay.

86
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:32,268
Okay, there you go, there you go.

87
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,203
- Someone call 911?
- Yeah, we did.

88
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:36,538
Okay, they're on their way.

89
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:39,258
You're gonna be okay.

90
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:43,514
So, marble in the entryway,
sunken living room, and...

91
00:07:45,614 --> 00:07:48,050
granite countertops.

92
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,086
Throughout.

93
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:54,023
Stainless steel appliances, and...

94
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,958
double ovens.

95
00:07:56,058 --> 00:08:00,329
- I love double wall ovens.
- I love them too!

96
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:09,271
- Let's have a look at that water heater.
- Yes, let's.

97
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:54,117
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

98
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:58,020
- Miranda! What did you do?
- I said I'd bring the cake.

99
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,557
- It's so beautiful!
- You made this?

100
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:02,491
It's just something I do.

101
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:06,162
Oh, my God. It's so perfect,
I don't want to ruin it.

102
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:08,802
- Oh, come on. That's nonsense, Nancy.
- That's what it's for.

103
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:12,116
- All right. Here we go.
- No, no, Nancy, Nancy.

104
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:14,120
- What?
- It's got mustard on it.

105
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,839
- I brought this, use this.
- Okay.

106
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:19,408
Wait, wait, wait. There are no candles.

107
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:21,460
It's not a birthday cake
if there are no candles.

108
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,682
- Yes, it is.
- All right, I'll settle this. Watch this.

109
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:39,761
What a way to eat this.

110
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:43,900
It's the salt and the sweet.

111
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,235
- It's so good!
- Nancy is so drunk.

112
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:49,405
- So when's the big night?
- The big night?

113
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,312
- With Kevin.
- Kevin. The big night is...

114
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:56,151
- You didn't cancel.
- No, I didn't cancel.

115
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,081
Just promise me
that you won't stand him up.

116
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,952
- He works with my husband.
- I... why... why would I do that?

117
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:06,205
Well, it took me a good six months
to get you to say yes.

118
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,808
- I just really want it to go well.
- I don't know why you care so much.

119
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,628
If it goes great
then you can say that...

120
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:15,731
you found your soulmate
because of Darlene.

121
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:49,165
Kevin?

122
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:51,734
You didn't knock.

123
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,903
- I was...
- You're early.

124
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,338
That's why I didn't knock.

125
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:57,507
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:03,245
There are worse things,
I suppose, like... being late.

127
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:08,284
Yes, they're here!

128
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:10,752
Oh, let me get that for you.

129
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:12,989
Thank you.

130
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:19,128
Where do you want it?

131
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:25,868
- Over here?
- That's fine.

132
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:28,570
All right,
I'll just set that right there.

133
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:33,896
- Did you cut yourself?
- No.

134
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:37,279
Oh, no, that's nail polish.

135
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,488
I should put some clothes on.
Would you excuse me?

136
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:48,257
Okay. Sure.

137
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:50,593
Oh, I should've offered you
something to drink.

138
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:52,765
I have fresh squeezed lemonade.

139
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:55,451
Do I have to pay 50 cents
and drink it out of a little paper cup?

140
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:58,034
No, I closed the stand.

141
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,269
Bought a little bicycle
with the money I made.

142
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:03,840
- A little basket on the front?
- With tassels for the handlebars.

143
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,763
- So do you want the lemonade?
- No thank you, I'm good.

144
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:26,929
You moving?

145
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:30,199
What?

146
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:36,072
I was just asking, are you...

147
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,606
are you moving?

148
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:40,925
Yeah. As soon as I sell this place.

149
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:44,513
What, you don't like it here?

150
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:49,685
Liking one place doesn't mean
you can't move to another one, so...

151
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:55,891
I don't know, the question of whether
I like it here or not is really moot.

152
00:12:57,906 --> 00:12:59,695
Sorry.

153
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:09,038
You look hot.

154
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:14,410
- Did you say something?
- I was just saying you look really nice.

155
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:17,729
Thank you, Kevin.

156
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,585
I ordered these a few days ago,
and I have been dying to get them.

157
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,612
Must be an awfully special pen?

158
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:55,450
Would you mind?

159
00:13:57,653 --> 00:13:59,421
Thank you.

160
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:04,993
You know, I should finish getting ready.

161
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:08,130
- Could you come back?
- Come back?

162
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,501
- Well, you are early.
- What time was I supposed to be here?

163
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,603
You don't remember?

164
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:17,606
- It's just...
- Kevin.

165
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,175
Come on.

166
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,579
I really don't want to leave.

167
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:31,553
I think it's best that you do.
I'm sorry.

168
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:37,350
Okay.

169
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:47,970
Why'd you do that?

170
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,939
Unlock my door.

171
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:53,509
Okay, you need to leave, like, right now,
or I'm calling the police.

172
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:57,579
You're not calling anybody. Okay?

173
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,749
- Don't you touch me.
- It's okay.

174
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,586
Hey, hey! Miranda,
I don't want to hurt you!

175
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:06,568
I won't hurt you!

176
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:10,459
Hey! Hey!

177
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:14,963
- Hey, come here.
- Stop it, you fuck!

178
00:15:15,063 --> 00:15:17,232
Hey, stop!

179
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,202
I want you.

180
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:23,338
I've always wanted you.

181
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:32,614
- Hey!
- Get the fuck off me!

182
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:46,967
Stop!

183
00:15:51,271 --> 00:15:55,171
It's gonna be okay. I already said
I don't want to hurt you, okay?

184
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:57,406
I don't want to hurt you.

185
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:02,578
No!

186
00:16:10,986 --> 00:16:13,222
That feel good?

187
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:22,764
Are you okay? You okay?

188
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:29,872
You okay?

189
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:45,487
Hello?

190
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:50,626
Miranda?

191
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,450
Anybody home?

192
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:06,108
Miranda?

193
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,711
Should I wait here?

194
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:15,817
Darlene said you might cancel.

195
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:42,845
I just... I showed up, and she was...

196
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:48,417
God, I had never even met her before.
It was a blind date.

197
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:51,820
Oh, God. I've... I've...

198
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,456
I've never seen anyone like that.

199
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:57,692
Will she... will she be okay?

200
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:58,854
The man who raped you...

201
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:01,215
have you seen him before?

202
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,598
Yes.

203
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:12,400
- Sorry.
- Oh, hey, William.

204
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,785
Hey, Deacon around?

205
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:16,572
He's in the office, but no one's
been able to get him off the phone.

206
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:21,117
- I thought you were off tonight, man?
- I just need my money, that's all.

207
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:26,748
Oh, hey, Deacon. I was hoping I could...

208
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:39,061
Here's that show
you used to like to watch.

209
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:54,109
Honey, I'm gonna get something
to drink, okay?

210
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:58,046
I'll be right back. Right back.

211
00:23:01,062 --> 00:23:04,912
So what you're saying is I have...
I have no buyer.

212
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:10,372
Now, Miranda, listen, I know
that you are having a very hard time.

213
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:14,176
So, I can't proceed
on the other house now.

214
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:18,413
- But you like that house.
- But I wanted a new one.

215
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:22,484
And now I can't sell my house,
so I can't buy a new one.

216
00:23:22,584 --> 00:23:24,920
I'm just stuck, I have to deal, right?

217
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,302
Well, I'll tell you what,
we can try again in a few months?

218
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:33,929
A few months? Why? I mean, why bother?
Will I suddenly be un-raped then?

219
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,472
I have an idea.

220
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,277
Rose bushes.
Why don't you plant rose bushes?

221
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,387
- You need some help?
- Oh, Daddy.

222
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:03,325
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing there?

223
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,067
You know, you have your mother's nose,
and not much else.

224
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:15,440
Well, that's what happens
when you give me seed packets

225
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,405
instead of selling my damn house.

226
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:20,242
Are you sure they're gonna grow
just covered up like that?

227
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:24,212
You are standing on property
nobody wants.

228
00:24:24,312 --> 00:24:26,698
Or so says Judy, with the bad haircut.

229
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,200
No luck I take it.

230
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:31,586
Well...

231
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:42,097
The reason I came over was I thought
maybe we'd go have a bite to eat.

232
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:44,115
Go to the movies?

233
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:48,120
- Well, you could've called.
- Well, I did, I tried.

234
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:00,315
Maybe tomorrow.

235
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:11,226
How's my favorite sister?

236
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:28,203
Hey, Miranda!

237
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:30,271
Nancy, my shift is over.

238
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:33,675
I know, I know, but...
I need you, it's...

239
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:35,010
It's an emergency.

240
00:26:36,444 --> 00:26:39,648
Miranda! Come on!

241
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:45,520
It's only gonna take a second
and it's very important.

242
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,471
We just wanted to give you a little something
before you make your transfer.

243
00:26:49,571 --> 00:26:51,777
We're gonna miss you so much!

244
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:53,959
Surprise!

245
00:26:54,595 --> 00:26:59,668
- Who wrapped that?
- I did. It's just something I do.

246
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,417
- You made this bow? It's beautiful!
- Super pretty.

247
00:27:02,517 --> 00:27:05,006
Thank you, guys. Thanks.

248
00:27:12,994 --> 00:27:15,163
- Yay!
- Ta-da!

249
00:27:15,263 --> 00:27:18,633
See, now you can just practice
at home. Isn't it great?

250
00:27:18,733 --> 00:27:20,120
Fantastic.

251
00:28:17,825 --> 00:28:19,894
Asshole!

252
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,299
- Miranda.
- Oh, Mrs. Brown.

253
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,918
- Can I speak with you?
- Oh, sure.

254
00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:29,605
- You missed your orientation.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

255
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:33,403
Sorry doesn't cut it in surgery, Miranda.
Lives are on the line.

256
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,722
- I know.
- Is something wrong?

257
00:28:35,822 --> 00:28:38,146
- No.
- You seem distracted.

258
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:40,665
Which is not a good thing
in this business.

259
00:28:40,765 --> 00:28:43,034
Actually I'm reconsidering my transfer.

260
00:28:43,134 --> 00:28:46,855
After that last performance
we've already reconsidered it for you.

261
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:50,976
- Oh, well...
- I'm disappointed, Miranda.

262
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:56,065
You pushed very hard and very long for
something you appeared to want very badly.

263
00:28:57,498 --> 00:28:59,767
If it were me...

264
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:03,071
I wouldn't let anything stand in my way.

265
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:07,859
If it were me I wouldn't walk around
with my tag sticking out.

266
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:11,379
Here you go, come again.

267
00:29:18,386 --> 00:29:20,856
- Lady, pay attention.
- What?

268
00:29:20,956 --> 00:29:23,591
I'm just telling you to pay attention.
I'm in a hurry here.

269
00:29:23,691 --> 00:29:25,493
Sorry.

270
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,839
What's that?

271
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:40,404
It's your stuff.

272
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:43,678
Yeah, thanks.

273
00:29:43,778 --> 00:29:47,182
- Excuse me, you need to pay.
- I paid when I dropped it off.

274
00:29:47,282 --> 00:29:50,685
- I don't have any record of it.
- Well, I have a receipt right here.

275
00:29:50,785 --> 00:29:53,721
Well, I don't know how you can
if I don't have a record of it here.

276
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:56,324
Give me a minute and I'll show you.

277
00:29:56,424 --> 00:29:58,593
How about you hand me
the items back first, ma'am?

278
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:02,230
- Excuse me? Are you kidding?
- Lady, I need to leave.

279
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:06,501
Look, I know I have a receipt.
I even... I wrote it in my check register.

280
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:09,007
Okay, why don't you let me
wait on him while you're looking?

281
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,672
Because it's my turn, dammit.

282
00:30:10,772 --> 00:30:13,323
Please calm down. All you need
to do is hand me the item and...

283
00:30:13,423 --> 00:30:16,811
And all you need to do
is stuff that fat back in your skirt.

284
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:21,015
How do you manage that,
being skinny and fat at the same time?

285
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:25,019
And you know, with breasts like that...

286
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:27,004
do us all a favor
and wear a fucking bra.

287
00:30:27,104 --> 00:30:29,091
I think you need to leave.
Like right now.

288
00:30:29,191 --> 00:30:31,659
- Not without my tablecloth.
- Take it.

289
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:35,342
No. I'm gonna find that receipt,
because I'm not having anyone in this shop

290
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:37,300
thinking that I didn't pay.

291
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,361
We have an abusive customer down here.

292
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:44,889
Paid.

293
00:30:44,989 --> 00:30:47,809
We appreciate your business, ma'am,
but I think it's best if you leave.

294
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:49,944
I bet you do.

295
00:33:54,896 --> 00:33:57,698
You look happy.
Is Mrs. Burke doing better?

296
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:00,334
No, she's about the same.

297
00:34:03,338 --> 00:34:06,607
- You need help with that?
- Oh, no, I got it.

298
00:34:06,707 --> 00:34:11,279
You're lucky you never smoked.
It's a hard habit to give up.

299
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:16,016
Yeah, well...

300
00:34:16,884 --> 00:34:21,489
Now I have to watch our for snacking
as a replacement for cigarettes.

301
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:31,382
Damn you.

302
00:36:02,189 --> 00:36:04,358
This won't do.

303
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:07,897
No, this won't do at all.

304
00:36:28,649 --> 00:36:31,987
There you go. It's looking good.

305
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:42,997
- Daddy, what are you doing?
- Well, I thought maybe you'd want this.

306
00:36:43,731 --> 00:36:47,268
- I want an old swing on my new porch?
- Oh, it's not an old swing.

307
00:36:47,368 --> 00:36:50,938
Honey, this is the one you
and your mother used to use.

308
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:56,176
You really remember things
differently, don't you?

309
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:59,980
Daddy, the whole point
is to make this place look new.

310
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,650
Right, right. Well, I could paint it.

311
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,111
- Daddy.
- And if it squeaks I can oil it.

312
00:37:05,211 --> 00:37:06,287
Dad.

313
00:37:07,654 --> 00:37:10,892
All right, I'll take it down.
Take it down.

314
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:14,649
Daddy? Daddy?

315
00:37:15,162 --> 00:37:18,699
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

316
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:21,835
- I'm fine, girl.
- I got you.

317
00:37:22,603 --> 00:37:24,673
- Alright.
- Okay.

318
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:28,576
- I got you.
- Right, one, two, three.

319
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:30,711
I got you.

320
00:37:31,212 --> 00:37:33,599
- Thank you.
- What have you done to my porch?

321
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:40,020
Hey, hey! Sir, wait!

322
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:41,299
Oh, my.

323
00:38:04,445 --> 00:38:07,114
Critical care unit, Nancy here.

324
00:38:07,714 --> 00:38:09,650
It's for you.

325
00:38:16,457 --> 00:38:18,658
This is Miranda.

326
00:38:21,996 --> 00:38:24,264
I'll be right there.

327
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,502
Will you clean the phone?

328
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:36,944
- Do you think something bit him?
- I don't know.

329
00:38:37,044 --> 00:38:39,446
- Something poisonous.
- Maybe.

330
00:38:39,546 --> 00:38:42,883
- I tried lifting him, but...
- Did you fall?

331
00:38:43,017 --> 00:38:44,952
A little bit.

332
00:38:45,052 --> 00:38:46,553
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm alright.

333
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:50,725
- I'll take care of him.
- You know, he might get mad.

334
00:38:50,825 --> 00:38:53,154
If you want to get better, dog,
you come with me.

335
00:38:53,344 --> 00:38:55,496
You can't be pushy.
You have to let him come to you.

336
00:38:55,596 --> 00:38:57,328
That's okay, I came prepared.

337
00:38:57,731 --> 00:38:59,984
Hospital food!

338
00:39:00,868 --> 00:39:03,070
Come here, Benny.

339
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:06,941
Hospital food, come here, dog.
There you go. You'll come with me.

340
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:09,154
- You'll come with me, right?
- Very funny.

341
00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:13,914
Hospital food. Come into the car.
There you go. There you go. Good boy.

342
00:39:14,014 --> 00:39:15,983
Oh, boy.

343
00:41:03,891 --> 00:41:06,493
You wanted to see me, so...

344
00:41:12,633 --> 00:41:14,701
William Finn.

345
00:41:18,372 --> 00:41:19,974
It's you.

346
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:23,271
I don't think anybody wants to be me.

347
00:41:24,044 --> 00:41:25,880
So yeah.

348
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,948
That's me.

349
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:30,684
You look different.

350
00:41:31,886 --> 00:41:34,588
I don't get to get out very much.

351
00:41:36,824 --> 00:41:39,526
What made you finally agree to see me?

352
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,611
An impulse.

353
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:45,766
Like every other stupid decision
I ever made.

354
00:41:51,572 --> 00:41:55,676
You can... you can say
what you came to say.

355
00:41:57,277 --> 00:41:59,713
You expect me to cry?

356
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:02,116
Scream?

357
00:42:02,216 --> 00:42:04,485
Say dear God, why me?

358
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,158
- Something like that.
- That's not me.

359
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:15,696
- I just figured from your letter.
- My letter just said I wanted to see you,

360
00:42:15,796 --> 00:42:19,300
it didn't say I had any idea
what I'd do when I got here.

361
00:42:21,902 --> 00:42:26,073
Guess I had to be sure that I could
look you in the eye and not be afraid.

362
00:42:29,743 --> 00:42:31,912
You still live in that same house?

363
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:34,214
Excuse me?

364
00:42:34,314 --> 00:42:37,117
Well, I remember you told me
you were gonna move.

365
00:42:37,217 --> 00:42:40,621
But your letters, the address,
it's the old house.

366
00:42:42,456 --> 00:42:44,791
Couldn't sell the house.

367
00:42:46,026 --> 00:42:50,030
So I'm making improvements,
making like a new house.

368
00:42:52,182 --> 00:42:54,251
I'm sorry.

369
00:42:55,769 --> 00:42:57,395
I'm sorry.

370
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:03,978
I was so messed up back then.

371
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:11,986
Will, let me ask you something.

372
00:43:15,222 --> 00:43:16,924
Sure, anything.

373
00:43:19,093 --> 00:43:20,861
How's the food in here?

374
00:43:23,597 --> 00:43:24,550
The food.

375
00:43:25,832 --> 00:43:27,835
How's the food?

376
00:43:42,483 --> 00:43:46,520
On time. It's almost that time.

377
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:51,525
So it is.

378
00:44:04,038 --> 00:44:08,275
I got your favorite, there you go.
I got your favorite, here you go, Benny!

379
00:44:08,442 --> 00:44:10,544
Come here, there you go.

380
00:44:11,878 --> 00:44:15,782
Yeah, you like that. You greedy dog.

381
00:44:16,316 --> 00:44:18,051
Daddy!

382
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,023
I hated putting him in here, you know,
but it's just safer that way.

383
00:44:23,123 --> 00:44:24,824
I thought you were
at the hardware store.

384
00:44:24,924 --> 00:44:27,732
I was, but they didn't need me anymore.

385
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:32,599
- And you came over not to see me?
- Actually I came by to check on the dog.

386
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:35,719
I thought you guys were sworn enemies.

387
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:39,289
The way I see it,
hating him only hurts me.

388
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:52,119
So... I got your letter.

389
00:44:52,219 --> 00:44:53,954
Yeah?

390
00:44:54,054 --> 00:44:56,556
Thank you for coming back.

391
00:44:59,726 --> 00:45:01,962
I wanted to see you.

392
00:45:02,763 --> 00:45:05,632
I'm surprised that you could
even read that letter.

393
00:45:05,732 --> 00:45:07,935
I'm sure there was tons
of mistakes in it.

394
00:45:08,902 --> 00:45:11,071
I was never that good in school.

395
00:45:11,972 --> 00:45:14,108
You're taking classes in here, right?

396
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:17,527
Yeah. I mean, yes.

397
00:45:17,627 --> 00:45:20,881
My teacher is a real hardass
for stuff like that.

398
00:45:20,981 --> 00:45:23,016
I'm sorry that I curse.

399
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:28,288
- You say sorry a lot.
- I have a lot to be sorry for.

400
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:34,261
What's something you're not sorry for?

401
00:45:34,361 --> 00:45:36,596
Something you're good at.

402
00:45:38,498 --> 00:45:41,151
I don't know, screwing up,
getting caught.

403
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:43,053
I'm serious.

404
00:45:45,038 --> 00:45:46,840
Fixing things.

405
00:45:48,508 --> 00:45:50,811
I've always been good at that.

406
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:55,616
When I was a kid if I broke something
my dad would always make me fix it.

407
00:45:55,716 --> 00:45:59,686
I mean, he'd beat the crap out of me,
and then he'd make me fix it.

408
00:46:01,755 --> 00:46:03,857
I started to like the way it felt.

409
00:46:03,957 --> 00:46:07,794
Putting things together, making it work.

410
00:46:11,531 --> 00:46:13,533
Kinda like you.

411
00:46:14,735 --> 00:46:18,873
- What do you mean?
- You're a nurse, aren't you?

412
00:46:19,973 --> 00:46:21,809
Yes, yes.

413
00:46:23,977 --> 00:46:26,980
I fix things, you fix people.

414
00:46:27,614 --> 00:46:29,550
Maybe we have something in common.

415
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,846
I guess we do.

416
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:49,136
Electronic stud finder.

417
00:46:50,537 --> 00:46:55,396
Whatever happened to banging on a wall
and listening for the beam?

418
00:46:59,846 --> 00:47:01,048
Well's Hardware.

419
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:03,351
Daddy, I'm gonna nickname you
"Missed call".

420
00:47:03,451 --> 00:47:05,682
<i>Yeah, well, when I need you, I need you.</i>

421
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:08,454
<i>I was in therapy. What do you need?</i>

422
00:47:08,554 --> 00:47:11,225
I need you to go check on Benny.

423
00:47:11,325 --> 00:47:14,578
- <i>Yeah, that's funny, I'm already with him.</i>
- You are?

424
00:47:14,678 --> 00:47:18,482
Yeah, and he's a lot more fun
now that he's doing what I tell him to.

425
00:47:18,582 --> 00:47:20,800
<i>Sit! Sit! Good boy.</i>

426
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,240
<i>That's a good boy.</i>

427
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,807
I can't believe you've had him
for five years and never taught him to sit.

428
00:47:26,907 --> 00:47:31,511
Now look at him and tell me something.
Does he look sick to you?

429
00:47:31,611 --> 00:47:35,415
- <i>Or am I just being a worry-wart?</i>
- No, he looks fine, Daddy.

430
00:47:35,515 --> 00:47:38,519
But then, you know, he always looks fine
when he's begging for food.

431
00:47:40,086 --> 00:47:42,623
Well, keep feeding him then. All right?

432
00:48:23,263 --> 00:48:26,633
Excuse me, ma'am,
are you here to see William Finn?

433
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:29,503
- Yes.
- He's not gonna be able to see you today.

434
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:32,940
Why not?

435
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,209
He just can't.

436
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:18,986
What, no scratch and sniff today, Billy?

437
00:49:20,887 --> 00:49:22,089
What are you talking about?

438
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:26,426
That little piece of trim that keeps
coming up in here and visiting you.

439
00:49:26,526 --> 00:49:29,363
She looks uppity if you ask me.

440
00:49:30,697 --> 00:49:32,466
You know what she looks like?

441
00:49:32,566 --> 00:49:37,504
What, you think you're the only moon-faced
kid around here that gets any visitors?

442
00:49:37,604 --> 00:49:39,439
Billy.

443
00:49:40,907 --> 00:49:43,830
Hey. You stop talking about her.

444
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:48,448
What do you think she wants
with you anyway?

445
00:49:49,749 --> 00:49:51,685
Shut up.

446
00:49:52,152 --> 00:49:56,089
Does she even know why you're here?

447
00:49:56,189 --> 00:49:58,558
Shut the fuck up.

448
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:02,880
It takes 57 minutes each way.

449
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:07,534
- I know.
- That is 114 minutes of my time, gone.

450
00:50:08,335 --> 00:50:11,304
There's a reason I couldn't
come out that day.

451
00:50:11,805 --> 00:50:14,341
All right? I got in trouble.

452
00:50:14,441 --> 00:50:16,443
What kind of trouble?

453
00:50:18,144 --> 00:50:22,066
- Some guys here like picking on me.
- So you got into a fight?

454
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:26,453
No. No, not exactly.

455
00:50:26,553 --> 00:50:29,389
- They cornered me.
- Why you?

456
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:33,560
- 'Cause they know I'm won't fight back.
- How do they know that?

457
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:37,897
Because everyone in here
knows how badly I want to get out.

458
00:50:57,367 --> 00:50:59,837
So they cornered you and you had
to spend time in solitary?

459
00:51:01,354 --> 00:51:03,224
No, the infirmary.

460
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:07,594
So... those guys who attacked you...

461
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,766
What'd they do to you?

462
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,974
Do you want to see?

463
00:51:38,993 --> 00:51:42,228
The old man's looking pretty sharp.

464
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:46,032
Yeah, well... don't get too excited,
I re-gifted.

465
00:51:46,332 --> 00:51:49,156
Oh, come on.

466
00:51:49,886 --> 00:51:52,622
Well, you're gonna spend
the night, right?

467
00:51:53,673 --> 00:51:57,244
- Dad...
- No, no. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

468
00:51:57,344 --> 00:51:59,812
You know, heaven forbid
you spend one more minute

469
00:51:59,912 --> 00:52:02,434
with your father than you have to.

470
00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:06,286
Benny, you love me, don't you?
How you doing, Benny?

471
00:52:06,386 --> 00:52:08,422
Yeah.

472
00:52:09,089 --> 00:52:12,626
- Did you get him to eat?
- He ate.

473
00:52:14,761 --> 00:52:17,141
All gone.

474
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:21,768
Yeah, I don't know. He sleeps so much.

475
00:52:21,868 --> 00:52:23,703
Maybe I should take him to the vet.

476
00:52:23,803 --> 00:52:26,237
He's not a puppy anymore, Dad.
He's getting old.

477
00:52:26,337 --> 00:52:28,992
I'm getting old, I'm retired, you know.

478
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:34,589
Benny's still here, he's young.
You got some moves, right boy?

479
00:52:44,991 --> 00:52:47,479
What you looking at there, man?

480
00:52:48,795 --> 00:52:51,765
Something that doesn't belong to you.

481
00:52:52,733 --> 00:52:55,535
You really do miss pussy.

482
00:52:56,002 --> 00:52:58,538
I don't see why though.

483
00:52:58,638 --> 00:53:02,509
Seems to me there's plenty of pussy
right here in this cell.

484
00:53:09,616 --> 00:53:11,751
You know something, Randy?

485
00:53:11,851 --> 00:53:16,356
Your shits smell better than you do.

486
00:53:20,427 --> 00:53:22,629
You ever...

487
00:53:23,029 --> 00:53:25,701
ever touch my things again...

488
00:53:27,567 --> 00:53:32,147
And only the idea of you
will be left behind.

489
00:53:44,818 --> 00:53:48,288
- Did you get the card?
- Yeah. Yeah, I loved it.

490
00:53:48,388 --> 00:53:50,124
I loved it. Thank you so much.

491
00:53:50,624 --> 00:53:51,958
It was my mom's favorite holiday.

492
00:53:52,058 --> 00:53:55,596
She used to make me sign these valentines,
those little paper ones.

493
00:53:55,696 --> 00:53:59,115
- Your mom sounds like a good lady.
- She would've liked to hear you say that.

494
00:53:59,215 --> 00:54:01,719
Actually she died when I was nine.

495
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:05,505
The...

496
00:54:05,939 --> 00:54:11,066
asthma attack, it was... she didn't
get to her medication on time. I...

497
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:15,081
- was the one who found her.
- I'm sorry, that's terrible.

498
00:54:15,481 --> 00:54:17,217
It was a long time ago.

499
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:20,453
Yeah, still.

500
00:54:20,921 --> 00:54:23,089
That must be hard. I'm sorry.

501
00:54:25,642 --> 00:54:28,962
- What about you?
- My mother?

502
00:54:31,698 --> 00:54:34,101
She left when I was 12.

503
00:54:35,735 --> 00:54:37,637
Do you hate her for that?

504
00:54:38,538 --> 00:54:40,974
I don't know how to hate anybody.

505
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:46,512
Maybe if she'd stuck around...

506
00:54:47,747 --> 00:54:50,517
maybe I could've got on a better track.

507
00:54:52,652 --> 00:54:54,787
There's still time.

508
00:55:06,546 --> 00:55:08,835
I was starting to wonder
if I was gonna see you this week.

509
00:55:08,935 --> 00:55:11,204
With the holiday all my schedules
have been off, so...

510
00:55:11,604 --> 00:55:13,773
Memorial day.

511
00:55:16,009 --> 00:55:18,011
You're nervous.

512
00:55:18,544 --> 00:55:20,583
I'm getting paroled.

513
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:22,497
Soon.

514
00:55:23,149 --> 00:55:26,720
- Does that make you nervous?
- Should I be?

515
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:32,225
Well, I don't think that you would visit me
if you thought I'd be a threat out there.

516
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:36,629
- So why'd you ask?
- Because...

517
00:55:37,697 --> 00:55:40,566
All I can think about in here...

518
00:55:41,067 --> 00:55:43,569
is how I'm gonna miss this.

519
00:55:48,408 --> 00:55:52,812
Look, if you don't want to see me
when I get out of here, I'll understand.

520
00:55:52,912 --> 00:55:55,448
But you gotta know right now...

521
00:55:56,316 --> 00:55:58,085
I would never do that again.

522
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,823
So the prison thinks
you've been rehabilitated.

523
00:56:04,357 --> 00:56:06,659
They think I've served my time.

524
00:56:09,128 --> 00:56:11,630
Do you think you've served your time?

525
00:56:12,765 --> 00:56:16,002
Look, Miranda, I can't undo what I did.

526
00:56:18,604 --> 00:56:20,040
I know.

527
00:56:22,275 --> 00:56:25,278
I won't stop saying I'm sorry.

528
00:56:27,347 --> 00:56:29,916
I want to start fixing things.

529
00:56:32,919 --> 00:56:34,581
If you let me.

530
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:45,765
Hey, I'm sorry...

531
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,802
No!

532
00:56:48,902 --> 00:56:51,578
Oh, Daddy, I'm sorry.

533
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,843
- God, look at me.
- It's okay. Here.

534
00:56:59,513 --> 00:57:03,249
- Take these.
- I should be able to do this.

535
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:07,487
He was your best friend, Daddy.
It'd be a lot for anyone.

536
00:57:07,587 --> 00:57:09,232
I can do this.

537
00:57:09,332 --> 00:57:11,324
Where's the shovel? Is it in the back?

538
00:57:11,674 --> 00:57:14,074
- You're all dressed up.
- I know. I'll wear an apron.

539
00:57:14,174 --> 00:57:16,179
No, you're gonna get a mess
all over your clothes.

540
00:57:16,279 --> 00:57:19,646
Why don't you go out and get us some food
or something, and then when you come back

541
00:57:19,746 --> 00:57:21,014
I'll be finished.

542
00:57:22,001 --> 00:57:23,770
- Chinese Gourmet?
- Yeah.

543
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:27,941
Yeah, those bird like things would...

544
00:57:28,641 --> 00:57:30,721
- Won...
- Won tons.

545
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:33,413
Oh, sweetie, I'm sad.

546
00:57:33,513 --> 00:57:36,516
Just when you two were becoming friends.

547
00:57:37,444 --> 00:57:40,820
Alright. I'll be back.

548
00:58:01,975 --> 00:58:04,143
You know, your mother...

549
00:58:04,243 --> 00:58:07,847
used to complain a bit
that I wasn't around all the time.

550
00:58:07,947 --> 00:58:11,067
It was the hardware store.
I was trying to put it together.

551
00:58:11,167 --> 00:58:14,653
- You were providing.
- Yes, I know.

552
00:58:16,122 --> 00:58:19,125
It's... confusing.

553
00:58:19,225 --> 00:58:24,170
Be a father, and not be able
to protect your children.

554
00:58:26,065 --> 00:58:30,836
I wish I had found her, not you.
That's basically what I'm saying.

555
00:58:40,846 --> 00:58:42,715
You know, Daddy...

556
00:58:45,518 --> 00:58:49,255
with us it's... bad things happen...

557
00:58:49,622 --> 00:58:51,569
and we make the best of them.

558
00:58:53,259 --> 00:58:55,316
That's right.

559
00:58:56,229 --> 00:58:58,612
That's what we do.

560
00:59:07,106 --> 00:59:08,532
Randy.

561
00:59:09,642 --> 00:59:11,777
I'm leaving you.

562
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:15,147
You gonna miss me?

563
00:59:16,381 --> 00:59:19,318
About as much as you gon' miss me.

564
00:59:20,086 --> 00:59:23,600
Randy, don't underestimate yourself.

565
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:28,461
I've...

566
00:59:28,561 --> 00:59:31,597
actually grown quite attached to you.

567
00:59:36,469 --> 00:59:38,948
All this time together...

568
00:59:39,405 --> 00:59:41,641
this is how you say goodbye?

569
00:59:43,843 --> 00:59:45,645
Well...

570
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,821
Somehow...

571
00:59:51,284 --> 00:59:53,787
I know that you won't forget me.

572
01:00:02,295 --> 01:00:04,830
Most people don't.

573
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:07,462
Have you been to Florida?
Oh, my God, you have to go.

574
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,051
- I would like to.
- Have you been to Florida?

575
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:12,306
Hey, Miranda, come here.
You've got to look at this.

576
01:00:12,406 --> 01:00:13,467
Yeah, what is that?

577
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:16,576
She just got back from her vacation
in Orlando. Show her.

578
01:00:16,676 --> 01:00:18,211
I swam with the dolphins.

579
01:00:18,311 --> 01:00:21,147
Poor sharks, no one
ever wants to swim with them.

580
01:00:21,247 --> 01:00:24,007
Here are the two kids at the Magic
Kingdom. That was super fun.

581
01:00:24,107 --> 01:00:26,653
- They got their faces painted.
- Cute! How old is he?

582
01:00:26,753 --> 01:00:28,688
- He's like, four.
- Oh, so cute.

583
01:00:28,788 --> 01:00:32,291
- Don't you have a vacation coming up?
- You should really go to Orlando.

584
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:35,488
I... Florida in the summertime?
It seems redundant.

585
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:37,797
- Where are you going, then?
- Canada?

586
01:00:37,897 --> 01:00:39,599
I'm staying home, actually.

587
01:00:39,699 --> 01:00:42,492
You can't stay home. It's your vacation.
What's the point?

588
01:00:42,592 --> 01:00:44,738
It's where my house is,
and I'm still working on it.

589
01:00:44,838 --> 01:00:47,174
And I'm gonna finish it
once and for all.

590
01:00:52,578 --> 01:00:54,947
She needs to find a man. Right?

591
01:00:55,047 --> 01:00:56,516
Miranda Wells?

592
01:00:57,244 --> 01:01:00,086
- Do y'all know Miranda?
- That's me.

593
01:01:06,259 --> 01:01:08,161
Thank you.

594
01:01:08,561 --> 01:01:13,202
- Who's it from?
- Oh, just my dad. You know how he is.

595
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:17,503
Did she say from her dad?

596
01:01:20,506 --> 01:01:23,793
<i>Did you... did you get
the flowers I sent?</i>

597
01:01:23,893 --> 01:01:25,478
I got 'em.

598
01:01:25,578 --> 01:01:29,082
They were just delivered. At my work.

599
01:01:29,582 --> 01:01:33,820
You don't like 'em?
That's all I could afford right now.

600
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:38,825
The flowers are not the problem,
William. They're fine.

601
01:01:38,925 --> 01:01:41,728
It's having them delivered
at my workplace is the problem.

602
01:01:43,263 --> 01:01:45,532
Oh, yeah, you don't want them
knowing about us?

603
01:01:49,435 --> 01:01:52,305
Not that there's an us. I'm sorry.

604
01:01:52,405 --> 01:01:56,109
- <i>Stop saying you're sorry.</i>
- Well, I just want to stay in touch.

605
01:01:56,509 --> 01:01:58,545
You could've written.
You could've called.

606
01:01:59,762 --> 01:02:00,757
I could?

607
01:02:00,857 --> 01:02:04,384
<i>Yeah, I thought I made that clear
last time I visited.</i>

608
01:02:06,786 --> 01:02:08,554
Well, I just...

609
01:02:08,654 --> 01:02:11,457
figured maybe you were just saying that.

610
01:02:11,924 --> 01:02:16,429
No, 'cause when I say something
I mean it.

611
01:02:16,829 --> 01:02:19,765
<i>I hope the same goes for you.</i>

612
01:02:25,238 --> 01:02:27,773
- <i>William?</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

613
01:02:27,873 --> 01:02:29,901
Sorry, you...

614
01:02:30,201 --> 01:02:32,459
cut out. What'd you say?

615
01:02:35,248 --> 01:02:37,316
Doesn't matter.

616
01:02:49,962 --> 01:02:51,764
Fuck!

617
01:03:02,091 --> 01:03:03,740
Miranda?

618
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,192
William! You're here.

619
01:03:12,185 --> 01:03:14,659
I promised I'd come.
You didn't believe me?

620
01:03:14,759 --> 01:03:18,041
No, I did, I did.
I just didn't expect you so soon.

621
01:03:18,491 --> 01:03:21,760
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

622
01:03:22,895 --> 01:03:25,064
Just anxious to fix things.

623
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,835
Well, then let's get started.

624
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:32,621
One minute.

625
01:03:46,118 --> 01:03:48,721
I'm gonna go get something to drink.

626
01:03:49,322 --> 01:03:51,724
You want some lemonade?

627
01:03:51,824 --> 01:03:53,826
Homemade.

628
01:03:53,926 --> 01:03:55,582
That sounds really good.

629
01:03:59,398 --> 01:04:01,434
Thank you.

630
01:04:36,635 --> 01:04:39,738
Wait, let me. I'll take that.

631
01:04:40,311 --> 01:04:42,374
I got it, thanks.

632
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:46,411
Here?

633
01:04:52,718 --> 01:04:55,648
I... wanted to come back and...

634
01:04:55,748 --> 01:04:57,974
fix this hole here.

635
01:04:58,557 --> 01:05:00,626
If you'd let me.

636
01:05:00,726 --> 01:05:02,661
I insist.

637
01:05:05,464 --> 01:05:07,199
So...

638
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,102
I'll see you?

639
01:05:11,604 --> 01:05:13,672
You'll see me.

640
01:05:15,808 --> 01:05:17,843
All right.

641
01:05:31,774 --> 01:05:37,635
No, just give me some Elmer's glue
and a straight head, and...

642
01:05:37,735 --> 01:05:40,533
well, I'll make you
something really good.

643
01:05:40,633 --> 01:05:43,769
You're as stubborn
as gum on carpet, Mitchell.

644
01:05:43,869 --> 01:05:48,107
If you pull those strings with Mr. Simmons
you can be as old school as you want.

645
01:05:48,207 --> 01:05:50,843
I'll tell you something. It's Simpson.

646
01:05:51,811 --> 01:05:54,680
And Jerry... Jerry's gonna
give you what you want.

647
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:59,018
- He'll give you your second story.
- Thank you, Mitchell.

648
01:05:59,118 --> 01:06:00,920
Welcome!

649
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,804
Hey...

650
01:06:05,758 --> 01:06:08,527
- I need some paint.
- Okay.

651
01:06:08,627 --> 01:06:11,414
- To match this color.
- Yeah, how much you need?

652
01:06:11,514 --> 01:06:14,567
I figure a gallon'll do.
Fix a porch ceiling.

653
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:18,070
- Big hole in it.
- Okay. I'll get you set up.

654
01:06:51,036 --> 01:06:53,339
Okay, that's $21.15.

655
01:06:56,909 --> 01:06:58,644
Okay.

656
01:07:16,261 --> 01:07:18,864
It's just five cents more.

657
01:07:49,028 --> 01:07:50,863
Mitchell?

658
01:07:54,967 --> 01:07:56,435
Miranda!

659
01:07:58,086 --> 01:08:00,806
- Miranda!
- Daddy!

660
01:08:00,906 --> 01:08:02,458
What the hell are you thinking about?

661
01:08:02,558 --> 01:08:04,893
- What are you talking about?
- That son of a bitch!

662
01:08:04,993 --> 01:08:06,378
When did he get out?

663
01:08:06,478 --> 01:08:09,276
How does he have the nerve to get out

664
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:12,580
- and show his face within 100 miles of here.
- Daddy, calm down. Calm down.

665
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:17,089
I am calmed down!
He's a lowlife scumbag, Miranda.

666
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:18,791
Has he been over here?

667
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:20,059
- No.
- Tell me the truth.

668
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:22,662
Then what is this, Miranda?
This is a chip of paint.

669
01:08:22,762 --> 01:08:27,099
He brought it into the shop.
It matches that ceiling.

670
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:31,437
Daddy, listen, okay?
William's been here.

671
01:08:31,537 --> 01:08:36,192
- Please... don't say that name around me!
- Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

672
01:08:36,292 --> 01:08:38,887
He raped you, Miranda, right here
in this house! He raped you.

673
01:08:38,987 --> 01:08:41,714
I know that, Daddy.
And I'm not forgetting it.

674
01:08:42,514 --> 01:08:46,385
I'm letting him fix things. Okay?
He wants to fix things.

675
01:08:46,485 --> 01:08:49,088
This... Miranda, this can't be fixed!

676
01:08:49,188 --> 01:08:53,025
It can't be undone, Daddy, but I'm trying
to figure out a way to move on.

677
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:57,162
- And this is how you do it?
- Tell me right way, Daddy.

678
01:08:57,896 --> 01:09:00,332
I don't know. You know...

679
01:09:01,016 --> 01:09:03,669
You want me to sit and cry
in therapy for 10 years

680
01:09:03,769 --> 01:09:06,305
writing in some goddamn journal
about my feelings?

681
01:09:06,405 --> 01:09:09,074
That's not me.
It'd be like drowning in a puddle.

682
01:09:09,174 --> 01:09:11,710
I'd be dying by inches.

683
01:09:12,728 --> 01:09:16,231
You want me to hate him forever?
That hurts no one but me.

684
01:09:16,916 --> 01:09:18,968
I'm tired of hurting.

685
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:21,954
Miranda, there are
other options than that.

686
01:09:22,054 --> 01:09:25,288
Other options than having your rapist
over for dinner!

687
01:09:25,388 --> 01:09:29,228
He's fixing the porch, okay?
We're not over here sipping tea, Daddy.

688
01:09:29,328 --> 01:09:32,915
He fucking stays on the porch.
He's fixing the fucking porch!

689
01:09:33,015 --> 01:09:36,235
- Well, I can fix the porch!
- But I need him to fix it.

690
01:09:36,335 --> 01:09:38,970
Okay, that's what I need.

691
01:09:42,607 --> 01:09:45,110
I don't know you.

692
01:09:45,644 --> 01:09:47,933
I don't know you.

693
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:09,384
You didn't show up.

694
01:10:09,484 --> 01:10:12,204
I did actually, I just...

695
01:10:12,304 --> 01:10:15,275
- Just didn't stay.
- You were here?

696
01:10:15,375 --> 01:10:18,410
Yeah. I was across the street.

697
01:10:18,844 --> 01:10:20,779
<i>I saw your dad.</i>

698
01:10:20,879 --> 01:10:22,749
<i>I heard him, too.</i>

699
01:10:22,849 --> 01:10:24,139
<i>I figure...</i>

700
01:10:25,017 --> 01:10:27,645
I best not stick around.

701
01:10:29,221 --> 01:10:31,053
<i>In fact...</i>

702
01:10:31,957 --> 01:10:34,526
I'm not sure it's such a good idea to...

703
01:10:34,827 --> 01:10:37,162
<i>to come around, period.</i>

704
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,235
You still there?

705
01:10:45,003 --> 01:10:48,040
Listen. I know my dad...

706
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:51,677
an outburst like that he'll either sleep
or work for two weeks straight.

707
01:10:51,777 --> 01:10:53,529
He won't be back any time soon.

708
01:10:53,629 --> 01:10:56,665
Yeah, I just don't want
to cause more harm.

709
01:10:58,183 --> 01:11:01,651
You know, I feel like I've done
enough of that for a lifetime.

710
01:11:02,087 --> 01:11:04,056
<i>What do you think?</i>

711
01:11:04,156 --> 01:11:07,526
I think you're afraid
of a 70-year-old man.

712
01:11:22,641 --> 01:11:24,943
I wasn't sure you'd still come.

713
01:11:25,043 --> 01:11:27,279
I said I would.

714
01:11:29,114 --> 01:11:31,316
Oh, shit.

715
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:34,353
- What?
- Sorry, I forgot the paint.

716
01:11:34,853 --> 01:11:37,550
It's okay, we have other things to do.

717
01:11:41,093 --> 01:11:43,695
You want a drink before we get started?

718
01:11:44,497 --> 01:11:46,837
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

719
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:58,225
I was thinking I might just try
this carpenter thing. Full time.

720
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:04,115
What'd you say?

721
01:12:07,286 --> 01:12:09,555
I was just saying I could...

722
01:12:09,655 --> 01:12:11,690
get used to this.

723
01:12:15,794 --> 01:12:17,913
Too sweet?

724
01:12:18,013 --> 01:12:20,981
- No, it's perfect.
- Good.

725
01:12:57,536 --> 01:13:01,085
Can I... give you a hand?

726
01:13:02,541 --> 01:13:03,602
Sure.

727
01:13:46,068 --> 01:13:48,127
You're dripping.

728
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,255
Shit.

729
01:13:50,355 --> 01:13:51,786
I'm sorry about that.

730
01:14:19,384 --> 01:14:21,053
Something wrong?

731
01:14:21,553 --> 01:14:23,622
I don't know, my...

732
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:28,960
My stomach's just feeling
a little messed up.

733
01:14:41,239 --> 01:14:43,141
What'd you eat today?

734
01:14:43,241 --> 01:14:45,877
Just some clam chowder.

735
01:14:46,111 --> 01:14:48,113
That'll do it.

736
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:54,319
Look, I'm so... I'm sorry about this.
Can I maybe just...

737
01:14:54,887 --> 01:14:57,155
use your bathroom?

738
01:14:57,255 --> 01:14:58,891
Just lie down for a minute?

739
01:14:59,191 --> 01:15:02,561
- Could you go home?
- No, I don't think I can make it home.

740
01:15:03,161 --> 01:15:05,714
Look, maybe if I just...

741
01:15:06,665 --> 01:15:09,752
If I just get where it's cool inside.

742
01:15:09,852 --> 01:15:14,269
I'm just... I'm sorry,
I'm really not feeling too well.

743
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:16,431
It's okay.

744
01:15:20,912 --> 01:15:22,781
Okay.

745
01:15:22,881 --> 01:15:24,750
Sure.

746
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:27,586
You can come in.

747
01:15:47,172 --> 01:15:49,007
Well...

748
01:15:59,117 --> 01:16:01,152
Hey, you.

749
01:16:07,559 --> 01:16:09,561
What happened?

750
01:16:10,429 --> 01:16:11,974
You passed out.

751
01:16:18,636 --> 01:16:20,645
Thank you.

752
01:16:29,081 --> 01:16:30,720
You are so pretty.

753
01:16:33,418 --> 01:16:36,855
- Thank you, William.
- Look at you...

754
01:16:36,955 --> 01:16:39,024
taking such good care of me.

755
01:16:40,325 --> 01:16:43,123
It's the thing we have
in common, remember?

756
01:16:43,829 --> 01:16:47,299
- Yeah, I fix things.
- Exactly, and I fix people.

757
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:02,554
You know what's wrong with me?

758
01:17:03,148 --> 01:17:05,250
Of course I do.

759
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:07,152
Yeah?

760
01:17:09,721 --> 01:17:12,090
You're a rapist, William.

761
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:14,692
That's what's wrong with you.

762
01:17:17,395 --> 01:17:19,798
Miranda. Hey!

763
01:17:19,898 --> 01:17:21,733
What the fuck...

764
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:24,657
What the fuck is...

765
01:17:25,304 --> 01:17:27,289
What are you doing?

766
01:17:27,389 --> 01:17:31,854
Surely you didn't think I'd forgotten
that you came into my home and raped me?

767
01:17:32,911 --> 01:17:34,480
Did you make me sick?

768
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:40,406
No. The antifreeze made you sick.
I just provided it to you.

769
01:17:44,789 --> 01:17:47,504
Oh, come on, I didn't give you
any more than I gave Benny,

770
01:17:47,604 --> 01:17:49,895
and you got a good 70 pounds on him.

771
01:17:52,631 --> 01:17:54,499
You fucking crazy?

772
01:17:54,799 --> 01:17:56,601
No.

773
01:17:57,302 --> 01:17:59,862
No, I'm not crazy, William.

774
01:17:59,962 --> 01:18:03,875
Crazy suggests that I don't know
right from wrong.

775
01:18:03,975 --> 01:18:06,077
And I do.

776
01:18:06,177 --> 01:18:09,681
This... is clearly wrong.

777
01:18:10,649 --> 01:18:13,786
Miranda... look at me.

778
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,567
You're a nurse.

779
01:18:18,456 --> 01:18:21,247
That means you save people.

780
01:18:22,594 --> 01:18:26,298
I saw you save that man
that was choking.

781
01:18:26,398 --> 01:18:28,433
I was there.

782
01:18:28,533 --> 01:18:30,852
You saved his life.

783
01:18:30,952 --> 01:18:32,955
You saw that?

784
01:18:33,405 --> 01:18:34,840
You saw what I got to do?

785
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:37,965
I got to stick a knife into
a man's throat in broad daylight,

786
01:18:38,065 --> 01:18:40,678
and people wanted me to do it.

787
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:44,015
In fact, they applauded.

788
01:18:46,518 --> 01:18:50,021
- What are you doing?
- Room service.

789
01:18:53,558 --> 01:18:56,502
What did you give me, Miranda?

790
01:19:01,433 --> 01:19:04,745
<i>Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.</i>

791
01:19:27,992 --> 01:19:30,328
I'm getting good at this.

792
01:19:37,736 --> 01:19:40,209
All right, I get it.

793
01:19:50,149 --> 01:19:55,139
I'm kind of surprised you trust me
to give you water. Considering.

794
01:20:00,858 --> 01:20:02,661
Go ahead.

795
01:20:02,761 --> 01:20:06,682
Go ahead and drink, William.
At this point what do you have to lose?

796
01:20:07,966 --> 01:20:10,068
You wanna watch?

797
01:20:20,211 --> 01:20:22,080
Hold that thought.

798
01:20:35,694 --> 01:20:37,522
Now...

799
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:41,132
You stay right there.

800
01:21:21,139 --> 01:21:23,876
- Do you have something for me?
- Yes, ma'am, it's right there.

801
01:21:27,579 --> 01:21:29,581
Thank you.

802
01:22:09,587 --> 01:22:11,278
Please.

803
01:22:11,378 --> 01:22:14,092
Don't. Please.

804
01:22:14,192 --> 01:22:16,496
Just in time.

805
01:22:20,865 --> 01:22:24,202
Used up my very last one three days ago.

806
01:22:24,936 --> 01:22:27,706
- Oh, it hurts, doesn't it?
- What are you doing to me?

807
01:22:27,806 --> 01:22:31,543
I'm sorry it hurts,
I know it hurts. Here.

808
01:22:31,643 --> 01:22:36,014
Hold my hand.
Hold my hand, there you go.

809
01:22:36,114 --> 01:22:38,750
There you go, squeeze
all you want. That's it.

810
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:41,820
William, you're hurting me!
William! Stop it, stop it!

811
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,490
You're hurting me, stop it, stop it!
William, let go, let go, let go!

812
01:22:50,829 --> 01:22:53,932
Thank God that's not my hand.

813
01:22:55,033 --> 01:22:57,074
What the fuck?

814
01:22:58,537 --> 01:23:00,673
What is that?

815
01:23:01,473 --> 01:23:06,061
Honestly, you know, I'm not even
allowed to perform surgery.

816
01:23:06,161 --> 01:23:07,812
Not even allowed to assist in surgery.

817
01:23:07,912 --> 01:23:11,182
I've been having
this terrible problem with my hand.

818
01:23:11,282 --> 01:23:13,151
Help!

819
01:23:13,251 --> 01:23:15,087
Hey!

820
01:23:15,687 --> 01:23:18,689
I developed this terrible twitch.

821
01:23:24,696 --> 01:23:26,998
It's getting better.

822
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,478
That's so weird.

823
01:23:32,036 --> 01:23:36,074
You should really look
at yourself. Here.

824
01:23:38,877 --> 01:23:41,713
Seriously though,
look at your expression.

825
01:23:41,813 --> 01:23:43,948
Your eyes.

826
01:23:44,048 --> 01:23:48,086
It's fascinating, isn't it?
That's why I work in critical care.

827
01:23:48,186 --> 01:23:50,855
You get to see what really
matters to people.

828
01:23:50,955 --> 01:23:55,327
You're not a killer.
I know you're not a killer.

829
01:23:55,427 --> 01:23:58,295
You're not gonna let me die.

830
01:23:59,981 --> 01:24:02,854
I let my mother die, William.

831
01:24:04,001 --> 01:24:07,856
She did a lot of things,
but she didn't fuck me from behind.

832
01:24:10,508 --> 01:24:14,312
So really, William, the question is...

833
01:24:15,713 --> 01:24:18,082
What matters to you?

834
01:24:18,383 --> 01:24:20,385
You do.

835
01:24:22,687 --> 01:24:24,723
You do.

836
01:24:25,473 --> 01:24:28,527
- I do?
- Yeah.

837
01:24:29,227 --> 01:24:32,564
'Cause you're pretty stupid
and predictable.

838
01:24:32,664 --> 01:24:34,833
You know that?

839
01:24:34,933 --> 01:24:37,448
Oh, I almost forgot.

840
01:24:38,202 --> 01:24:40,386
What goodies did you bring?

841
01:24:42,307 --> 01:24:45,106
What's in the backpack?

842
01:24:47,778 --> 01:24:50,147
No, Miranda!

843
01:24:57,088 --> 01:24:58,990
Wallet.

844
01:25:00,925 --> 01:25:02,827
Keys.

845
01:25:04,762 --> 01:25:07,678
Don't tell me you were that optimistic.

846
01:25:09,934 --> 01:25:12,770
That's not what it looks like.

847
01:25:14,806 --> 01:25:17,775
I wasn't gonna do anything with that.

848
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:19,878
You know what I was thinking...

849
01:25:19,978 --> 01:25:22,680
when you were raping me?

850
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:28,107
When I thought that I might die...

851
01:25:31,589 --> 01:25:32,970
I was thinking...

852
01:25:36,027 --> 01:25:38,329
Is it in yet?

853
01:25:41,933 --> 01:25:44,779
'Cause I couldn't feel a thing.

854
01:25:48,006 --> 01:25:50,607
But I'm pretty certain
that you feel me now, don't you?

855
01:26:01,352 --> 01:26:03,860
Take a look at yourself.

856
01:26:09,027 --> 01:26:11,062
Go on.

857
01:26:16,167 --> 01:26:18,736
Help! Help!

858
01:26:18,836 --> 01:26:21,005
- Help!
- You're right, William...

859
01:26:21,606 --> 01:26:23,574
I win.

860
01:26:32,683 --> 01:26:34,685
I win.

861
01:27:00,444 --> 01:27:03,614
- Daddy, I'm so sorry.
- Don't...

862
01:27:04,015 --> 01:27:06,017
apologize.

863
01:27:06,651 --> 01:27:08,352
Please don't.

864
01:27:08,452 --> 01:27:11,088
I know that it's...

865
01:27:12,724 --> 01:27:14,709
I know that this doesn't make
a lot of sense...

866
01:27:14,809 --> 01:27:16,644
Manny.

867
01:27:16,994 --> 01:27:19,497
It doesn't make any sense.

868
01:27:19,597 --> 01:27:21,666
At all.

869
01:27:24,302 --> 01:27:27,560
You were so strong, Miranda.

870
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:33,861
When your mother died,
everyone figured you would rebel,

871
01:27:33,961 --> 01:27:37,038
cause all sorts of troubles.

872
01:27:37,515 --> 01:27:41,886
But you stayed the course.
You stayed levelheaded.

873
01:27:44,756 --> 01:27:47,992
For the first time in my life...

874
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,996
I'm scared.

875
01:27:53,598 --> 01:27:56,167
I'm really worried about you.

876
01:27:57,869 --> 01:28:01,339
- You don't have to worry.
- This is your life.

877
01:28:01,739 --> 01:28:03,841
I know that, Daddy.

878
01:28:06,210 --> 01:28:08,979
So I put an end to it.

879
01:28:12,666 --> 01:28:15,469
He won't be coming around anymore.

880
01:30:14,572 --> 01:30:16,781
<i>Strength</i>

881
01:30:20,111 --> 01:30:24,327
<i>We'll fight another day</i>

882
01:30:26,684 --> 01:30:30,755
<i>To break the silence</i>

883
01:30:30,855 --> 01:30:36,210
<i>Of a sleepless mind</i>

884
01:30:47,839 --> 01:30:50,074
<i>Fend</i>

885
01:30:53,144 --> 01:30:57,435
<i>For your and my own sake</i>

886
01:30:59,783 --> 01:31:03,871
<i>We sail together</i>

887
01:31:03,971 --> 01:31:09,341
<i>Through the blazing sky</i>

888
01:31:20,705 --> 01:31:23,674
<i>Send us shining</i>

889
01:31:23,774 --> 01:31:27,011
<i>Out of this state</i>

890
01:31:27,111 --> 01:31:30,348
<i>Divided we let go</i>

891
01:31:30,448 --> 01:31:33,585
<i>Unite us we'll pay</i>

892
01:31:33,685 --> 01:31:36,854
<i>For times our freedom</i>

893
01:31:36,954 --> 01:31:40,191
<i>Leads us in vain</i>

894
01:31:40,291 --> 01:31:43,561
<i>Derided we stand down</i>

895
01:31:43,661 --> 01:31:47,298
<i>All blinded by faith</i>

896
01:31:47,398 --> 01:31:49,667
<i>Mend</i>

897
01:31:52,738 --> 01:31:56,975
<i>Our hearts won't lay astray</i>

898
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:03,414
<i>They soar forever</i>

899
01:32:03,514 --> 01:32:08,888
<i>Elevate us high</i>

900
01:32:20,414 --> 01:32:22,617
<i>Bend</i>

901
01:32:25,853 --> 01:32:30,557
<i>This life through our own ways</i>

902
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:36,480
<i>As freedom comes on</i>

903
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:39,100
<i>Clouds of smoke</i>

904
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,711
<i>We rise</i>

905
01:32:53,414 --> 01:32:56,310
<i>Send us shining</i>

906
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:59,757
<i>Out of this state</i>

907
01:32:59,857 --> 01:33:03,061
<i>Divided we let go</i>

908
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:06,293
<i>Unite us we'll pay</i>

909
01:33:06,393 --> 01:33:09,597
<i>For times our freedom</i>

910
01:33:09,697 --> 01:33:12,900
<i>Leads us in vain</i>

911
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,220
<i>Derided we stand down</i>

912
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:20,558
<i>All blinded by faith</i>
