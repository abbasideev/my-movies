00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,040
Lydia! Kitty!

2
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,330
My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard?

3
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,210
Netherfield Park is let at last. Do you not want to know who has taken it?

4
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,430
As you wish to tell me, my dear, I doubt I have any choice in the matter.

5
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,310
Kitty, what have I told you about listening at the door?

6
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,310
There's a Mr Bingley arrived from the North.

7
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,730
- Five thousand a year! - Really?

8
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,530
- He's single! - Who's single?

9
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,400
A Mr Bingley, apparently. Kitty!

10
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,450
How can that possibly affect them?

11
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,780
Mr Bennet, how can you be so tiresome?

12
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,330
You know he must marry one of them.

13
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,540
That is his design in settling here?

14
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,960
You must go and visit him at once.

15
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,090
Good heavens. People.

16
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,630
For we may not visit if you do not, as you well know, Mr Bennet.

17
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,010
- Are you listening? You never listen. - You must, Papa! At once!

18
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,720
There's no need. I already have.

19
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,350
- You have? - When?

20
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,110
Oh, Mr Bennet, how can you tease me so?

21
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,690
Have you no compassion for my poor nerves?

22
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,490
You mistake me, my dear. I have the highest respect for them.

23
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,950
They've been my constant companions these twenty years.

24
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Papa!

25
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,580
- Is he amiable? - Who?

26
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,120
- Is he handsome? - He's sure to be.

27
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,500
With 5,000 a year, it would not matter if he had warts.

28
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,040
Who's got warts?

29
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,460
I will consent to his marrying whichever girl he chooses.

30
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,880
- So will he come to the ball tomorrow? - I believe so.

31
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,970
- Mr Bennet! - [Kitty] I have to have your muslin!

32
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,980
- I'll lend you my green slippers! - They were mine.

33
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,900
- I'll do your mending for a week. - I'll retrim your new bonnet.

34
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,810
Two weeks I'll do it for.

35
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,090
[# jig]

36
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,400
It's not the same! It's not the same.

37
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,450
I can't breathe.

38
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,000
[girl] I think one of my toes just came off.

39
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,130
If every man does not end the evening in love with you,

40
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,100
then I'm no judge of beauty.

41
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,310
- Or men. - No, they are far too easy to judge.

42
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,020
They're not all bad.

43
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,060
Humourless poppycocks, in my limited experience.

44
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,520
One day, someone will catch your eye,

45
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,110
and then you'll have to watch your tongue.

46
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,590
How good of you to come.

47
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,430
Which of the painted peacocks is our Mr Bingley?

48
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,340
He's on the right. On the left is his sister.

49
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:39,560
- The person with the quizzical brow? - That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.

50
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,150
- He looks miserable, poor soul. - He may be, but poor he is not.

51
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,310
Tell me.

52
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,280
1 0,000 a year, and he owns half of Derbyshire.

53
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,490
The miserable half.

54
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,550
[# jig]

55
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,770
Mr Bennet, you must introduce him to the girls immediately.

56
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,480
Smile at Mr Bingley. Smile.

57
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
Mary.

58
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,170
Mr Bingley, my eldest daughter you know.

59
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,760
Mrs Bennet, Miss Jane Bennet, Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet.

60
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,680
It is a pleasure. I have two others, but they're already dancing.

61
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,220
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.

62
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,730
And may I introduce Mr Darcy of Pemberley in Derbyshire.

63
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,580
How do you like it here in Hertfordshire?

64
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,750
Very much.

65
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,250
The library at Netherfield, I've heard, is one of the finest.

66
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,880
It fills me with guilt. I'm not a good reader. I prefer being out of doors.

67
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,640
Oh, I mean, I can read, of course.

68
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,260
And I'm not suggesting you can't read out of doors.

69
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,190
[Jane] I wish I read more, but there seem to be so many other things to do.

70
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,650
[Bingley] That's exactly what I meant.

71
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,690
Mama, Mama! You will never, ever believe what we're about to tell you.

72
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,490
- Tell me! - She's going to take the veil.

73
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,030
- The regiment are coming! - Officers?

74
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,450
They're going to be stationed the whole winter, right here.

75
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,160
- Officers? - As far as the eye can see.

76
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,550
[Mrs Bennet] Oh, look. Jane's dancing with Mr Bingley.

77
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,220
Mr Bennet.

78
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,490
- Do you dance, Mr Darcy? - Not if I can help it.

79
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,470
I didn't know you were coming to see me. What's the matter?

80
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,350
We are a long way from Grosvenor Square, are we not, Mr Darcy?

81
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,720
I've never seen so many pretty girls.

82
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,390
You were dancing with the only handsome girl.

83
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,560
She is the most beautiful creature I have ever beheld.

84
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,110
- But her sister Elizabeth is agreeable. - Perfectly tolerable.

85
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,570
Not handsome enough to tempt me. Return to your partner and enjoy her smiles.

86
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,200
[Darcy] You're wasting your time with me.

87
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,710
Count your blessings, Lizzie. If he liked you, you'd have to talk to him.

88
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,170
Precisely.

89
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,090
I wouldn't dance with him for all of Derbyshire,

90
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,630
Iet alone the miserable half.

91
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,340
[# jig]

92
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,740
Wait!

93
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:07,180
- I enjoyed that so much, Miss Lucas. - How well you dance, Mr Bingley.

94
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,640
[woman] I've never enjoyed a dance so much.

95
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,680
My daughter Jane is a splendid dancer, is she not?

96
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,810
She is indeed.

97
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,020
Your friend Miss Lucas is a most amusing young woman.

98
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,900
Oh, yes, I adore her.

99
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,240
- It is a pity she's not more handsome. - Mama!

100
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,910
Oh, but Lizzie would never admit that she's plain.

101
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,330
Of course, it's my Jane who's considered the beauty of the county.

102
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Mama, please!

103
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,790
When she was 1 5, a gentleman was so much in love with her,

104
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,170
I was sure he would make her an offer.

105
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,920
However, he did write her some very pretty verses.

106
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,340
And that put paid to it.

107
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,930
I wonder who discovered the power of poetry in driving away love.

108
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,470
- I thought poetry was the food of love. - Of a fine, stout love.

109
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,140
But if it is only a vague inclination, one poor sonnet will kill it.

110
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,350
So, what do you recommend to encourage affection?

111
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:06,320
Dancing. Even if one's partner is barely tolerable.

112
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,260
[hushed] Mr Bingley is just what a young man ought to be.

113
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,930
- Sensible, good-humoured... - Handsome, conveniently rich...

114
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,940
Marriage should not be driven by thoughts of money.

115
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,310
Only deep love will persuade me to marry.

116
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,150
- Which is why I'll end up an old maid. - Do you really believe he liked me?

117
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,820
He danced with you most of the night, and stared at you the rest.

118
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,990
I give you leave to like him. You've liked many stupider.

119
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,450
You're a great deal too apt to like people in general.

120
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,580
All the world is good in your eyes.

121
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,040
Not his friend. I still can't believe what he said about you.

122
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,630
Mr Darcy?

123
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,590
I'd more easily forgive his vanity had he not wounded mine.

124
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,550
But no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak again.

125
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,210
[Mrs Bennet] He danced with Miss Lucas.

126
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,260
[Mr Bennet] We were all there, dear.

127
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,550
It is a shame she's not more handsome.

128
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,470
There's a spinster in the making and no mistake.

129
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,310
The fourth with a Miss King of little standing,

130
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,600
and the fifth again with Jane.

131
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,060
If he had any compassion, he would've sprained his ankle.

132
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,400
The way you carry on,

133
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,650
you'd think our girls look forward to a grand inheritance.

134
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,110
When you die, which may be very soon,

135
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,820
they will be left without a roof over their head nor a penny to their name.

136
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,580
- Please, it's ten in the morning. - A letter to Miss Bennet, ma'am.

137
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,250
From Netherfield Hall.

138
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,130
- Praise the Lord. We are saved! - [laughter]

139
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:30,300
[Mrs Bennet] Make haste, Jane, make haste. Oh, happy day!

140
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,340
It is from Caroline Bingley.

141
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:39,260
She has invited me to dine with her.

142
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,520
- Her brother will be dining out. - Dining out?

143
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,650
- Can I take the carriage? - Let me see.

144
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,520
- It is too far to walk. - This is unaccountable of him.

145
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,610
Mama, the carriage for Jane?

146
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,320
Certainly not. She'll go on horseback.

147
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,370
[Lizzie & Jane] Horseback!

148
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,200
[thunder]

149
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,550
Lizzie.

150
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,100
Now she'll have to stay the night, exactly as I predicted.

151
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,430
Good grief, woman, your skills in the art of matchmaking

152
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,480
are positively occult.

153
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,270
Though I don't think, Mama, you can take credit for making it rain.

154
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,660
"My friends will not hear of me returning home until I am better.

155
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,910
Excepting a sore throat, a fever and a headache, nothing is wrong with me."

156
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,290
If Jane does die it will be a comfort to know it was in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

157
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,790
People do not die of colds.

158
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,380
[Lizzie] But she may perish with the shame of having such a mother.

159
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,260
I must go to Netherfield at once.

160
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,400
Lady Bathurst is redecorating her ballroom in the French style.

161
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,780
A little unpatriotic, don't you think?

162
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,250
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

163
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,180
[Caroline] Good Lord, did you walk here?

164
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,390
I did.

165
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,780
- I'm so sorry. How is my sister? - She's upstairs.

166
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,950
Thank you.

167
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,340
[Caroline] My goodness, did you see her hem? Six inches deep in mud.

168
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,670
She looked positively mediaeval.

169
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,380
I feel such a terrible imposition. They're being so kind to me.

170
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:26,140
I don't know who is more pleased at your being here, Mama or Mr Bingley.

171
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,770
Thank you for tending to my sister so diligently.

172
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,280
She's in far better comfort than at home.

173
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,150
It's a pleasure.

174
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,200
I mean, it's not a pleasure that she's ill. Of course not.

175
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,240
It's a pleasure that she's here, being ill.

176
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,710
[Mr Bennet] Not going to be famous, our pig.

177
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,210
Black on the back, but not related to the learned pig of Norwich.

178
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,510
- Now that pig is... - Mr Bennet.

179
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,010
It's all going to plan. He's half in love with her already.

180
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,430
- Who is, blossom? - Mr Bingley.

181
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,930
He doesn't mind that she hasn't a penny.

182
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,350
He has more than enough for the two of them.

183
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,520
- How will we meet them? - Easy!

184
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,770
Wait for me!

185
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:18,360
[Lydia] You drop something. They pick it up. And then you're introduced.

186
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,080
Officers!

187
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,950
[# military march]

188
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,690
[Caroline] You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

189
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,950
You're mistaken. I write slowly.

190
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,740
How many letters you must have occasion to write, Mr Darcy.

191
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,790
Letters of business. How odious I should think them.

192
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,830
It is fortunate, then, they fall to me and not you.

193
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,540
Tell your sister I long to see her.

194
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,090
- I've already told her once. - I do dote on her.

195
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,510
I was quite in raptures at her beautiful design for a table.

196
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,930
Perhaps you will give me leave to defer your raptures.

197
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,220
I have not room enough to do them justice.

198
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,270
[Bingley] You young ladies are so accomplished.

199
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,940
- What do you mean? - You paint tables, play the piano

200
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,520
and embroider cushions.

201
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,860
I never heard of a lady, but people say she's accomplished.

202
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,280
[Darcy] The word is applied too liberally.

203
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,610
I do not know more than half a dozen women

204
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,580
- that are truly accomplished. - [Caroline] Nor l.

205
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,910
Goodness, you must comprehend a great deal in the idea.

206
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,710
- I do. - Absolutely.

207
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,580
She must have a knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing

208
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,090
and the modern languages to deserve the word.

209
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,130
And something in her air and manner of walking.

210
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,220
And she must improve her mind by extensive reading.

211
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,140
I'm no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.

212
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,640
- I wonder at you knowing any. - Are you so severe on your own sex?

213
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,320
I never saw such a woman. She would certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.

214
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,240
[Caroline] Miss Elizabeth, let us take a turn about the room.

215
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,180
It's refreshing, is it not, after sitting so long in one attitude?

216
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,640
It is a small kind of accomplishment, I suppose.

217
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,020
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?

218
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,730
You can only have two motives, and I would interfere with either.

219
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,980
What can he mean?

220
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,400
The surest way to disappoint him would be to ask him nothing.

221
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,360
Do tell us, Mr Darcy.

222
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,740
Either you are in each other's confidence

223
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,030
and you have secret affairs to discuss,

224
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,450
or you are conscious that your figures

225
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,830
appear to the greatest advantage by walking.

226
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,090
If the first, I should get in your way.

227
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,170
If the second, I can admire you much better from here.

228
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,720
How shall we punish him for such a speech?

229
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,930
- We could laugh at him. - No. Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

230
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,810
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would you consider pride a fault or a virtue?

231
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,980
- I couldn't say. - We're trying to find a fault in you.

232
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,270
I find it hard to forgive the follies and vices of others,

233
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,230
or their offences against me.

234
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,950
My good opinion, once lost, is lost forever.

235
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,080
Oh, dear. I cannot tease you about that.

236
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,370
What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.

237
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,790
[Caroline] A family trait, I think.

238
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,780
A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet, a Miss Bennet and a Miss Bennet, sir.

239
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,950
Are we to receive every Bennet in the country?

240
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,000
What an excellent room you have, sir.

241
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,840
Such expensive furnishings.

242
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,010
[Mrs Bennet] I do hope you intend to stay here, Mr Bingley.

243
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,010
Absolutely, I find the country very diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?

244
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,890
I find it perfectly adequate.

245
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,970
Even if society is a little less varied than in town.

246
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,020
Less varied? Not at all.

247
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,270
We dine with four and 20 families of all shapes and sizes.

248
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,900
Sir William Lucas, for instance, is a very agreeable man.

249
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,860
And a good deal less self-important than some people half his rank.

250
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,740
[Lydia] Mr Bingley, is it true you will hold a ball here?

251
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,450
A ball?

252
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,330
It would be an excellent way to meet new friends. You could invite the militia.

253
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,500
- Oh, do hold a ball! - Kitty!

254
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,550
When your sister recovers, you shall name the day.

255
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,260
I think a ball is an irrational way to gain new acquaintance.

256
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:40,600
It would be better if conversation, not dancing, were the order of the day.

257
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,890
Indeed, much more rational, but rather less like a ball.

258
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,690
Thank you, Mary.

259
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:52,070
What a fine imposing place to be sure, is it not, my dears?

260
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,570
There's no house to equal it in the county.

261
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,490
- Mr Darcy. - Miss Bennet.

262
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,490
- There she is. - I don't know how to thank you.

263
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,500
You're welcome any time you feel the least bit poorly.

264
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,830
Thank you for your stimulating company. Most instructive.

265
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,590
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

266
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,220
- Mr Darcy. - Miss Elizabeth.

267
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,610
And then there was one with great long lashes, like a cow.

268
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,530
Ask Mrs Hill to order us a sirloin, Betsy.

269
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,110
Just the one, mind. We're not made of money.

270
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,370
[Mary practises scales]

271
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,500
I hope, my dear, you've ordered a good dinner today.

272
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,540
I've reason to expect an addition to our family party.

273
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,500
[Lizzie] His name's Mr Collins, the dreaded cousin.

274
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,130
- [Charlotte] Who is to inherit? - Everything.

275
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,180
Even my piano stool belongs to Mr Collins.

276
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,340
When?

277
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,550
He may turn us out of the house as soon as he pleases.

278
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,020
The estate passes directly to him and not to us poor females.

279
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,650
Mr Collins, at your service.

280
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,950
What a superbly featured room and what excellent potatoes.

281
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,130
It's many years since I've had such an exemplary vegetable.

282
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:36,590
To which fair cousin should I compliment the excellence of the cooking?

283
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,260
We are perfectly able to keep a cook.

284
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,390
Excellent.

285
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,970
I'm very pleased the estate can afford such a living.

286
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,940
I'm honoured to have as my patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

287
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,730
You've heard of her, I presume?

288
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,900
My small rectory abuts her estate,

289
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,740
Rosings Park, and she often condescends

290
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:07,740
to drive by my humble dwelling in her little phaeton and ponies.

291
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,540
Does she have any family?

292
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,210
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings and very extensive property.

293
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,550
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

294
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,800
that her daughter seemed born to be a duchess,

295
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:25,760
for she has all the superior graces of elevated rank.

296
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,730
These kind of compliments are always acceptable to the ladies,

297
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:34,230
and which I conceive myself particularly bound to pay.

298
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,940
How happy for you, Mr Collins,

299
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,690
to possess the talent for flattering with such delicacy.

300
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,280
Do these attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment

301
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,910
or are they the result of previous study?

302
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,660
They arise from what is passing at the time.

303
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:56,250
And though I do sometimes amuse myself with arranging such little compliments,

304
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,050
I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.

305
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:04,340
Oh, believe me, no one would suspect your manners to be rehearsed.

306
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,600
[Lydia laughs, coughs]

307
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,560
After dinner, I thought I might read to you for an hour or two.

308
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,730
I have with me Fordyce's Sermons

309
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,360
which speak very eloquently on all matters moral.

310
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,950
Are you familiar with Fordyce's Sermons, Miss Bennet?

311
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,880
Mrs Bennet, I have been bestowed by the good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourgh

312
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,500
a parsonage of no mean size.

313
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,800
I have become aware of the fact.

314
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:45,930
It is my avowed hope that soon I may find a mistress for it.

315
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:49,510
And I have to inform you that the eldest Miss Bennet

316
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,520
has captured my special attention.

317
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,440
Oh, Mr Collins.

318
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,730
Unfortunately, it is incumbent upon me

319
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:07,160
to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet is very soon to be engaged.

320
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,660
Engaged.

321
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,290
But Miss Lizzie, next to her in age and beauty,

322
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,910
would make anyone an excellent partner.

323
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,130
Do not you agree? Mr Collins?

324
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,670
Indeed. Indeed.

325
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,340
A very agreeable alternative.

326
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,030
[fiddler plays]

327
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,950
[Lizzie] Mr Collins is a man who makes you despair at the entire sex.

328
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,410
- Yours, I believe. - Oh, Mr Wickham, how perfect you are.

329
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,790
He picked up my handkerchief. Did you drop yours on purpose?

330
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,420
Mr Wickham is a lieutenant.

331
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,420
- An enchanted lieutenant. - What are you up to, Liddy?

332
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,670
- We happened to be looking for ribbon. - White, for the ball.

333
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,430
Shall we all look for some ribbon together?

334
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,980
- Good afternoon, Mr James. - Miss Lydia, Miss Bennet.

335
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,690
I shan't even browse.

336
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,610
I can't be trusted. I have poor taste in ribbons.

337
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,320
Only a truly confident man would admit that.

338
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,940
No, it's true.

339
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,280
And buckles. When it comes to buckles, I'm lost.

340
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,870
- You must be the shame of the regiment. - The laughing stock.

341
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,160
What do your superiors do with you?

342
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,830
Ignore me. I'm of next to no importance, so it's easily done.

343
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,170
- Lizzie, lend me some money. - You already owe me a fortune.

344
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:50,630
- Allow me to oblige. - No, Mr Wickham, please...

345
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,390
I insist.

346
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,650
- [Lizzie] I pity the French. - [Wickham] So do l.

347
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,480
- [Jane] Look, Mr Bingley. - [Lydia] Mr Bingley!

348
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,860
[Bingley] I was just on my way to your house.

349
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,160
How do you like my ribbons for your ball?

350
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,790
- Very beautiful. - She is. Look, she's blooming.

351
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,580
Oh, Lydia.

352
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,370
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham. He is a credit to his profession.

353
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,880
[Jane] You can't invite people to other people's balls.

354
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,670
Of course, you must come, Mr Wickham.

355
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,300
If you'll excuse me, ladies, enjoy the day.

356
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,220
[Lizzie] Do you plan to go to the Netherfield ball, Mr Wickham?

357
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:44,940
Perhaps. How long has Mr Darcy been a guest there?

358
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,980
About a month.

359
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:52,700
Forgive me, but are you acquainted with him, with Mr Darcy?

360
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,160
Indeed, I've been connected with his family since infancy.

361
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:02,250
You may well be surprised, given our cold greeting this afternoon.

362
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,550
I hope your plans in favour of Meryton will not be affected

363
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:12,760
- by your relations with the gentleman. - It is not for me to be driven away.

364
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:17,890
If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go, not l.

365
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,730
I must ask, what is the manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

366
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,110
My father managed his estate.

367
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,490
We grew up together, Darcy and l.

368
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:38,660
His father treated me like a second son, loved me like a son.

369
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,330
We were both with him the day he died.

370
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,210
With his last breath,

371
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,540
his father bequeathed me the rectory in his estate.

372
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,340
He knew I had my heart set on joining the Church.

373
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,840
But Darcy ignored his wishes and gave the living to another man.

374
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,850
- But why? - Jealousy.

375
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,480
His father...

376
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,730
Well, he loved me better and Darcy couldn't stand it.

377
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,480
- How cruel. - So now I'm a poor foot-soldier.

378
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:14,400
Too lowly even to be noticed.

379
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,330
[hums tune]

380
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,420
- Breathe in! - I can't anymore. You're hurting.

381
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,840
Betsy.

382
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,590
Betsy!

383
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,280
- There must've been a misunderstanding. - Jane, you never think ill of anybody.

384
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,030
How could Mr Darcy do such a thing?

385
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,530
I will discover the truth from Mr Bingley this evening.

386
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,040
Let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.

387
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,500
Till he does, I hope never to encounter him.

388
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,960
Poor, unfortunate, Mr Wickham.

389
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,290
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

390
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,210
And, let us hope, a rather more willing dancer.

391
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,260
[man] There they are, look.

392
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:24,600
- [lady] Oh, yes. - [man] Billy.

393
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,310
[man] Jane Martin is here.

394
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,760
May I say what an immense pleasure it is to see you again.

395
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,010
- Mrs Bennet. - Miss Bingley.

396
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,220
Charming.

397
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,980
I'm so pleased you're here.

398
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,360
So am l.

399
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:19,530
And how are you? Miss Elizabeth? Are you looking for someone?

400
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:24,200
No, not at all, I was just admiring the general splendour.

401
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:28,120
- It is breathtaking, Mr Bingley. - Good.

402
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,760
[Mrs Bennet] You might have passed a few pleasantries with Mr Bingley.

403
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,680
[Mrs Bennet] I've never met a more pleasant gentleman in all my years.

404
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,350
Did you see how he dotes on her?

405
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:52,230
[Mrs Bennet] Dear Jane, always doing what's best for her family.

406
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,230
[orchestra plays]

407
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,710
- Charlotte! - Lizzie!

408
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:16,670
- Have you seen Mr Wickham? - No. Perhaps he's through here.

409
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:33,230
Lizzie, Mr Wickham is not here. Apparently, he's been detained.

410
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,690
Detained where? He must be here.

411
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,110
- There you are. - Mr Collins.

412
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,780
Perhaps you will do me the honour, Miss Elizabeth.

413
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:49,080
Oh, I did not think you danced, Mr Collins.

414
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,790
I do not think it incompatible with the office of a clergyman.

415
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,380
Several people, her Ladyship included, have complimented me

416
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,210
on my lightness of foot.

417
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:30,580
[Jane] Apparently, your Mr Wickham has been called on some business to town.

418
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:37,960
Dancing is of little consequence to me, but it does...

419
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,710
...but it does afford the opportunity to lavish...

420
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:50,050
-... upon one's partner attentions... - [Jane] My informer tells me...

421
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:55,310
...that he would be less inclined to be engaged, were it not for...

422
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,730
...the presence of a certain gentleman.

423
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,980
[Collins] Which is my primary object.

424
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,980
[Lizzie] That gentleman barely warrants the name.

425
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,070
[Collins] It is my intention, if I may be so bold,

426
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,780
to remain close to you throughout the evening.

427
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,630
May I have the next dance, Miss Elizabeth?

428
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,720
You may.

429
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:41,980
- Did I agree to dance with Mr Darcy? - I dare say you will find him amiable.

430
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:47,190
It would be most inconvenient since I've sworn to loathe him for all eternity.

431
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,540
[# solo violin dance]

432
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,000
- [Lizzie] I love this dance. - [Darcy] lndeed. Most invigorating.

433
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,590
It is your turn to say something, Mr Darcy.

434
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,560
I talked about the dance.

435
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,600
Now you ought to remark on the size of the room or the number of couples.

436
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,860
I'm perfectly happy to oblige. What would you like most to hear?

437
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,320
That reply will do for present.

438
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,700
[Lizzie] Perhaps by and by I may observe

439
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,080
that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.

440
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,830
For now, we may remain silent.

441
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,630
[Darcy] Do you talk as a rule while dancing?

442
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,680
No. No, I prefer to be unsociable and taciturn.

443
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,100
Makes it all so much more enjoyable, don't you think?

444
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,400
Tell me, do you and your sisters very often walk to Meryton?

445
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,530
Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

446
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,660
It's a great opportunity to meet new people.

447
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:25,460
When you met us, we'd just had the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.

448
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,550
Mr Wickham's blessed with such happy manners, he's sure of making friends.

449
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,470
Whether he's capable of retaining them is less so.

450
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,390
He's been so unfortunate as to lose your friendship. That is irreversible?

451
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,730
- It is. Why do you ask such a question? - To make out your character.

452
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,360
- What have you discovered? - Very little.

453
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:51,110
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.

454
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,030
I hope to afford you more clarity in the future.

455
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,240
[chattering]

456
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,580
- Is that Mr Darcy of Pemberley? - I believe so.

457
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,540
I must make myself known to him.

458
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,630
He's a nephew of my patroness, Lady Catherine.

459
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,750
He will consider it an impertinence.

460
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,470
Mr Darcy.

461
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,760
Mr Darcy.

462
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:03,640
Mr Darcy. Good evening...

463
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:06,770
What interesting relatives you have.

464
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,740
[sings]

465
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,000
Mary, dear, you've delighted us long enough.

466
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,540
Let the other young ladies have a turn.

467
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,260
[Bingley]...since I was a child, and then she died.

468
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,130
I have a beautiful grey.

469
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:43,180
Of course, Caroline's a much better rider than l, of course.

470
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:51,520
Oh, yes. We fully expect a most advantageous marriage.

471
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:56,820
And my Jane, marrying so grand, must throw her sisters in the way.

472
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:24,010
Clearly my family are seeing who can expose themselves to the most ridicule.

473
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,140
- At least Bingley has not noticed. - No.

474
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:31,810
- I think he likes her very much. - But does she like him?

475
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,110
Few of us are secure enough to be in love without proper encouragement.

476
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,650
Bingley likes her enormously,

477
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,570
but might not do more if she does not help him on.

478
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,490
She's just shy. If he cannot perceive her regard, he is a fool.

479
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,120
We are all fools in love.

480
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:51,290
He does not know her character as we do.

481
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,880
She should move fast and snap him up.

482
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,460
There is plenty of time for us to get to know him afterwards.

483
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,590
[Caroline] I can't help feeling that someone's going to produce a piglet

484
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,720
and make us chase it.

485
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,190
- Oh, dear! - I do apologise, sir.

486
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,320
I'm awfully sorry. Do forgive me.

487
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,090
[lady] Emily, please!

488
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,970
Mary, my dear Mary. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

489
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,310
- I've been practising all week. - I know, my dear.

490
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,890
[Mary] I hate balls.

491
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:14,160
Mr Bennet, wake up.

492
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:19,040
[Mrs Bennet] Oh, I've never had such a good time!

493
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,800
Charles, you cannot be serious.

494
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:36,400
We'll have a wedding here in less than three months if you ask me, Mr Bennet.

495
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,730
Mr Bennet!

496
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:49,160
Mary, please.

497
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,540
[Mr Bennet] Thank you, Mr Hill.

498
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:20,310
Mrs Bennet, I was hoping, if it would not trouble you,

499
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:25,150
that I might solicit a private audience with Miss Elizabeth.

500
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:31,030
Oh, certainly, Lizzie would be very happy indeed.

501
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,580
Everyone, out. Mr Collins would like a private audience with your sister.

502
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:40,170
Wait, Mr Collins can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear.

503
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,300
I desire you will stay where you are. Everyone else to the drawing room.

504
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,010
- Mr Bennet. - But...

505
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,550
Now.

506
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:54,350
- Jane. Jane, don't... Jane! - Jane.

507
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:00,100
Papa, stay.

508
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,260
Dear Miss Elizabeth,

509
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,050
My attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.

510
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,640
Almost as soon as I entered the house,

511
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:39,980
I singled you out as the companion of my future life.

512
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,860
But before I am run away with my feelings,

513
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,770
perhaps I may state my reasons for marrying.

514
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,400
Firstly, that it is the duty of a clergyman

515
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,240
to set the example of matrimony in his parish.

516
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:55,410
Secondly, I am convinced it will add greatly to my happiness.

517
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,500
And thirdly, that it is at the urging

518
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,250
of my esteemed patroness, Lady Catherine,

519
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,790
that I select a wife.

520
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,090
My object in coming to Longbourn was to choose such a one

521
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,300
from among Mr Bennet's daughters,

522
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,390
for I am to inherit the estate

523
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:16,720
and such an alliance will surely...

524
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,810
...suit everyone.

525
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,520
And now nothing remains but for me to assure you in the most animated language

526
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:29,230
- of the violence of my affections. - Mr Collins!

527
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,570
And no reproach on the subject of fortune

528
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:36,410
- will cross my lips once we're married. - You forget I have given no answer.

529
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,160
Lady Catherine will thoroughly approve when I speak to her

530
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:45,460
of your modesty, economy and other amiable qualities.

531
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:50,340
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal, but I regret that I must decline it.

532
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:55,430
I know ladies don't seek to seem too eager...

533
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,310
Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious. You could not make me happy.

534
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:03,140
And I'm the last woman in the world who could make you happy.

535
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:07,900
I flatter myself that your refusal is merely a natural delicacy.

536
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,900
Besides, despite manifold attractions,

537
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:15,360
it is by no means certain another offer of marriage will ever be made to you.

538
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:19,160
I must conclude that you simply seek to increase my love by suspense,

539
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:23,750
according to the usual practice of elegant females.

540
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:27,500
I am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man.

541
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:30,210
Please understand me, I cannot accept you.

542
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,470
[Lydia & Kitty laugh]

543
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:40,640
Headstrong, foolish child.

544
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:54,530
Don't worry, Mr Collins. We'll have this little hiccup dealt with immediately.

545
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:59,160
Lizzie. Lizzie!

546
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:07,580
Mr Bennet, we're all in an uproar!

547
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:11,460
You must come and make Lizzie marry Mr Collins.

548
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,090
Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie,

549
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,890
but she vowed she will not have him, and now the danger is

550
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,890
Mr Collins may not have Lizzie.

551
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:25,680
- What am I to do? - Well, come and talk to her.

552
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:27,020
Now!

553
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,780
- Tell her you insist they marry. - Papa, please.

554
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:47,040
[Mrs Bennet] You will have this house and save your sisters from destitution.

555
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,170
- I can't marry him. - Go and say you've changed your mind.

556
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,880
- Think of your family. - You cannot make me.

557
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,590
Mr Bennet, say something.

558
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:02,850
Your mother insists upon you marrying Mr Collins.

559
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,770
Yes, or I shall never see her again.

560
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:09,940
From this day onward, you must be a stranger to one of your parents.

561
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,560
Who will maintain you when your father is dead?

562
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:16,610
Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr Collins,

563
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,950
and I will never see you again if you do.

564
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,740
Thank you, Papa.

565
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:30,120
[Mrs Bennet] Ungrateful child! I shall never speak to you again.

566
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:33,000
Not that I take much pleasure in talking.

567
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,760
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints

568
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,930
can have no pleasure in talking to anybody.

569
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,840
Jane!

570
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:49,270
What's the matter? Jane?

571
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:47,200
I don't understand what would take him from Netherfield.

572
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:49,660
Why does he not know when he'll return?

573
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:51,000
Read it.

574
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,890
"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister and we are scarcely less eager.

575
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:08,010
I do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty,

576
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:12,100
elegance and accomplishment. I hope to call her hereafter my sister."

577
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:14,980
Is that not clear enough?

578
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,860
Caroline sees her brother in love with you

579
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,690
and has taken him off to persuade him otherwise.

580
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:25,820
But I know her to be incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone.

581
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:30,660
- It's more likely he does not love me. - He loves you. Do not give up.

582
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:34,920
Go to our aunt and uncle's in London,

583
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,710
Iet it be known you are there and I am sure he will come to you.

584
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,930
Give my love to my sister and try not to be a burden, dear.

585
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,560
[Mr Bennet] Poor Jane.

586
00:53:55,770 --> 00:54:00,150
Still, a girl likes to be crossed in love now and then.

587
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:02,530
It gives her something to think of

588
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,870
and a sort of distinction amongst her companions.

589
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:09,770
- I'm sure that will cheer her up, Papa. - It's your turn now, Lizzie.

590
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,850
You've turned down Collins.

591
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:16,320
You're free to go off and be jilted yourself.

592
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,360
What about Mr Wickham?

593
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:21,320
He's a pleasant fellow and he'd do the job credibly.

594
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:25,160
- Father... - And you have an affectionate mother

595
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:28,950
who would make the most of it.

596
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,520
- Charlotte! - My dear Lizzie.

597
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:56,230
I've come her to tell you the news. Mr Collins and I are... engaged.

598
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,690
- Engaged? - Yes.

599
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:08,200
- To be married? - What other kind of engaged is there?

600
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:13,000
For heaven's sake, Lizzie, don't look at me like that.

601
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,170
I should be as happy with him as any other.

602
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,170
- But he's ridiculous. - Oh, hush.

603
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:23,090
Not all of us can afford to be romantic.

604
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:27,090
I've been offered a comfortable home and protection.

605
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,970
There's a lot to be thankful for.

606
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:34,600
I'm 27 years old. I've no money and no prospects.

607
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:38,360
I'm already a burden to my parents.

608
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,980
And I'm frightened.

609
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:45,700
So don't judge me, Lizzie. Don't you dare judge me.

610
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:41,040
[Lizzie] Dear Charlotte, thank you for your letter.

611
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:45,550
I'm glad the house, furniture and roads are to your taste,

612
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,140
and that Lady Catherine's behaviour is friendly and obliging.

613
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,970
What with your departure, Jane's to London

614
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:55,640
and the militia to the North with the colourful Mr Wickham,

615
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:59,730
I must confess, the view from where I sit has been rather grey.

616
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,900
As for the favour you ask, it is no favour at all.

617
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:07,200
I would be happy to visit you at your earliest convenience.

618
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,950
[Collins] Welcome to our humble abode.

619
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:25,050
My wife encourages me to spend time in the garden for my health.

620
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:27,590
I think our guest is tired after her journey.

621
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:32,430
I plan many improvements. I intend to throw out a bough and plant a lime walk.

622
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,560
I flatter myself that any young lady would be happy

623
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,730
to be the mistress of such a house.

624
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,770
We shan't be disturbed here.

625
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:45,820
This parlour is for my own particular use.

626
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:52,660
Oh, Lizzie, it's such a pleasure to run my own home.

627
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,830
- [Collins] Charlotte, come here! - What's happened?

628
00:57:55,990 --> 00:58:00,000
Has the pig escaped again? Oh, it's Lady Catherine.

629
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,710
Come and see, Lizzie.

630
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,500
[Collins] Great news.

631
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:08,920
We received an invitation to Rosings from Lady Catherine.

632
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,630
How wonderful!

633
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,800
Do not make yourself uneasy about your apparel.

634
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:16,310
Just put on the best you've brought.

635
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:21,020
Lady Catherine's never been averse to the truly humble.

636
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:25,310
[Collins] One of the most extraordinary sights in all of Europe.

637
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,030
The glazing alone

638
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,780
Come along. Come along.

639
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:43,500
[Lady Catherine] A little later we'll play cards.

640
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,340
Your Ladyship.

641
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,510
Miss de Bourgh.

642
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:12,400
- So, you are Elizabeth Bennet? - I am, your Ladyship.

643
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:18,530
This is my daughter.

644
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:25,210
- It's kind of you to ask us to dine.

645
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,130
Mr Darcy.

646
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:32,590
What are you doing here?

647
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,220
Mr Darcy, I had no idea we had the honour.

648
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:45,100
- Miss Elizabeth, I'm a guest here. - You know my nephew?

649
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:50,190
I had the pleasure of meeting your nephew in Hertfordshire.

650
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,110
Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do?

651
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:04,660
Mr Collins, you can't sit next to your wife. Move. Over there.

652
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:24,730
Harvey, I wonder, could you get me the fish course...

653
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:28,980
I trust your family is in good health, Miss Elizabeth?

654
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,110
They are, thank you.

655
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:37,820
My eldest sister is in London. Perhaps you saw her there.

656
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:39,990
I haven't been fortunate enough...

657
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,580
Do you play the pianoforte, Miss Bennet?

658
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:49,210
- A little, ma'am, and very poorly. - Do you draw?

659
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,630
No, not at all.

660
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,050
Your sisters, do they draw?

661
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:56,550
Not one.

662
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,220
That's very strange.

663
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:01,010
I suppose you had no opportunity.

664
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:05,100
Your mother should've taken you to town for the benefit of the masters.

665
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:09,400
My mother wouldn't have minded, but my father hates town.

666
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,980
- Has your governess left you? - We never had a governess.

667
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,650
No governess? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess?

668
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:22,950
I never heard such a thing. Your mother must've been a slave to your education.

669
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,160
Not at all, Lady Catherine.

670
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,460
Your younger sisters, are they out in society?

671
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:34,800
- Yes, ma'am, all. - All?

672
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,970
What, all five out at once? That's very odd.

673
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:41,890
And you second. The younger ones out before the elders are married?

674
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,560
Your youngest sisters must be very young.

675
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,430
Yes, my youngest is not 1 6.

676
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:50,520
But it would be hard on younger sisters

677
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:54,360
not to have their amusement because the elder is still unmarried.

678
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,530
It would hardly encourage sisterly affection.

679
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:02,660
Upon my word, you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.

680
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:05,540
Pray, what is your age?

681
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,620
With three younger sisters grown up, you can hardly expect me to own to it.

682
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,880
Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us.

683
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:26,390
- No, I beg you. - For music is my delight.

684
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,850
In fact, there are few people in England

685
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:32,940
who have more true enjoyment of music.

686
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,690
Or better natural taste.

687
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:41,240
If I had ever learnt, I should've been a great proficient.

688
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,580
So would Anne, if her health would've allowed her.

689
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:49,950
I'm not afflicted with false modesty, when I say I play poorly...

690
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:53,880
Come, Lizzie, her Ladyship demands it.

691
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:18,980
How does Georgiana get along, Darcy?

692
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:22,610
- She plays very well. - I hope she practises.

693
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:26,030
No excellence can be acquired without constant practice.

694
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,660
I've told Mrs Collins this.

695
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:32,290
Though you have no instrument, you're welcome to come to Rosings

696
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,460
and play on the pianoforte in the housekeeper's room.

697
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:39,500
You'll be in nobody's way in that part of the house.

698
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:51,850
You mean to frighten me by coming in all your state to hear me.

699
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:55,940
But I won't be alarmed, even if your sister does play so well.

700
01:03:56,100 --> 01:04:00,020
I know that I cannot alarm you even should I wish it.

701
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:04,150
What was my friend like in Hertfordshire?

702
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:07,370
You really care to know?

703
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:10,740
Prepare yourself for something very dreadful.

704
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:13,960
The first time I saw him, he danced with nobody,

705
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,750
though gentlemen were scarce

706
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,710
and there was more than one lady without a partner.

707
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,630
- I knew nobody beyond my own party. - Nobody can be introduced at a ball.

708
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,550
[Lady Catherine] Fitzwilliam, I need you.

709
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,900
I do not have the talent

710
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:42,440
of conversing easily with people I have never met before.

711
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:46,530
Perhaps you should take your aunt's advice and practise.

712
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:10,390
[Lizzie] Dear Jane...

713
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,730
Mr Darcy.

714
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,120
Please, do be seated.

715
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,540
Mr and Mrs Collins have gone to the village.

716
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:51,390
This is a charming house.

717
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:55,930
I believe my aunt did a great deal to it when Mr Collins first arrived.

718
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,480
I believe so.

719
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:04,900
She could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful subject.

720
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:16,660
- Shall I call for some tea? - No, thank you.

721
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,500
Good day, Miss Elizabeth, it's been a pleasure.

722
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:33,510
What on earth have you done to poor Mr Darcy?

723
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,060
I have no idea.

724
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:39,980
[Collins] Every mind must have some counsellor

725
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:43,810
to whom it may apply for consolation in distress.

726
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:48,780
There are many conveniences which others can supply and we cannot procure.

727
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:50,820
I have in view those objects

728
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:54,120
which are only to be obtained through intercourse...

729
01:06:56,490 --> 01:07:01,710
Forgive me, through the intercourse of friendship or civility.

730
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:07,670
On such occasions, the proud man steps forth to meet you not with cordiality,

731
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:12,680
but with the suspicion of one who reconnoitres an enemy...

732
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,470
- How long do you plan to stay? - As long as Darcy chooses.

733
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,890
- I am at his disposal. - Everyone appears to be.

734
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:23,810
I wonder he does not marry and secure a lasting convenience of that kind.

735
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:27,770
- She would be a lucky woman. - Really?

736
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:31,070
Darcy is a most loyal companion.

737
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,700
He recently came to the rescue of one of his friends.

738
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,280
What happened?

739
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:38,580
He saved him from an imprudent marriage.

740
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:39,950
Who's the man?

741
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:49,300
His closest friend, Charles Bingley.

742
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:54,630
Did Mr Darcy give a reason for this interference?

743
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,970
There were apparently strong objections to the lady.

744
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:01,430
What kind of objections? Her lack of fortune?

745
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:05,850
I think it was her family that was considered unsuitable.

746
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:12,110
- So he separated them? - I believe so. I know nothing else.

747
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:44,020
Miss Elizabeth.

748
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:46,810
I have struggled in vain and can bear it no longer.

749
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:51,150
These past months have been a torment. I came to Rosings only to see you.

750
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,490
I have fought against judgement, my family's expectation,

751
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:57,530
the inferiority of your birth, my rank.

752
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,320
I will put them aside and ask you to end my agony.

753
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:03,660
- I don't understand. - I love you.

754
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:08,170
Most ardently.

755
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:15,340
Please do me the honour of accepting my hand.

756
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,680
Sir, I appreciate the struggle you have been through,

757
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,430
and I am very sorry to have caused you pain.

758
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,680
It was unconsciously done.

759
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,900
- Is this your reply? - Yes, sir.

760
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:31,770
- Are you laughing at me? - No.

761
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,110
Are you rejecting me?

762
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:38,860
I'm sure the feelings which hindered your regard will help you overcome it.

763
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:42,200
Might I ask why with so little civility I am thus repulsed?

764
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:47,620
I might enquire why you told me you liked me against your better judgement?

765
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:50,080
If I was uncivil, then that is some excuse.

766
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:53,250
- But you know I have other reasons. - What reasons?

767
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:57,010
Do you think anything might tempt me to accept the man who has ruined

768
01:09:57,170 --> 01:10:00,340
the happiness of a most beloved sister?

769
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:05,220
Do you deny that you separated a young couple who loved each other,

770
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:07,770
exposing your friend to censure for caprice

771
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:10,770
and my sister to derision for disappointed hopes,

772
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,980
involving them both in acute misery?

773
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:16,610
- I do not deny it. - How could you do it?

774
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:19,650
I believed your sister indifferent to him.

775
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:22,490
I realised his attachment was deeper than hers.

776
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:23,660
She's shy!

777
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:26,490
Bingley was persuaded she didn't feel strongly.

778
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,700
- You suggested it. - For his own good.

779
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:31,710
My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me.

780
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,460
I suppose his fortune had some bearing?

781
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:41,220
I wouldn't do your sister the dishonour.

782
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:43,430
- It was suggested... - What was?

783
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:46,060
It was clear an advantageous marriage...

784
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:48,600
- Did my sister give that impression? - No!

785
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:52,900
- No. There was, however, your family... - Our want of connection?

786
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:55,520
- No, it was more than that. - How, sir?

787
01:10:55,730 --> 01:11:00,610
The lack of propriety shown by your mother, younger sisters and your father.

788
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:09,000
Forgive me. You and your sister I must exclude from this.

789
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,290
And what about Mr Wickham?

790
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:18,550
Mr Wickham?

791
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,510
What excuse can you give for your behaviour?

792
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:24,930
- You take an eager interest. - He told me of his misfortunes.

793
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:27,760
- Oh, they have been great. - You ruin his chances

794
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:30,140
yet treat him with sarcasm.

795
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:32,350
So this is your opinion of me?

796
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,980
Thank you. Perhaps these offences might have been overlooked

797
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:40,440
had not your pride been hurt by my scruples about our relationship.

798
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:43,820
I am to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstances?

799
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:46,660
And those are the words of a gentleman.

800
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:51,540
Your arrogance and conceit, your selfish disdain for the feelings of others

801
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:57,460
made me realise you were the last man in the world I could ever marry.

802
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:13,730
Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much of your time.

803
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:19,940
I came to leave you this.

804
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:34,160
I shall not renew the sentiments which were so disgusting to you.

805
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:38,620
But if I may, I will address the two offences you have laid against me.

806
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:48,550
My father loved Mr Wickham as a son.

807
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:52,510
He left him a generous living. But upon my father's death,

808
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:57,310
Mr Wickham announced he had no intention of taking orders.

809
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:03,270
He demanded the value of the living, which he'd gambled away within weeks.

810
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:08,780
He then wrote, demanding more money, which I refused.

811
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:12,030
After which, he severed all acquaintance.

812
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:16,620
He came back to see us last summer, and declared passionate love for my sister,

813
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:20,710
whom he tried to persuade to elope with him.

814
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:24,540


815
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:30,130
When it was made clear he would never receive a penny of it, he disappeared.

816
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:33,970
I will not attempt to convey the depth of Georgiana's despair.

817
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:37,260
She was 15 years old.

818
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:42,890
As to the other matter, of your sister and Mr Bingley,

819
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:46,610
though the motives which governed me may appear insufficient,

820
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:50,150
they were in the service of a friend.

821
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,360
Lizzie.

822
01:15:55,570 --> 01:15:57,450
Are you all right?

823
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:01,000
I hardly know.

824
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:12,090
Lizzie. How fortunate you have arrived.

825
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,970
Your aunt and uncle are here to deliver Jane from London.

826
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:19,470
- How is Jane? - She's in the drawing room.

827
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:28,190
I'm quite over him. If he passed me in the street, I'd hardly notice.

828
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:32,240
London is so diverting. It's true.

829
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:36,700
There's so much to entertain.

830
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:44,370
What news from Kent?

831
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:48,250
Nothing.

832
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,130
At least not much to entertain.

833
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,090
Lizzie, tell Mama!

834
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,970
Stop making such a fuss.

835
01:16:57,130 --> 01:17:00,970
- Why didn't she ask me as well? - Because I'm better company.

836
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:03,720
- What's the matter? - I've just as much right.

837
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:06,100
Let's all go.

838
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:09,230
Lydia's been invited to Brighton with the Forsters.

839
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,440
Sea-bathing would set me up nicely.

840
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:13,900
I shall dine with the officers every night.

841
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:16,030
Papa, don't let her go.

842
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:20,950
Lydia will never be easy until she's exposed herself in some public place.

843
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:25,660
And we could never expect her to do it with so little inconvenience.

844
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:27,920
If you do not check her,

845
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:32,840
she'll be fixed as the silliest flirt who ever made her family ridiculous.

846
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:34,840
And Kitty will follow, as always.

847
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:39,930
Lizzie, we shall have no peace until she goes.

848
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:43,430
Is that really all you care about?

849
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,190
Colonel Forster is a sensible man.

850
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:50,190
He will keep her out of any real mischief.

851
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:53,190
And she's too poor to be an object of prey to anyone.

852
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,530
It's dangerous.

853
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:59,280
I am certain the officers will find women better worth their while.

854
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:04,200
Let us hope, in fact, that her stay in Brighton

855
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:09,210
will teach her her own insignificance.

856
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:12,040
At any rate, she can hardly grow any worse.

857
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:16,760
If she does, we'd be obliged to lock her up for the rest of her life.

858
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:28,640
Lizzie, you're welcome to accompany us.

859
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:30,770
The Peak District is not Brighton.

860
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:34,480
Officers are thin on the ground which may influence your decision.

861
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:38,780
Come to the Peak District with us, Lizzie, and get some fresh air.

862
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:42,530
The glories of nature. What are men compared to rocks and mountains?

863
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:45,910
Men are either eaten up with arrogance or stupidity.

864
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,410
If they are amiable, they have no minds of their own.

865
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:52,880
Take care, my love. That savours strongly of bitterness.

866
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:04,140
I saw Mr Darcy when I was at Rosings.

867
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:05,890
[Jane] Why did you not tell me?

868
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,980
Did he mention Mr Bingley?

869
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:14,520
No.

870
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:21,320
[Lizzie] No, he did not.

871
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:28,550
[Mr Gardiner] Oh, what are men compared to rocks and mountains?

872
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:32,230
[Mrs Gardiner] Or carriages that work?

873
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,650
[Lizzie] Where exactly are we?

874
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:41,230
[Mrs Gardiner] Quite close to Pemberley.

875
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:45,450
- Mr Darcy's home? - That's the fellow.

876
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:49,280
[Mr Gardiner] Very well-stocked lake. I've a hankering to see it.

877
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:50,540
Oh, no, let's not.

878
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,290
Well, he's so...

879
01:20:56,500 --> 01:21:00,090
I'd rather not, he's so... he's so...

880
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,960
- So what? - So rich.

881
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:05,300
By heavens, Lizzie, what a snob you are!

882
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:09,220
Objecting to Mr Darcy because of his wealth. The poor man can't help it.

883
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:14,850
He won't be there anyway. These great men are never at home.

884
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:20,540
Keep up.

885
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:44,730
- Is your master much at home? - Not as much as I would wish.

886
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:47,400
[housekeeper] He dearly loves it here.

887
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:51,320
[Mrs Gardiner] If he should marry, you might see more of him.

888
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:02,750
[housekeeper] He's a lot like his father.

889
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:11,680
[housekeeper] When my husband was ill, Mr Darcy couldn't do enough.

890
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:20,100
[housekeeper] He just organised the servants for me.

891
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:38,580
This is he, Mr Darcy.

892
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:41,960
A handsome face.

893
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:46,380
Lizzie, is it a true likeness?

894
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:50,010
Does the young lady know Mr Darcy?

895
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:52,470
Only a little.

896
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:56,760
Do you not think him a handsome man, miss?

897
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:58,350
Yes.

898
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:03,140
Yes, I dare say he is.

899
01:24:06,690 --> 01:24:09,610
This is his sister, Miss Georgiana.

900
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:13,740
She sings and plays all day long.

901
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:18,450
Is she at home?

902
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:16,150
[piano plays]

903
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,700
Miss Elizabeth.

904
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:41,590
- I thought you were in London. - No.

905
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,060
No, I'm not.

906
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:45,930
No.

907
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:49,440
- We would not have come... - I came back a day early...

908
01:26:55,230 --> 01:26:56,650
I'm with my aunt and uncle.

909
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,410
And are you having a pleasant trip?

910
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:04,200
Very pleasant.

911
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:07,870
- Tomorrow we go to Matlock. - Tomorrow?

912
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:12,920
- Are you staying at Lambton? - Yes, at the Rose and Crown.

913
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:15,170
Yes.

914
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,550
I'm so sorry to intrude.

915
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:24,800
They said the house was open for visitors. I had no idea.

916
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:31,190
- May I see you back to the village? - No.

917
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:37,230
- I'm very fond of walking. - Yes.

918
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,990
Yes, I know.

919
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:48,200
Goodbye, Mr Darcy.

920
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:08,390
[man] This way, sir.

921
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,520
Are you sure you wouldn't like to join us?

922
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:33,120
We've just met Mr Darcy. You didn't tell us that you'd seen him.

923
01:28:33,330 --> 01:28:37,960
He's asked us to dine with him tomorrow. He was very civil, was he not?

924
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:40,670
- Very civil. - Not at all how you'd painted him.

925
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,220
To dine with him?

926
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:46,760
There's something pleasant about his mouth when he speaks.

927
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:49,850
You don't mind delaying our journey another day?

928
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:53,600
He particularly wants you to meet his sister.

929
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:55,480
His sister.

930
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:26,090
Miss Elizabeth!

931
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,680
My sister, Miss Georgiana.

932
01:29:32,890 --> 01:29:35,020
My brother has told me so much about you,

933
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:38,230
- I feel as if we are friends already. - Thank you.

934
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,730
- What a beautiful pianoforte. - My brother gave it to me.

935
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:43,900
- He shouldn't have. - I should have.

936
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:47,320
- Very well then. - Easily persuaded, is she not?

937
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:51,370
He once had to put up with my playing.

938
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:56,250
- He says you play so well. - Then he has perjured himself.

939
01:29:56,410 --> 01:29:59,580
- I said "quite well". - "Quite well" is not "very well".

940
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:01,460
I'm satisfied.

941
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:10,640
- Mr Gardiner, are you fond of fishing? - Very much.

942
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,600
Would you accompany me to the lake this afternoon?

943
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:16,310
Its occupants have been left in peace too long.

944
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:20,690
- I would be delighted. - Do you play duets, Miss Elizabeth?

945
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:26,070
- Only when forced. - Brother, you must force her.

946
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:30,030
[Mr Gardiner] Splendid fishing, good company. What a capital fellow.

947
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:33,200
[Mrs Gardiner] Thank you so much, Mr Darcy.

948
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,330
A letter for you, madam.

949
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,370
Oh, it's from Jane.

950
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:06,030
It is the most dreadful news.

951
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:10,700
Lydia has run away...

952
01:31:13,570 --> 01:31:15,370
...with Mr Wickham.

953
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:17,410
They are gone to Lord knows where.

954
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:23,580
She has no money, no connections. I fear she is lost forever.

955
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:29,010
This is my fault.

956
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:32,720
If only I had exposed Wickham when I should.

957
01:31:32,890 --> 01:31:35,890
No, this is my fault.

958
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:39,350
I might have prevented all this by being open with my sisters.

959
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:43,310
[Mrs Gardiner] Has anything been done to recover her?

960
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:48,570
My father has gone to London, but I know nothing can be done.

961
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:53,410
We have not the smallest hope.

962
01:31:53,570 --> 01:31:55,450
Would I could help you.

963
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,830
Sir, I think it is too late.

964
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:05,590
This is grave indeed. I will leave you. Goodbye.

965
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:07,710
[Mr Gardiner] We must go at once.

966
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:11,630
I will join Mr Bennet and find Lydia before she ruins the family.

967
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:44,170
[Mrs Bennet] Why did the Forsters let her out of their sight?

968
01:32:44,330 --> 01:32:47,500
I always said they were unfit to take charge of her.

969
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:50,960
- And now she is ruined. - You are all ruined.

970
01:32:51,170 --> 01:32:56,550
Who will take you now with a fallen sister?

971
01:32:56,720 --> 01:33:00,220
Poor Mr Bennet will now have to fight the perfidious Wickham

972
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:01,970
and then be killed.

973
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:04,020
He hasn't found him yet, Mama.

974
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:07,020
Mr Collins will turn us out before he is cold.

975
01:33:07,190 --> 01:33:11,110
Do not be so alarmed. Our uncle is in London helping in the search.

976
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:16,530
Lydia must know what this must be doing to my nerves.

977
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:21,950
Such flutterings and spasms all over me!

978
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:27,670
My baby Lydia, my baby!

979
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:32,380
How could she do such a thing to her poor mama?

980
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:35,970
- You can't do that! - Don't be such a baby.

981
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:38,850
- Kitty, give it to me. - Who's it for?

982
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:40,640
It's addressed to Papa.

983
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,140
It's in Uncle's writing.

984
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,100
Papa, there's a letter.

985
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:50,690
- Let me catch my breath. - It's in Uncle's writing.

986
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:57,450
- He's found them. - Are they married?

987
01:33:57,610 --> 01:34:00,070
- I can't make out his script. - Give it to me.

988
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,530
Are they married?

989
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:06,250
a year on her. That is his condition.

990
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:09,250
- You will agree to this, Father? - Of course.

991
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:13,800
God knows how much your uncle must've laid on that wretched man.

992
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:15,170
What do you mean?

993
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:17,220
No man would marry Lydia

994
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:21,600
under so slight

995
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,430
Your uncle must've been very generous.

996
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:27,730
Do you think it a large sum?

997
01:34:27,890 --> 01:34:31,060
Wickham's a fool if he

998
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:34,070
- Heaven forbid! - Father!

999
01:34:35,690 --> 01:34:40,160
Lydia married and at 1 5 too!

1000
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,240
Ring the bell, Kitty.

1001
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:46,910
I must put on my things and tell Lady Lucas. Oh, to see her face.

1002
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:49,830
Tell the servants they will have a bowl of punch.

1003
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,790
- We should thank our uncle. - So he should help.

1004
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,460
He's far richer than us and has no children. Daughter married!

1005
01:34:56,630 --> 01:34:58,590
Is that really all you think about?

1006
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:02,680
When you have five daughters, tell me what else will occupy your thoughts.

1007
01:35:02,890 --> 01:35:04,680
Then perhaps you'll understand.

1008
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:08,850
You don't know what he's like.

1009
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:12,440
- Lydia! - Oh, Mama!

1010
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:18,570
We passed Sarah Sims in her carriage.

1011
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:22,620
So I took off my glove so she might see the ring.

1012
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:25,740
Then I bowed and smiled like anything...

1013
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:30,540
I'm sure she was not half as radiant as you, my dear.

1014
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:32,830
You must all go to Brighton.

1015
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:36,630
That is the place to get husbands. I hope you have half my good luck.

1016
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:38,300
Lydia.

1017
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:42,680
I want to hear every little detail, Lydia, dear.

1018
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,850
I've been enlisted in a regiment in the North of England.

1019
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:47,640
Glad to hear it.

1020
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:51,060
Near Newcastle. We travel there next week.

1021
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:55,270
- Can I come and stay with you? - That is out of the question.

1022
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,280
[Lydia] Monday morning came and I was in such a fuss.

1023
01:35:58,440 --> 01:35:59,610
I don't want to hear.

1024
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:03,360
[Lydia] There was my aunt preaching away as if reading a sermon.

1025
01:36:03,570 --> 01:36:07,240
- She was horrid unpleasant. - Can't you understand why?

1026
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:11,710
But I didn't hear a word because I was thinking of my dear Wickham.

1027
01:36:11,870 --> 01:36:14,540
I longed to know if he'd be married in his bluecoat.

1028
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:19,260
The North of England, I believe, boasts some spectacular scenery.

1029
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:23,260
So I thought, who is to be our best man if he doesn't come back?

1030
01:36:23,470 --> 01:36:27,050
Lucky, he did, or I would've had to ask Mr Darcy.

1031
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:31,600
- Mr Darcy! - I forgot!

1032
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:35,190
- But I shouldn't have said a word. - Mr Darcy was at your wedding?

1033
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:38,270
He was the one that discovered us.

1034
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:43,240
He paid for the wedding, Wickham's commission, everything.

1035
01:36:43,450 --> 01:36:45,320
But he told me not to tell.

1036
01:36:46,490 --> 01:36:48,950
- Mr Darcy? - Stop it, Lizzie.

1037
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:54,120
Mr Darcy's not half as high and mighty as you sometimes.

1038
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:02,840
Kitty, have you seen my ring?

1039
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:05,180
Write to me often, my dear.

1040
01:37:05,380 --> 01:37:08,470
Married women never have much time for writing.

1041
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:10,520
I dare say you won't.

1042
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:15,690
When I married your father, there didn't seem to be enough hours in the day.

1043
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:22,240
My sisters may write to me, for they'll have nothing else to do.

1044
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:33,410
There's nothing so bad as parting with one's children.

1045
01:37:34,410 --> 01:37:38,250
One seems so forlorn without them.

1046
01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:47,800
- Goodbye. - Goodbye, Lydia. Goodbye, Mr Wickham.

1047
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:52,060
Bye, Kitty. Bye, Papa.

1048
01:37:57,980 --> 01:38:01,150
I can't imagine what your father does with all that ink.

1049
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,230
Mrs Bennet.

1050
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:09,030
Did you hear the news, madam? Mr Bingley is returning to Netherfield.

1051
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:13,330
Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch of pork. She expects him tomorrow.

1052
01:38:13,490 --> 01:38:15,870
Tomorrow?

1053
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,620
Not that I care. Mr Bingley's nothing to us.

1054
01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:22,090
I'm sure I never want to see him again, no.

1055
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:26,630
We shan't mention a word about it. Is it quite certain he's coming?

1056
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:31,720
Yes, madam. I believe he's alone. His sister remains in town.

1057
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:38,690
Why he thinks we should be interested, I've no idea. Come along, girls.

1058
01:38:39,650 --> 01:38:43,940
We better go home at once and tell Mr Bennet.

1059
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:48,030
The impudence of the man. I wonder he dare show his face.

1060
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,240
It's all right, Lizzie.

1061
01:38:50,410 --> 01:38:53,410
I'm just glad he's alone because we shall see less of him.

1062
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:57,870
Not that I'm afraid of myself. But I dread other people's remarks.

1063
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,710
Oh, I'm sorry.

1064
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:19,410
[humming]

1065
01:39:34,030 --> 01:39:36,330
He's here. He's here. He's at the door.

1066
01:39:37,450 --> 01:39:40,540
- Mr Bingley! - Mr Bingley?

1067
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:43,710
Oh, my goodness! Everybody behave naturally.

1068
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,550
And whatever you do, do not appear overbearing.

1069
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:50,300
There's someone with him. Mr Whatsisname, the pompous one.

1070
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:55,140
[Mrs Bennet] Mr Darcy? The insolence of it. What does he think of, coming here?

1071
01:39:55,350 --> 01:40:00,230
Keep still, Jane. Mary, put that away at once. Find some useful employment.

1072
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:05,270
Oh, my Lord, I shall have a seizure, I'm sure I shall.

1073
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,400
Kitty.

1074
01:40:07,570 --> 01:40:11,820
- We can't have this here. - Mary, the ribbons, the ribbons.

1075
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:18,040
Mary, sit down at once. Mary!

1076
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:26,210
Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley, ma'am.

1077
01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:39,770
[Mrs Bennet] How glad we are to see you, Mr Bingley.

1078
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:42,600
There have been many changes since you went away.

1079
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:47,730
Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters too.

1080
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:49,780
You will have seen it in the papers,

1081
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:52,530
though it was not put in as it ought to have been.

1082
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:56,410
Very short. Nothing about her family.

1083
01:40:56,570 --> 01:40:59,410
Yes, I did hear of it. I offer my congratulations.

1084
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:03,000
But it is very hard to have my Lydia taken away from me.

1085
01:41:03,210 --> 01:41:07,250
Mr Wickham has been transferred to Newcastle, wherever that is.

1086
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:09,300
Will you stay long in the country?

1087
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,710
Just a few weeks. For the shooting.

1088
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:13,970
When you've killed all your own birds,

1089
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:17,220
I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please.

1090
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:21,930
Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige and will save the best coveys for you.

1091
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:24,600
Excellent.

1092
01:41:24,770 --> 01:41:28,690
- Are you well, Mr Darcy? - Quite well, thank you.

1093
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:31,230
I hope the weather stays fine for your sport.

1094
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:34,900
- I return to town tomorrow. - So soon?

1095
01:41:36,570 --> 01:41:41,120
My Jane looks well, does she not?

1096
01:41:42,950 --> 01:41:45,080
She does indeed.

1097
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:55,220
Well, we must be going, I think.

1098
01:41:55,930 --> 01:41:59,600
Darcy. It's been very pleasant to see you all again.

1099
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:01,760
Miss Elizabeth. Miss Bennet.

1100
01:42:01,970 --> 01:42:03,350
You must come again.

1101
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:07,020
Last winter, you promised to have a family dinner with us.

1102
01:42:07,230 --> 01:42:12,020
I've not forgot, you see. At least three courses.

1103
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:19,530
Excuse me.

1104
01:42:25,370 --> 01:42:28,210
[Mrs Bennet] Most extraordinary.

1105
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:42,720
We were going to walk in and she was going to say, "Sit down."

1106
01:42:42,930 --> 01:42:44,970
So, I feel...

1107
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,240
Oh, it's a disaster, isn't it?

1108
01:42:57,450 --> 01:42:59,410
It's been...

1109
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:03,990
- Miss Bennet. - Mr Bingley.

1110
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:07,000
I'll just go in and I'll just say it.

1111
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:09,460
Yes, exactly.

1112
01:43:14,130 --> 01:43:17,880
I'm glad that's over. Now we can meet as indifferent acquaintances.

1113
01:43:18,050 --> 01:43:19,050
Oh, yes.

1114
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:22,350
You cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.

1115
01:43:22,550 --> 01:43:26,390
You are in great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.

1116
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:32,730
- I'm sorry he came with Mr Darcy. - Don't say that.

1117
01:43:34,070 --> 01:43:35,150
Why ever not?

1118
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:41,070
Jane.

1119
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:46,120
- I've been so blind. - What do you mean?

1120
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:49,080
[Kitty] Look, it's him. He's back. He's come again.

1121
01:43:57,460 --> 01:43:59,420
I know this is all very untoward,

1122
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:03,850
but I would like to request the privilege of speaking to Miss Bennet.

1123
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:07,180
Alone.

1124
01:44:08,770 --> 01:44:12,020
Everybody to the kitchen immediately.

1125
01:44:12,190 --> 01:44:16,230
Except you, Jane, dear, of course.

1126
01:44:18,190 --> 01:44:23,240
Oh, Mr Bingley, it's so good to see you again so soon.

1127
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:48,100
First, I must tell you I've been the most unmitigated and comprehensive ass.

1128
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:08,080
Kitty, be quiet.

1129
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:22,920
Yes.

1130
01:45:23,090 --> 01:45:25,380
A thousand times yes.

1131
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:34,230
Thank the Lord for that. I thought it would never happen.

1132
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:24,940
I am confident they will do well together.

1133
01:46:25,110 --> 01:46:29,120
Their tempers are much alike.

1134
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:34,120
They will be cheated assiduously by their servants.

1135
01:46:34,330 --> 01:46:40,500
And be so generous with the rest, they will always exceed their income.

1136
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:45,260
Exceed their income? He has 5,000 a year.

1137
01:46:49,220 --> 01:46:52,720
I knew she did not be so beautiful for nothing.

1138
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:03,570
[Mary] "...must be free from all insincerity.

1139
01:47:03,730 --> 01:47:07,400
She only can address herself effectually to the feelings of others

1140
01:47:07,610 --> 01:47:10,870
whose mind glows with the warmth of sensibility

1141
01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:13,830
and whose arguments result from conviction.

1142
01:47:13,990 --> 01:47:17,500
She must feel the influence of those passions and emotions

1143
01:47:17,710 --> 01:47:20,880
which she wishes to inspire..."

1144
01:47:41,650 --> 01:47:43,940
Can you die of happiness?

1145
01:47:45,530 --> 01:47:48,530
He was ignorant of my being in town in the spring.

1146
01:47:48,690 --> 01:47:51,780
- How did he account for it? - He thought me indifferent.

1147
01:47:51,950 --> 01:47:55,700
- Unfathomable. - No doubt poisoned by his sister.

1148
01:47:55,870 --> 01:48:01,460
Bravo. That's the most unforgiving speech you've ever made.

1149
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:03,840
Oh, Lizzie, if I could but see you so happy.

1150
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:06,340
If there was such a man for you.

1151
01:48:10,090 --> 01:48:13,340
Perhaps Mr Collins has a cousin.

1152
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:17,970
[horses]

1153
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:18,120
- What is that? - What?

1154
01:48:18,140 --> 01:48:21,230
- [knocking] - Maybe he's changed his mind.

1155
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,570
Coming!

1156
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:30,070
Yes.

1157
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:34,120
Lady Catherine.

1158
01:48:39,790 --> 01:48:42,710
The rest of your offspring, I presume?

1159
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:46,630
All but one. The youngest has been lately married, your Ladyship.

1160
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:49,760
My eldest was proposed to only this afternoon.

1161
01:48:51,630 --> 01:48:55,640
- You have a very small garden. - Could I offer you a cup of tea?

1162
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:59,220
Absolutely not. I need to speak to Miss Elizabeth Bennet alone.

1163
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:02,270
As a matter of urgency.

1164
01:49:06,230 --> 01:49:09,570
You can be at no loss to understand why I am here.

1165
01:49:09,730 --> 01:49:12,030
I cannot account for this honour at all.

1166
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:16,450
I warn you, I am not to be trifled with.

1167
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:18,990
A most alarming report has reached me.

1168
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:23,710
That you intend to be united with my nephew, Mr Darcy.

1169
01:49:23,870 --> 01:49:27,460
I know this to be a falsehood. Though not wishing to injure him

1170
01:49:27,670 --> 01:49:31,590
by supposing it possible, I instantly set off to make my sentiments known.

1171
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:34,840
If you believed it impossible, I wonder that you came so far.

1172
01:49:35,050 --> 01:49:36,390
To hear it contradicted.

1173
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:39,970
Your coming will be a confirmation if such a report exists.

1174
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:43,430
If? You pretend to be ignorant of it?

1175
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:46,600
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourself?

1176
01:49:46,770 --> 01:49:48,650
I have never heard of it.

1177
01:49:48,860 --> 01:49:51,230
Can you declare there is no foundation for it?

1178
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:54,950
I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship.

1179
01:49:55,110 --> 01:49:58,200
You may ask a question which I may choose not to answer.

1180
01:49:58,410 --> 01:50:00,700
Has my nephew made you an offer of marriage?

1181
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:03,960
Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.

1182
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:07,710
Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?

1183
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:11,630
If that is the case, you cannot suppose he would make an offer to me.

1184
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:16,930
Selfish girl. This union has been planned since their infancy.

1185
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:20,470
Do you think it can be prevented by a woman of inferior birth

1186
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:25,140
whose own sister's elopement resulted in a scandalously patched-up marriage

1187
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:28,600
only achieved at the expense of your uncle.

1188
01:50:28,770 --> 01:50:32,690
Heaven and Earth! Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?

1189
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:35,400
Tell me once and for all, are you engaged to him?

1190
01:50:38,870 --> 01:50:41,080
I am not.

1191
01:50:41,950 --> 01:50:44,910
Will you promise never to enter into such an engagement?

1192
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:47,290
I will not and I certainly never shall.

1193
01:50:49,170 --> 01:50:51,460
You have insulted me in every possible way

1194
01:50:51,670 --> 01:50:54,420
and can now have nothing further to say.

1195
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:58,430
I must ask you to leave immediately.

1196
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:02,050
Goodnight.

1197
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:07,810
I have never been thus treated in my entire life!

1198
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:12,520
- [Mr Bennet] What is going on? - Just a small misunderstanding.

1199
01:51:12,690 --> 01:51:15,940
[Lizzie] For once in your life, leave me alone!

1200
01:54:05,490 --> 01:54:08,320
- I couldn't sleep. - Nor l. My aunt...

1201
01:54:08,490 --> 01:54:11,660
Yes, she was here.

1202
01:54:11,830 --> 01:54:15,000
How can I ever make amends for such behaviour?

1203
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:17,540
After what you've done for Lydia

1204
01:54:17,710 --> 01:54:21,050
and, I suspect, for Jane, it is I who should be making amends.

1205
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:27,180
You must know. Surely you must know it was all for you.

1206
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:32,810
You are too generous to trifle with me.

1207
01:54:32,970 --> 01:54:36,390
You spoke with my aunt last night and it has taught me to hope

1208
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:39,270
as I'd scarcely allowed myself before.

1209
01:54:40,730 --> 01:54:45,780
If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.

1210
01:54:45,950 --> 01:54:48,950
My affections and wishes have not changed.

1211
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:52,330
But one word from you will silence me for ever.

1212
01:54:57,540 --> 01:55:01,840
If, however, your feelings have changed...

1213
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:06,840
...I would have to tell you,

1214
01:55:07,050 --> 01:55:09,890
you have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love...

1215
01:55:10,050 --> 01:55:13,140
I love... I love you.

1216
01:55:13,310 --> 01:55:16,270
I never wish to be parted from you from this day on.

1217
01:55:27,950 --> 01:55:29,660
Well, then.

1218
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:37,250
Your hands are cold.

1219
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:23,540
[Mr Bennet] Shut the door, please.

1220
01:56:34,470 --> 01:56:39,980
Lizzie, are you out of your senses? I thought you hated the man.

1221
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:45,190
- No, Papa. - He is rich, to be sure.

1222
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:49,240
And you will have more fine carriages than Jane.

1223
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:51,860
But will that make you happy?

1224
01:56:52,070 --> 01:56:56,160
Have you no other objection than your belief in my indifference?

1225
01:56:56,330 --> 01:56:58,540
None at all.

1226
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:03,580
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of fellow.

1227
01:57:03,790 --> 01:57:06,170
But this would be nothing if you liked him.

1228
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:08,050
I do like him.

1229
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:12,010
I love him.

1230
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:19,850
He's not proud. I was wrong. I was entirely wrong about him.

1231
01:57:23,230 --> 01:57:26,560
You don't know him, Papa. If I told you what he was really like,

1232
01:57:26,770 --> 01:57:27,940
what he's done...

1233
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:30,990
What has he done?

1234
01:57:39,080 --> 01:57:42,830
[Mrs Bennet] But she doesn't like him. I thought she didn't like him.

1235
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:46,710
[Jane] So did l. So did we all.

1236
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:49,590
[Jane] We must have been wrong.

1237
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:55,300
- It won't be the first time, will it? - No, nor the last, I dare say.

1238
01:58:00,810 --> 01:58:02,600
Good Lord.

1239
01:58:05,230 --> 01:58:09,270
- I must pay him back. - No.

1240
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:13,030
You mustn't tell anyone. He wouldn't want it.

1241
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:17,530
We misjudged him, Papa. Me more than anyone. In every way.

1242
01:58:17,740 --> 01:58:21,080
Not just in this matter.

1243
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:23,910
I've been nonsensical.

1244
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:29,040
But he's been a fool about Jane, about so many other things.

1245
01:58:29,250 --> 01:58:32,670
But then, so have l.

1246
01:58:35,590 --> 01:58:38,340
You see, he and I are...

1247
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:43,770
He and I are so similar.

1248
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:47,310
We're both so stubborn.

1249
01:58:48,980 --> 01:58:50,690
Papa, l...

1250
01:58:54,650 --> 01:58:57,030
You really do love him, don't you?

1251
01:58:58,490 --> 01:59:00,780
Very much.

1252
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:10,960
I cannot believe that anyone can deserve you.

1253
01:59:11,130 --> 01:59:15,340
But it seems I am overruled.

1254
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:20,140
So I heartily give my consent.

1255
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:33,400
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzie, to anyone less worthy.

1256
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:37,740
Thank you.

1257
01:59:51,710 --> 01:59:56,340
If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, for heaven's sake, send them in.

1258
01:59:56,550 --> 01:59:59,090
I'm quite at my leisure.

1259
02:00:20,990 --> 02:00:22,690
How are you this evening, my dear?

1260
02:00:23,090 --> 02:00:24,090
Very well.

1261
02:00:24,390 --> 02:00:26,290
-Only I wish you would not call me "my dear". -Why?

1262
02:00:26,690 --> 02:00:30,090
Because it's what my father always calls my mother when he's cross about something.

1263
02:00:30,190 --> 02:00:31,490
What endearments am I allowed?

1264
02:00:31,690 --> 02:00:32,690
Well let me think...

1265
02:00:33,290 --> 02:00:35,090
"Lizzie" for everyday

1266
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:37,690
"My Pearl" for Sundays

1267
02:00:37,790 --> 02:00:39,090
and...

1268
02:00:39,290 --> 02:00:43,390
"Goddess Divine", but only on very special occasions.

1269
02:00:44,090 --> 02:00:47,390
And...what should I call you when I am cross?

1270
02:00:47,990 --> 02:00:49,490
"Mrs. Darcy"?

1271
02:00:49,590 --> 02:00:52,390
No! No.

1272
02:00:52,690 --> 02:00:55,690
You may only call me "Mrs. Darcy"...

1273
02:00:56,290 --> 02:01:01,390
when you are completely, and perfectly, and incandescently happy.

1274
02:01:04,790 --> 02:01:06,390
Then how are you this evening... Mrs. Darcy?

1275
02:01:07,790 --> 02:01:09,190
Mrs. Darcy

1276
02:01:17,890 --> 02:01:19,290
Mrs. Darcy

1277
02:01:23,090 --> 02:01:24,190
Mrs. Darcy

1278
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:27,990
Mrs. Darcy

1279
02:01:33,690 --> 02:01:34,990
Mrs. Darcy
