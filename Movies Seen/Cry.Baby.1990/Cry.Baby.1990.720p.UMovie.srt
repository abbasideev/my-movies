Watch. It's easy.

550
00:33:06,378 --> 00:33:09,221
You just open your mouth,

551
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:14,911
and I open mine,

552
00:33:16,993 --> 00:33:19,162
and we wiggle
our tongues together.

553
00:33:23,055 --> 00:33:25,156
And it feels real sexy.

554
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:28,746
I won't get mononucleosis,
will I?

555
00:33:28,815 --> 00:33:30,618
No, Allison. Just try it.

556
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:33,394
If you don't like it,
I promise I'll stop.

It's just that
you are so beautiful.

567
00:34:48,984 --> 00:34:51,051
I want to let you,
but I can't.

568
00:34:51,127 --> 00:34:52,896
For my parents' sake.

569
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:56,112
Cry-Baby, they're both dead.
I'm an orphan.

I'm sorry, Allison.

571
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,065
No wonder we're together,
honey.

572
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:03,343
I'm an orphan, too.

00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:05,383
You are?

574
00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:06,690
Yes.

575
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:09,877
And orphans
have special needs.

00:35:11,086 --> 00:35:13,791
Just on the outside
of the shirt, okay?
Is it okay with you?

577
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:15,736
Yes. Oh, yes!

578
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:20,990
My parents were,
they good people
and they... they loved me.

579
00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:23,231
I want you. I need you.

580
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:24,972
I love you, too, Allison.

581
00:35:25,351 --> 00:35:27,326
They had to go on
a business trip together.

582
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:29,196
It was their
first airplane ride.

583
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:32,546
Oh, Cry-Baby,
your fingers feel so good.

584
00:35:32,618 --> 00:35:35,095
I've been saving it up
for a girl like you, honey.

585
00:35:35,297 --> 00:35:38,140
Mommy and Daddy
took separate planes
for safety.

586
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,714
In case one plane crashed,
I would still have
a living parent.

587
00:35:41,793 --> 00:35:43,928
But, Cry-Baby,
both planes crashed

588
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:46,035
and I never saw
my parents alive again.

What's the matter,
Cry-Baby?

592
00:35:52,342 --> 00:35:53,644
Everything is the matter.

593
00:35:53,714 --> 00:35:56,923
It's just a thunderstorm.
Heat lightning.

594
00:35:57,799 --> 00:35:58,963
It's sexy.

595
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:01,539
It's not sexy.
Electricity makes me insane.

596
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,284
Why, Cry-Baby? Why?

597
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:07,575
Here's why.
Electricity killed my parents.

598
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:10,115
They died in
the electric chair?

599
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,959
That's right, Allison.

600
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,534
My father was
the Alphabet Bomber.

601
00:36:14,878 --> 00:36:17,355
He may have been crazy,
but he was my pop.

602
00:36:17,858 --> 00:36:19,526
The only one I ever had.

603
00:36:20,205 --> 00:36:23,150
God. I read about
the Alphabet Bomber.

607
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:38,149

My mother
tried to stop him.

612
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:53,320
She couldn't even spell,
for Christ's sake,
but they fried her, too.

613
00:36:53,657 --> 00:36:56,032
But I'll pay them
all back, Allison.

614
00:36:56,504 --> 00:36:58,170
That's why, every day,
I gotta do

something rotten
for my parents' sake

616
00:37:00,088 --> 00:37:01,789

what I have to do.

617
00:37:01,862 --> 00:37:03,391
But not much, though.

618
