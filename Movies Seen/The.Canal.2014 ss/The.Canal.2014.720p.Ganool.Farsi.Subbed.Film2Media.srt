1
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,420
Alright, quiet, come on.

2
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,300
Calm down.

3
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,930
Who wants to see ghosts?

4
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,900
Who wants to see some ghosts?

5
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,850
Ghosts!

6
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,450
Alright, that's better.

7
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,420
First of all, hello, welcome.

8
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,470
My name is David Williams, this
is my colleague, Clare McManus.

9
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,190
We are archivists in the
National Film Archive.

10
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:31,650
Today you're going to see a series
of films, dated from 1895 to 1905.

11
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,200
It's worth bearing in mind that everyone
you see in these films are long since dead

12
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,480
all these people, men, women and children have
vanished off the face of the earth forever.

13
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,490
So, in a way, it's like
watching real ghosts.

14
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,110
Alright, alright!

15
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,670
Let's just watch it and see
what you think.

16
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,280
Thanks.

17
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,880
Don't worry.. she'll love it.

18
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,060
Hi!

19
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,600
Hey.. nice to see you!
How are you?

20
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,030
This is my wife Alice.

21
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,480
Hi
Hi! Great to meet you!

22
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,030
So nice to finally meet you. Sorry I couldn't
make it the last time. I was... busy

23
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,650
No no no no... not at all!

24
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,530
So... I'm going to let you go on
in, take a look for yourselves.

25
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,200
I'll be right here waiting for you,
take as much time as you need.

26
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,280
Alright, thank you.

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,190
Come on then!

28
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,710
Go on, you first.

29
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,340
Are you coming?

30
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,770
No. I'm too nervous.

31
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,260
Go on, you go round.

32
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,420
I love it!

33
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,260
Alice..

34
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,100
you got a message.

35
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,490
..you got a message

36
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,290
Who is it?

37
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,690
Mam..

38
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,090
Dad

39
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,500
Hey sweetie...

40
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,990
I heard a noise and I woke up
and now I need to go toilet.

41
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,850
I'll go.

42
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,620
Da.. are you afraid of the dark?

43
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,030
No. Of course not.

44
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,680
Why, are you?

45
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,430
No, but there could be
something hiding in the dark.

46
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,430
Hmmm.. like what?

47
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,590
Monsters.

48
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,770
Night night. Ok.
I love you.

49
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,270
Night Dad, love you.

50
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,880
Do you want to tell me
dinosaurs I can name

51
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,830
Maybe tomorrow.

52
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,300
Can you say night night to my
dragon heads?

53
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,960
Good night!

54
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,010
Is he alright?

55
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,240
Yeah, he's fine.

56
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,010
Who was the message from?

57
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,480
Steve.

58
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,310
In work.

59
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,220
Just because he doesn't have a life he thinks
everyone else should be on a 24 hour call.

60
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,360
I'm sorry. I should have
switched it off earlier.

61
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,350
I love you.

62
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,070
Good night.

63
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,800
What time do you start work?

64
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,970
What's this?
Not 'til 10.

65
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,030
Alright, come on.

66
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,240
Have a good day, sweetheart.

67
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,950
Bye. Love you. You too.

68
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,320
Thank you.

69
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,010
Bye boys!

70
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,520
Bye Mam!

71
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,600
Allosaurus, Bwontosaurus, T-Rex,

72
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,400
Triceratops, Stegosaurus,
that's the best one!

73
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,960
Wow! God you're getting so clever,
that's more than I can name!

74
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,040
Do you think I'd be able to
swim in there?

75
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,750
No way.. no.. it's too deep.

76
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,070
Would you be able to swim in there?

77
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,130
No..

78
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,810
No It's too deep for me too.

79
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,830
Billy.

80
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,070
Billy!

81
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,670
Billy! Billy!

82
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,330
Hey don't go in there,
I told you.

83
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,070
A girl in our school saw a ghost in there.

84
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,600
Well I don't know about ghosts,
but there could be rats in there.

85
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,420
It's filthy.

86
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,660
Can I throw a stone and see
if a ghost comes out?

87
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,760
Throw a stone?

88
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
Alright, just one.

89
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,470
Then we've got to go.

90
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,550
You got one?

91
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,620
Ok?

92
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,020
Can I throw another one?

93
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,380
No! Come on,
we're going to be late.

94
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,390
I'll pick you up later.

95
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,670
Bye Dad!

96
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,940
Have a good day.

97
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,440
I hope you feel better
than you look.

98
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,130
I didn't get much sleep last night.

99
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,300
Why, do I look that bad?

100
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,570
No worse than usual!

101
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,990
Anyway, I probably don't look
much better!

102
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:24,460
I was up til 4am watching Cat
People and the Curse of the...

103
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,680
Cat People? It was on?
I love that movie!

104
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,280
Yeah.. I was going to give you a call, but...
I figured you need your beauty sleep!

105
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,360
Yeah.. very funny.

106
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,700
Listen, I don't mean to
spoil the day with work,

107
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,670
but some films came into the archive,

108
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,720
some from the police archive,
could be interesting.

109
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Yeah

110
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,890
Would you look at them for me?

111
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,050
Sure./
Great. Thanks.

112
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,380
Hey.. that's my road.

113
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,040
I had a really strange day today.

114
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,860
I watched a 1902 film, our
house was in it.

115
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,240
There was a murder here.

116
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,800
A man killed his wife.
It happened in this room.

117
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,820
What?

118
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,480
I wouldn't worry about it.

119
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,430
Horrible things happen
in every old house.

120
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,750
Only these dinosaurs rule their...

121
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,680
You look amazing Mrs Williams!

122
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,050
Oh!
Thank you, Sophie!

123
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,890
This is my husband, David.

124
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,560
Hi!
Hi.

125
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,520
Sophie used to be the nanny for
the Thompsons, two doors down.

126
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,800
Mam, Sophie never even
heard of Stegosaurus.

127
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,920
Well, not everyone knows
about dinosaurs, you know!

128
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,190
OK, make yourself at home, and help
yourself to any food in the kitchen.

129
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,900
We shouldn't be home too late.

130
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,440
See you tomorrow.

131
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,700
Sleep well.

132
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,320
Pleased to meet you.

133
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,120
Alice!

134
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,120
Hi!

135
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,300
Alex is here.

136
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,640
I'm sure you remember David,
my husband.

137
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,710
Hi

138
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,710
You're the, eh, the librarian?

139
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,710
The... archivist.

140
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,120
Nice to see you again.

141
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,200
You too.

142
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,450
I'm sure you won't mind if I borrow your
lovely wife for a couple of moments there's

143
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,790
somebody I'd really
like her to meet.

144
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,790
No no, not at all!

145
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,280
I'll get a drink.

146
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,020
Can I help you sir?

147
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,500
Can I get a..

148
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,090
another gin and tonic.

149
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,410
Hi.

150
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,830
I'm sorry about all that.

151
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,780
What was all that about?

152
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,120
Um..

153
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,470
work stuff.

154
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,000
He wanted me to meet this
client, but I didn't want to.

155
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,670
Not tonight.

156
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,900
I thought he was the client.

157
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,170
Yes... he is.

158
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,990
But he wanted me to meet
another one.

159
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,480
A colleague of his.

160
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,480
Let's dance.

161
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,040
I'm just going to finish this.

162
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,600
I love you.

163
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,310
Whoa!

164
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,330
Sorry! I couldn't resist.

165
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,920
You alright?/
Yeah.

166
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,530
You look pale.

167
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,740
No I'm alright.

168
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,890
Yeah?

169
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,010
Paler than usual, even.

170
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,250
Um..

171
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,330
I have the last 7 or 8 of those donated
films lined up in the screening room,

172
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,930
Take a look?/
Yeah, sure.

173
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:45,310
<i>Twinkle twinkle little star,
how I wonder what you are.</i>

174
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:52,570
<i>Up above the world so high,
like a diamond in the sky..</i>

175
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,600
Kiss!

176
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,570
Bye boy.

177
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,130
Bye Mum.

178
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,580
Wait for your Dad, Billy!

179
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,280
Hey, don't work late tonight.

180
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,680
Come straight home.

181
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,410
Why? What's wrong?

182
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,200
I won't be too late, I promise.

183
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,470
Bye.

184
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,200
Alice!

185
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,510
Alice!

186
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,600
Hello?

187
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,960
Dad! I'm still at school,
are you collecting me?

188
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,170
Dad, did you forget about me?

189
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,090
I just lost track of time.
I'm sorry.

190
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,800
Adam and me were the only ones left.

191
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:52,380
Adam said a gowilla could beat a
winosaurus in a fight, is that true?

192
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,420
No.

193
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,230
The master wants you.

194
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,360
The master wants you.

195
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,440
David...

196
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,110
please..
don't..

197
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,570
I don't want to...

198
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,430
David...

199
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,790
please..
don't..

200
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,120
I don't want to die

201
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,900
<i>Hi, it's Alice here,
sorry I missed your call.</i>

202
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,760
<i>If you want to leave your name and number
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</i>

203
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,600
<i>Thanks.</i>

204
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,840
Detective McNamara.

205
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,940
So, when did you last see her?

206
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,070
Em.. yesterday morning.

207
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,480
We said good bye, I took
Billy, my son, to school.

208
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,560
And has she stayed out all
night before?

209
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,750
No.

210
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,050
No, never.

211
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,450
She said she was working late last night,
but I asked a work colleague of hersand

212
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,270
she said Alice left
around about five.

213
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,410
Did you have an argument?

214
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,670
No.

215
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,310
You sure?

216
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,700
Yeah.

217
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,280
You been in touch with her
family and friends?

218
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,040
Yes.

219
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,770
And they've heard
nothing from her?

220
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,270
No.

221
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,170
Ok..

222
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:09,010
Hair colour?

223
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,800
Some of them are a little old.

224
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,680
That's all I could find.

225
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,960
Dad, when will mummy
be coming back?

226
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,340
I told you... she'll be home soon.
Don't worry.

227
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,220
Pretty..

228
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,290
Hey./
Hiya.

229
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,660
Is there any news?

230
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,300
How's Billy?

231
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,700
Yeah, he's fine.

232
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,550
I put him to bed about
an hour ago.

233
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,390
He wanted to sleep in your room.

234
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,240
Do you know there's black
stuff on your hands.

235
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,980
They took my fingerprints to
eliminate me.

236
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,310
In case there's an investigation.

237
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,160
Em.. I put Billy to bed about
an hour ago.

238
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,220
He wanted to sleep in your room.

239
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:02,060
He's fine. All day.
We get on really well!

240
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,500
He's a great kid,
I really like him.

241
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,600
I get to know everything about
dinosaurs!

242
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,890
Yeah!

243
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,670
I'd better go.

244
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,990
Yeah.

245
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,460
Thanks.

246
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,500
Yeah.

247
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,900
See you in the morning.

248
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,450
Billy...

249
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,920
Billy! What are you looking at?

250
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,930
Come here...

251
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,790
I had a dream about Mammy.

252
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,800
I miss her.

253
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,230
Man came forward yesterday
claiming to be your wife's lover.

254
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,800
Says he was with her the
night she disappeared.

255
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:13,990
They've been seeing each other
for about a year.

256
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,720
You know anything about that?

257
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,190
No.

258
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:26,110
Well, according to him,
she was planning to leave you.

259
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,530
That's impossible.
She loves me.

260
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,780
She has a lover, David.
He's lying!

261
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,550
Well, several of her friends
have backed him up.

262
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:41,770
By all accounts, she was in love
with the bloke, and he with her.

263
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,340
Sorry.

264
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,740
Fucking acid reflux.

265
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,920
Total fucking pain in the arse.

266
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,040
Want one of these?

267
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,200
No.

268
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,400
I've got a very weak stomach,
David.

269
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,620
You didn't kill her, did you?

270
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,850
You've no right to be asking
me these things.

271
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,800
I love, I love my wife.

272
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,800
I'd never, I'd never do
anything to hurt her.

273
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,980
Never.

274
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,730
Are you asking her lover
these questions, are you?

275
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,680
Yeah.

276
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,980
You asking him if he killed her?

277
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,340
Yeah.

278
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,070
He's got an alibi.

279
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:50,950
His boss called just as she
was leaving his house,

280
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,510
they both heard her insist
on going home by herself

281
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:58,380
and then stayed on the phone for over
an hour, so it's cast iron mate!

282
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,370
people always suspect the husband.

283
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,880
Do you know why that is?

284
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,220
Cause it's always the husband.

285
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,910
Every fucking time.

286
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,740
Is this your wife?

287
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,470
This your wife, Alice Williams?

288
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,280
Yes.

289
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,290
Yes, it's my wife.

290
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:09,690
There was no evidence of foul
play or assault.

291
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,590
She drowned.

292
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,230
She must have fallen in.

293
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,370
It was an accident?

294
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,030
Yes.

295
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,870
I think so.

296
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,740
One of the heels of her
shoe had snapped off,

297
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,150
which we think may have
caused her to fall in.

298
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,780
So in the absence of any
evidence to the contrary,

299
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:36,200
we have to conclude
that it was an accident, yes.

300
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,280
Do you agree?

301
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,570
You did know she was pregnant?

302
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:27,210
Very sorry for your troubles.

303
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:30,130
Thank you.

304
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,530
Nana.

305
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,240
Ohh!

306
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,150
She loved you.

307
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,030
You know that, don't you?

308
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,830
Yes?

309
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,820
Yes?

310
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,040
She loved you.

311
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,570
More than anything else in the
whole world.

312
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,970
Yes.

313
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,200
Oh Billy!

314
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,580
Billy. Billy!

315
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,070
Come on, go with Clare, ok?

316
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,860
How's he doing?

317
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,100
Yeah, he's alright.

318
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,320
Children are strong.

319
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,270
They are stronger than most
adults, even.

320
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:31,490
Of course, they don't really
understand, do they?

321
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,270
Maybe I should take him for a
while.

322
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,940
It might be good for him.

323
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,910
I think Alice would
have liked that.

324
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:45,080
He should be around
another woman.

325
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,720
A mother figure.

326
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,360
We've got Sophie
living with us now...

327
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,710
Billy's nanny...

328
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,260
I think it's best if stays
home with me.

329
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,300
Did you hear about Alex?

330
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,550
Alex?

331
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,820
Alice's boyfriend.

332
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,710
Apparently he's taken
Alice's death very badly.

333
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,240
He's completely devastated.

334
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,970
They say he need to go into a
hospital.

335
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,570
To recover.

336
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,000
Yes.

337
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:24,320
I couldn't give a shit.

338
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,810
Do you understand me?

339
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:29,860
I couldn't care less,
I have my son.

340
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,690
A lot of people loved her.

341
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,810
I loved her.

342
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,330
I have to go.

343
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,170
Just say goodbye to Billy.

344
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,270
It's been a long day.

345
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,400
You alright?

346
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,970
I lied.

347
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,810
I, eh, I lied to the police.

348
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,280
I did know about that guy in
the house

349
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,340
Oh...

350
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,860
em...

351
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:28,280
it doesn't really matter now
anyway, does it.

352
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,020
It was an accident.

353
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,610
The thing is...

354
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,380
on the night she disappeared

355
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,390
I went to his house,

356
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:41,410
that guy, and I went in after them

357
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,610
and I saw them together in bed.

358
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,810
I didn't do anything.

359
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,150
You know, I could have done, but
I didn't. I just left.

360
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,490
They didn't even see me.

361
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,160
On the way home I felt..

362
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,270
so sick, I just had to go to
the public toilets

363
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,630
beside the canal and I just
threw up, everywhere,

364
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:09,070
and I remember, I was just
being sick, and I looked up,

365
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:12,610
and there was someone looking
over the cubicle wall at me.

366
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,450
It was a man.

367
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,910
I managed to get to the door,
and just before I blacked out

368
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:21,600
I swear I saw him with his
hands around her throat,

369
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:27,770
and he was, he was trying to
kill her.

370
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,540
He was killing her, and I couldn't
move, I couldn't do anything.

371
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,750
And then when she didn't come
back home the next day..

372
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,890
I mean, what I seen was real..
Clare...

373
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,210
it was really real.

374
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,200
Then you need to
tell the police.

375
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,150
Tell em what, what I told you,
I don't even,

376
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,600
I don't even know
what the man looked like.

377
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,310
It doesn't matter,
tell them anyway

378
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:52,730
Once I tell them I followed Alice
into that house, that is it.

379
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,820
Alright?

380
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,700
They'll, they'll just,
they'll just think it was me.

381
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,870
What are you going to do?

382
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,360
I have to find him first.

383
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,000
I just have to.

384
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,320
David!

385
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,460
David!

386
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,610
What?

387
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,640
The old camera.

388
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,890
Eh, no, sorry.
I'll do it now.

389
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,430
It's ok.
Do it in the morning.

390
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,340
What's this?

391
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,390
It's just..

392
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,510
eh, just..

393
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,410
unsolved crimes.

394
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:30,940
Murders that happened
in the city around the canal.

395
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,760
I found it online.

396
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,760
Just going through it.

397
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,270
See if I can find similarities.

398
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,800
David.

399
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,520
You should be taking time to grieve,
not thinking about stuff like this.

400
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,120
I'll find something.

401
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,420
Yeah, I just have to keep
looking, that's all.

402
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,930
Dad, look what we did!

403
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:09,730
Wow! It's great!

404
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,220
I hope you don't mind.
I know how busy you are.

405
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,760
No, course not.

406
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,950
I totally forgot.

407
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:19,220
Dad, lift me up, so I can
put the angel on top.

408
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,420
You want to put the
angel on top, do you?

409
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,200
Up right the top.

410
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,430
You ready?

411
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:31,830
Wherever you want..

412
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,950
1-2-3.. come on, reach!

413
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,480
Sorry for disturbing you.

414
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:16,000
I was thinking that we could make a real effort
with the decorations and stuff this year.

415
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,210
I think it would be good for Billy.
What do you think?

416
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,750
I could buy more lights for the stars.

417
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:26,120
And yes, I thought I could decorate
all the other rooms and stuff..

418
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,070
make it, like, really
Christmassy.

419
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:29,890
Yeah.

420
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:32,230
Yeah.
That sounds a good idea.

421
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:35,240
Are you alright?

422
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,820
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

423
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,660
Mr Williams.

424
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,220
Night Sophie.

425
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,800
Do you want us to move?

426
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,270
No it's ok, stay where you are.

427
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,480
Hello?

428
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,230
Is someone there?

429
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:41,100
Sophie?

430
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,740
Sorry!

431
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,120
sorry.

432
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,760
Sorry..

433
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:57,830
Look, could you come
to my room for a second?

434
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,230
Why?

435
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,350
Eh, just for a second.

436
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,420
Don't you... listen!
It's really faint.

437
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,890
What is it?/
Just listen.

438
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,870
You hear it?

439
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,030
I can't hear anything.

440
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:30,370
No it's stopped.

441
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,470
There's something behind there.

442
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:33,860
Maybe it's just a rah.

443
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,110
No no. It's not a rat.

444
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:41,900
I can't hear anything.

445
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,370
What can you hear?

446
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:46,230
It's whispering like
someone's praying.

447
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,510
Maybe it's just from the house
next door.

448
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,250
No...

449
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,210
the walls are too solid.

450
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,520
Dad what are you doing
I was asleep?

451
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,410
Billy..

452
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:04,780
Billy go to bed.

453
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,120
It's alright.

454
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,720
It's nothing. Everything's ok.

455
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,600
Take him to bed, will you.

456
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,690
Come on. We have to go to bed.

457
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:19,140
I want to stay.

458
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,400
What's Dad doing?

459
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,080
What's wrong?

460
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,160
Billy, go to your room,
get dressed.

461
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,130
You and Sophie
are getting out of here.

462
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:50,550
I'm just going to
put the belt on you.

463
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,760
There we go.

464
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:57,290
Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
I love you.

465
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,570
I'm not sure about this.

466
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:08,130
I'm sorry, sorry about this. You're just
going to have to trust me. Alright?

467
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:12,110
It's not safe here,
It's not safe for you and Billy.

468
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,580
Everything is paid for at the
hotel, they're expecting you

469
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,660
Okay.

470
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,260
You can buy anything
you want on room service.

471
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,010
I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks.

472
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,230
Yeah.

473
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:33,370
Come on...
come on...

474
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:36,210
Ok, it's just coming up...

475
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,220
Ok there..

476
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,380
there it is, you see it?

477
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,360
Yes..

478
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,330
I see it.
There's someone there.

479
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,630
Ok, there's more..
just wait...

480
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,680
and there...
there...

481
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,500
you see his outline?

482
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,190
It's hard to tell,
it could just be a shadow.

483
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:55,660
Oh come on, there's someone there.

484
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:59,110
Maybe. It's really hard to tell.

485
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,250
Tell me you believe this, ok?

486
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,900
Believe what?

487
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,360
This is the man
that killed Alice.

488
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:11,390
This is the same man that I saw on
the night that she was murdered.

489
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:12,780
What do you mean?

490
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,380
I think there's ghosts
in my house.

491
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,830
David!...

492
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:20,670
I know this sounds crazy, believe me,
I know how fucking crazy this sounds,

493
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,880
but I've seen things,
I've heard things,

494
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,670
it's the only
rational explanation

495
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,050
I don't think it is!/
Yes it is!

496
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:30,070
Ok, ok, wait until you hear this.

497
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:32,410
In the 1930's they held
seances in my house,

498
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:35,270
the people said they saw a
shadowy figure, a shadowy figure

499
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,540
It's a coincidence, that's all.

500
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,190
The previous owner, right,

501
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:42,400
the estate agent told us it was
an old lady that went senile,

502
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,130
but it wasn't.

503
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:46,640
They lied to us.

504
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,710
She was a young woman who tried to burn her
house down while her family was asleep.

505
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:57,110
Now her son died in the fire,
but she swore she didn't do it.

506
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,710
Like me with Alice.

507
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,640
She said it was the demon.

508
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,350
She said a man she couldn't see
tried to rape her.

509
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:06,430
She said he was a demon
who lived behind the walls.

510
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:07,700
The walls, Clare.

511
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,070
Stop for a moment.

512
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:10,650
Stop for one moment.

513
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,370
Will you just think about
what you're saying.

514
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:20,010
You think I'm having a
nervous breakdown don't you?

515
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,930
Well maybe I am.

516
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,700
No.

517
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,170
Well maybe...

518
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:32,210
You're just exhausted.

519
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,800
Ok?

520
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,170
Yeah.

521
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,530
Billy?

522
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,070
Sophie?

523
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:59,140
Billy can you hear me?

524
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,300
Dad why did you not come
to see us today?

525
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,670
I'm sorry.

526
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:06,070
I wanted to, I just wasn't
feeling very well.

527
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:09,110
Can you come in and
see us tomorrow?

528
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,260
Yeah.

529
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,210
Yeah, promise.

530
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:14,910
What have you had to eat?

531
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:19,440
We had burgers, chips,
icecream and coke for dinner.

532
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,660
Wow..

533
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,510
My tummy is big, look how fat
I am Dad!

534
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,160
Billy is Sophie back in the
room with you?

535
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:02,360
No she's still in the shower.

536
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:09,170
Billy I want you to move
the laptop around, ok?

537
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,720
Just move the laptop around so I can
see the rest of the room, go on.

538
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,150
Please?

539
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:15,820
Keep moving...

540
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,820
keep moving the laptop.

541
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:19,650
That's it.
Good boy.

542
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:21,520
keep moving some more...

543
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,080
that's it...

544
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,790
just need to see the...

545
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:26,350
the room.

546
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,420
What is that?

547
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:37,720
Billy...

548
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,850
Billy!

549
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:41,670
Billy get out of the room!

550
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,370
Billy!

551
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,760
How did you get here so fast?

552
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:11,890
Mr Williams?

553
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:17,370
I'm not sure if I can work
here anymore.

554
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:20,340
I don't know what's going on.

555
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,400
And..

556
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,870
if it wasn't for Billy I think
I'd leave right now.

557
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,100
I understand.

558
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:37,150
Yeah you're right,
you should go.

559
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,500
I can't guarantee your safety
anymore and...

560
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:47,530
it's not safe to be around us.

561
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:52,080
I don't want to leave Billy
behind...

562
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:56,000
but I really don't think
you're well, Mr Williams.

563
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:05,890
Maybe if you told me what was going on
I could understand or I could help.

564
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:10,990
Please Sophie, you must go
tomorrow.

565
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:16,430
You better sleep in here with
us tonight.

566
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:19,920
I'll take the floor, you can
have the bed.

567
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,540
No it's alright.
I'll be ok.

568
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,990
No. No, no, please.

569
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:26,720
You won't.

570
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,120
Mr Williams, I want to talk to you
about this again in the morning.

571
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,200
About me leaving, I mean.

572
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,860
Yeah.

573
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,790
Goodnight.

574
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,410
Come on...

575
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:34,600
Come on...

576
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,660
No..

577
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:52,560
No!... what are you doing?

578
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,390
Arrhhh!

579
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:55,180
Just come down the stairs..

580
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,940
Let me out!

581
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:07,360
Let me out!

582
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:10,850
Mr Williams!

583
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:17,260
Where's Dad, who's in the house?

584
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:20,010
I don't know...

585
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,590
No-one

586
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:33,260
Mr Williams, let me out.

587
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:37,240
Let us out..

588
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,950
Billy's afraid..

589
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:47,100
I've checked everywhere

590
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,830
Dad!

591
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,840
Me and Billy..
were following somebody outside...

592
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:56,780
Ok then I heard you screaming.

593
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,920
They're trying to separate us.

594
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,170
Did you see anyone up there?

595
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:05,950
Did you?

596
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:07,140
Come on Billy!

597
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,240
No..

598
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,890
Billy's staying with me.

599
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,950
Sophie!...

600
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,600
Billy...

601
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,980
Do you ever see other people
in the house?

602
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:54,780
Billy, if you see someone,
you know you have to tell me?

603
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,430
Did you?

604
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,380
Are you sure?

605
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:04,750
Where's Sophie?

606
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,990
She left this morning.

607
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:11,400
She's not coming back.

608
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,450
Billy, do you see that woman?

609
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:25,310
Where?

610
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:28,760
There...

611
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:30,970
you see, she's hiding
in the long grass?

612
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:33,720
I don't see anyone.

613
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,830
Are we going to see my teacher
today?

614
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:54,910
No.

615
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:56,640
Not today.

616
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:06,830
Billy..
Billy get back.

617
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:09,400
Go on. Get back...

618
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:12,870
Go... go hide behind the wall.

619
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,240
Go on...

620
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,450
turn around...turn around,
count to 10.

621
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:23,550
Ok?

622
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:25,390
One... two... go on...

623
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,490
1...

624
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:31,270
2...

625
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,820
...4...

626
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:51,570
...10!

627
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:59,180
Is this a game of hide and seek,
can I open my eyes now?

628
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:12,390
Clare...

629
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:13,540
David..

630
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,160
You okay?

631
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,830
Hi, Billy!

632
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:18,280
Hi!

633
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,510
I need to develop this.

634
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:23,350
What is it?

635
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:25,530
It's nothing.

636
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:28,800
Just let me develop it,
it won't take me long.

637
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,700
You have to tell me
what it is first.

638
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,590
Please, Clare,
don't make me beg.

639
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:39,060
I need to see this.

640
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,470
Please.

641
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:43,370
Ok.

642
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:45,800
But it'll be a couple
of days though.

643
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,120
No. No, I need to see it today...

644
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,630
em...

645
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:51,540
I need to see it now.

646
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,710
It's fully booked in here.

647
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,690
Ok, I'll get it done, promise.

648
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:02,330
I'll even drop it down to you
when it's done, Ok?

649
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,870
Look...

650
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:07,510
I've been thinking...

651
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:11,650
maybe you should
talk to someone?

652
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:15,870
A bereavement counsellor
or something.

653
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,250
Just...

654
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,220
think about it, Ok?

655
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:37,470
If anyone walks here tonight,
we'll see their footsteps

656
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,450
It's like snow!

657
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:40,880
Can I have a go?

658
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,480
Yeah!

659
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:49,540
Now no one can get in without
us knowing.

660
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:09,610
You're like me

661
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,770
What's with all the powder, Dave?

662
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:40,220
It's flour from the kitchen.

663
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,340
Oh..

664
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:43,050
is that right?

665
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,570
What's with all the flour,
are you making a cake?

666
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:47,600
What do you want?

667
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,030
Get your clothes on.
You're coming with me.

668
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:58,070
We found a hammer in the canal,
with your fingerprints on it.

669
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:01,580
A hammer that belonged to your
wife's lover.

670
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:06,110
He says it went missing
the night she disappeared.

671
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,690
Can you explain that?

672
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,300
There was a murder in my house
in..

673
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,300
in 1902.

674
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:16,230
What...

675
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:20,540
You could look all of this is up;
and a man killed his whole family.

676
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,550
You understand me...

677
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:24,460
and I think he was
the one who did it.

678
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:27,430
I have proof, I've captured
something on film.

679
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,440
It's a ghost.

680
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,420
You can see it in a few days.

681
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:42,160
As the senior welfare officer I have no
choice but to recommend his case to social

682
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,130
services and recommend that
the child is taken into care.

683
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:46,880
Isn't that a little harsh?

684
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,530
Mr Williams has just lost his wife.

685
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:53,170
His symptoms are clearly
part of a grieving process.

686
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:55,530
Are locking nannies in cupboards and

687
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:58,630
hearing voices behind walls part of
the grieving process?

688
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:03,700
It was only one nanny and people react
differently to the death of a loved one

689
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:04,980
and, by the way,

690
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:10,650
this is the same nanny that Mr Williams
caught smoking drugs in her room, so...

691
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:26,120
No way!

692
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,620
No way!

693
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:29,440
Yes.

694
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:34,010
Yes, we can do that.

695
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:36,630
We'll wait for the report back
from the psychiatrist

696
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:38,800
and then we'll see
what to do after that.

697
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:43,870
I'm not going to a psychiatrist.

698
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:45,410
There's nothing wrong with me.

699
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:47,880
You have to.
We agreed to it.

700
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,020
You did.
I didn't.

701
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:52,640
I'm not going.

702
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:57,260
I have to get back to Billy

703
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:04,260
Dad...

704
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,340
who are those men?

705
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:07,830
They're the police.

706
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:09,480
Don't look.

707
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:30,360
Is there somebody outside?

708
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,050
No.

709
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,650
Dad..

710
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:42,020
What?

711
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:45,660
You'd never leave me, would you?

712
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:49,240
No. Of course not.

713
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:54,390
What if you die like Mammy,
what would happen to me then?

714
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:02,110
I'll never leave you, Billy.

715
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:04,530
Never.

716
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,370
And we'll always be together,
you and me.

717
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:09,990
Ok?

718
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:14,520
Right now, close your eyes.

719
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:56,040
Did you watch it?

720
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,770
No.

721
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:02,280
Would you...

722
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,990
would you watch it with me?

723
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:09,210
I'm afraid to watch it on my own.

724
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:11,840
Ok.

725
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:14,570
Ok.

726
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:17,430
Come watch on TV...

727
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,860
David... do you
remember calling me last night?

728
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:41,240
Last night?
No.

729
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:43,270
You did.

730
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:48,260
You were delirious, I
hardly recognised your voice.

731
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:53,720
You were crying.

732
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,350
You said...

733
01:17:58,810 --> 01:18:02,470
you wanted to
tell me something about Alice.

734
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:06,460
That wasn't me.
I didn't call you.

735
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:10,080
Sit down.

736
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:22,320
If you did hurt her, if you did do it,
maybe you should just...

737
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:27,970
get it over with...
go to the police.

738
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,330
I'll go with you if you want me to.

739
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:38,630
I'll tell them what a good
person you are.

740
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,420
I'll help you.

741
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:47,390
Clare they sacrificed children
in this room...

742
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,180
don't you know?

743
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:53,970
David what are you talking
about?

744
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:57,440
Baby's blood is the most
powerful, you see?

745
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:01,810
They would carry the bodies
from here through the sewer

746
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:03,870
and dump them in the canal.

747
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:06,040
In the canal!

748
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,880
They...
they thought of everything...

749
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,440
David, stop it, stop it!

750
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,000
Stop it...
look at me!

751
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:17,960
Did you kill Alice?

752
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:24,590
Just say you didn't do it...
look me in the eye

753
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:26,540
Say you didn't do it.

754
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:29,270
Say you didn't do it, please!

755
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:30,870
Just tell me!

756
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:34,380
Whatever you say,
I'll believe you.

757
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:39,430
Whatever you say, anything you say,
I'll believe you.

758
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,380
I'll believe you...

759
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:44,020
I'll believe you...

760
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:46,170
Just tell me...

761
01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:52,450
Just tell me...

762
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:54,880
Just tell me...

763
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:14,070
Just watch this.

764
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:16,500
Then you'll understand.

765
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:20,010
Yeah, we'll...
we'll watch this.

766
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:40,330
Ok there she is...
do you see her?

767
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:42,260
She's moving...

768
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:45,710
you see?

769
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:48,650
David...

770
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:51,510
there's nothing there.

771
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,890
Just wait...
there's more.

772
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,460
Ok... there...
there!

773
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:02,110
Do you see, there, look!

774
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:04,120
What is that there?

775
01:21:04,570 --> 01:21:07,440
She's moving toward us,
do you see her?

776
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,380
What is it?

777
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:16,600
Yes...
I see som...

778
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,100
You see it?

779
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,420
I see something--

780
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:21,610
I told you I'm telling the truth..

781
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:24,640
What is it?/
I'm not going insane!

782
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:25,680
Do you understand me...

783
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,810
look there!

784
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:28,260
What is it?

785
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:33,680
David...

786
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:35,780
David, turn it off!

787
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:37,880
Turn it off, what is it?

788
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,670
What is it?

789
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:49,410
David please!
No!

790
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:58,010
Nooo!!

791
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:01,350
Stop!!

792
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:04,290
Arrrrghhhh!!

793
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:21,450
What's up then?/
It wasn't me.

794
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:25,460
We saw him go into the house with a
woman, then we heard her screaming.

795
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:26,830
What have you done, David?

796
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:29,060
What have you done?

797
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:33,930
I didn't do it!

798
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:37,140
Open the door, David!

799
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:38,140
Mr Williams...

800
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:40,000
David!
Open the door!

801
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,600
Open the fucking door, David.

802
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:54,340
Upstairs!

803
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:00,630
David!

804
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:02,260
Come back!

805
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:04,420
Stop!

806
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:05,870
David!

807
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:11,370
Stop it...
stop it...

808
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:14,430
Look at me..

809
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:23,270
look!
Right, there she is.

810
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,390
There!
She's moving.

811
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:27,800
David..

812
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:30,310
there's nothing there..

813
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:32,280
There..
she's moving towards us...

814
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,710
Do you see her?

815
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:34,770
Look!

816
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:36,050
I want you to see her.

817
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:37,440
You can see her!

818
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,300
There's nothing there!

819
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:00,640
Go that way!

820
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:15,550
The master wants her.

821
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,020
Give her to him.

822
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:38,990
I couldn't help it../
You're a fucking whore!

823
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:41,640
David, I love you!/
You're a fucking whore!

824
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:42,850
That's what you are!

825
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:44,580
I didn't mean for this to
happen.

826
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:47,250
I need to leave,
I need to take Billy with me..

827
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:50,370
..No no, David, I'm sorry...

828
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,860
No no....

829
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:54,790
Fucking bitch!

830
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:58,300
David...

831
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:00,270
No, David!

832
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:01,570
Da...

833
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:03,740
David!

834
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:06,680
David!!

835
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,350
Euurgh!

836
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,820
Help!

837
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,360
David!

838
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:16,950
Aghh!

839
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,760
Alice...

840
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:48,020
Alice...

841
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,020
David....

842
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:11,900
Aggghhhh!

843
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:18,270
Arrrgghhh!

844
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,930
Arrrggghhhh!

845
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:56,340
Arrrgghhh!

846
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:12,970
You alright?

847
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:27,470
When's the first viewing,
then?

848
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:29,860
Next Monday.
Will that give you enough time?

849
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:33,280
Oh yes yes, the house will be
cleared by next Friday.

850
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,420
I don't want time wasters.

851
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:37,920
I only want serious people
looking at this house.

852
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,340
Of course.
I feel the same.

853
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:45,720
Nana, can I go inside and get
my dinosaur book?

854
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:47,230
Yes, yes

855
01:27:47,230 --> 01:27:50,220
Don't be long,
we're going now.

856
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:54,080
I have a list of appointments
already lined up for next week.

857
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:19,520
Billy...

858
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:21,940
Billy, over here!

859
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:25,050
It's Daddy...

860
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,290
I'm here with your mother.

861
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:37,760
Do you miss us?

862
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:44,670
Do you want to
stay here with us?

863
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:58,000
Do you want to stay here with
us forever?

864
01:28:58,430 --> 01:29:01,220
I love you Billy.

865
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,520
I love you.
