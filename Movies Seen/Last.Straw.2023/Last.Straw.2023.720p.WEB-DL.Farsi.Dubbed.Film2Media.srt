24
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,790
What the f...

25
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,417
I literally think about
that tweet every single day.

26
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,294
You are one of a kind, Tabs.

27
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,171
Thank you

28
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,133
What is that?

29
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,844
Fucking pregs.

30
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,011
What?

31
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,763
There's a creature

32
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,514
growing up inside me.

33
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,891
You're pregnant?

34
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,726
Yeah.

35
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:52,148
So, who's the daddy?

36
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,402
You slut.

37
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,947
- You don't know?
- No!

38
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,740
Um...

39
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,035
It's either the lacrosse player
with the unibrow...

40
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,787
- Mm-hmm.
- ...or...

41
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,290
it's the drunk guy with the big
arms and the baby dick.

42
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,877
Or it's the whisper man.

43
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,544
Who's the whisper man?

44
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,923
He had this, like, super deep
voice the whole party.

45
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,968
Mmm.

46
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:23,179
As soon as we started doing it,

47
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,098
he was all like...

48
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,518
"Oh, yeah, beat it up.
Oh, yeah."

49
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:30,145
"Oh, beat it..."

50
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,551
Okay, stop, stop. Give me that.

51
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,862
So, like, what are you
gonna do about it?

52
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,239
It sucks.

53
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,996
Kill it?

54
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,623
For real, Nancy?

55
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,250
I don't know.

56
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,129
- Did you tell your dad?
- Ew, no.

57
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,507
He'd kill me before I kill it.

58
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,471

Oh, thank God, Bobby.

79
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,193
Could you give me a lift?
I'm so late.

80
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,070
It's quarter to 9:00.
We're right on time.

81
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,781
The managers get there earlier.

82
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,240
Well, shit. Have fun.

00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,617
Oh, you think...

84
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,036
You're so cute, Bobby.

85
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,477
Oh God, I'm so tired.

86
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,031
He'll kill me.

87
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,408
Bag. Thanks, Bobby!

88
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,869
Because we know that we've paid,
I just...

89
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,455
I can't find it.
I'm gonna find it.

90
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,248
I'm gonna call you back,
all right?

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,127
Hey, you're late. Again.

92
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,213
I know. I know.

93
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,965
You're a manager now.

94
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,549
Co-workers need
to look up to you.

95
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,759
Ugh.

96
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,385
How are you gonna

97
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,346
put them in their place

98
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,324
if you don't know what place
you're supposed to be in

99
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,742
or time you're supposed
to be in it?

100
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,976
I got it.

101
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,518
Why are you so sweaty?

102
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,396
Because I had to walk here.

103
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,273
The monster's shot.

104
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,735
Mom's old car?

105
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,657
- The fucker died on me.
- How? What happened?

106
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,869
Was it transmission?
What did it sound like?

107
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,495
You think I know?

108
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,122
I'm sure it's gonna cost me

109
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,333
another two grand
to fix this piece of shit.

110
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,293
You think maybe it's time we...

111
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,297
Okay.

112
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,634
You're not gonna need it
tonight anyway,

113
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,220
because you are working
late shift.

114
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,347
What? No. Dad, I can't.

115
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,141
I don't want to hear it.

116
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,726
I was gonna go to a graduation
party with Tabs.

117
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,521
You realize you graduated
like over a year ago.

118
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,982
Why you still hang out with
high schoolers is beyond me.

119
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,608
This is so not fair.

120
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,153
Well, sorry,
there's a bug going around.

121
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,238
So, it is down to you and Jake.

122
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,073
So, you're leaving me
with the freak.

123
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,660
Can you at least let Bobby stay?

124
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,703
No. I do not feel comfortable

125
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,497
leaving you and Bobby
alone together.

126
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,100
But you feel comfortable
leaving me and Jake together?

127
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,625
Uh-huh.

128
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,729
- Are you for real?
- Hey, can you help me out here?

129
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,212
I'm up to my neck in bills.

130
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,548
I cannot pay overtime
to Bobby or anyone else.

131
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,259
And Jake is... he's trusted here.

132
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,305
Probably gonna be dead anyway,

133
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,182
but even if we had
two customers,

134
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,101
it'll be worth it,
so it is happening.

135
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,978
Where are you gonna be? Hmm?

136
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,691
I've got plans.

137
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,568
Hmm.

138
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,487
Can you take the onions upstairs
and, you know,

139
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,033
just grow some balls
and be a manager?

140
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,534
I don't want balls.

141
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,661
Why do I need balls
to run this place?

142
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,538
I meant the figurative balls.

143
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,381
You okay?

144
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:55,470
Yeah, I'm working
the late shift with Jake.

145
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,513
I can stay, you know,

146
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,224
even if you don't pay me
or whatever.

147
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,979
Heard there's a party tonight.

148
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,688
I think it's at Max's.

149
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,359
- You know, that's actually...
- I was blackout drunk.

150
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,525
Don't remember a thing.

151
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,753
Just a minute.

152
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,139
- What the fuck you eat, girl?
- Jesus! Jake.

153
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,767
Go away.

154
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,352
You don't look good.

155
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,522
You never look good.

156
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,612
Are you pregnant?

157
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,284
Nancy out here?

158
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,119
- Hey.
- Hey.

159
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,830
- What the fuck?
- Uh, just-just bad meat.

160
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,623
Just made her sick.
That's my bad.

161
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,434
I should have dumped it
properly, I'm sorry.

162
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,669
Okay, wait, is the freezer
on the fritz again?

163
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,504
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

164
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,924
Okay, I'm gonna go
take a look at that.

165
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,885
Grab a hose and make this
go away, and then I'm gonna go.

166
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,221
So, just you know,
if you need me, text me, okay?

167
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,973
Good luck on your big date, boss.

168
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,599
Big date, huh?

169
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,187
Your father has needs, too.

170
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,604
God, I'm gonna be sick again.

171
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,983
Thank you.

172
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,319
Sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

173
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,572
Hey, could you whip me up
one of your slamming sammies

174
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,865
before I leave?

175
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,283
My honor.

176
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,617
I'll be right in.

177
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,539
Fuck.

178
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,630
<i>Jake's gonna be here tonight.</i>

179
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,718
- But in case it gets busy...
- It won't.

180
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,176
In case it does.

181
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,970
In here you got your cold cuts,

182
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,055
stuff for sandwiches, burgers.

183
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,225
Anyone want something sloppy,

184
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,062
you got the blender thing here,
chef's knives.

185
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,772
You know, ah!

186
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,736
Once this deep fryer gets going,
things will get really wild.

187
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,030
All right, thanks.
You know what?

188
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,908
Do me a favor tonight.
Just make sure...

189
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,036
Nancy?

190
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,539
Bobby, I don't care
about any of this.

191
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,834
Well, what about
the meat hammers?

192
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,961
So, you can beat the meat.

193
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,963
Yeah, I bet you love
beating the meat.

194
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,676
Uh, I heard you were
feeling shitty.

195
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,597
So, you're actually sick?
Or, like, you know...

196
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,363
Order 13, you're up.

197
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,577
Thank you.

198
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,751
And make sure to bring
that fat bottom

199
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,795
back to Fat Bottom Bistro
again soon.

200
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,171
Yep. Have a good one.

201
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,224
"Make sure to bring
that fat bottom

202
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,725
back to Fat Bottom Bistro
again."

203
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,477
Fuck.

204
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,939
Your dad is, like,
the top five scariest people

205
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,356
I've ever met.

206
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,942
Yeah, he's all talk.

207
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,444
- Deep down he's just a big old...
- Teddy bear?

208
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,239
- I was gonna say pussy.
- Miss Nancy Osborne!

209
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,700
You got a potty mouth on you.

210
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,869
You should wash that out
with soap.

211
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,413
Thanks, but no thanks, Jake.

212
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,083
I'd rather not star
in your weird fetish fantasies.

213
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,752
Don't worry, we got all night
to play together.

214
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,879
- You and I are working...
- The overnight, yes.

215
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,465
And please don't ever
say "play" again.

216
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,342
Don't look so excited.

217
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,486
I'd rather rip out all my hair
than work the night with you.

218
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,262
You're breaking my heart.

219
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,833
Oh my God, I'm...
I'm so sorry, Nancy.

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,585
- Don't worry, Pete.
- I'll clean up now, Nancy.

221
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,670
It's cool, it was an accident.

222
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,716
Shit.

223
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,345
I got it. Fuck.

224
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,723
It's fine. Just fucking stay.

225
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,771
Hey!

226
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,773
Hey, what are you
douchebags doing?

227
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,482
Playing with our new friend.

228
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,819
- Did you kill that?
- We found him like that.

229
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,905
He's lying. I killed it.

230
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,115
Can you guys get the fuck
out of here with that?

231
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,282
Yo, aren't you
that college chick

232
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,785
who hangs
with Max and his crew?

233
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,637
- I didn't know you worked here.
- Mm.

234
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,661
Yeah, she owns the place.

235
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,782
Is it named after you?

236
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,959
- Get it? Because Fat Bottom?
- Suck my dick, get it?

237
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,460
Hey!

238
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,213
That's not how a lady
should be talking.

239
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:23,964
Go play in traffic,

240
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:24,965
- needle dick.
- Whoa.

241
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:25,548
Whoa.

242
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,665
- Yeah!
- She gave us the finger.

243
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:35,268
- Everything okay?
- I handled it, Captain America.

244
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,479
Damn it.

245
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,441
Petey!

246
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,818
There's a spill, Nancy.

247
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,235
Thank you.

248
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,154
Do you mind
cleaning it up finally?

249
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,283
Don't be riding
on my brother like that.

250
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,994
- Not now, Jake.
- I'm serious. Leave him alone.

251
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,038
- He's a spaz.
- Oh.

252
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,486
Really? I didn't know Petey
was a fucking spaz, thank you.

253
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,792
Sorry.

254
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,670
Nice.

255
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:04,130
I'll go explain that one to him.

256
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,760
I told them to leave.

257
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,013
It's fine. I got it.

258
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,057
I want fries!

259
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,142
- Listen up, jerkoffs...
- Who? Us?

260
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,062
- No, we're not the jerkoffs.
- Can you cut it out, assholes?

261
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,856
Wait, I thought
we were jerkoffs.

262
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,066
Are we jerkoffs or assholes?

263
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,693
- Can you just fucking stop it?
- It's a simple question.

264
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,112
Would you rather we jerk off

265
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,738
or stick something
up your asshole?

266
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,198
You are disgusting.

267
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,325
Get the fuck out.
I'm serious, leave.

268
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,618
We're paying customers.

269
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,105
We're not gonna serve you!

270
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,122
I guess we'll serve ourselves.

271
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,915
I'm calling the cops.

272
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,082
Fuck the cops!

273
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,967
What's going on?

274
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,844
They're giving us a hard time.

275
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,054
Oh, shit.
They bring that shit in here?

276
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,848
Are you seriously gonna laugh?

277
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,557
- What are you doing?
- Hi, yes.

278
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,601
I need you to send over
a cop now, please.

279
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,122
You're not seriously calling the
cops on them right now, are you?

280
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:04,190
Yes, Fat Bottom Bistro on 9.
I got a bunch of imbeciles.

281
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,109
They're being abusive
and they won't leave.

282
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,612
See you in 10 minutes.

283
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,947
Thank you so much.

284
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,454
Well, I called them.
They're on their way.

285
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,207
Bullshit.

286
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,046
Why don't you wait and see?

287
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,576
I would leave if I were you.

288
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,161
I ordered fries.

289
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:01,915
You know what?

290
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,126
Hold them for me.

291
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,254
I'll be back later.

292
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,092
That's a fucking promise.

293
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,822
Everyone, kitchen, now!

294
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,742
I know that I may be younger
than most of you,

295
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,119
but I am the manager.

296
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,248
And so, when I do something,

297
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,291
when I make a decision,

298
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,770
I don't want to hear it
from anyone.

299
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,004
Come on, Nancy.

300
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,463
Come on what?

301
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,590
- Am I not the manager?
- Yeah.

302
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:54,425
Because your dad
owns the place.

303
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,386
That's the only reason
you're standing there

304
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,054
rather than any of us.

305
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,056
- Except Petey.
- Sorry.

306
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,017
- Shut up, Jake.
- No, I'm serious.

307
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,410
You act like
you're all high and mighty

308
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,395
but you're from the same
Podunk town as us, okay?

309
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,438
Your shit smells
just as much as mine.

310
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,941
- I seriously doubt that.
- I'm sick of you.

311
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,788
- Your dad leaves five seconds...
- Enough!

312
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:12,819
- No.
- Yes!

313
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,155
- Dude, cut it out.
- Okay.

314
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,133
Just let your girlfriend speak
for herself, little boy.

315
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,157
She's not my girlfriend.

316
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,302
Okay, that's it.
I've had enough.

317
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,911
What are you gonna do?

318
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,157
You gonna defend her honor?

319
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,329
You're fired!

320
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,498
Who?

321
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,501
You, Jake.

322
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,254
Oh.

323
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,463
You're fired.

324
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,049
But I'm a legacy.

325
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,592
A what?

326
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,179
You know my mom
was your folks' first hire

327
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,806
when they opened this place?

328
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,559
Okay? Your dad, he did right
by me and Petey

329
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,687
- by bringing us in...
- This is why we're losing money.

330
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:51,482
We've got more employees
than customers.

331
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:52,943
Well, you can't fire me.

332
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,152
- Really?
- Yeah.

333
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,988
Because I think I already did.

334
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:00,951
This is fucking horseshit.

335
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,120
Who's gonna work the late shift?

336
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,455
I don't know yet.

337
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,832
I'll do it myself.

338
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,750
That's not the point, Bobby.

339
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,045
And you're still here.

340
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,300
Petey's my ride.

341
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,467
Sorry.

342
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,056
Then go wait
in the fucking parking lot.

343
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,756
What do you want, Bobby?

344
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,508
I-I was just trying
to see if you were okay.

345
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,011
And if you wanted me to work
the late shift with you?

346
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,929
Oh my God, you don't get it
either, do you?

347
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,806
I don't want you here.

348
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,349
Yeah, y-you're right. Of course.

349
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:09,060
Look, Bobby, you're a nice guy.

350
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,187
You are. But you're never
gonna get with me.

351
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,523
- Well, technically...
- Got it?

352
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,858
Got it.

353
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,777
Do I need to be more clear?

354
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,195
Great. Now, fuck off.

355
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,245
Vile.

356
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,704
Oh, God.

357
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,334
Sorry, buddy.

358
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,615
I'll see you tomorrow.

359
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,202
Fuck.

360
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,260
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

361
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,053
I'm not interrupting anything,
am I?

362
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,932
No, no, just cleaning up.
What's happening?

363
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,351
<i>Dad, you don't have to hide
anything from me.</i>

364
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,523
Well, I just, uh, don't want
to make you uncomfortable

365
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,233
with my dating life.

366
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,153
Yeah, well,
maybe don't call it that.

367
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:27,323
<i>You know I'll always
love your mother, right?</i>

368
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,826
I fired Jake.

369
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,246
<i>Excuse me?</i>

370
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,581
Yeah, I had to, okay?

371
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,334
You told me to take charge,
and so I did.

372
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,711
- I had to do what I had to do.
- That's not what I...

373
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:43,423
- Was that really necessary?
<i>- Yes.</i>

374
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,425
<i>You weren't there.
You wouldn't understand.</i>

375
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,135
Okay, I'm gonna
deal with this later.

376
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,220
But what the fuck, Nancy?
Come on.

377
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:50,764
<i>I'm working here alone.</i>

378
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:54,142
Yeah, you...
you can handle that, right?

379
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,478
<i>- Right?</i>
- Yeah, of course.

380
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,939
Is that even a question?

381
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,066
You don't sound
very confident to me.

382
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:04,820
<i>You probably
won't get anyone anyway.</i>

383
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,325
- So why do I have to be here?
<i>- You know why?</i>

384
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,161
<i>Because the lights
are on a timer.</i>

385
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:15,121
- What?
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

386
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:18,750
<i>The sign, the outdoor lights,
they're on a timer.</i>

387
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:20,168
<i>They go off at sunrise.</i>

388
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:21,795
<i>I had this system put in
last week.</i>

389
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:24,714
<i>So, somebody has to be there
while the lights are on.</i>

390
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:27,092
And so, that's why
I'm stuck here?

391
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,258
<i>Yeah.</i>

392
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,719
<i>And if somebody shows up,</i>

393
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:30,886
<i>you need to be there.</i>

394
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:33,932
<i>Hey.</i>

395
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,309
<i>You're a manager now,
so act like one.</i>

396
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:41,564
All right, well,
you enjoy your whatever.

397
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:42,774
I love you.

398
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,276
Hello?

399
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:49,781
Sorry about that.

400
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,200
Cheers.

Fuck.

429
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:58,344
Listen up, assholes.
I'm not messing around, okay?

430
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:02,473
I called the cops once.
I will call them again.

431
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,546
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

432
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:35,298
I'm at the Fat Bottom Bistro
on 9.

433
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:36,883
I got these kids harassing me.

434
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,634
<i>Okay, ma'am,
I've got your location.</i>

435
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,762
<i>- Who am I speaking with?</i>
- This is Nancy.

436
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:44,265
My dad is Edward Osborne.
We own the place.

437
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,977
I got these kids
and they're fucking banging

438
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:48,478
on the fucking windows and shit.

439
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,646
And they were here earlier.

440
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,482
I know they're trying
to scare me.

441
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,317
<i>Are they armed
or have they physically</i>

442
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:56,652
<i>made contact with you
or hurt you in any way?</i>

443
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,240
No. But it wouldn't hurt to send
somebody to help, right?

444
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:05,036
- I'm all alone here.
<i>- Ma'am, I can send someone out,</i>

445
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:07,247
<i>but all the units are tied up
at the moment.</i>

446
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,750
<i>I can't give you an exact PTA,
but I can send someone</i>

447
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,627
<i>- as soon as they're available.</i>
- Are you fucking kidding me?

448
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,545
<i>Ma'am, I can stay
on the phone with you</i>

449
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:16,506
<i>until someone can get
out there. Can you...</i>

450
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:19,968
Hello?

451
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,013
Fuck.

452
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,629
Fuck this.

453
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,772
What the fuck is going on?

454
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:28,411
What do you want from me?

455
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,166
Disgusting fucking freaks.

456
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:37,169
Shit.

457
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,883
Why are you doing this to me?

458
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,176
Damn!

459
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:54,938
Where is my phone?

460
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,609
How is this happening?

461
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,737
Oh, thank God.

462
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:08,618
Help me!

463
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:11,246
- Missy, back away from the door!
- Get in here!

464
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:13,289
Back away!

465
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:14,456
Please...

466
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:18,169
- Unlock the door.
- Why didn't you just say that?

467
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:21,381
All right, you just calm down.
Take it easy now.

468
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,508
They're out there
and they're messing with me.

469
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:27,529
- Why are your lights off?
- I don't know.

470
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,765
I think they fucking
cut the power or something.

471
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,480
Oh. I didn't realize
they fucking...

472
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:40,691
That was easy.
What seems to be the problem?

473
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:43,111
There's a bunch
of fucking teenagers,

474
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:44,946
and they're scaring
the shit out of me.

475
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,324
You here all alone?

476
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:49,575
Yes!

477
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,119
Why are you all by yourself?

478
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:54,205
Does that really matter
right now?

479
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:02,672
Did you hear anything
I just said?

480
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,178
Yup. A bunch of kids.

481
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:12,598
Do you feel like
you're in danger?

482
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:14,475
Enough that I called you guys.

483
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:26,780
Yeah, right.

484
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:31,409
You have no idea the business
you just took me from,

485
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:32,660
little lady.

486
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:33,954
I don't.

487
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,375
Can I have...

488
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:42,087
a cup of coffee?

489
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:45,506
Are you fucking serious?

490
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,461
Hey, there,
this is Sheriff Brooks

491
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,421
down at the Fat Bottom Bistro.

492
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:27,048
<i>Go ahead, Sheriff.</i>

493
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:31,928
Yeah, I think it might have been
some kids messing around.

494
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,655
Kind of worried
that it might be a bunch

495
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:35,348
that we were looking for.

496
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:37,558
But as soon as I got here,
they jetted away.

497
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,854
<i>Ten-four. Are you going clear?</i>

498
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:44,274
I could use a breather.

499
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:47,235
I'm gonna stick around here
for a bit.

500
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:48,820
Make sure she's okay.

501
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:53,366
Let me know when they need me
back there, okay?

502
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:54,951
<i>Copy that, Sheriff.</i>

503
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,038
How about that coffee?

504
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:07,379
So?

505
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:13,386
That's a little bitter.

506
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:15,972
I'm talking about the kids
that are terrorizing me

507
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,516
at every fucking moment,
and I can't get rid of them.

508
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:21,144
There's nobody out there.
At least not right now, anyway.

509
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:23,604
They were here earlier.

510
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,231
I can tell you
what they look like.

511
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:27,025
What I want to do
is take a statement,

512
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:28,651
see what you can give me.

513
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:29,903
Then I'll hang for a bit.

514
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:36,492
Can I get some milk and sugar?

515
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:46,962
You got no idea how nice it is
to sit for a sec.

516
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:52,968
Can you please not?

517
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,178
- Not what?
- Rape me with your fucking eyes.

518
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:57,097
- Excuse me?
- Instead of sitting there,

519
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:58,723
staring at my ass,

520
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,977
why don't you get off yours
and actually go do something?

521
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:02,977
You listen here, little lady.

522
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:04,814
I already told you like 10 times

523
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,231
that they were here earlier

524
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:07,541
and they were
banging on the windows.

525
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:09,442
They stole my phone
and they were driving

526
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,527
these stupid fucking mopeds.

527
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:13,864
- They were wearing these masks.
- Hold on a second.

528
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,615
Did you say mopeds?

529
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,117
Yeah, and?

530
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:21,305
Come with me. Let's go outside
to the squad car.

531
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:24,082
Please tell me what is going on.

532
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:26,001
Seriously, you're scaring me.

533
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:28,754
Listen, I don't mean
to scare you,

534
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,815
but I'm gonna be honest
with you right now, okay?

535
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,340
- Please.
- I just came

536
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,300
from one of the most
horrific murders

537
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:36,261
I've ever witnessed,
and whoever did it,

538
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:39,765
they got away on some kind
of dirt bikes or mopeds.

539
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:41,682
- Wait, are you serious?
- Yeah.

540
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,601
They're here?

541
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:44,853
Go, go, go!

542
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,272
No! No!

543
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,096
Oh, Bobby.

544
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:05,225
Fuck.

545
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:11,106
Bobby, what the fuck
are you doing here?

546
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:12,858
I'm sorry about
what happened earlier.

547
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:17,653
- Are you okay?
- Give me your phone.

548
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:24,995
- Who are you calling?
- My dad.

549
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:28,456
<i>Hey, it's Edward.</i>

550
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:30,834
<i>- I'm not here. Leave a message.</i>
- Fuck. Damn it.

551
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,441
Let's call the cops.

552
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:46,242
Hey! Over here!

553
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:20,568
No!

554
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,403
Get the fuck off me!

555
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:29,327
This is... this isn't happening...

556
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:08,699
What the fuck do you want?

557
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:22,297
No!

558
00:40:26,843 --> 00:40:28,219
Fuck off!

559
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:29,470
Ah!

560
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:40,273
No! Please don't!

561
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:42,108
Ah!

562
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:47,405
You don't have to do this.

563
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,451
No!

564
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:23,984
What the fuck.

565
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,069
What the fuck, Petey!
What did you do?

566
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:27,946
Why are you here?

567
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:31,116
Fuck, Pete!

568
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:34,702
What the fuck?
What the fuck did you guys do?

569
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,246
What the fuck is going on?

570
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:39,374
You! No, you...
you knew this?

571
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:42,377
You did this?

572
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:43,543
How could you?

573
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:48,049
What the fuck!

574
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,468
What is wrong with you?

575
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,225
And you're still here.

576
00:41:58,769 --> 00:41:59,978
Why?

577
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:02,730
Petey's my ride.

578
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:05,525
Sorry.

579
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:07,735
Then go wait
in the fucking parking lot.

580
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:10,530
Look, Nancy, I...
I really need this job, okay?

581
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:13,992
I got bills,
and I got insurance,

582
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:16,077
and my prescription, and shit.

583
00:42:16,244 --> 00:42:18,704
You should have thought
of that before you mouthed off.

584
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:20,540
I'm really sorry.
I won't do it again.

585
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:22,000
You're not getting it.

586
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:23,501
You're done.

587
00:42:23,668 --> 00:42:25,336
- What if...
- Leave.

588
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:36,431
The rest of you,
get back to your shift.

589
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:02,707
4-9-3-4-U...

590
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:06,544
0-3-8-2-4.

591
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:08,629
I just need a refill.

592
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:12,092
Yeah, I do, I have at least
two refills left for this month.

593
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:16,637
Okay, well, how about we talk to
someone else that could help me?

594
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:18,514
They told me I should
talk to you guys.

595
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:19,682
I need a refill.

596
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,184
When is she coming in?

597
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:23,079
Because she's the one I usually
deal with over there

598
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:25,063
and I don't really
deal with anybody else.

599
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,023
I just called my insurance!

600
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,400
<i>I know that's not how it works.
I know how it works.</i>

601
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:30,807
<i>I know
I've never paid you back,</i>

602
00:43:30,902 --> 00:43:32,171
<i>but I'm gonna pay you back
this time.</i>

603
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:33,905
I just need it for, like,
three weeks.

604
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:36,616
<i>I'm talking like 50 bucks,
Uncle Greg.</i>

605
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:38,243
<i>Like, this is nothing.</i>

606
00:44:01,724 --> 00:44:03,393
So, what are we doing?

607
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:05,103
Going home.

608
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:06,897
You still mad at me, Bobby?

609
00:44:07,063 --> 00:44:09,125
Do you have to be
such a dickhead all the time?

610
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:10,400
I do. it's in my nature.

611
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:14,237
- That's theft.
- No, it ain't.

612
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:16,489
I saved up two months
out of pocket for this

613
00:44:16,656 --> 00:44:18,717
- as an investment in this place.
- Sure. I believe you.

614
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:20,101
Jesus Christ.
Will you guys shut up

615
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,037
so we can go get drunk already?

616
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,915
Yeah, as long as I can bitch
about you know who.

617
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:26,624
You ever do anything else?

618
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:28,794
- You in, Petey?
- Are you in, Jake?

619
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,046
- Yeah, I'm in, buddy.
- Okay then, I'm in as well.

620
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:34,257
Bobby?

621
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:35,759
I really don't feel like it.

622
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:39,846
What are you gonna do?

623
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:42,808
What, you gonna go home
and choke yourself

624
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:44,267
to pics of Nancy?

625
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:46,227
You gonna go tickle that pickle?

626
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:48,021
Why, you want to watch?

627
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:52,358
Not tonight.

628
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:55,278
Yeah, whatever.
I'll, uh, see you there.

629
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:57,238
Okay, he'll see us there.

630
00:44:58,406 --> 00:44:59,783
Grab that, Petey.

631
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:07,040
- How was your shift, bud?
- It was good.

632
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:09,751
Good, I need you to make a left
out of here today.

633
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:33,441
How's it hanging, Jake?

634
00:45:33,608 --> 00:45:36,444
A little to the left, you know,
but I ain't complaining.

635
00:45:36,611 --> 00:45:38,279
- You got the stuff?
- You got the money?

636
00:45:38,446 --> 00:45:41,574
- Mm-hmm.
- Show me.

637
00:45:41,741 --> 00:45:43,451
Show me yours,
I'll show you mine.

638
00:45:45,328 --> 00:45:46,872
Give it to Petey.

639
00:45:47,038 --> 00:45:48,539
Where's the money?

640
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:52,502
Hey, Pete,
you get any tips today?

641
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:56,965
I didn't get any
from the front of house.

642
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:00,551
You know, man,
I only got a dime to my name,

643
00:46:00,718 --> 00:46:02,595
but I need some medicine.

644
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:05,640
So, how's about I just get you
next time?

645
00:46:07,225 --> 00:46:08,225
Sound good?

646
00:46:09,227 --> 00:46:10,812
Drive, Petey. Go.

647
00:46:16,234 --> 00:46:17,652
That feels good, Petey.

648
00:46:23,574 --> 00:46:25,160
You know, drugs,
they get a bad rap,

649
00:46:25,326 --> 00:46:27,328
but drugs ain't done nothing
but help me.

650
00:46:27,495 --> 00:46:29,247
<i>People talking
about gateway drugs</i>

651
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:30,748
<i>don't tell you
what the biggest...</i>

652
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:35,170
Biggest gateway drug there is.

653
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:39,758
That's motherfucking trauma.

654
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:48,599
<i>I mean, you fucking know it,
Petey.</i>

655
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:51,186
You come home and find our mom
just dead on the floor.

656
00:46:51,352 --> 00:46:54,564
The woman who raised you,
made you feel whole.

657
00:46:57,776 --> 00:46:58,944
Eh?

658
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:02,589
They think they're gonna do
the business they do without me?

659
00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:04,991
Nobody makes the slamming
sammies like I do.

660
00:47:05,158 --> 00:47:07,828
That's mama's recipe.

661
00:47:07,994 --> 00:47:09,955
I was gonna help run that place.
I know it.

662
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:11,622
I've just been
trying to find a time

663
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,416
to talk to Mr. Osborne about it.

664
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:15,293
He's just a hard man
to pin down.

665
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,796
I mean, I got ideas, you know.
I'm a man with a plan.

666
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:19,547
I'm a man with a plan.

667
00:47:19,714 --> 00:47:21,842
And she fucking
just dumped me like that?

668
00:47:22,008 --> 00:47:24,260
She can't just
fucking dump me like that.

669
00:47:24,427 --> 00:47:25,887
No, sir.

670
00:47:26,721 --> 00:47:28,765
She cannot
just fire me like that.

671
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,434
She can't just
fire me like that.

672
00:47:31,601 --> 00:47:34,771
You can't just fucking fire me
like that.

673
00:47:36,564 --> 00:47:39,150
You remember that little brat
running up and down that diner?

674
00:47:39,317 --> 00:47:42,403
And now she finds herself
just fucking running that place!

675
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:43,738
Huh?

676
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:46,616
Pete, pull over.

677
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:48,576
Oh! Oh! Pete, Pete, pull...

678
00:47:48,743 --> 00:47:49,953
Pull the truck over!

679
00:47:54,499 --> 00:47:56,042
- Chug it.
- Here we go.

680
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:57,460
Don't choke, don't choke.

681
00:47:57,627 --> 00:47:58,711
Empty it.

682
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:00,171
Holy...

683
00:48:00,338 --> 00:48:02,632
That's not it.

684
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:05,593
This is my beer, baby.

685
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:06,970
First beer.

686
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:08,930
Hey.

687
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:10,390
What are you all doing?

688
00:48:10,556 --> 00:48:11,975
You guys remember us?

689
00:48:12,934 --> 00:48:14,978
You're the guy who works
at the fat pussy place.

690
00:48:15,145 --> 00:48:16,855
Oh, yeah! The fat pussycat!

691
00:48:17,022 --> 00:48:19,024
- Yeah, not anymore.
- What the...

692
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,067
Okay.

693
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:24,029
You want to smoke some crack?

694
00:48:24,195 --> 00:48:26,197
Uh, no.

695
00:48:26,364 --> 00:48:28,992
Shit's for losers, man.

696
00:48:30,493 --> 00:48:31,870
What the fuck?

697
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:34,915
You little shits are funny.

698
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:38,543
Motor around
doing comedy acts

699
00:48:38,709 --> 00:48:40,879
like the one you did earlier
is fucking hilarious.

700
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:42,756
- Funny. I'm funny, right?
- Sure are.

701
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:44,632
Yeah, funny to a Mongoloid.

702
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,509
What'd you call my brother?

703
00:48:53,224 --> 00:48:54,684
Y'all want to hear a joke?

704
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:57,437
Go ahead, bro. Tell us a joke.

705
00:49:00,481 --> 00:49:03,484
What did the farmer say
when he lost his tractor?

706
00:49:05,862 --> 00:49:07,447
I don't know. What'd he say?

707
00:49:10,366 --> 00:49:11,701
"Where's my tractor?"

708
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,581
Oh, it's so...

709
00:49:17,582 --> 00:49:20,168
stupid it's actually kind of
funny if you think about it.

710
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:22,146
I know, right? It's like
the farmer lost his tractor

711
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,839
like I lost my job.

712
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,382
Because of you little twats.

713
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:29,594
What'd you call us?

714
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:33,807
I said you twats
got me fired today...

715
00:49:36,684 --> 00:49:38,228
because of your shenanigans.

716
00:49:38,394 --> 00:49:39,479
Hmm.

717
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:45,318
Who the fuck says...

718
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:48,738
Yo.

719
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:50,490
Yo, Jackson.

720
00:49:50,656 --> 00:49:51,992
- Yo!
- Get the fuck back!

721
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:53,385
- Get back, motherfucker!
- Whoa! Okay!

722
00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:54,428
- Get back!
- You fucking stabbed him!

723
00:49:54,452 --> 00:49:55,452
Get back!

724
00:49:56,662 --> 00:49:57,789
He'll be fine.

725
00:49:57,956 --> 00:49:59,332
- He's not fucking fine!
- Shut up!

726
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:00,876
Shut the fuck up!

727
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:02,127
Get on your knees!

728
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:05,005
Get on your fucking knees!

729
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:13,221
Petey, hey, hold this.

730
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:18,309
You shoot them if they move,
all right?

731
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:20,771
All right, all right,
you little mother...

732
00:50:20,937 --> 00:50:23,314
No, no, no!

733
00:50:23,481 --> 00:50:26,151
Fucking die already!

734
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:32,824
You stay here, okay?
You keep your gun on them, okay?

735
00:50:40,373 --> 00:50:44,127
<i>♪ And proudly wear it
Around my neck ♪</i>

736
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:47,881

00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:52,510
<i>♪ Whatever happened

738
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:56,556
You want to stand up?

739
00:50:56,722 --> 00:50:58,183
Okay, you two stand.

740
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:02,562
You're good. You stay there.

741
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:06,775
I want you to dance.

742
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:08,026
What?

743
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,110
Dance.

744
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:11,947
- How?
- How?

745
00:51:12,113 --> 00:51:13,489
I don't know.

746
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:15,241
Just feel the music, brother.

747
00:51:15,408 --> 00:51:16,409
Yeah.

748
00:51:16,576 --> 00:51:17,660
Come on.

749
00:51:18,703 --> 00:51:19,704
Dance, come on.

750
00:51:19,871 --> 00:51:21,122
Come on, you can dance.

751
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:23,166
Good, good. Now dance together.

752
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,918
Dance with each other.

753
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:27,295
Dance with each other, yeah.
Good. Good.

754
00:51:27,462 --> 00:51:29,172
Get close, get close.

755
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:32,258
That's good, yeah. Good.

756
00:51:32,425 --> 00:51:34,427
You guys are fucking
terrible dancers, come on.

757
00:51:34,594 --> 00:51:36,137
Fuck you, you lame fuck!

758
00:51:36,304 --> 00:51:37,096
If you're gonna shoot us,
just shoot us!

759
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:37,973
Shut the fuck up!

760
00:51:37,974 --> 00:51:40,016
Petey, come here. Come here.

761
00:51:40,183 --> 00:51:41,977
Petey, get the fuck over here.
Come here.

762
00:51:42,143 --> 00:51:43,353
Shoot him.

763
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,858
No, no, no, no. No, Jake. No.

764
00:51:48,024 --> 00:51:50,944
It's okay. Be a good brother.
Do it for me, okay? Shoot him.

765
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:53,029
- But...
- Hey! You got a dick?

766
00:51:53,196 --> 00:51:55,031
- Yes, I...
- Look at me. Look at me.

767
00:51:55,198 --> 00:51:56,518
- Do you have a dick?
- Yes, I do.

768
00:51:56,657 --> 00:51:59,119
Yeah? You do?
Okay, so you're a man, right?

769
00:51:59,285 --> 00:52:00,871
- Right.
- So you're a man? Okay, good.

770
00:52:01,037 --> 00:52:02,705
So be a man with a plan like me,

771
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:03,705
and shoot him
in the fucking head.

772
00:52:03,706 --> 00:52:04,958
But... but...

773
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,435
Stand up for yourself, Petey!

774
00:52:06,459 --> 00:52:08,169
Look at me.
Come on, stand up for yourself.

775
00:52:08,336 --> 00:52:10,005
He called you
a fucking Mongoloid.

776
00:52:10,171 --> 00:52:12,011
- I didn't mean it!
- Shut the fuck up!

777
00:52:12,173 --> 00:52:13,842
He called you
a fucking Mongoloid!

778
00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:15,761
Go, you motherfucker!

779
00:52:15,927 --> 00:52:19,139
Fuck! God! Motherfucker!

780
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:20,598
Oh! Fuck!

781
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:25,103
Fucking bitch!

782
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,355
Fuck you! Fuck you!

783
00:52:58,594 --> 00:53:00,430
Stop crying, you little idiot.

784
00:53:00,596 --> 00:53:01,765
Get out.

785
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:03,391
What's that, Jake?

786
00:53:04,392 --> 00:53:07,478
Get out of the car, okay?
This is your fault.

787
00:53:07,645 --> 00:53:09,480
All right, look at me.
Look at me, all right?

788
00:53:09,647 --> 00:53:11,316
I'm driving. Get out.

789
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:13,734
- Get out!
- All right.

790
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:15,779
Hey, take this, okay?

791
00:53:15,946 --> 00:53:17,530
All right, take this.

792
00:53:17,697 --> 00:53:19,908
Wait for me at the diner.

793
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:34,255
The whole night at Max's,
she was just touching my arm

794
00:53:34,422 --> 00:53:36,257
and, like, laughing
at all my jokes.

795
00:53:36,424 --> 00:53:39,135
It... It's dumb. She was...

796
00:53:39,302 --> 00:53:41,679
Dude, if I have to listen
to you talk about Nancy

797
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:43,887
for one more second,
I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.

798
00:53:44,015 --> 00:53:45,225
I'm just saying it's like...

799
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,770
we just had this really
good night, I guess.

800
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:50,772
She's only a chick man.

801
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:52,190
Relax.

802
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:53,357
Yeah.

803
00:53:54,192 --> 00:53:55,944
You try to make her jealous?

804
00:53:58,113 --> 00:53:59,614
Just fuck one of her friends.

805
00:53:59,781 --> 00:54:03,284
I'm not gonna have sex
with one of her friends.

806
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:06,037
- Fuck her mom then.
- Her mom's dead, asshole.

807
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:08,456
That's fucked up.

808
00:54:08,623 --> 00:54:10,000
Fuck!

809
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:14,170
Christ!

810
00:54:14,337 --> 00:54:16,631
- Yeah, okay, get off me.
- You need to see your face.

811
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:18,558
It looks like your brother
shit some puppies.

812
00:54:18,716 --> 00:54:20,111
- Go fuck yourself, Jake.
- Where you been?

813
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:21,552
Playing with some new toys.

814
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,276
Where'd you get these?

815
00:54:36,442 --> 00:54:38,820
Me and Petey jacked them
from those dimwit teens.

816
00:54:38,987 --> 00:54:41,447
Oh, hell yeah.
Let's ride, baby.

817
00:54:41,614 --> 00:54:43,699
- No way.
- Oh, shut the fuck up, Bobby.

818
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:46,077
- Come on, we've been drinking.
- Come on, Bobby.

819
00:54:46,244 --> 00:54:49,247
They're just mopeds.
Just don't be a pussy.

820
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:52,500
Look, just hop in, all right?

821
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:54,710
We'll ride them, then we'll
just... just dump them.

822
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:14,564
You don't sound
very confident to me.

823
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:43,593
So, uh, where are we gonna go?

824
00:55:46,304 --> 00:55:47,555
I got an idea.

825
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:50,851
Famous last words, boys.

826
00:56:00,026 --> 00:56:01,111
What are these for?

827
00:57:00,796 --> 00:57:01,880
Fuck.

828
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:07,886
Petey. Petey, come here.
Come here. Come here.

829
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:09,637
Get the fuck over here.
Come on.

830
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:13,892
You okay?

831
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:15,936
Hey, you all right?
Hey, did she see you?

832
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:17,687
- You sure?
- I'm sure. Yes.

833
00:57:17,854 --> 00:57:18,854
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

834
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,523
Okay. All right, come here.

835
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,450
- I don't want to do this.
- Okay, it's okay.

836
00:57:22,608 --> 00:57:25,278
- It's okay, buddy. Come here.
- No. No!

837
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:27,989
Okay, we're just gonna freak
her out a little bit, yeah?

838
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:30,241
Just can't wait to see her
shit some puppies.

839
00:57:30,408 --> 00:57:32,828
Hey, you guys ready?
All right, stay cool. Stay cool.

840
00:57:32,994 --> 00:57:34,871
Come on. Put this on.

841
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:36,915
Come on, just put it on.

842
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:38,249
Put it on. Come on.

843
00:57:40,626 --> 00:57:43,421
Good. All right, go around this.
Come on, come on.

844
00:57:46,758 --> 00:57:48,468
- She's really scared.
- Put your mask on.

845
00:57:48,634 --> 00:57:49,803
I think that's enough.

846
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:51,322
No, it's enough
when I say it's enough.

847
00:57:51,346 --> 00:57:53,139
Jake, look,
she's calling the cops.

848
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:55,641
Go to the mopeds.
Get in the fucking car.

849
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:57,643
She faked it before.
She'll fake it again.

850
00:57:57,811 --> 00:57:59,938
You don't even know.
I can hear her.

851
00:58:00,105 --> 00:58:01,397
Oh, fuck this.

852
00:58:03,024 --> 00:58:04,275
Please.

853
00:58:04,442 --> 00:58:06,361
Get the fuck back! Get back!

854
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:09,239
I'm fucking done.

855
00:58:16,204 --> 00:58:17,538
Turn the light switch off!

856
00:58:17,705 --> 00:58:19,249
Turn all the lights out!

857
00:58:37,683 --> 00:58:39,560
I don't want
to get in trouble, guys.

858
00:58:39,727 --> 00:58:41,396
Shut the fuck up.

859
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:44,232
Okay.

860
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:46,151
All right, Coop,
I want you to go,

861
00:58:46,317 --> 00:58:47,944
take these mopeds and go around

862
00:58:48,111 --> 00:58:50,906
to the other side of the diner
and wait for my signal, okay?

863
00:58:51,072 --> 00:58:52,282
- Go.
- What?

864
00:58:53,616 --> 00:58:55,160
I want you to take
the fucking mopeds

865
00:58:55,326 --> 00:58:57,370
and go around to the other side
of the diner

866
00:58:57,537 --> 00:58:59,177
and wait for my signal,
you fucking idiot.

867
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:00,874
Okay? And take Petey with you.

868
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:02,250
Fuck.

869
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:04,377
Okay, go, go, go, go.
Petey, go.

870
00:59:05,461 --> 00:59:06,546
We got this.

871
00:59:06,712 --> 00:59:07,964
All right.

872
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:09,507
I'm not gonna lose.

873
00:59:10,633 --> 00:59:11,944
Come with me,
let's go outside

874
00:59:11,968 --> 00:59:12,928
to the squad car.

875
00:59:12,929 --> 00:59:14,345
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

876
00:59:14,512 --> 00:59:15,889
They're coming after us.

877
00:59:16,056 --> 00:59:17,682
I don't like this, Jake.

878
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:19,893
She just fucking
told them it was me.

879
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,937
And she knows how Petey walks.
Oh, fuck, fuck.

880
00:59:22,103 --> 00:59:24,230
I'm not gonna fucking die
for this, I'm not.

881
00:59:24,397 --> 00:59:25,857
I'm gonna fucking handle this.

882
00:59:26,024 --> 00:59:27,317
Jake!

883
00:59:35,575 --> 00:59:38,536
Can you please tell me
what is going on?

884
00:59:38,703 --> 00:59:40,455
Seriously, you're scaring me.

885
00:59:40,621 --> 00:59:43,708
Listen, I don't mean
to scare you, but...

886
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:45,515
- What the fuck is that?
- Please!

887
00:59:45,626 --> 00:59:47,670
- What?
- Is that blood on your face?

888
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:49,172
I'm sorry.

889
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:51,216
Sorry for what, Petey?

890
00:59:51,382 --> 00:59:53,676
What the fuck did you two do?

891
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:56,721
- ...mopeds.
- Are you serious?

892
00:59:56,888 --> 00:59:58,849
Jeez.

893
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:00,058
Go, go, go!

894
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:02,143
No, no!

895
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:05,290
Bobby, what the fuck
are you doing here?

896
01:01:05,456 --> 01:01:07,500
I'm sorry about what happened
earlier, I...

897
01:01:08,418 --> 01:01:10,879
What's he doing?
Look what he's doing right now.

898
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:12,463
What? What are you doing?

899
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:14,215
You just killed a fucking cop!

900
01:01:14,382 --> 01:01:15,926
I did it for you!

901
01:01:16,092 --> 01:01:18,511
Motherfucker, your fingerprints
are on everything.

902
01:01:18,678 --> 01:01:20,430
Don't you understand,
you fucking idiot?

903
01:01:20,596 --> 01:01:23,474
You are going to fry
along with me and Petey.

904
01:01:23,641 --> 01:01:25,435
Okay? So unless you want
to burn,

905
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:27,854
I need you to go in there
and find both of them!

906
01:01:47,123 --> 01:01:50,293
Get away. Stay with her!

907
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,670
Bobby, help me get his legs, man.

908
01:01:53,296 --> 01:01:54,798
Help me get his fucking legs!

909
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:56,507
I can't fucking
leave him out here.

910
01:01:56,674 --> 01:01:57,968
Come on!

911
01:01:58,134 --> 01:02:00,595
All right, one, two...

912
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:04,724
All right, bud, come on!

913
01:02:04,891 --> 01:02:06,392
Okay...

914
01:02:39,926 --> 01:02:41,469
Wait, okay.

915
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,726
She's fucking gone.

916
01:02:48,894 --> 01:02:50,872
If you don't want to go
to prison the rest of your life,

917
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:52,480
go fucking find her!

918
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:58,194
You're a good boy.
You're a good boy.

919
01:02:58,361 --> 01:03:00,446
Hey, Bobby, how about you?

920
01:03:04,117 --> 01:03:06,702
I want to know how she was
in the sack before I fucking...

921
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:21,259
Hey, Jake, it's Edward.
Sorry I'm calling so late.

922
01:03:21,426 --> 01:03:24,387
I can't get a hold of Nancy.
I'm getting kind of concerned.

923
01:03:24,554 --> 01:03:28,767
And, look, I know you guys had
some kind of an issue earlier,

924
01:03:28,934 --> 01:03:31,269
but I hope you know
you always have a job with us.

925
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:36,775
So, yeah, just give me a call
if you hear from her, would you?

926
01:03:36,942 --> 01:03:38,151
Thanks.

927
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:40,028
Still not picking up?

928
01:03:40,195 --> 01:03:41,446
No.

929
01:03:41,612 --> 01:03:43,073
Well, she can take care
of herself.

930
01:03:46,576 --> 01:03:47,828
