1
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:23,153
I'm Anna Troyev,
the art therapy instructor.

2
00:02:42,998 --> 00:02:44,826
Arms up.

3
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:54,967
I trust we won't go
through this every day.

4
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:57,403
Anna?

5
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:00,364
Welcome.

6
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:02,540
Are you ready for
your first day?

7
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,671
I think so.

8
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:05,847
Please.

9
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:07,632
Do you live far?

10
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:10,417
Somewhat, but it's worth it.

11
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:13,222
I've always wanted to
use art to help people.

12
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:14,465
Wonderful.

13
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:15,508
Please.

14
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:18,860
This way.

15
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:22,690
Those are our
security procedures.

16
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:24,953
Learn them backwards
and forwards.

17
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,262
Most of our patients are
quite docile, but others..

18
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:31,830
Doctor, it's Leena.

19
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:34,267
She's not in her room,
nobody can find her.

20
00:03:36,138 --> 00:03:37,792
Lock it.

21
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:40,795
Full on lock out!

22
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:52,633
Who is Leena?

23
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:55,027
Our most dangerous patient.

24
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,682
In fact, she's the reason
for the opening you're filling.

25
00:03:58,552 --> 00:04:02,295
Your predecessor underestimated
her and ignored protocol.

26
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:03,905
It did not end well.

27
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:06,212
Listen to me.

28
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:07,996
Do not leave this room.

29
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,520
Don't worry, you'll be safe here

30
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:11,478
and I'll come back after
we found her.

31
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:13,741
Please, please.

32
00:04:38,984 --> 00:04:40,333
Hello there.

33
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,776
Does your mom or dad work here?

34
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:57,524
Could I see?

35
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,580
Is that me?

36
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:13,932
That's very good.

37
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:17,022
I'm Anna.

38
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:18,371
What's your name?

39
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:28,468
Leena.

40
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:34,561
You didn't a-answer me before.

41
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:35,867
Do your parents work here?

42
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,870
Why would you think that?

43
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:44,354
- Because you're..
- I'm what?

44
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:51,970
Leena..

45
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,240
Put it down.

46
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:08,595
Leena, put it down now.

47
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:26,526
You didn't tell me
she was a child.

48
00:06:27,484 --> 00:06:29,660
It's because she's not.

49
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:34,360
Leena suffers
from a gland disorder.

50
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:37,885
Which causes
proportional dwarfism,

51
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:41,759
essentially halting her
growth around age ten.

52
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,370
Make no mistake, Leena may
look like a child,

53
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:46,590
but she is a grown woman.

54
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,635
31 to be exact.

55
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,727
When Leena first arrived,
she struggled so hard against

56
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:59,341
her restraints that she
would bleed severely.

57
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:02,997
It was a lesson for all of
us on the depths of her

58
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,651
will to be free.

59
00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:10,614
Much of Leena's early life
was spent doing whatever she

60
00:07:10,657 --> 00:07:12,920
could to survive.

61
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:17,142
But she never grew older, at
least not on the outside.

62
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:19,100
Imagine, going through
your whole life

63
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:22,147
with the world only
seeing a child.

64
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:25,629
It is very important that you
do not see her in that way.

65
00:07:25,672 --> 00:07:29,328
Leena uses her affliction as
much as she suffers from it.

66
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:33,854
She's an exceptional con artist.

67
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,338
Two years ago, Leena wormed
her way into this family

68
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:41,340
by posing as a runaway.

69
00:07:41,383 --> 00:07:45,257
This family took her in, they
fed her, they clothed her.

70
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,912
Normally, Leena would simply
steal whatever she could and

71
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:52,177
disappear, but this time she...

72
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:59,445
Well, let me put it this
way, she lives here now.

73
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:25,906
Idti.

74
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:40,051
Idti!

75
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:50,409
She does that.

76
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:16,217
How much longer we got, daddy?

77
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:18,263
You have a few minutes, darling.

78
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:20,613
You learning me by
heart little Sara?

79
00:09:20,657 --> 00:09:23,616
No, daddy, I know you by heart.

80
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,227
You're inside my heart.

81
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:31,276
We're going to be
brave, aren't we?

82
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:32,319
Yes, daddy.

83
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,670
But this is gonna
be our hardest battle.

84
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:41,678
Leena; Hello, Dmitri.

85
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:44,811
You're on time.

86
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:52,427
It's perfect.

87
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:06,703
I can't tie these myself.

88
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,073
I want to do
something nice for you.

89
00:10:30,248 --> 00:10:31,641
You can come in.

90
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:35,688
Yeah. Yeah.

91
00:11:17,774 --> 00:11:19,166
I can do it now.

92
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:22,735
Any moment I may see, my
daddy coming back to me.

93
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:26,652
I don't.

94
00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:28,349
My daddy has to go away.

95
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,394
Idti.

96
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:42,483
Do you want some candy?

97
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:13,427
Idti!

98
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:49,811
She cut the feed.

99
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:54,555
I'm so sorry, Anna.

100
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,516
Hopefully, the police will find
her before anyone else is hurt.

101
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:03,477
Not quite the start we'd
hoped for, I'm sure.

102
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:07,090
This job isn't for me.

103
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:25,462
Oh, Anna.

104
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,334
It usually takes only one.

105
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,590
Who's there?

106
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,010
Don't be afraid, I'm police.

107
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:54,611
Don't be afraid, I'm police.

108
00:18:59,365 --> 00:19:00,525
Uh... Where are your parents?

109
00:19:01,715 --> 00:19:03,326
My parents are in America.

110
00:19:05,502 --> 00:19:07,852
Sweetheart, what is your name?

111
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:13,510
My name is Esther.

112
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:20,490
- You killed it.
- Thanks, man.

113
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,795
Proud of you, sweetheart.

114
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,144
Yeah, great job, pal.

115
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,145
Thanks, guys.

116
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,669
How long do you think you'll be?

117
00:20:25,712 --> 00:20:28,933
Actually a bunch of people are
getting together tonight.

118
00:20:28,976 --> 00:20:30,326
Well, congrats.

119
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:32,763
I'll see you guys
back at the house.

120
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:36,830
I mean, this was
supposed to be family night.

121
00:20:36,854 --> 00:20:38,919
What, is he not supposed
to have fun with friends?

122
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:40,771
Oh God, all he does is have fun.

123
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:42,294
No.

124
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:44,209
Gunnar works his tail off.

125
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:47,299
When he's not studying,
he's fencing.

126
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:48,387
He's living his life.

127
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:54,785
Don't do that,
don't go into your head.

128
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:56,787
I need you to be present.

129
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,049
Gunnar needs you.

130
00:20:58,092 --> 00:20:59,529
Oh, sorry, was I
not at that match?

131
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:01,966
Esther's not coming back, Allen.

132
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,185
I miss her too.

133
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,317
I do.

134
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:07,450
Every moment of every day.

135
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,891
What's he doing here?

136
00:21:54,497 --> 00:21:55,996
From the little we've
gotten from Esther,

137
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,414
we believe a woman
abducted her, brought her to

138
00:21:58,457 --> 00:22:01,025
Russia and passed her off as
her own child until Esther

139
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:03,244
managed to escape.

140
00:22:04,028 --> 00:22:05,508
We haven't gotten
many specifics yet.

141
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,486
Perhaps when she's feeling
safer, she can shed some more

142
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,076
light on what
she's been through.

143
00:22:10,513 --> 00:22:13,516
We have a child therapist
that she'll be working with.

144
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,082
Good.

145
00:22:15,953 --> 00:22:17,633
But what she needs
right now is her family.

146
00:22:19,478 --> 00:22:21,175
Be prepared for changes.

147
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:25,615
Four years is a long time
in the development of a child.

148
00:22:46,897 --> 00:22:48,377
Esther?

149
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:55,688
Sweetheart, it's me, it's mommy.

150
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:06,569
Can I, can I see you?

151
00:23:26,023 --> 00:23:27,764
Sweetie.

152
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:29,156
It's mommy.

153
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:39,471
I thought I'd
never see you again.

154
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,562
Everything is right now.

155
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,742
It's been so long since
you've seen any of us.

156
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,443
See if I can..
Oh, there's daddy.

157
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:57,228
This was one of
our charity events.

158
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,535
He looks so handsome that
night, didn't he?

159
00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:00,686
Can I grab you anything else?

160
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,451
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

161
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,411
Oh, speak of the devil, your
brother is probably a foot

162
00:24:06,455 --> 00:24:09,109
taller than you'd remember.

163
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,156
Oh, there's Mup-Mup.

164
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:13,636
She's been so good to us.

165
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,854
Oh, I can't wait to see her.

166
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:19,598
No, sweetie.

167
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:21,208
She passed.

168
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,296
Remember?

169
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,385
It's just the four of us now.

170
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,041
I have to use the restroom.

171
00:24:34,178 --> 00:24:35,484
Ah, is the restroom over there?

172
00:24:36,702 --> 00:24:37,940
No, it's just
right back over there.

173
00:24:37,964 --> 00:24:38,791
Over in the back?

174
00:24:38,835 --> 00:24:40,053
Hm-hm.

175
00:24:40,097 --> 00:24:42,447
- Thank you for your help.
- You're welcome.

176
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:54,503
I can't wait to see you.

177
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:55,895
So stupid.

178
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:23,836
Oh, daddy and Gunnar are
just downstairs.

179
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,926
Do you think father
will recognize me?

180
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:31,627
Maybe not if you keep
calling him father.

181
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,584
Dad.

182
00:25:32,628 --> 00:25:33,628
Yeah. That's better.

183
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:38,111
Here, let me look at you.

184
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:45,423
Oh, my God, you look,
like a little lady.

185
00:25:45,466 --> 00:25:47,425
You've grown up so much.

186
00:25:49,253 --> 00:25:51,951
Take this off.

187
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:54,432
That's better.
It's less austere.

188
00:25:55,912 --> 00:25:56,912
This is..

189
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,051
Sorry.

190
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:10,491
No, I-I'm sorry, I..
Come on, let's go.

191
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,950
I think, I'm nervous.

192
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:36,996
Right, big step.

193
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:41,827
Daddy.

194
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:46,745
I'm so sorry, I can't
believe it's really you.

195
00:26:56,712 --> 00:26:57,843
I always knew.

196
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,932
I always knew.

197
00:27:05,068 --> 00:27:06,243
Hello, Gunnar.

198
00:27:07,287 --> 00:27:08,680
Hey.

199
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,137
I think we can do a little
better than "hey,"

200
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:12,161
don't you think?

201
00:27:13,337 --> 00:27:15,252
Come on.

202
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:21,954
Glad you're back.

203
00:27:21,998 --> 00:27:23,129
Me too.

204
00:27:25,262 --> 00:27:26,437
How about we go home?

205
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,092
- Yes!
- Let's go home.

206
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,093
Welcome home, Esther.

207
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,246
We left it just as it was.

208
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:38,161
We always knew you'd
come back home.

209
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:43,644
I mean you probably outgrown
so much but we have a lot of

210
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:47,779
Christmases and birthdays to
make up for, so just let us

211
00:28:47,823 --> 00:28:50,042
know what you're into,
and you might get it.

212
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,132
I like painting.

213
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:54,612
You like to paint?

214
00:28:54,655 --> 00:28:56,614
You were never interested
in painting before.

215
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:00,072
Well, maybe you two can
spend some time in your studio.

216
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:01,619
Nothing would make me happier.

217
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:17,113
So um, the plan is, tomorrow
you're gonna talk to Dr. Segar.

218
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,418
Do you remember her?

219
00:29:18,462 --> 00:29:22,031
She, she had the
parrot named Sydney?

220
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:24,337
Hm-hm.

221
00:29:24,381 --> 00:29:27,036
Well, if you need anything..

222
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,559
We're be right down the hall.
Alright?

223
00:30:11,689 --> 00:30:13,212
Okay, you can go in.

224
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:15,171
Dr. Segar will be
right with you.

225
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:16,801
Dr, Segar: I'm seeing her
in few minutes.

226
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:18,977
I think it's too soon for you
to get involved, detective.

227
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:21,177
I'd like to talk
to her alone first.

228
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,353
Look, I have to go.

229
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,242
You have no idea how
happy I am to see you, Esther.

230
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:42,328
Welcome home.

231
00:30:43,939 --> 00:30:46,898
Well now, you are certainly not
the little girl I once knew.

232
00:30:47,943 --> 00:30:49,292
You're a young lady now.

233
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:52,706
Do you remember what I told you

234
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,010
when we first began
our sessions?

235
00:30:56,473 --> 00:30:57,929
I told you if I ask any
questions that make you

236
00:30:57,953 --> 00:31:00,129
uncomfortable, we'll stop.

237
00:31:00,912 --> 00:31:02,435
I wish my parents were like you.

238
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:05,047
How so?

239
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:07,329
They keep asking
what happened to me,

240
00:31:07,353 --> 00:31:10,487
but I'm not ready to
tell them about it.

241
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,054
And that's perfectly fine.

242
00:31:12,097 --> 00:31:14,317
I am hoping you'll talk
to me about it,

243
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,580
but only when
you're ready, okay?

244
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:20,410
Having said that, is there
anything you want to tell me

245
00:31:20,453 --> 00:31:23,761
about your time, away..

246
00:31:23,804 --> 00:31:25,545
You want to play, Sydney?

247
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:27,765
I think Sydney
wants to play with me.

248
00:31:28,157 --> 00:31:30,463
Hello. I remember you.

249
00:31:30,507 --> 00:31:33,118
Do you remember me?

250
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,642
Your turn.

251
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:36,924
Esther, you can wait out
here, I'm just gonna need to

252
00:31:36,948 --> 00:31:38,515
talk to your mom for a moment.

253
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:56,968
Hello.

254
00:31:57,012 --> 00:31:58,448
Hi.

255
00:31:58,491 --> 00:31:59,623
I like your earrings.

256
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,842
Oh, thank you, honey.

257
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:02,843
What are you writing?

258
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,758
Oh! I'm sorry.

259
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:06,195
I'm so sorry.

260
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:07,109
It's-it's okay.

261
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:08,414
I'm sorry.

262
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:10,112
I'm just gonna
get this cleaned up.

263
00:32:19,556 --> 00:32:21,645
Does she seem the
same as you remember?

264
00:32:21,688 --> 00:32:23,386
Different?

265
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:27,042
Well, of course she's different.

266
00:32:27,085 --> 00:32:29,522
She has an accent now.

267
00:32:29,566 --> 00:32:34,310
Is that unusual, considering
where she's been?

268
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:36,288
Not necessarily,
she was there a long time

269
00:32:36,312 --> 00:32:38,357
when her speech was still
developing.

270
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:41,186
But I will tell you,
she's in far better shape

271
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:44,363
intellectually and emotionally
than I would expect.

272
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:46,322
That's good, right?

273
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:54,330
I did also notice
some inconsistencies.

274
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:56,593
For example, she
said that was Sydney.

275
00:32:56,636 --> 00:33:00,118
Sydney was a macaw, bright
orange and four times the size.

276
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:02,251
Yet, today, she addressed
this bird as Sydney

277
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:04,035
with complete confidence.

278
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,558
What are you getting at?

279
00:33:05,602 --> 00:33:07,319
To me, it felt
like a performance.

280
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,392
He hit me and ripped my dress!

281
00:33:13,436 --> 00:33:15,046
I want to go home.

282
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:17,831
That's enough for today.

283
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,395
Of course, we'll reschedule.

284
00:33:39,027 --> 00:33:40,680
Esther, you alright?

285
00:33:40,724 --> 00:33:42,073
Uh, yes.

286
00:33:53,171 --> 00:33:54,607
Hey!

287
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,001
Morticia.

288
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:58,307
Get Gunnar for me, would you?

289
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,656
What did you call me?

290
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:02,093
Mike, that's her. The sister?

291
00:34:02,137 --> 00:34:04,530
Oh, shit, it's my bad.

292
00:34:04,574 --> 00:34:07,142
Umm... Get Gunnar.

293
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:08,534
Pajalsta?

294
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,123
How about I cut your balls off,
and feed them to you,

295
00:34:12,147 --> 00:34:14,105
you fucking shit stain?

296
00:34:16,194 --> 00:34:18,066
Was that Spanish, or something?

297
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:19,067
I don't.. Hey.

298
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,416
Let's go.

299
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,133
Your sister's a
fucking trip, man.

300
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:23,723
Seriously, dude, my
dad's right there.

301
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:25,073
I don't care.

302
00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:28,815
Mike, what the fuck..
I am what I am.

303
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,123
Hey, honey, you okay?

304
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:34,038
Hm. My dress is ruined.

305
00:34:34,082 --> 00:34:35,648
We'll buy you a new one.

306
00:34:35,692 --> 00:34:37,259
I was thinking, uh,
just thinking

307
00:34:37,302 --> 00:34:38,651
we can go to the studio.

308
00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:40,479
I would love to.

309
00:34:51,316 --> 00:34:52,535
If I didn't know any better,

310
00:34:52,578 --> 00:34:54,537
I'd think you've never
been in here before.

311
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,585
So beautiful.

312
00:35:04,242 --> 00:35:05,362
What's the light for?

313
00:35:06,723 --> 00:35:08,072
What's the light for?

314
00:35:08,855 --> 00:35:10,379
So you don't remember?

315
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:11,862
This is what your
papa is famous for.

316
00:35:12,337 --> 00:35:13,425
Hmm.

317
00:35:13,817 --> 00:35:15,514
Here.

318
00:35:15,558 --> 00:35:17,560
Press on this.

319
00:35:24,262 --> 00:35:26,960
Yeah, I always try to
fit so much in to one canvas,

320
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:31,139
you know, So I resorted
to a hidden layer.

321
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:33,117
Nothing is ever just
one thing, right?

322
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:35,012
So cool.

323
00:35:36,318 --> 00:35:38,885
You haven't been
in here in a while.

324
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,800
No, I haven't.

325
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,066
What's this one?

326
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:54,031
Oh, no.

327
00:35:54,597 --> 00:35:56,294
It's, uh, I should
have gotten rid of this.

328
00:35:56,903 --> 00:35:59,471
Who-who is, who is that?

329
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,493
There's no use
dwelling on the past.

330
00:36:01,517 --> 00:36:04,215
You're home now, that's
all that matters, alright?

331
00:36:04,259 --> 00:36:06,957
So I was thinking we could
dust off some canvasses you

332
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,240
know, and see what comes of it.

333
00:36:08,741 --> 00:36:09,916
I'd love to.

334
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,135
Yeah?

335
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:11,788
Uh, what's your poison?

336
00:36:11,831 --> 00:36:13,093
Oils, watercolors?

337
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:14,356
I've got it all.

338
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:16,271
- Charcoal.
- Charcoal.

339
00:36:16,314 --> 00:36:19,143
Okay, pick an object and
we'll sit down

340
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:21,667
and we'll draw it together.

341
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,105
I want to draw you.

342
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,106
You want to draw me?

343
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,195
Hm-hm.

344
00:36:27,238 --> 00:36:28,238
Yeah, okay.

345
00:36:31,764 --> 00:36:33,201
Well, this is a first.

346
00:36:33,853 --> 00:36:34,985
How do you want me?

347
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:37,509
I can, I can do the thinker.

348
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:39,871
The way you were when
you were looking at that.

349
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:43,371
That's not a place I
want to live anymore.

350
00:36:44,212 --> 00:36:47,215
There, just like that.

351
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:55,808
You learned to paint
while you were over there?

352
00:36:55,832 --> 00:36:58,704
Mm-hm.

353
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:05,102
Would you just draw, or was
it, was it also..

354
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:08,279
It wasn't what you think.

355
00:37:08,714 --> 00:37:09,778
It's still happening

356
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:11,804
despite everything
that's going on.

357
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:12,936
Allen?

358
00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:14,416
No, he won't be there.

359
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:16,635
You know how he feels
about these things.

360
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,309
So I'll see you at the
gala tomorrow then, okay?

361
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:19,943
It's for good cause.

362
00:37:19,986 --> 00:37:23,294
Beth, just bring your
checkbook and Jim.

363
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:25,296
It's for pediatric
cancer, for Christ's sake.

364
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,256
Okay, that's better, thank you.

365
00:37:36,786 --> 00:37:37,961
I'm finished.

366
00:37:38,004 --> 00:37:38,701
Allen; Already?

367
00:37:38,744 --> 00:37:40,442
Hm-hm.

368
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:46,796
Do you like it?

369
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:47,884
Allen; I love it.

370
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:50,016
It's-it's incredible.

371
00:37:50,452 --> 00:37:52,410
Okay, thirty seconds, alright?

372
00:37:52,454 --> 00:37:54,499
And then we're gonna see
what you can do with paint.

373
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:35,148
That's private.

374
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:36,541
Oh, I'm sorry.

375
00:38:36,585 --> 00:38:38,127
I-I saw that you brought it
back with you,

376
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:39,239
I thought it was special.

377
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,283
You don't knock?

378
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:44,244
I was looking for my gold watch.

379
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:47,160
It's OK, I'm sure it
will turn up.

380
00:38:47,204 --> 00:38:48,248
Sorry!

381
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,016
Property of Esther.

382
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:20,455
Mummy took me to Wicked.

383
00:39:20,977 --> 00:39:22,935
Mummy.

384
00:39:22,979 --> 00:39:24,763
Hello, mummy.

385
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,374
Thank you, mummy.

386
00:39:28,898 --> 00:39:30,421
I know, mummy.

387
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:32,291
Mummy.

388
00:39:34,643 --> 00:39:36,166
Huh! Mummy.

389
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,175
You're not gonna
believe what Esther can do.

390
00:39:45,218 --> 00:39:48,134
We spent the afternoon
in the studio.

391
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:50,267
She drew a portrait of me.

392
00:39:51,007 --> 00:39:53,313
She's got more talent than
I had when I was in my 20s.

393
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,576
How's that possible?

394
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:56,447
Four years ago she was
drawing stick figures.

395
00:39:56,491 --> 00:39:57,405
Easy.

396
00:39:57,448 --> 00:39:58,667
What?

397
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,253
Think about where you
were four years ago.

398
00:40:00,277 --> 00:40:01,583
Now you're a fencing champion.

399
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:05,064
Yeah, just, it's impressive.

400
00:40:05,674 --> 00:40:07,458
Maybe you can make
a portrait of me.

401
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:09,373
This is delicious, mummy.

402
00:40:10,635 --> 00:40:13,203
Thank you.

403
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:15,945
Is something wrong?

404
00:40:17,425 --> 00:40:18,164
No, no.

405
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,208
I'm-I'm just..

406
00:40:20,689 --> 00:40:23,039
Were you expecting someone?

407
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:32,309
Just thought I'd pop
in to say hi to Esther.

408
00:40:32,352 --> 00:40:33,919
Look who came for a visit.

409
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:35,399
Oh, I'm sorry to
interrupt dinner.

410
00:40:36,531 --> 00:40:38,334
This is, uh, the
police officer who helped us

411
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:39,185
when you went missing.

412
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:40,622
He's a friend.

413
00:40:40,665 --> 00:40:44,103
I just came to say
welcome home Esther.

414
00:40:44,147 --> 00:40:45,801
Thank you.

415
00:40:48,456 --> 00:40:50,153
Excuse me for a moment.

416
00:40:55,332 --> 00:40:58,640
You should know, um, our
child psychologist feels

417
00:40:58,683 --> 00:41:01,599
Esther should tell her story
within the confines of a...

418
00:41:01,643 --> 00:41:03,003
And not with a cop like me.

419
00:41:03,035 --> 00:41:04,994
Don't worry, I get it.

420
00:41:05,037 --> 00:41:07,997
But Esther did vanish from
our little town,

421
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,913
and that remains a concern.

422
00:41:10,956 --> 00:41:12,958
I need to know if
there's still a danger.

423
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,440
I spoke to Dr.
Segar this morning.

424
00:41:16,484 --> 00:41:19,704
Is that appropriate?

425
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:21,769
Donnan; She told me she's
open to a group discussion

426
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:23,273
tomorrow morning.

427
00:41:23,316 --> 00:41:25,101
Just to see if
everything's alright.

428
00:41:25,493 --> 00:41:29,018
Mummy, your gala is tomorrow.

429
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:33,172
We'll do it the
following day then.

430
00:41:33,196 --> 00:41:34,327
It's important.

431
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:35,546
I mean, sure.

432
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,201
If it's that important,
we'll be there.

433
00:41:39,942 --> 00:41:42,771
You forgot to fill your glass.

434
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:49,212
Well, um, welcome home, Esther.

435
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:50,387
You said that already.

436
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,257
Now, Esther.

437
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:52,998
Oh, it's okay, she's right.

438
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:54,043
I'll walk you out.

439
00:42:26,815 --> 00:42:28,468
I'm sorry you live here.

440
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:27,658
You know.. I think
I'll stay here

441
00:43:27,702 --> 00:43:29,529
for a while.

442
00:44:00,386 --> 00:44:02,426
I think something's
going on with Dr. Segar.

443
00:44:03,389 --> 00:44:04,715
She seemed to be implying
in our last meeting

444
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:06,958
that Esther is lying.

445
00:44:08,307 --> 00:44:10,353
That's insane.

446
00:44:10,396 --> 00:44:12,050
Maybe she needs to
see a therapist.

447
00:44:12,094 --> 00:44:14,400
I know, right?

448
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:17,752
What... what is this?

449
00:44:17,795 --> 00:44:18,796
Your date.

450
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,884
You're coming?

451
00:44:19,928 --> 00:44:20,992
Yeah, of course, I'm coming.

452
00:44:21,016 --> 00:44:22,234
You're my wife.

453
00:44:22,278 --> 00:44:24,280
I can deal with a few
rich pricks for you.

454
00:44:24,672 --> 00:44:25,716
What about Esther?

455
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,586
Well, Gunnar's here.

456
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,414
She'll be fine. Right?

457
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:29,478
What? Do you want
me to stay home?

458
00:44:29,502 --> 00:44:32,157
No. No.

459
00:44:35,117 --> 00:44:37,423
You know, it seems like
since we got Esther back,

460
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:40,557
we got us back too.

461
00:44:41,776 --> 00:44:43,865
I couldn't agree more.

462
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,973
How long do you
need to get dressed?

463
00:44:45,997 --> 00:44:47,172
I can be quick.

464
00:44:47,216 --> 00:44:48,391
Yeah?

465
00:44:50,436 --> 00:44:51,524
I can be quick too.

466
00:44:59,445 --> 00:45:00,577
I'm sorry.

467
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,620
No, they're cute.

468
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:32,000
Just close the door.

469
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,050
Just close the door.

470
00:45:39,094 --> 00:45:40,791
What?

471
00:45:40,835 --> 00:45:42,314
No.

472
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:44,752
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

473
00:45:44,795 --> 00:45:46,057
Oh, my God.

474
00:45:46,101 --> 00:45:48,059
Do you know how much
I spent on this dress.

475
00:45:49,191 --> 00:45:49,887
Let me look.

476
00:45:49,931 --> 00:45:50,975
Oh, man.

477
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:53,499
I can fix that,
with a safety pin.

478
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:54,631
Right, or staples.

479
00:45:54,674 --> 00:45:56,328
Staples will work.

480
00:46:01,464 --> 00:46:02,963
You're responsible for
looking after your sister

481
00:46:02,987 --> 00:46:04,728
while we're gone.

482
00:46:04,772 --> 00:46:06,338
We're trusting you, okay.

483
00:46:06,382 --> 00:46:07,644
Yeah, dad. I got it.

484
00:46:09,515 --> 00:46:10,995
You look incredible.

485
00:46:11,953 --> 00:46:13,563
We're off.

486
00:46:13,606 --> 00:46:14,758
Probably won't be home
till after midnight, okay.

487
00:46:14,782 --> 00:46:17,349
So, don't let her
stay up too late.

488
00:46:17,393 --> 00:46:18,307
You have the keys?

489
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,483
Copy that.

490
00:46:27,142 --> 00:46:28,970
You look nice.

491
00:46:29,013 --> 00:46:30,536
Thanks.

492
00:46:31,624 --> 00:46:33,539
Have a good night, honey.

493
00:46:33,888 --> 00:46:34,453
Ciao.

494
00:46:34,497 --> 00:46:36,281
Night.

495
00:46:39,937 --> 00:46:42,113
So what are we going to do?

496
00:46:42,635 --> 00:46:43,636
We?

497
00:46:45,682 --> 00:46:47,075
Whoo!

498
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,664
Oh, it's out. Oh, shit,
guys, I'm sorry.

499
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:13,666
I was holding on
to it for too long.

500
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:15,581
Okay, is it, Gunnar, is
your sister different

501
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,105
than you remember?

502
00:47:17,148 --> 00:47:18,889
I mean.. What do you think?

503
00:47:18,933 --> 00:47:20,760
She's been at some
eastern European sex gulag.

504
00:47:22,414 --> 00:47:22,937
Mike!

505
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,025
Yeah, no.

506
00:47:24,068 --> 00:47:25,722
She, uh, she's
different, alright.

507
00:47:25,765 --> 00:47:28,333
She's got an accent now.

508
00:47:28,377 --> 00:47:29,900
And she dresses
like Lizzie Borden.

509
00:47:29,944 --> 00:47:32,424
It's so fucking weird.

510
00:47:32,468 --> 00:47:33,817
Who is Lizzie Borden?

511
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:41,172
Uh, some crazy chick who
killed her parents with an axe.

512
00:47:41,216 --> 00:47:43,914
Uh, hey, Esther.

513
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:47,831
Why don't you go watch
a movie or something?

514
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:49,354
No.

515
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:52,401
Esther, this isn't your scene.

516
00:47:52,444 --> 00:47:54,011
Go watch a movie.

517
00:47:54,055 --> 00:47:55,578
Go fuck yourself.

518
00:47:57,319 --> 00:47:58,639
Hey, Gunnar, you
know what I like.

519
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:03,978
Go.

520
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:07,459
Anyway, cheers.

521
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:10,241
Yeah, I'll fucking
drink to that.

522
00:48:14,727 --> 00:48:15,807
What were we talking about?

523
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,474
Evening.

524
00:48:23,606 --> 00:48:25,825
Hey, my parents aren't here.

525
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,479
They're at mom's gala.

526
00:48:27,523 --> 00:48:29,003
Just my luck.

527
00:48:29,046 --> 00:48:31,135
Having a party?

528
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:33,355
No, it's just a few friends.

529
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:35,487
You can smell the
weed from the street.

530
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:37,054
What?

531
00:48:37,098 --> 00:48:39,338
Uh, I don't know, I don't know
what you're talking about.

532
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:43,887
Look, nothing's
going on here, okay?

533
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:46,716
So, um, why don't I just tell
my parents that you stopped by

534
00:48:46,759 --> 00:48:48,936
and we can just
forget all about this?

535
00:48:49,806 --> 00:48:51,808
Cool?

536
00:48:51,851 --> 00:48:52,896
Cool.

537
00:48:53,462 --> 00:48:55,333
Good.

538
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,727
Mind if I hit the
restroom before I go?

539
00:48:59,555 --> 00:49:01,383
Yeah. Um, whatever, yeah, sure.

540
00:50:21,332 --> 00:50:22,812
That was a blast.

541
00:50:22,855 --> 00:50:24,616
No wonder those uptight
millionaires line up to give

542
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,511
the foundation money.

543
00:50:27,121 --> 00:50:29,427
Oh, no. It's the booze.

544
00:50:29,471 --> 00:50:30,863
It's not the booze, hon.

545
00:50:30,907 --> 00:50:32,430
It's the host.

546
00:50:32,474 --> 00:50:33,668
You bring the best
out of people.

547
00:50:33,692 --> 00:50:35,085
Aww!

548
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,236
I just hope the house
is still standing.

549
00:50:55,279 --> 00:50:59,327
I mean when I was
16, I-I nearly,

550
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:01,546
I nearly burned the house down.

551
00:51:01,981 --> 00:51:03,505
No, Gunnar would never do that.

552
00:51:03,548 --> 00:51:05,463
Who says I'm talking
about Gunnar?

553
00:51:10,164 --> 00:51:11,817
Esther? We're home.

554
00:51:14,516 --> 00:51:15,516
Esther?

555
00:52:11,573 --> 00:52:13,357
The Saarne Institute?

556
00:52:25,021 --> 00:52:27,502
Esther?

557
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,655
If you're not Esther,
who the hell are you?

558
00:54:34,716 --> 00:54:36,631
How did you know
that I'm not Esther?

559
00:54:42,376 --> 00:54:44,291
Her own mother
doesn't even know.

560
00:54:46,902 --> 00:54:48,295
Yeah, kid, she does.

561
00:54:58,479 --> 00:54:59,784
Damn it.

562
00:55:00,176 --> 00:55:01,699
Mummy?

563
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,919
What the fuck are
you looking at?

564
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:10,273
So, let me get this straight.

565
00:55:10,882 --> 00:55:12,841
You're a grown-ass woman
and a wanted criminal?

566
00:55:14,408 --> 00:55:17,411
That is... beyond fucked up.

567
00:55:21,371 --> 00:55:24,026
This is all I ever do
anymore by the way.

568
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:25,767
Clean up after my kids.

569
00:55:26,158 --> 00:55:26,985
Don't worry about it.

570
00:55:27,029 --> 00:55:28,465
Mommy will take care of it.

571
00:55:28,509 --> 00:55:30,337
Mommy takes care of everything.

572
00:55:31,512 --> 00:55:33,383
When Gunnar told me
Donnan came to the house,

573
00:55:33,427 --> 00:55:35,080
I knew I'd find you here.

574
00:55:36,473 --> 00:55:39,258
You could've robbed us blind
and disappeared the second you

575
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:42,000
had a chance, but you didn't.

576
00:55:44,046 --> 00:55:45,395
Why is that?

577
00:55:46,483 --> 00:55:48,180
You're thinking bigger.

578
00:55:48,224 --> 00:55:49,921
Right?

579
00:55:49,965 --> 00:55:53,403
Play the part, manipulate us..
And a year from now we meet

580
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:55,579
with some tragic accident.

581
00:55:55,623 --> 00:55:57,102
Am I getting warm?

582
00:55:57,581 --> 00:55:59,235
Let me go.

583
00:55:59,278 --> 00:56:01,106
You'll never see me again.

584
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,065
That's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

585
00:56:03,108 --> 00:56:05,633
We can't have Esther
disappear twice now, can we?

586
00:56:06,938 --> 00:56:09,158
She didn't disappear.

587
00:56:09,201 --> 00:56:11,769
There was nothing that
I could do for her.

588
00:56:11,813 --> 00:56:13,292
It was too late.

589
00:56:14,903 --> 00:56:19,124
Gunnar.. He was always
way too rough with her.

590
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:20,909
That night it just went too far.

591
00:56:21,518 --> 00:56:23,955
What was I supposed to do?

592
00:56:23,999 --> 00:56:27,959
Hand over the only child I had
left over some sibling bullshit

593
00:56:28,003 --> 00:56:29,570
that went too far?

594
00:56:30,397 --> 00:56:33,269
I loved my daughter,
with all my heart.

595
00:56:33,312 --> 00:56:36,446
But a mother protects her
family, no matter what.

596
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:41,233
And if you think, that I'm
gonna let some psycho dwarf

597
00:56:41,277 --> 00:56:46,369
destroy what I have
built.. You're mistaken.

598
00:56:47,631 --> 00:56:48,956
This family came over on
the fucking Mayflower

599
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,112
and built this country.

600
00:56:50,634 --> 00:56:51,809
We matter.

601
00:56:51,853 --> 00:56:53,289
Allen matters.

602
00:56:54,116 --> 00:56:56,205
When he got the news
Esther was alive..

603
00:56:56,248 --> 00:56:58,468
The happiness on his face...

604
00:56:58,512 --> 00:57:01,036
I had to make this work.

605
00:57:01,863 --> 00:57:04,169
Allen doesn't know what
happened to Esther.

606
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:07,521
And you are gonna help me
make sure that he never does.

607
00:57:08,435 --> 00:57:11,307
There's only one thing worse
than the death of a child.

608
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,396
And that is a
child who is missing.

609
00:57:14,092 --> 00:57:17,139
Esther's disappearance
changed Allen.

610
00:57:17,879 --> 00:57:20,055
Changed who he was.

611
00:57:20,098 --> 00:57:21,709
Who he is supposed to be.

612
00:57:22,144 --> 00:57:26,670
But you are the answer.

613
00:57:32,154 --> 00:57:34,156
You and I have a chance
to turn this mess

614
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:36,506
into a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

615
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:38,573
Esther's down there, isn't she?

616
00:57:42,556 --> 00:57:44,775
Don't you fucking say her name.

617
00:57:46,037 --> 00:57:49,563
Okay. You conned your
way into my family.

618
00:57:49,606 --> 00:57:52,783
You chose this role, and now
you're gonna fucking play it.

619
00:58:01,705 --> 00:58:06,014
So you can be Esther for
now and live a life that anyone

620
00:58:06,057 --> 00:58:08,364
would kill to have.

621
00:58:08,407 --> 00:58:10,516
Or you take the fall for this
and get shipped back to Estonia

622
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,977
in handcuffs.

623
00:58:13,021 --> 00:58:14,501
What do you say?

624
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:30,168
I'm sorry I scared you.

625
00:58:30,212 --> 00:58:31,212
I'm sorry.

626
00:58:31,256 --> 00:58:32,431
I'm sorry.

627
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:34,172
We should've never
left you alone.

628
00:58:35,609 --> 00:58:36,566
What happened?

629
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:37,872
She fell off her bike.

630
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:39,613
I found her by the
side of the road.

631
00:58:39,656 --> 00:58:42,311
Honey, what were
you doing on a bike.

632
00:58:42,354 --> 00:58:44,095
Come, let's-let's go on.

633
00:58:44,139 --> 00:58:45,009
Mum, I'm so sorry.

634
00:58:45,053 --> 00:58:46,707
Stop.

635
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:49,405
What the fuck!

636
00:58:50,406 --> 00:58:51,581
Yeah.

637
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:52,974
So what does this mean?

638
00:58:53,017 --> 00:58:55,237
Oh, it means.. She's not a kid.

639
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,849
She is a grown woman and we
cannot underestimate her.

640
00:58:58,893 --> 00:59:00,827
No, she's more than that,
mother, she's a psychopath

641
00:59:00,851 --> 00:59:02,592
living in our fucking house.

642
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:05,160
Shh.

643
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:07,554
So we just have to
live with this person?

644
00:59:07,597 --> 00:59:09,251
I didn't say that.

645
00:59:09,294 --> 00:59:15,083
So then can we just, you know,
make it look like an accident?

646
00:59:15,736 --> 00:59:17,128
It's too soon.

647
00:59:17,172 --> 00:59:18,956
We need to think about this.

648
00:59:19,391 --> 00:59:20,436
So she just owns us now?

649
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:21,350
No, no.

650
00:59:21,393 --> 00:59:23,744
She has much to lose as we do.

651
00:59:23,787 --> 00:59:26,224
Look, neither of us
were expecting this.

652
00:59:26,268 --> 00:59:28,139
So for now, we just
keep an eye on her

653
00:59:28,183 --> 00:59:30,577
and when the time is right,
we'll end it.

654
00:59:31,186 --> 00:59:33,057
This is insane.

655
00:59:33,101 --> 00:59:34,624
Even for us.

656
01:00:18,189 --> 01:00:19,147
Cut.

657
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,800
See that, it's set in fire.

658
01:00:19,843 --> 01:00:21,062
Huh-uh.

659
01:00:21,105 --> 01:00:22,672
Pull it back, just like that.

660
01:00:22,716 --> 01:00:26,328
You get the bow, whip
it in and slide it.

661
01:00:26,371 --> 01:00:28,330
- See this, are you watching?
- Yeah.

662
01:00:28,373 --> 01:00:30,898
Yeah, and you.. Nice.

663
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:32,203
- You see that?
- Yeah, yeah.

664
01:00:32,247 --> 01:00:34,205
That's what I'm talking about.

665
01:00:34,249 --> 01:00:35,879
Our meeting with
Dr. Segar is today.

666
01:00:35,903 --> 01:00:38,514
A problem we wouldn't have if
you hadn't talked to the parrot.

667
01:00:38,557 --> 01:00:39,689
Sydney was a macaw.

668
01:00:39,733 --> 01:00:41,343
A what?

669
01:00:41,386 --> 01:00:42,823
All macaw's are parrots.

670
01:00:42,866 --> 01:00:45,390
But not all fucking
parrots are macaws.

671
01:00:48,785 --> 01:00:50,395
What are we gonna do about that?

672
01:00:52,267 --> 01:00:54,356
Oh, we make her believe.

673
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,879
Together.

674
01:00:57,228 --> 01:00:59,119
One of our goals here is
helping Esther acclimate back

675
01:00:59,143 --> 01:01:01,319
into life within
the family unit.

676
01:01:01,363 --> 01:01:03,931
Part of that is remembering
your shared history.

677
01:01:03,974 --> 01:01:07,151
Moments you had, the fun
things you did together before.

678
01:01:07,195 --> 01:01:09,588
Mr. Al bright, what's a memory
that means a lot to you

679
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,286
and to Esther?

680
01:01:11,329 --> 01:01:12,635
Oh, God, there are so many.

681
01:01:12,679 --> 01:01:14,768
Huh?

682
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,554
Um, there was
Christmas in Paris.

683
01:01:18,597 --> 01:01:19,816
The summer in Tuscany.

684
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:20,774
Yellowstone?

685
01:01:20,817 --> 01:01:22,166
Yeah, that's up there.

686
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:24,212
I was six.

687
01:01:24,255 --> 01:01:28,129
We saw bears.. And a, a
chipmunk stole my sandwich.

688
01:01:28,172 --> 01:01:30,218
Oh, my God, there were
so many chipmunks.

689
01:01:30,261 --> 01:01:31,828
Mm-hmm, what else, Esther?

690
01:01:31,872 --> 01:01:33,351
Be specific.

691
01:01:33,395 --> 01:01:36,224
We stayed at Elk Ridge
Ranch and rode horses.

692
01:01:36,267 --> 01:01:37,984
Mine was a pony named Nugget
and daddy's horse

693
01:01:38,008 --> 01:01:40,010
was called Stretch.

694
01:01:40,054 --> 01:01:43,187
And this one time when Stretch
leaned down to eat grass,

695
01:01:43,231 --> 01:01:45,624
daddy fell right over his
head onto the ground.

696
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:47,670
He had dirt all over his face.

697
01:01:47,714 --> 01:01:49,716
It was even in his teeth!

698
01:01:49,759 --> 01:01:50,997
I can't believe you're
telling this story.

699
01:01:51,021 --> 01:01:52,675
Oh, my God, it was in
your teeth for days.

700
01:01:54,111 --> 01:01:56,766
In summary Esther exhibits
a healthy outlook on life.

701
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:00,335
Especially re-entering
into this family unit.

702
01:02:00,378 --> 01:02:02,163
She's highly functioning.

703
01:02:02,206 --> 01:02:04,774
Emotionally well.

704
01:02:04,818 --> 01:02:06,733
That is all.

705
01:02:09,213 --> 01:02:10,954
There are people
coming over today.

706
01:02:10,998 --> 01:02:13,609
Just to see you.

707
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:18,788
They're friends of ours, who
knew Esther, so, enough with

708
01:02:18,832 --> 01:02:21,530
the glowering, okay?

709
01:02:21,573 --> 01:02:24,402
Esther is a lady.

710
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:29,625
Hmm.

711
01:02:29,668 --> 01:02:31,268
I think I'm gonna
have to do some damage.

712
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:37,546
Okay.

713
01:02:38,677 --> 01:02:40,244
I think we did good.

714
01:02:40,288 --> 01:02:42,812
Everyone expects
Esther to be broken.

715
01:02:42,856 --> 01:02:45,946
What they really want
is a happy ending.

716
01:02:45,989 --> 01:02:49,471
We are gonna pretend that
pink is your favorite color.

717
01:02:50,472 --> 01:02:52,256
Ooh, velvet.

718
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,823
The secret.

719
01:02:53,867 --> 01:02:56,608
Let's give them a story
they want to believe.

720
01:02:57,348 --> 01:02:59,916
This one is my favorite.

721
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:00,787
What's your favorite color?

722
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:02,353
Pink.

723
01:03:02,397 --> 01:03:04,051
Very, very good.

724
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:09,534
Now, you say you can paint.

725
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:10,797
What else can you do?

726
01:03:27,074 --> 01:03:28,858
I missed my family very much.

727
01:03:28,902 --> 01:03:31,600
It's lovely to be back.

728
01:03:31,643 --> 01:03:34,603
And what are your
plans now, young lady?

729
01:03:35,647 --> 01:03:38,172
What are my plans, mummy?

730
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:40,087
Absolutely nothing.

731
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:43,003
I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

732
01:04:07,114 --> 01:04:09,856
So let me get this straight.

733
01:04:09,899 --> 01:04:11,379
You're 30?

734
01:04:11,422 --> 01:04:13,207
Get out of my room, now, please.

735
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,469
It's not your room.

736
01:04:14,512 --> 01:04:16,036
It's my dead sister's room.

737
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:17,907
You're not her and
you never will be.

738
01:04:17,951 --> 01:04:19,387
Is that perfectly clear?

739
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:20,605
Fuck off.

740
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:22,694
Watch your mouth, freak.

741
01:04:22,738 --> 01:04:25,523
You know, I'm glad everything's
out in the open now.

742
01:04:25,567 --> 01:04:27,023
'Cause I'm done pretending
like you belong here.

743
01:04:27,047 --> 01:04:28,875
You don't.

744
01:04:29,963 --> 01:04:32,922
This is my house, my family.

745
01:04:32,966 --> 01:04:35,011
And it will never be yours.

746
01:04:35,055 --> 01:04:36,162
As long as you're
under this roof,

747
01:04:36,186 --> 01:04:38,188
you and I will have an
understanding.

748
01:04:38,232 --> 01:04:39,363
Here's what it is.

749
01:04:42,323 --> 01:04:44,803
I fucking own you.

750
01:04:47,415 --> 01:04:49,495
Do that again and I'll kill
you like I killed Esther.

751
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:56,728
One call from me, and you're
right back in that gulag.

752
01:04:56,772 --> 01:04:58,643
You'd go down too.

753
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:01,255
Why, because of what the
illegal immigrant fugitive

754
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:02,734
mental patient said?

755
01:05:04,475 --> 01:05:08,653
Good luck with that.

756
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:10,177
This is America.

757
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,614
People like me matter.

758
01:05:12,657 --> 01:05:14,703
And if you're not Esther,
ah, it just means

759
01:05:14,746 --> 01:05:16,357
Esther's missing again.

760
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,185
Mom has a problem with that.

761
01:05:18,228 --> 01:05:20,970
I don't.

762
01:05:21,014 --> 01:05:22,711
See you later, freak.

763
01:05:29,674 --> 01:05:33,548
You are gonna sleep
like a fucking baby tonight.

764
01:05:35,637 --> 01:05:39,467
I made roast lamb
with rosemary and tapenade.

765
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:41,034
And I know, Esther
doesn't like it.

766
01:05:41,077 --> 01:05:42,470
So I made your favorite.

767
01:05:42,513 --> 01:05:44,994
Oh, just like the old days.

768
01:05:45,038 --> 01:05:48,128
I'm really excited about
going into the city tomorrow.

769
01:05:48,171 --> 01:05:50,869
I'm gonna show the gallery
what I've been working on.

770
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,003
That sounds wonderful.

771
01:05:54,047 --> 01:05:55,154
Well, it's all thanks to you.

772
01:05:55,178 --> 01:05:56,701
Oh.

773
01:05:56,745 --> 01:05:58,375
I rediscovered the joy I once
felt doing what I loved.

774
01:05:58,399 --> 01:05:59,878
I feel like a kid again.

775
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:00,705
Do you wanna come?

776
01:06:00,749 --> 01:06:01,793
I would love to!

777
01:06:01,837 --> 01:06:04,013
Oh, Esther and I
already have plans.

778
01:06:04,057 --> 01:06:06,189
Oh.

779
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:08,539
What plans?

780
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:10,237
It's a surprise.

781
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,194
Okay.

782
01:06:11,238 --> 01:06:13,980
Well, another time then.

783
01:06:14,023 --> 01:06:15,522
It's great that you're
painting again, dad.

784
01:06:15,546 --> 01:06:18,332
Well, yeah.

785
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:20,421
May I be excused?

786
01:06:20,464 --> 01:06:24,686
Oh, don't forget your.. You
can eat upstairs, it's okay.

787
01:06:26,296 --> 01:06:28,211
Honey, hey, what's wrong?

788
01:06:28,255 --> 01:06:29,430
Dad, she's fine.

789
01:06:29,473 --> 01:06:30,561
Just give her some space.

790
01:06:30,605 --> 01:06:31,258
She's fine.

791
01:06:31,301 --> 01:06:32,737
Yeah.

792
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:34,701
She's probably tired from
all that piano playing.

793
01:07:08,121 --> 01:07:09,165
Can I come in?

794
01:07:09,209 --> 01:07:10,688
Mm-hmm.

795
01:07:10,732 --> 01:07:11,733
Are you okay?

796
01:07:11,776 --> 01:07:13,213
What happened down there?

797
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:18,305
I, uh, I don't really
like mummy's cooking.

798
01:07:20,481 --> 01:07:21,960
Can you keep a secret.

799
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:23,614
I'm not crazy about it either.

800
01:07:23,658 --> 01:07:27,314
Oh, listen, um, night time's
my favorite time to paint.

801
01:07:27,357 --> 01:07:28,793
Do you, you wanna come join me?

802
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:30,621
Yes, I would love to.

803
01:07:30,665 --> 01:07:32,275
I'll see you downstairs.

804
01:08:07,397 --> 01:08:08,964
This is a such a great space.

805
01:08:09,007 --> 01:08:10,966
I'm glad you like it.

806
01:08:11,009 --> 01:08:15,013
Every artist needs a space to
let their inner weirdo out.

807
01:08:15,927 --> 01:08:17,886
We get to see beauty, passion,

808
01:08:17,929 --> 01:08:20,236
where others don't
even know to look.

809
01:08:24,197 --> 01:08:25,502
I really like that.

810
01:08:39,037 --> 01:08:40,300
So much paint.

811
01:08:40,343 --> 01:08:41,866
Yeah, I'm a messy painter.

812
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,564
Drives your mother crazy.

813
01:08:48,351 --> 01:08:50,223
I think I'm, I think
I'm done for the night.

814
01:08:50,266 --> 01:08:51,528
Just turn the lights off.

815
01:08:51,572 --> 01:08:54,270
Have a good night.

816
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:14,812
Looks like you two had fun.

817
01:09:17,902 --> 01:09:18,947
He's right.

818
01:09:19,556 --> 01:09:20,949
You are talented.

819
01:09:24,605 --> 01:09:26,607
He is something, isn't he?

820
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,655
Are you so utterly
delusional to think that

821
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:33,222
he would want you?

822
01:09:34,832 --> 01:09:37,661
"Surprise, I'm not your
daughter, I'm a mutant grifter."

823
01:09:39,402 --> 01:09:41,187
He would be as repulsed
by you as I suspect

824
01:09:41,230 --> 01:09:42,797
most men are.

825
01:09:44,277 --> 01:09:47,889
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go upstairs

826
01:09:47,932 --> 01:09:50,108
and fuck my husband.

827
01:09:55,766 --> 01:09:57,768
He really is a new
man since you came back.

828
01:09:58,943 --> 01:09:59,943
Thanks for that.

829
01:10:36,807 --> 01:10:39,070
Hey, you.

830
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:11,886
Argh!

831
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:18,521
I think Esther's really
bummed about not coming to the

832
01:11:18,545 --> 01:11:20,808
gallery with me.

833
01:11:21,765 --> 01:11:23,830
Listen, I love that you and
Esther have painting in common.

834
01:11:23,854 --> 01:11:26,204
I just, I don't have
anything like that with her.

835
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:28,468
I was hoping that I could
spend the day with her

836
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,644
and maybe we could find
something to share.

837
01:11:30,687 --> 01:11:33,342
Plus it would be good for
you to be focused, right?

838
01:11:33,386 --> 01:11:36,476
I mean if Sals likes what he
sees then, maybe you get a show

839
01:11:36,519 --> 01:11:38,521
and you get back out there.

840
01:11:38,565 --> 01:11:40,436
Yeah, okay.

841
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,500
We're not hurting, are we?

842
01:11:41,524 --> 01:11:42,177
No, no.

843
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,918
Not at all.

844
01:11:43,961 --> 01:11:46,964
I.. You are a great painter.

845
01:11:47,008 --> 01:11:48,168
People miss seeing your work.

846
01:11:50,664 --> 01:11:52,318
Thank you.

847
01:11:54,102 --> 01:11:55,712
Is that bacon?

848
01:11:58,106 --> 01:12:00,282
Oh, it's heaven!

849
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,156
Good morning, daddy.

850
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,070
Crepe?

851
01:12:06,114 --> 01:12:07,202
Yes, please.

852
01:12:07,245 --> 01:12:08,986
Is there anything you can't do?

853
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,118
Mummy?

854
01:12:10,161 --> 01:12:11,162
Oh, no, thanks.

855
01:12:11,206 --> 01:12:13,208
I'm gonna make my
usual... Smoothie?

856
01:12:16,429 --> 01:12:20,781
Greek yogurt, kale, flax
seeds and lemon juice.

857
01:12:20,824 --> 01:12:22,696
Just the way you like it.

858
01:12:23,261 --> 01:12:25,002
Try it.

859
01:12:25,046 --> 01:12:27,396
I'm-I'm not really that hungry.

860
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,832
I'll-I'll have it.

861
01:12:28,876 --> 01:12:29,964
Here.

862
01:12:30,007 --> 01:12:31,748
No, this is special,
just for mummy.

863
01:12:31,792 --> 01:12:33,359
I made it for you.

864
01:12:33,402 --> 01:12:35,970
Oh, sweetie, that's
so nice of you.

865
01:12:36,013 --> 01:12:37,537
But I prefer to make my own.

866
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:38,842
Tricia, come on.

867
01:12:38,886 --> 01:12:41,192
Try it.

868
01:12:46,981 --> 01:12:49,462
Good.

869
01:12:49,505 --> 01:12:51,072
Delicious

870
01:12:51,638 --> 01:12:52,638
Thank you.

871
01:12:57,208 --> 01:12:58,209
Tricia, you okay?

872
01:12:58,253 --> 01:12:58,906
I'm good.

873
01:12:58,949 --> 01:13:00,211
Yeah?

874
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:16,378
I know you
wanted to come with me.

875
01:13:16,402 --> 01:13:17,814
But I think it'll be really
good for you to spend the day

876
01:13:17,838 --> 01:13:19,100
with your mom.

877
01:13:19,143 --> 01:13:20,425
I wanted to show you
something, though.

878
01:13:20,449 --> 01:13:21,449
Here.

879
01:13:24,975 --> 01:13:26,847
It's the one in the center.

880
01:13:30,154 --> 01:13:32,243
Dean at Woodley
is a friend of mine.

881
01:13:32,287 --> 01:13:34,332
Woodley is the best art
school in the country.

882
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:35,203
You're scary good, Esther.

883
01:13:35,246 --> 01:13:36,552
Can I show it to them?

884
01:13:36,596 --> 01:13:37,466
I would love it.

885
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:38,772
Thank you.

886
01:13:41,992 --> 01:13:43,405
Can you bring this
up to the platform.

887
01:13:43,429 --> 01:13:44,865
I'm just gonna get some coffee.

888
01:13:44,908 --> 01:13:46,475
Just for mom and dad.

889
01:13:46,519 --> 01:13:47,868
Mm-hmm.

890
01:13:47,911 --> 01:13:49,271
Okay. I'll see
you up there.

891
01:14:53,977 --> 01:14:55,849
Watch where you're going, kid!

892
01:14:55,892 --> 01:14:56,589
Does she belong to you?

893
01:14:56,632 --> 01:14:58,068
Yes, she does.

894
01:14:58,634 --> 01:14:59,592
What happened?

895
01:14:59,635 --> 01:15:00,375
Oh, nothing.
It's fine.

896
01:15:00,418 --> 01:15:01,463
Esther tripped.

897
01:15:01,507 --> 01:15:02,527
Sorry, it took forever.

898
01:15:02,551 --> 01:15:03,552
No, no.

899
01:15:03,596 --> 01:15:05,075
Knock 'em dead, okay?

900
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:07,774
Daddy, take me with you.

901
01:15:07,817 --> 01:15:08,514
Oh, honey, I wish.

902
01:15:08,557 --> 01:15:09,166
Next time.

903
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:10,298
Alright?

904
01:15:10,341 --> 01:15:11,255
Alright, you're gonna
miss your train.

905
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:12,339
See you later, honey.
Ciao.

906
01:15:19,568 --> 01:15:20,569
Easy, mom.

907
01:15:20,613 --> 01:15:22,136
You think you can
fucking kill me?

908
01:15:23,267 --> 01:15:25,618
Take this.

909
01:15:25,661 --> 01:15:27,445
Tastes like fucking garbage.

910
01:15:27,794 --> 01:15:29,709
Our arrangement is over.

911
01:15:29,752 --> 01:15:30,752
You're fucking dead.

912
01:15:33,016 --> 01:15:34,148
Hey!

913
01:15:40,981 --> 01:15:42,852
Argh!

914
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:45,550
Mom!

915
01:15:45,638 --> 01:15:46,856
Mom!

916
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:49,119
Oh, fuck!

917
01:15:49,163 --> 01:15:50,251
Bitch!

918
01:15:59,782 --> 01:16:01,523
Open the goddamn door.

919
01:16:01,567 --> 01:16:03,394
Esther!

920
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:05,396
Sweetie, come on.

921
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:06,875
Don't you...

922
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:25,346
I'm sorry. Was I
driving too fast?

923
01:17:25,955 --> 01:17:27,696
You must be Esther.

924
01:17:34,921 --> 01:17:36,531
I need to go to the hospital.

925
01:17:36,574 --> 01:17:38,054
You're fine.

926
01:17:38,098 --> 01:17:40,119
It feels like I'm being stabbed
a thousand fucking times.

927
01:17:40,143 --> 01:17:41,710
Officer Leahy!

928
01:17:41,754 --> 01:17:43,190
Oh, my God!

929
01:17:43,233 --> 01:17:44,515
Can you just be quiet
for like two seconds.

930
01:17:44,539 --> 01:17:45,845
What?

931
01:17:45,888 --> 01:17:46,628
We've located, Esther.

932
01:17:46,672 --> 01:17:47,411
You did!

933
01:17:47,455 --> 01:17:48,108
I'm bringing her home.

934
01:17:48,151 --> 01:17:49,326
Oh.

935
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:50,739
Oh, and I've informed
Allen as well.

936
01:17:50,763 --> 01:17:52,503
Okay, bye.

937
01:17:52,547 --> 01:17:53,679
Fuck!

938
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:55,201
You're okay.

939
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:56,463
You're okay.

940
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:58,596
Thank you so much.

941
01:18:01,425 --> 01:18:02,688
Oh, my goodness.

942
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:05,299
Oh.

943
01:18:09,259 --> 01:18:10,696
Thank you so much.

944
01:18:12,306 --> 01:18:15,396
Esther's behavior has been so
erratic since she got back.

945
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,095
To be honest, it's
been really hard.

946
01:18:19,139 --> 01:18:20,706
I mean there's constant lying

947
01:18:20,749 --> 01:18:22,708
and these outbursts of
anger and...

948
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,817
Sometimes she even jokes
about hurting herself

949
01:18:25,841 --> 01:18:28,278
and I don't think she's
really joking.

950
01:18:28,714 --> 01:18:29,366
You have her in therapy?

951
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:31,020
Yes, yes.

952
01:18:34,632 --> 01:18:35,677
Look who's back.

953
01:18:46,296 --> 01:18:47,471
Get up.

954
01:18:48,211 --> 01:18:49,996
We're doing this... now.

955
01:18:50,039 --> 01:18:52,172
Well, it's about goddamn time.

956
01:19:20,069 --> 01:19:21,592
Fuck.

957
01:19:22,332 --> 01:19:24,247
I am done with you.

958
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:26,162
Nothing is worth having
you in this house.

959
01:19:45,834 --> 01:19:49,490
Your suicide is gonna
break daddy's heart.

960
01:19:49,533 --> 01:19:50,533
But he'll get over it.

961
01:19:53,799 --> 01:19:54,799
Uck!

962
01:19:55,888 --> 01:19:57,280
Ah! Aaagh!

963
01:20:12,034 --> 01:20:13,731
Just die, you freak!

964
01:20:24,438 --> 01:20:26,309
Where is she?

965
01:20:27,876 --> 01:20:29,486
I, uh, I, uh, I didn't mean to.

966
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:30,444
Oh, that's just brilliant.

967
01:20:30,487 --> 01:20:33,099
It just happened.

968
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:42,499
Tricia.

969
01:20:42,543 --> 01:20:43,631
Hi, honey.

970
01:20:43,674 --> 01:20:44,738
The police just called me.

971
01:20:44,762 --> 01:20:45,720
Oh, I know.

972
01:20:45,763 --> 01:20:47,156
I'm, I'm sorry.

973
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,766
It was my fault.

974
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,595
Esther wandered off at the
store and I-I just, I panicked.

975
01:20:51,639 --> 01:20:53,641
But I called Officer Leahy
and, and they found her.

976
01:20:53,684 --> 01:20:54,990
- Oh, good.
- Mom.

977
01:20:55,034 --> 01:20:56,383
What?

978
01:20:56,426 --> 01:20:57,819
Well, I'm-I'm on the train..

979
01:20:57,863 --> 01:21:00,561
Hold on.

980
01:21:00,604 --> 01:21:02,780
I'm-I'm coming back home.
I'll be...

981
01:21:04,565 --> 01:21:06,784
Go downstairs and finish it.

982
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:08,830
What?

983
01:21:08,874 --> 01:21:11,137
Go downstairs and finish it.

984
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:13,139
Tricia, are you still there?

985
01:21:13,182 --> 01:21:15,619
Tricia, is everything okay?

986
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:17,143
Tricia, I-I'm coming home now.

987
01:21:17,186 --> 01:21:18,013
What?

988
01:21:18,057 --> 01:21:19,145
I'm coming home.

989
01:21:19,188 --> 01:21:20,015
Uh, what about your
meeting with Sal?

990
01:21:20,059 --> 01:21:21,234
Forget about that.

991
01:21:21,277 --> 01:21:22,689
No, sweetie, I swear
everything is fine.

992
01:21:22,713 --> 01:21:23,584
Esther is here.

993
01:21:23,627 --> 01:21:25,412
All is well.

994
01:21:25,455 --> 01:21:27,457
But I'm almost at
the station now.

995
01:21:27,501 --> 01:21:28,545
Okay.

996
01:21:28,589 --> 01:21:30,373
Well, can you please
take a cab home?

997
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:33,115
Because I really have
my hands full here.

998
01:21:34,812 --> 01:21:41,602
Yeah.

999
01:21:41,645 --> 01:21:42,951
No.

1000
01:21:42,995 --> 01:21:44,387
Fuck it.

1001
01:21:52,787 --> 01:21:54,441
There you are.

1002
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:24,862
Esther.

1003
01:22:28,866 --> 01:22:31,652
Come on out, Esther.

1004
01:22:32,435 --> 01:22:33,959
Or whatever the
fuck your name is.

1005
01:22:40,008 --> 01:22:44,404
You know.. It doesn't
have to be like this.

1006
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:47,842
Really, Gunnar?

1007
01:22:53,021 --> 01:22:55,067
I'm sure we could
figure something out.

1008
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:57,895
You really believe that?

1009
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:01,334
Honestly, no.

1010
01:23:01,377 --> 01:23:02,900
Me neither.

1011
01:23:03,814 --> 01:23:04,814
Shit.

1012
01:23:31,103 --> 01:23:33,192
Gunnar?

1013
01:23:36,673 --> 01:23:37,673
No.

1014
01:23:38,588 --> 01:23:39,850
No.

1015
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:46,596
What, what have you done?

1016
01:23:46,944 --> 01:23:48,076
What have you done?

1017
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:35,879
You've taken everything.

1018
01:25:37,229 --> 01:25:39,187
Allen will never be yours.

1019
01:25:40,536 --> 01:25:44,540
But I can promise you this,
he'll know who you are.

1020
01:25:44,584 --> 01:25:48,283
The deformed freak who
manipulated our grief,

1021
01:25:48,327 --> 01:25:53,941
murdered my son and
tried to kill me.

1022
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:57,249
Until I did what had to be done.

1023
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,200
Call the fire department.

1024
01:27:06,709 --> 01:27:07,709
Gunnar!

1025
01:27:09,321 --> 01:27:10,583
Gunnar!

1026
01:27:14,717 --> 01:27:16,545
Aaagh!

1027
01:27:18,504 --> 01:27:19,504
Do it!

1028
01:27:28,035 --> 01:27:29,341
Hold on, I'm coming.

1029
01:27:32,822 --> 01:27:34,737
Daddy, mommy tried to hurt me!

1030
01:27:34,781 --> 01:27:36,304
Allen!

1031
01:27:36,348 --> 01:27:38,263
Please help!

1032
01:27:38,654 --> 01:27:39,786
Allen!

1033
01:27:39,829 --> 01:27:41,048
Don't let go.

1034
01:27:41,091 --> 01:27:42,615
I can't hold on much longer.

1035
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:44,181
I'm losing my grip.

1036
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:48,577
- Da-daddy, help!
- Hang on.

1037
01:27:49,361 --> 01:27:50,623
I'm coming.

1038
01:27:51,145 --> 01:27:52,059
She's not Esther!

1039
01:27:52,102 --> 01:27:53,016
She's a grown woman!

1040
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:54,061
- She's lying!
- What?

1041
01:27:54,104 --> 01:27:55,758
- She tricked us!
- Mommy is lying!

1042
01:27:55,802 --> 01:27:57,722
- Give me your hand.
- No, daddy, please help me.

1043
01:28:01,329 --> 01:28:03,157
Tricia!

1044
01:28:46,853 --> 01:28:48,550
What the fuck?

1045
01:28:48,594 --> 01:28:50,204
I did this for you.

1046
01:28:50,247 --> 01:28:51,423
For us.

1047
01:28:51,466 --> 01:28:52,989
So we could be together.

1048
01:28:53,033 --> 01:28:55,035
Allen, I love you.

1049
01:28:55,427 --> 01:28:56,863
Who the fuck are you?

1050
01:28:56,906 --> 01:28:58,255
You're a monster!

1051
01:28:59,953 --> 01:29:02,085
Allen!

1052
01:31:10,736 --> 01:31:12,868
The fire took
everything from Esther.

1053
01:31:12,912 --> 01:31:15,131
Her home, her family.

1054
01:31:15,175 --> 01:31:17,786
The whole situation
is so tragic.

1055
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:20,223
It's horrifying.

1056
01:31:20,267 --> 01:31:22,008
I know.

1057
01:31:22,051 --> 01:31:24,837
As if Esther hasn't been
through enough already.

1058
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,666
Abducted, and now an orphan.

1059
01:31:28,536 --> 01:31:31,104
With no family to take her in?

1060
01:31:31,147 --> 01:31:32,888
What will happen now?

1061
01:31:34,586 --> 01:31:38,546
I've reached out to
a reputable adoption agency.

1062
01:31:38,590 --> 01:31:42,158
I'm confident we'll find a
home where Esther can get the

1063
01:31:42,202 --> 01:31:45,597
support and love she deserves.

1064
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:49,992
After all who wouldn't
want to adopt her?
