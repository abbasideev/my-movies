1
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,980
Guess what.

2
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,820
What?

3
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,950
I can't move.

4
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,220
Yeah, well, you don't have to.NYou're in a car.

5
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,030
Am I driving?

6
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,170
Like a pro.

7
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,860
Come on, wake up, you fuck.NCome on.

8
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,370
Did you try to help him get free?

9
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,000
Briefly.

10
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,610
Briefly?

11
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,910
When it came down to it, my lifeNwas more important to me than his.

12
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,380
Selfish, huh?

13
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,960
We found these...

14
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,290
...in your Spider.

15
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,440
Actually, I don't drive a SpiderNanymore.

16
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,000
Now I have a C8 Laviolette.

17
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,270
It's lighter, faster...

18
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,380
...swims better.

19
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,130
Right.

20
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,000
These three contain tracesNof ketamine...

21
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,110
...the same as we found in your bloodNand his.

22
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,510
This one had pure D-Tubocurarine,NDTC...

23
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,380
...which we only found in him.

24
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,610
Must've been somethingNhe took at the party.

25
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,310
No. DTC is not a party drug.

26
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,860
Along with the other stuff in his blood,Nit paralyzed his lungs.

27
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,320
Kevin Franks did not drown.

28
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,370
He had already stopped breathingNby the time you drove off the road.

29
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,660
He was breathingNwhen we went off the road.

30
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,860
How do you know?

31
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,440
He was making me come.

32
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,970
What? You were having sexNat 100 miles an hour?

33
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,110
Hundred and ten.NI must've hit a pothole.

34
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,680
Your friend, Dickie Pep...

35
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,550
...says he sold you 15 millilitersNof DTC last Thursday.

36
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,460
I don't know any Dickie Pep,Nbut he's lying.

37
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,690
Or you are.

38
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,900
Why would he lie?

39
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,630
You got him on some other chargeNand he's trying to deal his way out.

40
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,170
If he even exists.

41
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,010
You don't seem too upset by what'sNhappened.

42
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,440
Of course I am, I'm traumatized.

43
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,380
Who knows if I'll ever come again?

44
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
I want that cunt in jail.

45
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,820
We haven't got a case, Roy.

46
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:52,120
Well, just fucking make one. Please.

47
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,890
They'll order a psychiatric for bail.

48
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,940
I'll make sure we get somebodyNgood and tough.

49
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,060
Dr. Glass. I'm Henry Rose,NMiss Tramell's solicitor.

50
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,500
This is Catherine Tramell.

51
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,740
I shall be present duringNthe evaluation.

52
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,100
Well, that's fine by me.

53
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,680
I'll be asking fairly personal questions.NIf she doesn't mind your presence....

54
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,180
My client understands and agreesNI should be present for--

55
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,410
Maybe Dr. Glass is rightNand we should be alone for this.

56
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,520
I strongly advise youNnot to contemplate having--

57
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,390
So is this whereNwe're going to do it?

58
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,970
Mr. Rose told you the purposeNof this evaluation.

59
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,550
I'm applying for bail in a murder case.

60
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,590
The Crown wants to knowNif I'm a danger to myself or others.

61
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,850
You're the Crown's shrink,Nso you'll say I'm dangerous.

62
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,120
My shrink will say I'm not,Nand the judge will flip a coin.

63
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,860
Anything you tell me can be quotedNverbatim in testimony...

64
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,360
...and can affect your case.

65
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,200
You can quote me all you want.

66
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,370
Thank you.

67
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,110
Well, I see that you're a writer.

68
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,140
What do you write about?

69
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,080
Murder, sex, violence.

70
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,510
Do you ever write about yourself?

71
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,690
Not into autobiography.

72
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,220
Really? Why not?

73
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,660
Maybe I like to just sit back and getNother people to reveal themselves.

74
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,330
For instance,Nyou look a little divorced.

75
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,960
What makes you think I'm divorced?

76
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,260
The ring line hasn't faded.

77
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,930
You're very observant.

78
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,050
Yeah, but am I wrong?

79
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,410
Would it bother youNif you were wrong?

80
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,780
Would it bother you if I was right?

81
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,880
Tell me something you're afraid of.

82
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,060
Boredom.

83
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,100
Is that why you like to take risks?

84
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,370
I do like to take risks.

85
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,870
Like taking drugs and having sexNin a speeding car?

86
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,100
Like talking to meNwithout having your lawyer present?

87
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,020
Actually, that was your idea.

88
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,420
Like being on trial for murder? That'sNrisky. You could end up in prison.

89
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,680
Not if I'm innocent.

90
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,290
Innocent people end up in prisonNall the time.

91
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,090
Not rich, innocent people who areNrepresented by Henry Rose.

92
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,530
In that case, it isn't really excitingNunless you're guilty.

93
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,700
Oh, I bet you like to take risks,Ndon't you, Dr. Glass?

94
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,430
But I'm not the one who's on trialNfor murder.

95
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,080
Not yet.

96
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,210
Sorry, you're not allowedNto smoke in here.

97
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,430
You know what I like about you?

98
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,430
You enjoy being in control.

99
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,030
Like me.

100
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,060
Sorry, sir. Can't let you through here.

101
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,530
Well, I would say extremely intelligent.NGifted, accomplished.

102
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,030
Yet inside, I believe...

103
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,830
...she vacillates betweenNa feeling of godlike omnipotence...

104
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,840
...and a senseNthat she simply doesn't exist...

105
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,240
...which, of course, is intolerable.

106
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,280
Do you consider Miss Tramell to beNmentally impaired?

107
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,420
Not by legal definition, no. Not at all.

108
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,060
If released, is she likelyNto commit a violent crime?

109
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,230
I believe her behavior is drivenNby what we call a risk addiction.

110
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,130
A compulsive need to prove to herselfNthat she can take risks...

111
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,360
...and survive dangers others can't.

112
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,570
Especially the subsequent encountersNwith the police or the powers that be.

113
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,570
Why would a person do that?

114
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,480
The greater the risk, the greater theNproof of her omnipotence.

115
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,940
Her existence, really.

116
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,680
When you say she hasNa risk addiction...

117
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,360
...is this condition likely to getNworse?

118
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,030
All addiction is progressive.

119
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,790
The addict always needs to takeNgreater risks.

120
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,430
If other people are hurt or killed...

121
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,000
...as a result of her behavior,Nthat's not likely to stop her?

122
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,730
I think the only thingNthat'd stop her....

123
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,380
I suspect the only limit for herNwould be her own death.

124
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,110
Then she is a danger to herself.

125
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,420
Yes, I believe she is.

126
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,370
Nice work, Michael. Well done.

127
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,440
Dr. Glass, did Catherine TramellNkill Kevin Franks?

128
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,070
No, I can't make any comment, sorry.

129
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,640
Can you please tell us about the bail?

130
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,450
Dr. Michael Glass. What a big thingNyou are all of a sudden.

131
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:02,150
What are you doing here, Adam?NDon't say you're writing about Tramell.

132
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,160
A sexy, omnipotent killerNwith a Random House contract.

133
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,490
Why would I write that?

134
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,250
You don't know she's a killer.

135
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,060
No, but I hope she is, though.NI mean, I pray to God she is.

136
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,290
By the way, I hear you wereNbrilliant in there.

137
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,670
You're so lucid sometimes,Nit's just disgusting.

138
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,040
You thought about daytime television?

139
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,770
Denise always says you were bornNfor the small screen.

140
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,680
And how is my wife these days?NHaving fun?

141
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,220
Ex-wife, Michael. Ex-wife.

142
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,790
While we're chatting about killers...

143
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,090
...is there any chance of talking aboutNGeorge Cheslav?

144
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,200
Who told you about Cheslav?

145
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,630
Denise?

146
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,100
That's got to be any shrink's worstNnightmare.

147
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,360
A patient in your careNsuddenly runs amok...

148
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,440
...beats his girlfriend to deathNwith a brick.

149
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,300
That was seven years ago,Nwhy talk about it now?

150
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,500
Not quite seven, actually.NSeven in July.

151
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:00,670
But you talked to him twice a week.NHe never indicated he'd harm the girl?

152
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,320
I don't talk about my patients.

153
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,220
Cheslav's dead. Can't you talkNabout them when they're dead?

154
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,120
No, not even when they're dead.

155
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,160
Michael, what are you doing here?

156
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,690
What did you tell Adam TowersNabout George Cheslav?

157
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,330
Nothing.

158
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,740
Can you give us a minute?

159
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,860
He already knew.

160
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,340
Really? Because he said you told him.

161
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,640
No, all I said was--

162
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,290
If he writes about that, if he puts itNon his magazine cover--

163
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,480
He won't. You're just being paranoid.

164
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,160
You didn't do anything wrong.

165
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,690
Right. I didn't. I was treating a patientNthat killed his pregnant girlfriend.

166
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,800
End of story.NYou make sure he gets that.

167
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,360
Don't worry.

168
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,900
I'm up for the Douglas ChairNat the university.

169
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,010
You know what that means to me.NDo you think this is going to help?

170
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,980
I can't tell Adam what to write.

171
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,150
Why not?

172
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,320
Don't be stupid.

173
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,460
I think you're entitled to since you'veNbeen fucking him for over a year.

174
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,590
Do you think I didn't knowNwhen it started?

175
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,320
It's a pity you never asked yourselfNwhy it started.

176
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,540
How was the court caseNwith the mystery writer?

177
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,340
I hear she looks fabulous.

178
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,380
Also very intelligent.NPathological liar. Narcissistic.

179
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,880
Seductive, manipulative.

180
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,210
Do you think she killed the footballer?

181
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,390
I have no idea.

182
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,620
Everything she does is so perfectlyNcomposed.

183
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,300
It's designed to confuseNor confound you.

184
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,590
You never know what's truthNand what isn't. She's brilliant, really.

185
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,830
The masked psychotic. Your favorite.

186
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,500
I'm already working it into a paper:N"Risk Addiction and Omnipotence."

187
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,970
You're writing another already?

188
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,510
I'm writing two,Nbut this is the more interesting.

189
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,410
I'll catch you up.

190
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,910
Hello?

191
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,710
Glass? It's Roy Washburn.NAre you near a television set?

192
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,680
If you'll be quiet, I'll make aNstatement.

193
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,860
What happened?

194
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,320
The judge let her go.

195
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,580
Let her go? Why?

196
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,060
The guy who saidNhe sold her the DTC...

197
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,360
...the judge found out he'd perjuredNhimself in another case...

198
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,300
...and disqualified him as a witness.NBut I'll make you a bet.

199
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,490
What's that?

200
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,970
She'll do it again.

201
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,270
And soon.

202
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,470
Only this timeNI will fucking nail the bitch.

203
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,600
So we've been considering those whoNwish to control others...

204
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,900
...through their insecurity and theirNnarcissism.

205
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,540
To study NietzscheNpsychobiographically may seem naive.

206
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,140
Wasn't it Nietzsche's work itself,Nwhich...

207
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,410
...through deconstructive andNpost-structuralist readings...

208
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,140
...induced the death ofNpsychobiography?

209
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,460
Paul Portman said he might goNto Tavistock. I'm thinking I might go.

210
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,120
Just be patient.NStay where you are for about a year.

211
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,030
-But there's nothing holding me.N-Trust me.

212
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,470
You know Dr. Gerst?

213
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,570
Michael Glass.

214
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,540
It's a pleasure.

215
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,140
I saw your review of my book.

216
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,040
You didn't understand what I wasNsaying about the analytic field.

217
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,410
Towards the end you made one or twoNinteresting remarks.

218
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,320
Maybe one of these daysNwe can discuss it.

219
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,060
I'd be honored. Thank you very much.

220
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,460
"One or two interesting remarks"?

221
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,900
That was a compliment, Michelle.NDr. Gerst was very impressed.

222
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,470
And it appears that our MichaelNhas just been knighted.

223
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,940
Cheers.

224
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,610
Congratulations.

225
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,810
Excuse me. Dr. Glass?

226
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,420
I'm Peter Ristedes.NAdam Towers' assistant.

227
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,850
Urbane magazine.

228
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,990
Mind if I join you?

229
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,790
Adam asked me to see if you'd give usNa quote for the article he's writing.

230
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,970
I believe he mentioned it to you.

231
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,300
He didn't seem to thinkNyou'd want to talk to him.

232
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,910
I'll take that as a "no comment," then?

233
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,860
Dr. Glass?

234
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,210
Miss Tramell.

235
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,040
What are you doing here?

236
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,410
I wanted to talk to you.

237
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,410
About the evaluation.

238
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,950
Some of the things you said,NI've been thinking about them a lot.

239
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,760
I'm sorry you had to hear all that.

240
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,700
Got a minute?

241
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,110
Come through.

242
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:58,420
What you said about meNbeing addicted to risk...

243
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,820
...about having to do more and moreNdangerous things....

244
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,330
Well, after you said it...

245
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,260
...I realized I was...

246
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,990
...scared.

247
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,760
What exactly scared you?

248
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,480
For weeks before the accidentNI was having the same...

249
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,540
...fantasy over and over again.

250
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,980
I even wrote about it.

251
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:32,350
The woman's driving in the car,Nthe man's making her come.

252
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,290
She drives off the road,Nthe man's killed.

253
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,070
I feel like maybe I made it all happen.

254
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,770
That's why I'm here.

255
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,870
Are you saying you'd like toNgo into treatment?

256
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,870
Yeah.

257
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,480
Well, I think that's a very good idea.

258
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,950
I wouldn't be able to treat you, but l'dNbe happy to refer you to a colleague.

259
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,420
Why can't you treat me?

260
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,080
It's not advisable for a doctor who'sNdone a forensic evaluation...

261
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,260
...to then become that person'sNtherapist.

262
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,430
Why not?

263
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,070
Therapy requires a great deal of trust,Nwhich is difficult for most people.

264
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,000
It's best to start with a clean slate.

265
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,700
You mean you don't trust me.

266
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,480
What I said about you at the hearingNmust have seemed very negative.

267
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,580
I'm sure you've got feelings about that.

268
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,380
I'd be happy referring youNto another doctor.

269
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,380
This is Dr. Milena Gardosh.NShe has a clinic here in London.

270
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,390
You want to know the truth?

271
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:40,290
The reason I agreed to the evaluationNwas because I thought it would be fun.

272
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,830
I never....

273
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,360
I never talked to anyone who....

274
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,750
My patient's here.

275
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,590
What do I owe you?

276
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,820
You don't owe me anything.

277
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:18,940
But if you'd like to call Dr. Gardosh,NI'm sure she can help you.

278
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,130
I don't shop around.

279
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,500
Like you said,Ntrust is very hard to come by.

280
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,480
I was hoping I might find it with you.

281
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,950
Listen, why don't weNschedule another meeting.

282
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,720
And then we can talk about thisNwhen we're not so rushed.

283
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,710
You look different today. More relaxed.

284
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,380
The more nervous I am,Nthe more relaxed people think I am.

285
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,080
I wanted to talk about something youNbrought up last Wednesday.

286
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,880
You said before the accident...

287
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:45,030
...you had fantasies of sexualNexcitement and driving off the road.

288
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,890
Do you often have fantasies like that?

289
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,960
I have fantasies all the time.

290
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,870
Fantasies involving violence, death?

291
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,030
People die in my novels.

292
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,210
I have to think of new and interestingNways to kill them.

293
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,770
What happens whenNyou don't take risks?

294
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:17,290
I'm sorry, there's no smoking in here.NIt's a rule.

295
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,960
I don't like rules.

296
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,530
I have some of them,Nand that's one of them.

297
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,570
After the hearing...

298
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,800
...I was interviewed by a reporterNfrom Urbane magazine.

299
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,910
Adam Towers. He said he knew you.

300
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,920
Slightly. Why?

301
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,950
He told me about the Cheslav case.

302
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,030
I was impressed by what you did.

303
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,530
You knew Cheslav was dangerous.

304
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,970
Still you protected him.

305
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,640
You honored his confidentiality...

306
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,840
...even at risk to yourself.

307
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,180
Do you think you made the rightNdecision?

308
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,480
Or do you think you fucked up?

309
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,350
Given what I knew at the time,NI made the right decision.

310
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,860
So you still believe in confidentiality.

311
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,740
Within legal limits.NWhat exactly are you concerned with?

312
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,770
If I told youNthat I killed Kevin Franks...

313
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,680
...would you report me to the police?

314
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,920
No.

315
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,420
Anything that happened in the past,NI wouldn't discuss outside this room.

316
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,860
But if you told me you were going toNmurder someone specifically...

317
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,330
...and I thought you were serious...

318
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,970
...then, yes, I'd go to the police.

319
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,340
I might be manipulating youNto create risk for myself.

320
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,750
Do you want to talk aboutNwhat happened to Kevin?

321
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,720
No, not really.

322
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,790
I was just checking your policy.

323
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,820
So have you decided?

324
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,030
About taking me on as a patient.

325
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,700
Shooter had an ex-wife,Na drinking problem...

326
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:40,870
...a drug problem, a complicated sexNproblem he was barely aware of.

327
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,980
And a tremendous amount ofNfree-floating rage.

328
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:48,180
In short, he was a copNand a very good one.

329
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,480
On March 3rd....

330
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,220
The woman knelt nakedNat the foot of the bed.

331
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,660
Her back to him, her head on a pillow.

332
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,200
Shooter raked his fingers through herNblond hair and twisted it tight.

333
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,500
She groaned, her breath catching...

334
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,900
...as he suddenly yanked her hair likeNa rider pulling on a horse's mane.

335
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,770
The veins on his arms bulged asNhe roughly drew her onto him.

336
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,540
Do you rememberNthat cop Washburn?

337
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:21,150
T o him, the fact that I wasn't upsetNabout Kevin Franks...

338
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,090
...was proof that I must've killed him.

339
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,960
Then, when I wouldn't break down...

340
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,230
...he hit on me.

341
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,430
Hit on you?

342
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,700
Yeah.

343
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:39,310
He said that if I fucked him thingsNwould go easier.

344
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,450
Homicide copsNare usually smarter than that.

345
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,850
I knew one once, in San Francisco.

346
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,460
Nick Curran.

347
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,680
They called him Shooter.

348
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,190
We used to get in his carNand ride around...

349
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,590
...Listening to 911 calls on hisNscanner...

350
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,560
...then speed over.

351
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:07,330
Have you ever been to a murder sceneNright after it happened?

352
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,740
The body's still warm.

353
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,550
The watch is still ticking.

354
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,740
You can smell the blood.

355
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,420
We'd hang aroundNfor a while and then...

356
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,120
...go have sex in Nick's car.

357
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,230
Nick used to say:

358
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,900
"Death is always there.NIt's the only thing that's real."

359
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,270
Except maybe sex sometimes.

360
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,070
But only sometimes?

361
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,080
Well...

362
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,620
...I fucked this guy last night.

363
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,980
I fucked him for hours.

364
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,920
You know,Nwe did everything to each other.

365
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:04,530
The full screaming MastersNand Johnson's greatest hits.

366
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,500
But you know, a week from now,NI probably won't even remember him.

367
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,540
But, if I was with him when he died....

368
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,380
Now...

369
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,680
...I probably would never forget that.

370
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,920
Would l?

371
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,250
Were you ever with anyoneNwhen they died?

372
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,690
No.

373
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,070
Christ.

374
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,180
We still have 20 minutes left.

375
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,510
I feel like a cigarette.

376
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,410
See you tomorrow.

377
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,820
She just walked out?

378
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,080
How Lacanian.

379
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,090
For her, time's a weapon.

380
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,280
Everything's a weapon.NEverybody's an enemy.

381
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,460
Do you think she made it up aboutNthe policeman? Washburn?

382
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:12,230
I don't know. It's so hard to believeNanything she says.

383
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,200
She's trying to seduce you.

384
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,430
They always try to seduce you.

385
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,310
Yes, but this one's different, isn't it?

386
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,480
I don't know. More fun maybe.

387
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,680
Be careful, Michael.

388
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,050
By the way, I got a call from thatNreporter, Adam Towers.

389
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,550
What did he want?

390
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,430
I made everything sound boring.NI assured him he didn't have a story.

391
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,330
What if he calls others?NWhat if he calls Gerst?

392
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,630
Gerst won't talk to a popular magazineNreporter. Are you kidding?

393
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,780
Anyway, it was a successful paper.

394
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,690
Published, on this occasion,Nunder sole authorship.

395
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,560
Well, thank God for that.

396
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,890
Speaking of God, is Gerst coming?

397
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,070
We can only hope and pray.

398
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,430
That he comes or he doesn't?

399
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:20,440
I'm going for a smoke. Don't talk aboutNanything interesting till I get back.

400
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,500
How long have you lived here?

401
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,310
About six years, something like that.NSeven.

402
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,590
Hi, Dominic.

403
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,960
Hi, Milena.

404
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,170
Thank you.

405
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,410
The beauty aboutNantisocial behavior...

406
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:58,140
...is that it takes you away from otherNpeople, however briefly.

407
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,950
You're not an analyst.

408
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,760
I'm a writer.

409
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,390
Really? What do you write about?

410
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,620
Oh, the lurid, the sexual, the violent.

411
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,530
The basic instincts.

412
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,430
They're the most powerful,Naren't they?

413
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,080
Milena.

414
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,580
Oh, Michael.

415
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,220
I'm sorry, I didn't ask your name.

416
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,590
Catherine Tramell. Milena Gardosh.

417
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,190
Oh, you're Dr. Gardosh.

418
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,420
I've heard so many wonderful thingsNabout you.

419
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,970
Catherine.

420
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,540
There you are.

421
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:56,040
Milena, Dr. Glass.NI see you've met Catherine.

422
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,710
She's doing research for a novel aboutNan eminent psychoanalyst.

423
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,890
I thought she might enjoy an occasionNlike this.

424
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,450
Well, may I take your coats?

425
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,690
Thank you.

426
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,190
Excuse me.

427
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,030
Would you put that in my pocket?

428
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,770
Certainly.

429
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,070
Catherine, come this way.

430
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,470
What's going on? What was GerstNthinking of, bringing her here?

431
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,080
I'm sure he's no idea who she is.

432
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,010
Where did he meet her?

433
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,480
She would have met him, believe me.

434
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,150
I can't stay here while I've gotNa patient here. I have to go.

435
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,590
I understand.

436
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,070
If you follow inter-subjectivity to itsNnatural end...

437
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:52,430
...aren't you asking who's the patientNand who's the doctor?

438
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,500
Those were my very words.

439
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,000
Very good.

440
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,630
Note that one for future reference.

441
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,250
Are you leaving because of me?

442
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,630
You must have known I'd be here.

443
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,660
Is that a problem?

444
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:22,060
I know some people who play tennisNwith their shrinks.

445
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,670
I'm sure you do.

446
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:27,930
Have sex with them. Sell them drugs.NWork on their screenplays.

447
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,700
But I don't do that.

448
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:34,680
I was upset about our session today.

449
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,850
I felt I owed you an apology.

450
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,250
That's why I came.

451
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,980
We can go into that tomorrow.

452
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,460
I've got a better idea.

453
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,720
How about I ditch everybodyNand we go somewhere for a drink.

454
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,800
I told you, I don't socialize with myNpatients.

455
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,570
Another one of your rules?

456
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,140
Don't you get kind of tired of them?

457
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,710
You know, that's the nightmareNof shrinkdom, doctor.

458
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,540
Too many answers,Ntoo many questions...

459
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,240
...nobody gets laid.

460
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,460
Okay, forget getting laid.

461
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,130
We'll just talk.

462
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,470
We'll talk tomorrow.

463
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,950
Michael. There you are.

464
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,560
Oh, my God. Did you see that womanNthat Gerst brought with him?

465
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,020
No.

466
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,890
Actually, I was just looking for you.

467
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,330
What, in there?

468
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,530
I was looking for your coat.NI thought we could go for a drink.

469
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,710
If that's all right?

470
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,610
Yeah. Great.

471
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,650
What's wrong?

472
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,050
Turn around.

473
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,230
What?

474
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,720
Turn around.

475
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,130
Oh, God!

476
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:23,440
Michael, it's Denise!NPlease pick up the phone! Please!

477
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,080
Michael, please pick up the phone!

478
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,720
Denise?

479
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,420
Hey, hey, hey. What's happened?

480
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,330
Thanks, guv.

481
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,600
Come in, Michael.

482
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,400
Hey, you okay?

483
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,810
Hey, what's going on?

484
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,490
It's okay, I'm here now. Okay?

485
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,120
Who lives here?

486
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,120
It's Adam's place.

487
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,330
Jesus.

488
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,590
What happened?

489
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,470
I don't know. The door was unlockedNand I just came in.

490
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,640
I just saw him lying there.

491
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,050
Have you called the police?

492
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,150
No. I was afraid.

493
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,660
Hello, Michael.

494
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,730
What are you doing here?

495
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,200
It's my wife. Well, my ex-wife.

496
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,140
She found him like that,Nthen she called me.

497
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,780
I see.

498
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:10,010
And how did she happen toNfind him like that?

499
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,790
They'd been seeing each other and....

500
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,630
Oh, really?

501
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,390
Since when?

502
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,560
It's why I moved out.

503
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:27,770
So I assume you weren'tNthe best of friends?

504
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,030
No.

505
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,510
Yet I saw you talking to himNafter the Tramell hearing.

506
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,380
It was just journalist stuff.

507
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,420
He was asking me questions aboutNTramell.

508
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,490
Do you think she killed him?

509
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,180
Who?

510
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,160
Denise? No.

511
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,490
No, not a chance.

512
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:55,160
I've known her for a long time.NShe could never do anything like that.

513
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:01,370
Listen, Roy, I've told my story twiceNover. Is it all right if I go home?

514
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,170
All right.

515
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,240
Oh, by the way...

516
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,250
...this yours?

517
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,800
No, I just found it on the floor.

518
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,600
How did it end up in the rubbish?

519
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:27,270
I stepped on it. It was leaking.NI just threw it away.

520
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,210
Can I go?

521
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,610
Yes, by all means.

522
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,410
I assume you know Adam TowersNwas killed.

523
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,520
Why would I know?

524
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,450
Because of Denise.

525
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:51,960
Denise?

526
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,650
Your wife. Your ex-wife.

527
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,260
I know who she is.NHow do you know her?

528
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,000
Adam introduced us a couple of times.

529
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,230
It was all very open. I knew about her,Nshe knew about me.

530
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,910
Knew what about you?

531
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,240
That I was seeing him too.

532
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,980
The Masters and Johnson guy.NThat was him.

533
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:18,280
So-- You were sleepingNwith Adam Towers?

534
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,650
Occasionally.

535
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:26,430
So, of course,NWashburn thinks I killed him.

536
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,190
Why would he think that?

537
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:34,560
I kill because I'm addicted to risk.NOr to prove that I exist.

538
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,240
I'm not sure which one it is.

539
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,410
I never said you killed anybody.

540
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,870
But you think I did.

541
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,880
You think I killed Kevin, and nowNyou're wondering if I killed Adam.

542
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,780
Why don't you just ask me?NOr is that too direct for you?

543
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,780
Did you kill him?

544
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,060
If I said I didn't,Nwould you believe me?

545
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,690
Depends.

546
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,940
On what?NThe quality of my performance?

547
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:09,940
You know what?NI'm glad Adam Towers is dead.

548
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,800
And you should be glad too.

549
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,810
If you're too uptight,NI'll be glad for you.

550
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,140
Whoever killed him did you a favor.

551
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:18,510
Favor?

552
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:23,050
If he'd written that article on Cheslav,Nit would've ruined your career.

553
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:26,520
You haven't told me if you killed him.NCan you put that out?

554
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,570
Put it out now or you can leave,Nokay?!

555
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,170
Is that better?

556
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:24,090
When you think about fucking me...

557
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,690
...and I know you do...

558
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:30,560
...how do you picture it, doctor?

559
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:37,330
Oh, I know you can't answer me,Nso just think it.

560
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,300
Do you want it straight up?

561
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:41,970
You on top?

562
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,610
Me on top?

563
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,140
Do you want it from behind...

564
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,890
...on your knees,Nmy face in the pillow?

565
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:58,990
Do you want to beat me up...

566
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,720
...just a little?

567
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,900
Not too hard.

568
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:08,570
Oh, a little harder than that.

569
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,400
Do you want to come in my mouth?

570
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:22,450
What if I told you that I masturbateNthinking about you?

571
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,950
That I make myself come...

572
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:30,280
...thinking about youNmaking yourself come.

573
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,240
I guess we're out of time for today.

574
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,850
I'm terminating therapy.

575
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,610
Send me the bill.

576
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,400
Miss Tramell, it's Dr. Glass here.

577
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,340
Listen, I'm concerned about how ourNsession ended today.

578
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,240
I'd like to talk throughNany misunderstandings...

579
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,470
...there might be between us.

580
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,770
As soon as you get this message,Nplease give me a--

581
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,310
Just call me when you can.

582
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,350
Evening, Dr. Glass.

583
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:29,980
Could I have a word?

584
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:32,160
Sure. Upstairs.

585
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,730
Is that German?

586
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,400
Can I get you anything?

587
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,800
No.

588
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:43,940
So here's a surprise.

589
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:48,510
Adam Towers had a girlfriendNbesides Denise.

590
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:50,010
Guess who.

591
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,180
Catherine Tramell.

592
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,950
You don't look surprised.

593
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:58,090
She's a private patient of mine.

594
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,760
I see. Since when?

595
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,020
Not long.

596
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:06,960
So your ex and your private patientNwere both screwing Adam Towers.

597
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,290
That's quite a coincidence.NDid they know each other?

598
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,030
I don't know. I don't think so.NDid you--?

599
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:20,810
Tramell's prints were all over Towers'Napartment, along with others.

600
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:25,180
But what's interesting is the last callNhe made was to her mobile phone...

601
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,480
...90 minutes before he died.

602
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,980
Her story is she was out walking allNthat time.

603
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,990
Two hours strolling around ClerkenwellNand nobody saw her, so....

604
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,160
Come on, Michael. Talk to me.

605
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:42,100
I can't tell you anything. Even if lNknew something, which I don't.

606
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,660
Franks was first. Towers second.NThere's bound to be a third.

607
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,640
This goes beyond confidentiality.

608
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,400
You've got a legal obligation to protectNa potential victim.

609
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:57,610
You can't lock somebody up becauseNyou think they might do something.

610
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,220
Why don't you tell me what you knowNabout this article...

611
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:04,880
...Towers was writing about youNand our old friend George Cheslav.

612
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,530
Who told youNhe was writing an article?

613
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,030
His editor.

614
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:14,290
He'd been very busy.NHe had a lot of information on you.

615
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,800
What, and you think I killed him...

616
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:20,270
...to stop him writingNsome stupid article?

617
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:26,350
No. But just for the record, why don'tNyou tell me how you spent last night.

618
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,450
Between, say,N7 p.m. and 2 in the morning.

619
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:32,140
You know, broad strokes.

620
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:37,060
I had patients until 8 p.m.

621
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,350
Then went to a partyNin Collingham Gardens.

622
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,290
I left there about 11 with a woman.

623
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,260
We came here and I was on my kneesNfucking her when Denise called.

624
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,340
On your knees, eh?

625
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:55,600
Sounds like your eveningNwas better than mine.

626
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:59,910
Could I get her name?NSo there are no loose ends.

627
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:05,920
Look, Michael, Adam TowersNwas fucking your ex-wife...

628
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,460
...and about to do the sameNto your career. I've got to ask.

629
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,860
Michelle Broadwin.

630
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,900
She's a psycho-pharmacologist atNVictoria Psychiatric Hospital.

631
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,340
Thank you.

632
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,210
I'll be in touch.

633
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:37,550
What does that mean?

634
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:42,990
I smell blood.

635
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:03,070
Yeah, not all of them, of course, but,Nyou know, some of them.

636
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,150
They're all so sanctimonious...

637
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,480
...so judgmental.

638
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:15,190
All my friends, they drink too much.NThey snort too much coke.

639
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,830
Miss Tramell,Nit's Dr. Glass here again.

640
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:20,800
I'm a little concernedNI haven't heard from you.

641
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,330
I was wondering whether you're okay.

642
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:27,570
Look, let me give youNmy home number. It's 0207....

643
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:32,010
Sorry, it really got to me and I don'tNknow why it seems to be doing that.

644
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:36,410
Why it's getting worse.NI mean, I was really excited.

645
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,590
You have no new messages.

646
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,780
The thing about Gerst is this:

647
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,780
The selection committeeNis just a formality.

648
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:13,920
This is the real interview.

649
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,420
Relax.

650
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:20,600
Be direct, candid.

651
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,230
But not too candid.

652
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:29,240
Very good time. They always get lostNon the way. Come in.

653
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,270
Meet my new Mughal painting.

654
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,240
Not another one.

655
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:37,640
An lndian goddess at peace. It has aNtranquility to it, don't you think?

656
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,190
I wonder what the males are doing,Nloitering so close to her?

657
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:45,880
It's obvious. They're worshiping her.

658
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:47,290
As they should.

659
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,220
Perhaps that's why she has eight armsNto fend them off.

660
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:55,770
Why don't you girls go outsideNwhile Dr. Glass and I have our chat.

661
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,430
Come. Come.

662
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,010
Come with me. You'll enjoy it.

663
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,440
So, Dr. Glass, I have a question:

664
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,620
Do you think I'm insane?

665
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:15,360
Pardon?

666
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,090
Nuts? Bonkers? Off my trolley?

667
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:20,590
No, not at all.

668
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,430
But I might be if I recommended youNfor the Douglas Chair.

669
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:28,170
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

670
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,770
George Cheslav.

671
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:36,500
A major drug dealer, under your care,Nbrutally murders his girlfriend.

672
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,870
An inquiry is held...

673
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,810
...where Detective Roy Washburn...

674
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,350
...testifies that you actedNprofessionally at all times.

675
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,550
You're blameless.

676
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,850
That's right, I was.

677
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:53,560
However, after the trial...

678
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,530
...you experienced what we might termNan emotional meltdown:

679
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,030
Depression...

680
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,400
...occupational underachievement...

681
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,270
...marital problems...

682
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,910
...and questionable professionalNconduct...

683
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:11,010
...much discussed at dinner partiesNaround our great city.

684
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,480
I'm sorry?

685
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:18,550
Now you want my supportNfor the Douglas Chair.

686
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,860
No more Cheslavs, Michael.

687
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:29,990
No.

688
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,010
No more Cheslavs.

689
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,140
Catherine!

690
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:36,530
Sorry. All right.NSorry, I'm just looking for someone.

691
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,900
Not love. It's....

692
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,570
I don't know.

693
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,340
You have to terminate this therapy,Nright away.

694
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:35,780
Well, it's already done.NShe terminated it herself.

695
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,950
Good.

696
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:41,080
If she calls again, give her my number.

697
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:47,250
I'm a woman.

698
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,300
She'll relate to me differently.

699
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,480
What are you doing here?

700
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,870
Where she goes, I go.

701
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,240
Since when?

702
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:43,080
Since she started comingNto your office five days a week.

703
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:50,660
So, Adam Towers.NSeems his research has gone missing.

704
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,850
All his notebooks, audiotapes,Neven his hard drive.

705
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,790
Everything on George CheslavNand Michael Glass.

706
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,590
-You think Catherine has it?N-I know she does.

707
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,200
She ever tell you about themNwhen she's chatting on the couch?

708
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:04,630
You know I can't discuss that.

709
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,110
Come on. I've been very good to youNthese past few years.

710
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:11,110
I'm practically a psychopathNdelivery service.

711
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,870
I can't break privilege.

712
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,420
Pity. I have somethingNyou might like to know about.

713
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:20,060
Someone says you'd been lyingNat the Cheslav inquest.

714
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:21,720
Who?

715
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:24,520
You want me to break privilege?

716
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,420
Since you're a friend,Nit was your ex-wife.

717
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:31,160
Denise?

718
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:33,170
You want to sort her out.

719
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:37,330
Who knows, she might tell youNwhere Towers' notes went.

720
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:04,000
Someone's here.NDo you want us to say?

721
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,600
I'll be all right. Don't worry.

722
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,360
We'll see you later.

723
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:12,830
How you doing?

724
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,700
Okay.

725
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:18,710
Do you want a drink?

726
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,180
No, I have to go.

727
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,080
I'm meeting someoneNat the Atlantic Bar.

728
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:30,060
Denise, did you tell Towers thatNI lied at the Cheslav inquiry?

729
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:34,590
Of course, there's always an agenda.

730
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,730
No. I said you knew he was goingNto kill his girlfriend.

731
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,200
I didn't. That's a lie.

732
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,630
Yes, you did.

733
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:46,370
You kept saying how you knewNand should have gone to the police.

734
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:51,170
I didn't know. I sensed. And I told youNthat as my wife in confidence.

735
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:55,370
I didn't think you'd go and repeat itNin bed to some moron reporter.

736
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:01,450
Do you want to ruin my life, is that it?NYou want to ruin my practice?

737
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:06,130
Your life? Your practice?

738
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:09,630
Catherine was right,Neverything's always about you.

739
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:12,930
What about me? Adam's deadNand I'm a murder suspect.

740
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:17,600
Washburn keeps going on about meNnot cooperating, like I'm a liar.

741
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,780
I don't know where Adam's notes are.

742
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:23,340
I'm scared to go home. I'm scaredNto go out. I'm going out of my mind.

743
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:24,840
Be careful about Catherine.

744
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:26,410
Don't tell me what to do!

745
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:27,580
Just calm down.

746
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,810
Don't tell me to fucking calm down!

747
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:30,990
Hey, come on.

748
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:34,320
That's my wife, okay?NThis is a private conversation.

749
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,550
Get out of my way! Out of my way!

750
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,110
Denise. Oh, Denise!

751
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,620
Come on.

752
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:48,710
Come on, come on.

753
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:58,360
Come on, Denise. Look at me.

754
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:01,000
Call an ambulance!

755
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,130
Do it now!

756
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:06,110
Come on. Let's go.

757
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:10,670
Stay with me. Come on. Stay with me.

758
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,850
Come on. Stay with me.

759
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:49,110
You have a problem, Michael.

760
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:54,750
Witnesses say they saw you arguing.NShe was crying.

761
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,980
You grabbed her.NShe almost fell down.

762
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:01,760
Five minutes later,Nsomebody slits her throat.

763
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,590
Also, there are people here who thinkNyou killed Towers.

764
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:11,170
Towers? Didn't you speak to Michelle?

765
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:15,140
Yes. But now I'm hearing about thisNcigarette lighter with your prints on it.

766
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:16,440
I just picked that up.

767
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:21,480
And your ex is in a coma just as she'sNto say something inconvenient for you.

768
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,650
I was trying to save her life.

769
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:31,990
Look, I spoke to Towers' assistantNat Urbane magazine.

770
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:36,100
He expected Denise to say that youNperjured yourself at Cheslav's inquiry.

771
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:37,790
She wasn't going to say that.

772
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,800
What was she going to say?

773
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:47,200
Sorry, guv.

774
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,810
You wait there.

775
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:57,610
So....

776
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:04,310
Your ex and Catherine TramellNwere girl buddies. Did you know that?

777
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,680
What do you mean "girl buddies"?

778
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:12,420
According to Catherine,Nthey met through Towers and hit it off.

779
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:19,090
Denise told Catherine that Towers hadNbeen pressuring her...

780
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:22,100
...into saying that you'd perjuredNyourself.

781
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:26,240
But Denise wasn't having it.NShe was going to say you were clean.

782
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:31,110
You didn't know Cheslav was going toNkill his girlfriend, did you?

783
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,080
In fact, it cameNas a complete surprise, didn't it?

784
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,390
-Of course she's lying.N-How do you know?

785
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:45,760
Everything that comes out of her is aNlie. Even the truth's a lie with her.

786
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,990
It's her way of getting you to thinkNwhat she wants you to think.

787
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,390
That's her art. The art of mind-fucking.

788
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,330
She might be a talented writer.

789
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:56,800
When it comes to mind-fucking,Nshe's the all-time genius.

790
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:02,300
She really got to you, didn't she?

791
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:08,740
What do you mean?NWhat did she tell you about me?

792
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:11,850
Well, what is there to tell?

793
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:15,960
Don't play games with me.NShe can pull it off, you can't.

794
01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:21,560
Where are you going?

795
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,720
Someplace else. UnlessNyou have evidence to charge me.

796
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,230
Do you?

797
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:31,830
I didn't think so.

798
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:12,670
He let you go, finally.

799
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,410
I was worried.

800
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:18,620
You lied to Washburn for me. Why?

801
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,690
I knew you hadn't hurt Denise.

802
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:24,380
How could you know that?

803
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:27,530
Because I know you.

804
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:31,390
And I know the cops were keeping youNjust to play some kind of game.

805
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,000
What, like getting meNto talk about you?

806
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:39,110
Yeah, but you wouldn't do that,Nbecause you're into confidentiality.

807
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:44,340
Why were you meeting with Denise?

808
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:47,480
Research for my novel.

809
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,220
Research.

810
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:50,550
About what?

811
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:52,480
About you.

812
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:55,660
And Cheslav, the masked psychotic.

813
01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:02,220
The analyst in my book is obsessedNwith that sort of thing.

814
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:07,200
Washburn thinksNthat you slit Denise's throat.

815
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:12,300
Me? You're the one that hated her.

816
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:15,530
Maybe I'm acting outNyour unconscious impulses.

817
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:17,070
Stop it!

818
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:24,310
Do you think it's possible thatNyou want me to be the killer?

819
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:28,890
You know, how some guysNare into blonds...

820
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:31,460
...and some guys are into killers.

821
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,820
Isn't that what you're into?

822
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:40,590
Isn't that what turns you on?

823
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:44,340
Turns me on?

824
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:51,340
Isn't that why you're over here?

825
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:35,710
Okay.

826
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:38,520
I trust you.

827
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:41,330
You trust me.

828
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:05,780
Is there somewhere we can talk?

829
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,410
Over there.

830
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:24,290
Can I guess where you got it?

831
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,330
Let's find out what it is first.

832
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:31,100
It would be highly improper of me toNaccept any evidence in this fashion.

833
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:32,500
Fine.

834
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:36,080
It'll take me a few daysNto get it analyzed.

835
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:39,180
You'd have made a good cop, Michael.

836
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:41,650
You like the smell of blood.

837
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:52,220
Dr. Glass.

838
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:54,230
Hold on.

839
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:57,160
I was just thinking about you.

840
01:16:57,370 --> 01:17:00,770
I might have moreNpsychiatric evaluations for you.

841
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:03,100
That's nice, but I'm busyNat the moment.

842
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:08,270
Oh, that's a pity.NYou were so good with Catherine.

843
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:11,780
She tells me you're very perceptive.

844
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:14,380
She's very perceptive herself.

845
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:22,660
I hope Detective Washburn isn't givingNyou cause for...

846
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:24,120
...concern?

847
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:26,990
What do you mean?

848
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,790
Well, given his past record.

849
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,390
What past record?

850
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:38,560
I want to talk to you.

851
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:40,560
Oh, so now you want to talk.

852
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:44,730
Look, this "Dirtiest Cop in London,"Nit doesn't mention him by name.

853
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:48,470
But this "Detective X,"Nis that Roy Washburn?

854
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:53,070
Is it Washburn?

855
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:55,480
Excuse me?

856
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,350
Yeah, it's him.

857
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:05,920
Are you sure?

858
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:10,220
Adam may have been a sloppy writer,Nbut he had excellent sources.

859
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:14,840
What about perjury, intimidation,Nfalsifying evidence. Is that true?

860
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,660
A policeman fabricating evidence.

861
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:17,930
But you have proof?

862
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:21,270
How about Kevin FranksNand the Case of the Killer Orgasm?

863
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:24,640
When I did Catherine Tramell'sNassessment, I read that report.

864
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:27,540
Those syringes found in the carNcontained DTC.

865
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:30,910
Yeah, well, who foundNthe syringes in the car?

866
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,150
But why would Washburn do that?

867
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,690
Adam thought he did it to set upNCatherine Tramell.

868
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:37,650
Why didn't he write about it?

869
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:42,320
That's the whole point.

870
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:45,130
He was going to.

871
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:47,960
Then he got killed.

872
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:14,860
I owe you an apology.NAbout Roy Washburn. I--

873
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,500
I don't like apologies.

874
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:24,390
I also don't like people stealing thingsNfrom my apartment.

875
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:31,540
The insulin? In case you haven't had itNanalyzed yet.

876
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:33,780
Insulin?

877
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:35,880
My friend's diabetic.

878
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,710
Let yourself out, doctor.

879
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,730
Hello, Michael.

880
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,310
What do you want?

881
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,450
I got the lab analysis back.

882
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:46,180
D-Tubocurarine. Funny that.

883
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:49,790
You're sure it's not insulin?

884
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:51,820
Insulin?

885
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:53,150
No.

886
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,420
Can I see the report?

887
01:21:57,170 --> 01:22:01,760
You've got some trust issues there.NYou might want to work on that.

888
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:14,710
This isn't an officialNForensic Services report.

889
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:19,680
No. Because an unpreserved orNcontaminated chain of evidence...

890
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:25,190
...will be deemed inadmissibleNin a future trial, lnspector Clouseau.

891
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,990
So do you want to tell meNwhere you found it?

892
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,170
She's not worth it.

893
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:39,170
People are dyingNand I will have her for it.

894
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:41,900
If you stand in my way,NI'll have you as well.

895
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:44,080
I can fucking promise you that.

896
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:51,780
I've got something to show you.NGet in the car.

897
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,550
Get in!

898
01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:14,640
Medical examiner's on his way.

899
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:30,290
Hello, guv.

900
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:41,660
Were you working that night?

901
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:43,840
No, I don't know.

902
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,700
Did you see or hearNanything suspicious yesterday?

903
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:50,570
Not yesterday. No.

904
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:53,150
-Nothing?N-No.

905
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:54,840
How long have you worked here?

906
01:23:55,050 --> 01:23:56,450
Four months.

907
01:23:56,650 --> 01:23:57,910
Four months?

908
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:01,020
Where were you before that?

909
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,130
Ted.

910
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:08,460
Hi, guv.

911
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:11,530
--remember I talked to Vice earlier andNthey said--

912
01:24:11,730 --> 01:24:13,460
Fergie, give me a minute.

913
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:14,760
Let's go.

914
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,050
Who is he?

915
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:41,990
Richard Pepovic.NKnown to his friends as Dickie Pep.

916
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,900
You know him?

917
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,540
No.

918
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:50,330
Look at this.

919
01:24:58,650 --> 01:25:03,520
Now, we'll have to wait for the labNresults, of course...

920
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:08,160
...but what's the betting he's oozingNTubocurarine?

921
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:13,230
Now do you want to tell meNwho gave you the sample?

922
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:21,200
You don't know she did it.

923
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,500
No.

924
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:29,200
But then again, maybe I killed him.

925
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,210
Isn't that what she's gonna tell you?

926
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:34,540
He had something on me,Nso I killed him.

927
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:37,680
Then I jerked him offNeven though he was dead...

928
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:40,220
...to make it look likeNthere was come everywhere...

929
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:42,050
...to make it look like it was her.

930
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:50,260
Look, Towers was right about me,NI put them away whatever it takes.

931
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,830
So, fine, don't trust me.

932
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:55,030
You know Catherine better than me.

933
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,500
If you have five secondsNwhen you're not dizzy...

934
01:25:57,710 --> 01:26:01,160
...with the smell of her pussy,Nask yourself: Do you trust her?

935
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,800
Do you?

936
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:13,320
She's George Cheslav, times three.NWe both know it.

937
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,720
The question is:NHow do we put her away?

938
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,290
If you tell the courts that she's made aNdirect threat against someone....

939
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:21,620
But she hasn't.

940
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:24,990
If you say she did, and that got her putNon a psych ward...

941
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:28,360
...stopped her from killing again,Nwouldn't that be worth it?

942
01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:32,230
Some kind of redemptionNfor Cheslav at last?

943
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:38,870
Look, I'm prejudiced.

944
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,410
Don't take my word for it.

945
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:44,510
Talk to this guy.

946
01:26:49,090 --> 01:26:50,790
Listen to him.

947
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:19,150
Lieutenant Walker. It's Michael.

948
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:21,380
Look, thanks for talking to me.

949
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:24,890
It's just that I did an evaluationNof Miss Tramell....

950
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:37,330
Darkness had fallen and even beforeNthe buzzer sounded...

951
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:40,770
...Kelly knew it would be the doctor.

952
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:44,100
He'd come to accuse herNof more crimes.

953
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:46,800
They'd fight about thatNand then have sex...

954
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,510
...and everything would beNall right again.

955
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,310
Except it wouldn't be...

956
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,510
...if he didn't trust her.

957
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:30,620
Hi, handsome.

958
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:32,490
My new novel.

959
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:35,320
I'm anxious to hearNwhat you think about it.

960
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:39,330
I've been speakingNto Lieutenant Phil Walker...

961
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:42,300
...the San FranciscoNPolice Department.

962
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:47,310
Paranoid Phil.NNow there's a blast from the past.

963
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:52,000
He said you murdered a Johnny BozNand two detectives in San Francisco.

964
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:54,480
I was never even charged.

965
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:58,280
Grand jury said that Nick Curran'sNgirlfriend did it.

966
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:04,750
I'm going to take a Jacuzzi.NCare to join me?

967
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:15,030
All right, all right.NI killed Johnny Boz.

968
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,430
Why?

969
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:18,830
I didn't like him.

970
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,940
For the money.

971
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:23,740
To see if I could get away with it.

972
01:29:25,410 --> 01:29:29,210
To show that deathNreally isn't very important.

973
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:30,850
Because I was bored.

974
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:33,540
And you know how I hate being bored.

975
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,550
What about Denise, huh?

976
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:36,950
Adam Towers?

977
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:39,390
Adam was insufferable.

978
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:41,690
And you are something special.

979
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:47,630
Adam was trying to ruin you justNout of spite, and I couldn't bear it.

980
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:51,200
This is wonderful.

981
01:29:57,210 --> 01:29:58,470
Denise.

982
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:02,710
Denise.... Denise was good in bed.

983
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:06,410
Denise would have spoiledNeverything I'd accomplished...

984
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:08,590
...by killing Adam Towers.

985
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,920
God, you can't tell the truthNabout anything, can you?

986
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:17,660
You don't believe meNwhen I say I did it.

987
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:20,840
You don't believe meNwhen I say I didn't do it.

988
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:24,060
What is the pointNof talking to you, anyway?

989
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:29,440
Oh, come on.

990
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:34,940
Why don't you take your clothes offNand get in, huh?

991
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:50,690
This is worse than Cheslav, isn't it?

992
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:54,600
This time you knewNright from the start what I was.

993
01:30:56,700 --> 01:31:00,040
And you let it happen again,Ndidn't you?

994
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:05,000
It's almost like youNkilled them yourself.

995
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:16,690
Who do you thinkNI'm going to kill next?

996
01:31:22,030 --> 01:31:23,760
Come on.

997
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:26,700
You can figure it out.

998
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:22,110
Kelly met the analyst during her littleNstay at Holloway Prison.

999
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:26,750
His eyes wereNa beautiful shade of blue.

1000
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:29,420
Did Kelly trust the doctor?

1001
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:32,820
Did she mean itNwhen she told him she wanted help?

1002
01:33:33,030 --> 01:33:35,020
Even she wasn't sure.

1003
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:37,820
If things went well,Nthen she meant it.

1004
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:39,500
If not, she didn't.

1005
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:41,460
That way, she'd be protected.

1006
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:43,690
She remembered the first timeNshe met Irena...

1007
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:45,270
...at the party in Bloomsbury.

1008
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:47,570
She felt a deep affinityNfor the older woman.

1009
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:50,940
As if the two of them leaning againstNthe wall, silently smoking....

1010
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:53,050
The next time they saw each other...

1011
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:55,580
...only broughtNthe two women even closer.

1012
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:58,120
Even as Dr. Green watched themNthrough the window...

1013
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,550
...Iooking for any sign of conspiracy.

1014
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,050
Kelly found herself opening up,Ntrusting the older woman...

1015
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:06,390
...revealing things about herself....

1016
01:34:06,590 --> 01:34:08,990
Yes, Kelly thought. She liked Irena.

1017
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:13,730
She was trustworthy, intelligent,Nbeautiful, dignified.

1018
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:18,370
It was a pityNKelly was going to have to kill her.

1019
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:35,090
She dressed carefully.

1020
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:38,820
She liked to be well-dressedNwhen she killed.

1021
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:42,830
Killing Irena and telling Dr. GreenNshe was planning to do it...

1022
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:46,000
... that was the riskiest thingNshe could do.

1023
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:49,890
Come on, Milena.

1024
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:56,270
Come on, Milena, answer the phone

1025
01:34:58,050 --> 01:35:02,280
It's Michael Glass here. Can you callNme as soon as you get this message?

1026
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:06,240
As much as Kelly hated her shrink...

1027
01:35:06,450 --> 01:35:09,250
...she also loved him.

1028
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:13,330
She took a last glance at herselfNin the mirror.

1029
01:35:13,530 --> 01:35:18,360
Irena deserved a good death.NAnd Kelly would give it to her.

1030
01:35:18,570 --> 01:35:21,630
Hello, this is Roy Washburn,Nplease leave a message.

1031
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:25,270
Roy. It's Michael Glass.NCome as soon as you can.

1032
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:28,970
23 Highgate Street. Hampstead.

1033
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:33,340
I think Catherine is going to killNMilena Gardosh.

1034
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:45,320
It was almost midnight by the timeNDr. Green got to Hampstead.

1035
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:02,580
What is it?

1036
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:05,770
Thank God.NListen, we don't have much time.

1037
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:08,710
You're in danger.NShe's going to try and kill you.

1038
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:11,010
What? Who's trying to kill me?

1039
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:12,610
Catherine.

1040
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:19,450
I thought I could help herNbut I was wrong.

1041
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:23,390
I'll try and get her sectioned.NIt's the only thing that'll stop her.

1042
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,690
I've already spoken to Catherine.

1043
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:33,500
She's very upset. You terrified her.

1044
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:39,210
I terrified her? She's a murderer.NShe's already admitted it.

1045
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:42,080
For chrissake,Nyou had sex with your patient.

1046
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:44,580
You assaulted her.NShe nearly drowned.

1047
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:50,850
You've broken the law, not to mentionNthe ethical canon of our profession.

1048
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:52,120
It wasn't like that.

1049
01:36:52,330 --> 01:36:54,450
Michael, listen to me, please.

1050
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:56,460
You're not well.

1051
01:36:57,730 --> 01:36:59,500
You're the one who needs help.

1052
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:05,800
I've spoken to Gerst...

1053
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:10,640
...and he thinks that if you volunteerNfor a 28-day observation...

1054
01:37:10,850 --> 01:37:13,810
...you might be able to avoidNcriminal charges.

1055
01:37:15,050 --> 01:37:19,540
However, they will have toNrevoke your license.

1056
01:37:20,590 --> 01:37:21,650
I'm sorry.

1057
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,160
She's right.

1058
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:27,150
It's for your own good, Michael.

1059
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:35,330
She asked meNto take over her treatment.

1060
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:38,640
She's my patient now.

1061
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,440
Please, don't.

1062
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:48,750
You've no idea whatNyou're getting into.

1063
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:51,920
Tell her the truth.

1064
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,960
Tell her the truth.

1065
01:37:58,130 --> 01:37:59,560
I'll make you tell her the truth.

1066
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:06,160
God.

1067
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:08,720
Come on.

1068
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:17,780
She's right, you know.

1069
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:20,740
You really do need help.

1070
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:27,880
Bitch.

1071
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:35,190
So, what's this about?

1072
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:38,630
Protection.

1073
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:40,900
Oh, yeah? From who?

1074
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:45,040
Washburn.

1075
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:50,710
Go ahead.

1076
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:59,250
Kelly Lash kills lrena,NDr. Green's colleague.

1077
01:38:59,450 --> 01:39:01,420
No, I read your book.

1078
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:05,290
So you just rushed right over hereNto save her?

1079
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:09,760
It's just a story, doctor.NOr maybe I really am omnipotent.

1080
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:17,370
Congratulations,Nthe control freak finally lets go.

1081
01:39:17,570 --> 01:39:21,470
This is what you wanted from the start,Nwasn't it? To ruin me, to fuck me up!

1082
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:24,800
Feels good, doesn't it?

1083
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:32,480
No more "l should've stopped CheslavNfrom killing his girlfriend."

1084
01:39:32,690 --> 01:39:35,950
No more whining over nothing.

1085
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:39,020
-lt wasn't over nothing.N-Yes, it was.

1086
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:42,350
Cheslav did not kill his girlfriend.

1087
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:45,160
Washburn did.

1088
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,230
Washburn?

1089
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:52,430
What do you think Adam Towers wasNwriting about when he was killed?

1090
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:57,240
You're lying.NYou're a lying fucking bitch.

1091
01:39:57,450 --> 01:40:00,970
Sure I am,Nif it makes it easier for you.

1092
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:06,510
Why? Why would he killNthe girlfriend?

1093
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,980
To nail Cheslav.

1094
01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:23,430
That's right.

1095
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:26,740
Your seven years of hell.

1096
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:29,770
Your meltdown.

1097
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:31,670
Your divorce.

1098
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:38,050
Just so your good friend RoyNcould nail a drug dealer.

1099
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:50,360
Don't take it so hard.

1100
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:54,060
Even OedipusNdidn't see his mother coming.

1101
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:03,700
It's Roy Washburn.

1102
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:08,010
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

1103
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:09,680
Fuck off!

1104
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:14,380
Give me the gun! He knows I've gotNTowers' notes. He wants me dead.

1105
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:16,520
Open the door!

1106
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:19,190
He's going to kill meNand say you did it.

1107
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:23,320
No. No, this is all fucked up.

1108
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:27,590
You don't know what you're doing.NGive me the gun. He's going to kill me.

1109
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:29,130
You--!

1110
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:34,870
Go ahead, then, baby.

1111
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:53,760
Whatever she told you, she's lying.

1112
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,260
Kill her!

1113
01:41:58,470 --> 01:42:00,990
It's the only chance you've got.

1114
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:38,970
Let go of the gun!

1115
01:42:39,170 --> 01:42:40,610
Clear the weapon!

1116
01:42:40,810 --> 01:42:43,140
-Stay still!N-Get off me!

1117
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:45,940
Stop struggling! Stop struggling!

1118
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:50,170
Stay down! I'm telling youNto stay down. Okay?! Stay down!

1119
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:52,110
Get the cuffs on him.

1120
01:42:53,490 --> 01:42:55,250
-Call an ambulance!N-Keep still!

1121
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:57,480
Call an ambulance!

1122
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:10,030
Stay down!

1123
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:40,990
Calm down! Calm down!

1124
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:42,960
Nighttime! Nighttime!

1125
01:43:43,170 --> 01:43:44,870
You'll be home soon.

1126
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:12,970
Hello, Michael.

1127
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:20,800
I brought you a present.

1128
01:44:23,410 --> 01:44:27,810
I know you read an earlier draft.NBut you gave me a better ending.

1129
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:30,840
So, thank you.

1130
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:45,690
Would you like me to tell you the plot?

1131
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:52,870
It's about an American.

1132
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:55,440
A blond.

1133
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:57,300
A novelist.

1134
01:44:57,510 --> 01:45:00,570
People around her just keep dying.

1135
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:02,410
But the question is:

1136
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:04,210
Who's killing them?

1137
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:10,480
Is the beautiful blond novelistNa serial killer?

1138
01:45:12,190 --> 01:45:14,490
Or is it the crooked cop?

1139
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:17,490
Her analyst isn't sure.

1140
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:21,300
But he goes crazy trying to find out.

1141
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:24,660
But that's just half the story.

1142
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:26,170
There's a twist.

1143
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:33,250
You see, the novelistNnever really killed anybody.

1144
01:45:33,450 --> 01:45:35,810
And neither did the cop.

1145
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:39,040
The real killer all along...

1146
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,020
...was the shrink.

1147
01:45:56,900 --> 01:46:00,030
Yeah, from the moment he saw her...

1148
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:04,610
...he knew she was the smoke screenNhe was looking for.

1149
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:11,320
His best opportunity to get even.

1150
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:15,450
First...

1151
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:20,820
...he'd deal with that scumbagNjournalist.

1152
01:46:22,930 --> 01:46:27,160
You see, you don't just go aroundNstealing another man's wife.

1153
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:31,970
It's humiliating.

1154
01:46:39,010 --> 01:46:42,040
Not that she was a complete innocent.

1155
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:44,110
That weekend slut.

1156
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:51,450
Jesus, how could sheNlet that sleazebag touch her?

1157
01:46:57,630 --> 01:46:59,000
It's hurtful.

1158
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:04,200
And there's some hurtsNyou don't just get over.

1159
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:10,740
Jealousy.

1160
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:17,950
Jealousy can make us do crazy things.

1161
01:47:27,830 --> 01:47:29,890
But getting away with it...

1162
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,760
...that was genius.

1163
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:40,570
"Unfit to stand trial. "

1164
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:45,040
No prison for him,Njust a happy ending...

1165
01:47:45,410 --> 01:47:50,780
...in a quiet, sunlit, peacefulNpsychiatric institute.

1166
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:02,520
Of course, that could all be a fiction.

1167
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:07,730
He might really be insane.

1168
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:43,200
Come back soon, baby.

1169
01:48:45,610 --> 01:48:47,200
I miss you.
