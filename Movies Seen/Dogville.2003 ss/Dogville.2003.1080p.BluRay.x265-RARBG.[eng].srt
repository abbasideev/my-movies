1
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:32,425
The film "DOGVILLE" as told
in nine chapters and a prologue.

2
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:40,425
PROLOGUE (which introduces us
to the town and its residents)

3
00:00:43,074 --> 00:00:46,111
<i>This is the sad tale
of the township of Dogville.</i>

4
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:51,197
<i>Dogville was in the Rocky
Mountains in the US of A,</i>

5
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:54,368
<i>up here where the road
came to its definitive end</i>

6
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:58,024
<i>near the entrance to the old
abandoned silver mine.</i>

7
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:01,558
<i>The residents of Dogville
were good honest folks,</i>

8
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,179
<i>and they liked their township.</i>

9
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,619
<i>And while a sentimental soul
from the East Coast</i>

10
00:01:06,974 --> 00:01:09,432
<i>had once dubbed
their main street Elm Street,</i>

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,618
<i>though no elm had ever
cast its shadow in Dogville,</i>

12
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:15,382
<i>they saw no reason
to change anything.</i>

13
00:01:16,907 --> 00:01:19,395
<i>Most of the buildings
were pretty wretched,</i>

14
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:22,145
<i>more like shacks, frankly.</i>

15
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,408
<i>The house in which Tom lived
was the best, though,</i>

16
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:29,351
<i>and in good times, might almost
have passed for presentable.</i>

17
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:34,594
<i>That afternoon,
the radio was playing softly</i>

18
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:38,161
<i>for in his dotage,
Thomas Edison, Sr.</i>

19
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,267
<i>had developed a weakness
for music of the lighter kind.</i>

20
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,039
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

21
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:49,271
<i>- the President of the United States.
- My friends...</i>

22
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:51,852
<i>Tom, do me a favor, will you?</i>

23
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,106
<i>The radio?</i>

24
00:01:54,107 --> 00:01:56,105
Just because the music's over

25
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:58,372
and you might risk hearing
something useful?

26
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:00,715
I thought that's
why we had the radio.

27
00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:03,681
Well, I need to rest, as you know.

28
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:07,801
Mock me if you like.

29
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,206
<i>Tom's father had been a doctor</i>

30
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:12,339
<i>and now received a modest pension.</i>

31
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,542
<i>So it was no great disaster
for Tom to drift about</i>

32
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:18,405
<i>not doing anything in particular.</i>

33
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:20,805
<i>Tom was a writer...</i>

34
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,295
<i>at any rate, by his own rights.</i>

35
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:27,621
<i>His output as committed to paper
was so far limited to the words</i>

36
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:30,239
<i>"great" and "small,"</i>

37
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:32,339
<i>followed by a question mark,</i>

38
00:02:32,474 --> 00:02:34,472
<i>but nevertheless
meticulously archived</i>

39
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:37,525
<i>in one of his many bureau drawers.</i>

40
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,940
Bye, Dad.

41
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:47,239
Evenin', Master Tom!

42
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:49,439
Evening, Master Olivia.

43
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:51,506
You don't forget
about the meeting tomorrow.

44
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:53,705
No.

45
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:00,139
<i>In order to postpone the time</i>

46
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:02,681
<i>at which he would have
to put pen to paper in earnest,</i>

47
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:06,111
<i>Tom had now come up
with a series of meetings</i>

48
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:08,606
<i>on moral rearmament,</i>

49
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,478
<i>with which he felt
obliged to benefit the town.</i>

50
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,939
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Tom.

51
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,939
Evening, Chuck.

52
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:19,005
Will we see you
at the meeting tomorrow?

53
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:21,339
I could do without your lectures.

54
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:23,672
You know Vera...

55
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:26,465
wouldn't give me a moment's
peace till I said yes.

56
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:30,705
<i>Who gave Moses that bone?</i>

57
00:03:30,974 --> 00:03:32,906
It's still got meat on it.

58
00:03:32,907 --> 00:03:34,507
Jason did.

59
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:37,435
Jason gave that mutt
a bone with meat on it?!

60
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:39,985
When did we last see meat?

61
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:43,298
Next time you waste good food,
I'll take your knife away.

62
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:45,962
<i>Ought have known it was you
who was given meat to eat.</i>

63
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:48,618
<i>Moses is meant to be hungry!
To keep watch.</i>

64
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:51,005
Keep watch in Dogville?

65
00:03:51,074 --> 00:03:53,006
What's there to steal?

66
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:55,754
These are wicked times,
Tom Edison.

67
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,335
Soon there'll be folks by
with even less than us.

68
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:09,265
<i>Indeed, Tom was busy enough,</i>

69
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,705
<i>even though, formally speaking,</i>

70
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:14,295
<i>not yet busy with writing per Se.</i>

71
00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:17,015
<i>And if a body
found it hard to grasp</i>

72
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:19,456
<i>what profession he was busy at,</i>

73
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:22,175
<i>he'd merely reply, "mining."</i>

74
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:25,352
<i>For although he did not blast
his way through rock,</i>

75
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,554
<i>he'd blasted
through what was even harder...</i>

76
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:31,005
<i>namely, the human soul,</i>

77
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:33,915
<i>right into where it blistered.</i>

78
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,339
- Hey, Martha.
- Hello, Tom.

79
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:38,808
They're all coming, so you just
have those benches ready.

80
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,873
Yes, they're ready.

81
00:04:40,874 --> 00:04:43,681
But Tom, I repeat,
if you need to use my organ,

82
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:47,178
I got to get special permission
from the regional director.

83
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:50,392
And I repeat,
we don't need the organ.

84
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,057
We can be spiritual without singing
or reading from the Bible.

85
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:57,032
It's almost 7:00,
don't forget your bell now.

86
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:00,873
<i>I imagine that'll do, Ma Ginger.</i>

87
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:03,771
I don't think it's good for the soil
with all that raking and hoeing.

88
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,818
<i>It's the soil
that gave life to us all.</i>

89
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:12,271
Don't give me any of your lip,
Thomas Edison, Jr.

90
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:14,792
I'll hoe as I darn well please.

91
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:17,918
Yeah, and spoil the whole thing.

92
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:20,240
I agree with Tom.

93
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:22,239
Yeah, but he likes eating
my pies, don't you?

94
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:24,641
They're tasty, no doubt about it.

95
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:27,664
So when it comes to hoeing,
who's right, Tom, you or me?

96
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:30,105
I'm not so sure it's that simple.

97
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:31,906
He's got you there, Ginger.

98
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:34,894
You cannot resist, can you, Gloria?

99
00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:37,372
Hey, Ben, I'll get the doors.

100
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:40,854
- That'll be fine, Tom.
<i>- Any news from the freight industry?</i>

101
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,372
Is everything going
to hell there too?

102
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:46,002
Don't poke fun
at the freight industry.

103
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:53,072
<i>It was 7:00 precisely</i>

104
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:55,555
<i>as Martha chimed the hour.</i>

105
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:59,837
<i>And Tom was due to play checkers
with his childhood friend Bill Henson.</i>

106
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:03,406
<i>Bill was dumb and knew it.</i>

107
00:06:04,374 --> 00:06:06,771
<i>Far too dumb to qualify
as an engineer,</i>

108
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:09,172
<i>he was certainly sure of that.</i>

109
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:13,451
<i>After listening for a while
to the pile driver down the valley</i>

110
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,075
<i>that Ben insisted was working
on the foundation</i>

111
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,438
<i>of a new penitentiary,</i>

112
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,017
<i>Tom headed for the Henson home
in order to inflict upon Bill</i>

113
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,907
<i>yet another humiliating
defeat at checkers.</i>

114
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,928
<i>Some folks might say
the opportunity</i>

115
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:31,339
<i>to meet Bill's older sister Liz</i>

116
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,818
<i>was more of a draw
than the checkerboard.</i>

117
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,226
<i>And they might be right.</i>

118
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:39,262
<i>It was a fact that
in the Henson home</i>

119
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:41,925
<i>lay another horizon,</i>

120
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:45,325
<i>a horizon just as alluring
as the one beyond the valley...</i>

121
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:50,450
<i>a horizon bound by Liz Henson's
luscious curves...</i>

122
00:06:50,974 --> 00:06:55,479
- Nobody's getting it?
<i>- ...a sweet, painful, seductive abyss.</i>

123
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:57,839
<i>- Hey, Liz.</i>
- Hey, Tom.

124
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,918
<i>Must you come by every single day?</i>

125
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:05,383
It'd be a lot more fun if somebody
interesting appeared for a change.

126
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:08,305
You know, I really am
so lonesome in this town.

127
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:13,930
<i>The moment my fiancé writes that he's
gotten that job in Boulder, I'm off</i>

128
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:17,544
then the lot of you will have to find
some other girl's skirts to peek up.

129
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,673
Is Bill in?

130
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:21,672
Well, isn't he always?

131
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:25,012
He studies and I help out
with the glasses,

132
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:27,541
even though everybody knows
that I'm the clever one.

133
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:31,518
<i>- Hey, Mrs. Henson.
- Good evening, Tom.</i>

134
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,939
Checkers time, Bill ol' buddy!

135
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,371
What is that...?

136
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,638
You didn't hear the bell?

137
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:45,943
<i>As usual, Bill tried
to fake his way around actually playing.</i>

138
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:48,652
<i>He had not yet fully comprehended</i>

139
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:51,724
<i>this meeting business, he claimed.</i>

140
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:54,172
Maybe you should just let them be.

141
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,930
- I don't think so. I...
- What if they're just fine as they are?

142
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:00,905
You think they're fine?
I don't think so.

143
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:03,415
I think there is a lot
this country's forgotten.

144
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,841
I just try to refresh folks' memories
by way of illustration.

145
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,338
<i>So the illustration for tomorrow...</i>

146
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,405
I don't know.

147
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:17,171
See, if the people of Dogville
have a problem with acceptance,

148
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,158
what I really need is
something for them to accept.

149
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,008
Something tangible, like a gift.

150
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,968
Why in the heck would someone
up and give us a gift?

151
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,173
I don't know.

152
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:33,311
I'm gonna have
to do some thinking.

153
00:08:33,674 --> 00:08:35,672
Wait, wait, wait-<i>...</i>

154
00:08:38,774 --> 00:08:40,772
We're missing a piece.

155
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,039
We won't be able to play.

156
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,138
My mind is sharp tonight.

157
00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:08,271
Night, Bill.

158
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:21,425
CHAPTER ONE in which Tom
hears gunfire and meets Grace.

159
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:26,134
<i>Despite considerable effort
on his part to prolong things,</i>

160
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,446
<i>Tom had achieved the triumph
of the checkerboard pretty quickly.</i>

161
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:34,198
<i>It had started to rain, and the wind
had become a regular gale</i>

162
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,774
<i>when Tom strolled home
through Elm Street.</i>

163
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:40,271
<i>If Tom were to prove</i>

164
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,928
<i>that the citizens of Dogville
had a problem receiving</i>

165
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,338
<i>in his lecture the next day,</i>

166
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:47,561
<i>he sorely lacked an illustration...</i>

167
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:49,539
<i>a gift.</i>

168
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,678
<i>Bill might have been right.</i>

169
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:55,637
<i>It hadn't exactly rained gifts
on this particular township.</i>

170
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:36,731
<i>There was no doubt in his mind.</i>

171
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:39,221
<i>They were gunshots.</i>

172
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:42,731
<i>The pile driver in the marshes
didn't sound like that at all.</i>

173
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,238
<i>The shots had come
from down in the valley,</i>

174
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:47,406
<i>or perhaps from Canyon Road,</i>

175
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:49,515
<i>some place in the direction
of Georgetown.</i>

176
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:55,357
<i>He listened for more shots for ages,</i>

177
00:10:55,874 --> 00:10:57,892
<i>but they were not repeated.</i>

178
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,538
<i>A tad disappointed,</i>

179
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,507
<i>Tom sat down
on the old ladies' bench to think,</i>

180
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:08,991
<i>to hang on to the feeling
of danger for a moment.</i>

181
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,748
<i>But it wasn't long
before his thoughts</i>

182
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,478
<i>were back on his favorite
subjects again.</i>

183
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,892
<i>And in the midst of the storm,
they metamorphosed</i>

184
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,238
<i>into articles and novels,</i>

185
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:23,214
<i>and great gatherings
that'd listen in silence to Tom</i>

186
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:26,161
<i>after the publication
of yet another volume</i>

187
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:29,381
<i>that scourged and purged
the human soul.</i>

188
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:34,061
<i>And he saw men... and among them
even other writers...</i>

189
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:36,682
<i>throw their arms
around one another</i>

190
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,547
<i>as, through his words,
life had opened up for them anew.</i>

191
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:44,171
<i>It hadn't been easy.</i>

192
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:47,300
<i>But by his diligence and application
to narrative and drama,</i>

193
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,734
<i>his message had gotten through.</i>

194
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:53,315
<i>And asked about his technique,</i>

195
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:56,131
<i>he would have to say but one word:</i>

196
00:11:57,941 --> 00:11:59,939
<i>"illustration."</i>

197
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:21,924
<i>Tom could have spent another
half hour or more on the bench,</i>

198
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,988
<i>but another unusual noise
roused him.</i>

199
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:28,214
<i>It was Moses barking.</i>

200
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:31,042
<i>That wasn't unusual in itself,</i>

201
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,928
<i>but it was the way
he barked that was new.</i>

202
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,338
<i>His barking was not loud,</i>

203
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:39,964
<i>but more of a snarl, as if the danger
was quite close at hand</i>

204
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:43,784
<i>and not merely
a passing raccoon or fox,</i>

205
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:47,294
<i>as if the dog was
standing face to face</i>

206
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:51,430
<i>with a force
to be taken seriously.</i>

207
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:54,005
<i>Hey, lady!</i>

208
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,405
<i>I wouldn't go up there
if I were you.</i>

209
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:01,985
<i>I know the mountain well.</i>

210
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,828
<i>I doubt if I'd get away
with my life.</i>

211
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,238
It's a very nasty drop.

212
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:15,188
Is there another way?

213
00:13:15,574 --> 00:13:17,572
<i>Yeah.</i>

214
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,738
Where?

215
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,918
Back down the way you came from,

216
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:27,271
back down to Georgetown.

217
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:30,139
Why do you need
to get up the mountain?

218
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,158
Did it have anything to do
with those gunshots?

219
00:13:39,373 --> 00:13:41,591
Help me! Help me, please.

220
00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:44,491
Hide in the mine. In there.

221
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:55,572
Where is this road headed to?

222
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:57,506
Nowhere. It's a dead end.

223
00:13:57,507 --> 00:13:59,875
If you want the pass,
you'll have to turn around,

224
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:04,079
go back by way of Georgetown.
This place, it's called Dogville.

225
00:14:04,674 --> 00:14:06,072
- Dogville?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

226
00:14:06,073 --> 00:14:08,071
It figures. A stupid name
if I ever heard one.

227
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,430
- Hey, we're looking for somebody.
- Really? Who might that be?

228
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,087
My boss wants to talk to you.

229
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:20,525
- Young man?
- Yes, sir?

230
00:14:20,874 --> 00:14:22,872
I'm looking for a girl.

231
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,057
<i>She may have made her way
to your town in her confusion.</i>

232
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,538
<i>I don't want any harm
to come to her.</i>

233
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:30,842
<i>She's very precious to me.</i>

234
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:33,139
Well, sir...

235
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,537
nobody's been through Dogville.
Moses would have barked.

236
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:40,140
He's very suspicious of strangers.

237
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,127
<i>That's very wise of Moses.</i>

238
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,306
Please take my card...

239
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:48,404
and if perhaps you see a stranger,

240
00:14:48,907 --> 00:14:52,093
then give me a call.

241
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:55,704
<i>I am in a position
to offer a considerable reward.</i>

242
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:58,225
Yes, sir. Thank you.

243
00:15:01,273 --> 00:15:03,271
Was it you that fired those shots?

244
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,838
Well, they're gone.

245
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:22,441
<i>You want to come out now?</i>

246
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,748
You want a cup of coffee
before you go mountain climbing?

247
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:40,701
<i>- Yeah?
- That'd be nice.</i>

248
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,886
<i>The beautiful
fugitive's name was Grace.</i>

249
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,835
<i>She hadn't chosen Dogville
from a map</i>

250
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,288
<i>or sought out
the township for a visit.</i>

251
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,916
<i>Yet Tom felt right away
that she belonged.</i>

252
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:00,405
Shall I take the bone?

253
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,993
<i>She could have kept
her vulnerability to herself,</i>

254
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:13,309
<i>but she had elected to give
herself up to him at random...</i>

255
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:18,443
<i>as... yes... a gift.</i>

256
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:20,905
<i>"Generous,</i>

257
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:23,014
<i>very generous," thought Tom.</i>

258
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,371
Do you want to eat?

259
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:31,357
- You must be hungry...
- I can't.

260
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,738
I don't deserve that bread.

261
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,238
<i>I stole that bone.</i>

262
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,857
I'd never stolen anything before.

263
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,897
So now...
now I have to punish myself.

264
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,816
<i>I was raised to be arrogant.</i>

265
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:52,530
So, I... I had to teach myself
these things.

266
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,548
Well...

267
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:59,214
it may be best
for your education...

268
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:03,071
but, Grace, in this town,

269
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,071
in these times...

270
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:10,134
it's very impolite not to eat
what's set before you.

271
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,207
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

272
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,118
<i>Who were the men in the car?</i>

273
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:31,471
Why would they want to hurt you?

274
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,897
The man in the back of the car,
he's the boss.

275
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:38,305
I saw his face.

276
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:41,615
He gave me his telephone number,

277
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:44,024
told me to call if I saw you.

278
00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:46,371
I'm sure he'd offer you
a big reward

279
00:17:46,574 --> 00:17:48,572
if you told him where I was.

280
00:17:48,674 --> 00:17:50,672
Yeah.

281
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:57,514
- Where is your family?
<i>- I don't have a family.</i>

282
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,128
All I had was a father.

283
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,367
Those gangsters
took him away from me.

284
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,737
What if I said you could stay here?

285
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,677
Here? Even if you meant it,
it's impossible.

286
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:20,117
It's a very small town.

287
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:23,753
I have to hide.
People will ask questions.

288
00:18:24,273 --> 00:18:27,729
That might not matter,
not if they all wanted to help you too.

289
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,147
Are you saying that everybody
in this town is like you?

290
00:18:32,574 --> 00:18:34,572
They're good people.

291
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,737
They're honest people.

292
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:39,514
<i>They've all been
in need themselves.</i>

293
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,218
They might well
turn you down, but...

294
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,241
I think it'd be worth
the trouble to ask.

295
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,717
<i>But I've got nothing
to offer them in return.</i>

296
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:51,730
<i>No, I think you have plenty
to offer Dogville.</i>

297
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,960
<i>To call the mood
of the audience at Tom's moral lecture</i>

298
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:06,714
<i>in the mission house
the next day "enthusiastic"</i>

299
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:09,384
<i>would have been going too far.</i>

300
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,639
<i>But they had come,</i>

301
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,887
<i>and Tom had launched
himself fearlessly</i>

302
00:19:14,273 --> 00:19:18,399
<i>into his endeavor to illustrate
the human problem... to receive.</i>

303
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,438
<i>The subject was obvious...</i>

304
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:28,766
<i>but quite dreadfully ill-considered
by this young man.</i>

305
00:19:29,273 --> 00:19:31,441
<i>To compensate
for his lack of preparation,</i>

306
00:19:31,806 --> 00:19:34,464
<i>Tom made diligent use
of his technique of lashing out</i>

307
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:38,413
<i>somewhat haphazardly
in all directions.</i>

308
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:42,340
<i>His father peered around covertly
to gauge the mood,</i>

309
00:19:42,873 --> 00:19:45,241
<i>and sensing that the assembly
was not entirely happy</i>

310
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:47,747
<i>with his rather direct criticism,</i>

311
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:50,594
<i>he decided to forestall any protests.</i>

312
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:53,693
I'm sure that
you wish us well, Tom.

313
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,188
But, of any town,

314
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,666
I believe this one has
a very fine sense of community.

315
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:02,341
Living side by side,
we all know one another.

316
00:20:02,706 --> 00:20:04,844
I'm a pretty fair judge
of character myself.

317
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:07,345
Honestly, Tom,
you've done it again!

318
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,284
Made us come here to listen
to a lot of nonsense.

319
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:13,104
What do you think you are,
some kind of philosopher?

320
00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:16,903
- Observant, that's what I am.
- Lazy, I would say.

321
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,438
We shovel snow together.

322
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,717
- You shovel snow together?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

323
00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:24,244
Every household clears
their own front walk!

324
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:27,154
I got to allow
that Tom's right on that.

325
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:29,821
<i>The roads don't get cleared proper...</i>

326
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:34,770
I'm sorry, Tom, you'll have to come up
with something better than that.

327
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,488
The whole country
would be better served

328
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:40,560
with a greater attitude
of openness and acceptance.

329
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,024
You're not suggesting
we all wouldn't help out

330
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:45,541
- if somebody needed help?
<i>- No, that's not the point.</i>

331
00:20:45,906 --> 00:20:49,533
- We care for human beings up here!
- We'll probably never find out.

332
00:20:55,006 --> 00:20:58,073
Since nobody seems to want
to admit that there is a problem...

333
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:02,671
let me illustrate.

334
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:07,783
I'm not going to use something
that's already happened.

335
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,507
<i>I'm going to use something
that's just about to happen.</i>

336
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:19,221
<i>And after providing
a quick summary of the events</i>

337
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:22,327
<i>of the previous evening
to the astonished people of Dogville,</i>

338
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:25,051
<i>Tom went down to the mine</i>

339
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,596
<i>to retrieve the fugitive
from her hideaway.</i>

340
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:38,671
Allow me to introduce Grace.

341
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,905
Grace, these are the...

342
00:21:40,906 --> 00:21:42,904
citizens of Dogville.

343
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:45,171
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

344
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:51,131
Tom has told us
about your predicament, miss.

345
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,877
I really don't want to put
any of you in jeopardy.

346
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:57,929
Why don't you just go to the police?
They can take care of gangsters.

347
00:21:58,506 --> 00:22:02,862
- It's their job.
- I don't know that that's a good idea.

348
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,877
- In the transportation business-<i>-
- Ben!</i>

349
00:22:06,273 --> 00:22:09,989
These men, they have
powerful connections...

350
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:14,571
even with the police.

351
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:17,064
You think we should give
sanctuary to a fugitive?

352
00:22:17,472 --> 00:22:19,840
A fugitive that gangsters
want to get a hold of?

353
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,238
Well, that would put us
in a pretty pickle...

354
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:24,538
Easy, Claire,
think of your asthma.

355
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,087
<i>Dogville's a good place
to hide, that's for certain.</i>

356
00:22:27,506 --> 00:22:30,523
Exactly. The only way up here
is Canyon Road.

357
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:34,902
<i>That could easily be watched by
Ma Ginger's... excuse me... nosey cousin</i>

358
00:22:35,506 --> 00:22:37,504
<i>who lives only yards
from the turnoff.</i>

359
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:40,391
<i>She has a telephone.
Martha, you could ring the bell,</i>

360
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,837
<i>tell the town
if people were coming.</i>

361
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:46,571
But, Tom, I chime the hours.

362
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:49,067
What if people get confused
with all the ringing?

363
00:22:49,472 --> 00:22:52,050
Come now, Martha.
Surely we can use our old bell

364
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:54,900
to save a life if need be.

365
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,934
<i>- Why should we?</i>
- Because we care, Chuck.

366
00:22:58,373 --> 00:23:00,860
- We care for human beings.
- That ain't what I mean.

367
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,607
How do we know this woman
is telling us the truth?

368
00:23:05,006 --> 00:23:07,004
Maybe these gangsters
did shoot at her.

369
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:09,205
That don't make her
somebody to be trusted.

370
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:11,371
He's right.

371
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:15,454
Why would you trust me?

372
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,346
- I trust you.
- Tom, we're not gangsters.

373
00:23:19,906 --> 00:23:21,984
We mind our own business.

374
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,917
We don't ask nothing from nobody.

375
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:30,234
- So at last you admit it?
- If only there was some way

376
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:33,104
that we wouldn't doubt
the young lady's word,

377
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:36,843
<i>some way to know her,
then I think we'd all ignore the risk.</i>

378
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:41,393
<i>There is a way.
You said it yourself...</i>

379
00:23:41,806 --> 00:23:44,793
by living side by side with her.

380
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:47,460
<i>Dad, you're such a fine
judge of character.</i>

381
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,876
How long would it take a man
like you to unmask her?

382
00:23:51,372 --> 00:23:53,370
A week?

383
00:23:53,472 --> 00:23:55,405
Maybe two?

384
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:57,624
Surely we can offer her two weeks!

385
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:02,300
And if after that time, so much
as one man cries out, <i>"</i>Be gone!<i>"</i>

386
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:05,823
I promise I'll happily
send her packing myself.

387
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,077
Well, if Master Tom think
this is right for us,

388
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,617
and for the community, then,

389
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:21,971
that'll do for me.

390
00:24:22,173 --> 00:24:24,780
He might be young,
but his heart is right.

391
00:24:25,207 --> 00:24:28,543
And I've known his heart
for as long as it's been beating.

392
00:24:38,506 --> 00:24:41,933
<i>No more words were spoken at
the town meeting in the mission house.</i>

393
00:24:42,472 --> 00:24:45,250
<i>But it had been decided,
they all felt,</i>

394
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:48,313
<i>that the fugitive would be
given two weeks.</i>

395
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:51,456
<i>And they would all be able
to look at themselves in the mirror</i>

396
00:24:51,906 --> 00:24:54,513
<i>and know that they had done
what they could indeed,</i>

397
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,217
<i>and perhaps more
than most people would have done.</i>

398
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:02,984
<i>So, that very afternoon,</i>

399
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:05,647
<i>Tom took Grace on a stroll
down Elm Street</i>

400
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,137
<i>to introduce her
to the town he loved.</i>

401
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:12,296
Well, this is where...

402
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:15,516
Olivia and June live.
June's a cripple.

403
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:20,009
<i>They live here as a token
of my dad's broad-mindedness.</i>

404
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:23,766
<i>Chuck and Vera, they have seven children
and they hate each other.</i>

405
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,350
<i>Next door, we have the Hensons.</i>

406
00:25:26,706 --> 00:25:29,953
They make a living from grinding
the edges off cheap glasses

407
00:25:30,472 --> 00:25:32,640
to try and make
them look expensive.

408
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:35,663
Moving on we have Jack McKay.

409
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:38,413
Jack McKay, he's blind
and the whole town knows it,

410
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:42,752
but he thinks he can hide it
by never leaving his house.

411
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:45,390
In the old stable,
Ben keeps his truck.

412
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:49,335
He drinks, and he visits
the whorehouse...

413
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:52,303
once a month,
and he's ashamed of it.

414
00:25:52,706 --> 00:25:54,784
Martha, she runs the mission house

415
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,138
<i>until the new preacher comes,</i>

416
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,238
which will just never happen.

417
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:03,766
And that leaves
Ma Ginger and Gloria.

418
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:06,790
<i>They run this really
expensive store</i>

419
00:26:07,207 --> 00:26:11,103
where they exploit the fact
that nobody leaves town.

420
00:26:11,706 --> 00:26:13,704
We used to leave to go vote,

421
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,613
but since they put in
the registration fee...

422
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,058
it's about a day's
wages for these people...

423
00:26:19,406 --> 00:26:21,864
Dogville didn't feel
the democratic need anymore.

424
00:26:26,372 --> 00:26:29,499
<i>Those awful figurines say more
about the people in this town</i>

425
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,313
<i>- than many words.</i>
- If this is the town that you love,

426
00:26:32,706 --> 00:26:34,704
then you really have
a strange way of showing it.

427
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:39,790
All I see is...

428
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:43,516
a beautiful little town
in the midst of...

429
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,317
magnificent mountains.

430
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:50,950
A place where people
have hopes and dreams...

431
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:55,757
even under the hardest conditions.

432
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,705
<i>And seven figurines
that are not awful at all.</i>

433
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:07,700
<i>Calling Dogville beautiful
was original at least.</i>

434
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:11,987
<i>Grace was just casting
one more look at the figurines</i>

435
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:15,976
<i>she herself would have dismissed
as tasteless a few days earlier,</i>

436
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:18,537
<i>when she suddenly sensed</i>

437
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:20,854
<i>what would best
have been described</i>

438
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:24,104
<i>as a tiny change of light
over Dogville.</i>

439
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:49,674
<i>They're keeping an eye on you.</i>

440
00:27:50,073 --> 00:27:52,071
<i>If you love them already,</i>

441
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:54,554
<i>they might need a little persuading.</i>

442
00:27:56,506 --> 00:27:59,373
We've got two weeks
to get them to accept you.

443
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,295
You make it sound
like we're playing a game.

444
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,837
Well, yes...

445
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:08,071
we are.

446
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:11,290
Isn't saving your life
worth a little game?

447
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:14,756
- What do you want me to do?
- Do you mind physical labor?

448
00:28:17,372 --> 00:28:19,370
No.

449
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:21,677
Dogville offered you two weeks.

450
00:28:23,806 --> 00:28:25,804
Now you offer them.

451
00:28:32,717 --> 00:28:39,425
CHAPTER TWO in which Grace follows Tom's
plan and embarks upon physical labour.

452
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:44,309
<i>The next day was
a beautiful day in Dogville.</i>

453
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:47,356
<i>The tender leaves on Ma Ginger's
gooseberry bushes</i>

454
00:28:47,773 --> 00:28:50,580
<i>were unfurling despite
wise Tom's misgivings</i>

455
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,177
<i>as regards her gardening methods.</i>

456
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:55,537
<i>But more than that,</i>

457
00:28:55,706 --> 00:28:57,704
<i>this first day of spring</i>

458
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,965
<i>had also been picked to be
Grace's first-ever day of work,</i>

459
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:05,623
<i>the day in which she was
to set off around Dogville</i>

460
00:29:06,105 --> 00:29:09,472
<i>and offer herself
one hour per household per day.</i>

461
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:12,004
Excuse me.

462
00:29:14,573 --> 00:29:16,711
I'd like to offer you my help.

463
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:19,070
If there's anything
that you need...

464
00:29:20,706 --> 00:29:22,438
Yeah...

465
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:24,517
a carburetor that don't leak.

466
00:29:27,573 --> 00:29:30,090
All right, here. Let me take that.

467
00:29:30,506 --> 00:29:33,573
Maybe I could help
around your home.

468
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,850
I don't really have a home, miss.

469
00:29:39,573 --> 00:29:42,590
Just the garage.

470
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,940
I'm in the freight business.
The road's my home.

471
00:29:46,406 --> 00:29:48,338
I'm ready. Good morning.

472
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:50,557
Miss Olivia's got a home.

473
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,186
She's looking to help out
in somebody's home.

474
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:57,923
A cleaning lady for a cleaning lady?!

475
00:29:58,439 --> 00:30:00,437
You be talking nonsense, Mr. Ben.

476
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:03,841
- Have a good day.
<i>- All right.</i>

477
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:06,204
<i>See you later on.</i>

478
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:09,943
<i>And off Ben went
to Georgetown with the weekly shipment</i>

479
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:13,246
<i>of glasses that Mr. Henson had
so laboriously cleansed</i>

480
00:30:13,706 --> 00:30:17,212
<i>with his polisher of any trace
of their cheap manufacture.</i>

481
00:30:21,606 --> 00:30:23,604
<i>So Grace turned into the alley,</i>

482
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:27,622
<i>which went by the exotic name
"Glunen Street"...</i>

483
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:33,635
<i>to knock on the door of the blind,
but only too vain, man.</i>

484
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,938
Yes?

485
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:41,139
Good morning, Mr. McKay.
My name is Grace.

486
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:45,202
I was wondering if there's
anything I can do for you.

487
00:30:46,873 --> 00:30:49,360
That's very kind
of you, Grace, but...

488
00:30:49,773 --> 00:30:51,771
<i>I was thinking that perhaps
because of...</i>

489
00:30:52,072 --> 00:30:54,530
the situation that you're in...

490
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,597
What situation am I in?

491
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:00,037
<i>Ummm...</i>

492
00:31:00,972 --> 00:31:02,505
you're...

493
00:31:02,506 --> 00:31:05,433
you're on... your own.

494
00:31:09,773 --> 00:31:12,380
I've been on my own for so long.

495
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:15,203
Anything that you might need?

496
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:18,338
I'm sorry.

497
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:21,496
Have you ever noticed
the wooden spire

498
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,633
on the roof of the mission house?

499
00:31:25,072 --> 00:31:27,760
At 5:00 in the afternoon,

500
00:31:28,206 --> 00:31:31,773
it points a shadow
at Ginger's grocery store,

501
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:35,056
right at the "O"

502
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:38,813
in "Open" on the sign
in the window.

503
00:31:40,706 --> 00:31:44,012
Maybe it's telling people that
it's time to go shopping for supper.

504
00:31:45,706 --> 00:31:48,073
Goodbye, Mr. McKay.

505
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:51,572
Goodbye, Grace.

506
00:31:51,573 --> 00:31:53,681
<i>Grace's interview with Jack McKay</i>

507
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:57,406
<i>proved sadly symptomatic
of the attitude in Dogville...</i>

508
00:31:57,939 --> 00:32:00,157
<i>reserved but friendly,</i>

509
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,817
<i>not without curiosity.</i>

510
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:08,944
<i>Only Jack had expressed his "no"
concisely and precisely.</i>

511
00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:12,353
<i>Martha needed a monologue
almost an hour long</i>

512
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,804
<i>to arrive at the same conclusion.</i>

513
00:32:15,072 --> 00:32:17,290
Oh my goodness.
I... I... I'd have to think

514
00:32:17,673 --> 00:32:20,300
of work for you to do, because
I barely have enough work myself.

515
00:32:21,905 --> 00:32:24,393
<i>So, not very much later,
Grace had ended up</i>

516
00:32:24,806 --> 00:32:26,853
<i>next to Ma Ginger's
gooseberry bushes</i>

517
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:30,223
<i>in a mood that was not
particularly good.</i>

518
00:32:31,806 --> 00:32:34,703
<i>She could not tell
a gooseberry bush from a cactus,</i>

519
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:37,889
<i>but the meticulous order
in the yard appealed to her,</i>

520
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:40,677
<i>such as the metal chains
placed there</i>

521
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:43,090
<i>in order to shield
the second and third bushes</i>

522
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,437
<i>lest anybody decided to make use</i>

523
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:49,545
<i>of the deplorably time-honored
shortcut to the old lady's bench.</i>

524
00:32:50,172 --> 00:32:52,540
<i>Grace pulled herself together</i>

525
00:32:52,939 --> 00:32:54,987
<i>and headed towards the store.</i>

526
00:32:58,506 --> 00:33:00,694
- Hello.
<i>- Hi.</i>

527
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:03,790
Hello. We don't need
any help here either.

528
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:06,237
<i>I told that to Tom.</i>

529
00:33:06,472 --> 00:33:08,470
Well, it doesn't matter anyway

530
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:10,637
because there's nothing I can do.

531
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:12,836
I've never worked
a day in my life, so...

532
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:20,096
You know, if you put some aloe
on those hands of yours,

533
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:22,505
<i>they'll be better by the morning.</i>

534
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:24,504
It's the wood shavings.

535
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:26,704
I really do hate them.

536
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,883
But I do believe
I'll take your advice.

537
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:33,196
Your hands are surely the most
alabaster hands I've ever seen.

538
00:33:33,673 --> 00:33:35,860
Here comes Tom. How lucky we are!

539
00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:39,786
- Hi, all. Liz.
<i>- Hello, Tom.</i>

540
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:41,772
Grace.

541
00:33:41,773 --> 00:33:44,580
- How is all going?
- Not very well, I'm afraid.

542
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,497
<i>- Really?
- No. Nobody needs any help.</i>

543
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:49,903
Well, I thought
that might be the case.

544
00:33:50,206 --> 00:33:52,574
His plan to make everybody like me

545
00:33:52,972 --> 00:33:54,970
has run into a few problems

546
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:57,237
because nobody wants me
to work for them.

547
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:00,166
I would really like to offer
something in return.

548
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:04,327
<i>You're all running a terrible risk
having me here...</i>

549
00:34:06,673 --> 00:34:08,605
I mean, I'm willing to learn.

550
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:11,063
There must be somebody
who needs help.

551
00:34:11,472 --> 00:34:14,309
- Mr. McKay's sight is not so good...
- Yes, I went to Mr. McKay.

552
00:34:14,772 --> 00:34:17,460
I went to Martha
and to Chuck and Vera's,

553
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:19,903
and nobody seems to need any help.

554
00:34:20,172 --> 00:34:23,099
<i>They all think everyone else needs
something, and not themselves.</i>

555
00:34:23,573 --> 00:34:25,571
Funny, that's exactly
what Tom said!

556
00:34:25,872 --> 00:34:28,270
- I suppose he's pleased.
- Well...

557
00:34:28,673 --> 00:34:31,540
Just to prove him wrong...

558
00:34:32,005 --> 00:34:34,633
maybe you can lend a hand here.

559
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:38,229
But, Ginger, there really isn't
anything we need done.

560
00:34:38,738 --> 00:34:41,286
<i>Perhaps there's something
you don't need doing.</i>

561
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:43,983
- Anything we don't need done?
<i>- Something...</i>

562
00:34:44,372 --> 00:34:46,370
something that
you would like done,

563
00:34:46,506 --> 00:34:49,023
but that you don't think
is necessary.

564
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:51,437
What on earth would that be?

565
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,671
<i>Maybe the gooseberry bushes?</i>

566
00:34:53,872 --> 00:34:56,420
The gooseberries are
just fine. Thank you very much.

567
00:34:56,838 --> 00:35:00,055
Not yours. The one that planted
themselves in the tall grass?

568
00:35:00,573 --> 00:35:02,681
<i>We don't grow anything there.</i>

569
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:04,737
Exactly.

570
00:35:04,738 --> 00:35:06,736
A bit of tidying up.

571
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:08,572
Who knows,

572
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,571
those bushes might
one day bear fruit.

573
00:35:10,872 --> 00:35:14,089
<i>Yeah, that's true.
That's true. Who knows?</i>

574
00:35:14,606 --> 00:35:16,604
All right, girl.

575
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:19,006
Those alabaster hands of yours

576
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:22,968
are hereby engaged to weed
the wild gooseberry bushes.

577
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,471
<i>There you go.</i>

578
00:35:25,472 --> 00:35:27,470
Thank you.

579
00:35:27,738 --> 00:35:29,305
Around...

580
00:35:29,306 --> 00:35:31,304
like this, you see?

581
00:35:31,606 --> 00:35:34,233
<i>Anything too close to them,
just be careful.</i>

582
00:35:34,672 --> 00:35:36,505
There you...!

583
00:35:36,506 --> 00:35:39,193
<i>After a few of the wild
little gooseberry bushes</i>

584
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,657
<i>had given up the ghost in the care</i>

585
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:44,902
<i>of Grace's as yet unpracticed
alabaster hands,</i>

586
00:35:45,372 --> 00:35:47,560
<i>things began looking up
with the weeding...</i>

587
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:49,937
- Quick study.
<i>- ...and the town.</i>

588
00:35:51,905 --> 00:35:55,002
<i>In fact, it turned out,
there were not so few things</i>

589
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:59,282
<i>that the other townsfolk of Dogville
didn't need doing either.</i>

590
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:02,836
<i>As Ben had no home,</i>

591
00:36:02,905 --> 00:36:06,771
<i>Grace's domestic experiments were
absolutely things he didn't need,</i>

592
00:36:07,372 --> 00:36:10,998
<i>but he put up with them anyhow,
appearing with astonishing punctuality</i>

593
00:36:11,573 --> 00:36:13,820
<i>when the act of domesticity
had been completed,</i>

594
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,204
<i>no matter how unpredictable
business hours</i>

595
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:19,675
<i>in the freight industry
might otherwise have been.</i>

596
00:36:23,206 --> 00:36:27,452
<i>Olivia didn't need anyone to help June
to the toilet while she was at work,</i>

597
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:30,533
<i>as hitherto
they had coped splendidly</i>

598
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,487
<i>with Olivia's excellent
diaper arrangement.</i>

599
00:36:36,105 --> 00:36:38,882
<i>If Jack McKay had needed
a partner for conversation,</i>

600
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:42,815
<i>he would surely have gone out
and gotten one for himself in the town.</i>

601
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:46,828
<i>So, it was not out of need
that he allowed Grace to sit with him</i>

602
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,529
<i>in his dark parlor with the dramatic
drapes on one wall</i>

603
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:53,966
<i>for lengthy discussions regarding
the underestimated qualities</i>

604
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:56,686
<i>of the light on the East Coast.</i>

605
00:36:58,905 --> 00:37:01,592
<i>As Martha wouldn't dream
of burdening the parish</i>

606
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:04,527
<i>with wear and tear
of the pedals and bellows</i>

607
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:07,247
<i>while waiting for a new
priest to be appointed,</i>

608
00:37:07,638 --> 00:37:10,266
<i>she practiced without a note
ever leaving the organ.</i>

609
00:37:10,705 --> 00:37:12,703
<i>And was therefore
not really in need</i>

610
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,467
<i>of anyone to turn her pages.</i>

611
00:37:15,872 --> 00:37:17,870
<i>And God knows</i>

612
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:22,045
<i>that Mr. and Mrs. Henson's son
did not need any help with his books,</i>

613
00:37:22,672 --> 00:37:26,539
<i>and that the family had taken Grace in
for her own sake.</i>

614
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:29,217
My hands are getting much better.

615
00:37:29,572 --> 00:37:31,570
Yes!

616
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:34,247
<i>And although
Liz's hands had improved</i>

617
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:36,538
<i>through Grace's good counsel,</i>

618
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:40,135
<i>Thomas Edison was a doctor,
and of indisputable health.</i>

619
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:42,703
<i>And he did not need care or help</i>

620
00:37:43,005 --> 00:37:45,872
<i>with the pills from the medicine
closet with its many secrets.</i>

621
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:54,405
<i>Actually, Chuck was the only one
"not yet hooked," as Tom put it.</i>

622
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:57,003
<i>- Hooked?</i>
- Hooked.

623
00:37:57,005 --> 00:37:59,143
You sound so arrogant.

624
00:37:59,506 --> 00:38:01,504
<i>Arrogance is the worst thing!</i>

625
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:03,836
He doesn't like me.

626
00:38:05,605 --> 00:38:07,603
And he has every right
to feel that way.

627
00:38:07,738 --> 00:38:09,876
<i>Yeah. Listen...</i>

628
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,835
luckily, I've prepared
a Trojan horse.

629
00:38:14,406 --> 00:38:16,404
- A what?
<i>- A Trojan horse.</i>

630
00:38:16,472 --> 00:38:18,470
<i>We can get in by way of Vera.</i>

631
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:22,571
There's this lecture tomorrow
in Georgetown...

632
00:38:23,206 --> 00:38:25,983
given by some professor.

633
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:30,445
It's some intellectual thing...

634
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,666
but not so intellectual
he can't tour the provinces with it.

635
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:38,501
Anyway, the point is,
Vera, she'd do anything to go.

636
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:41,696
<i>But she's got no one to mind
Achilles while she's gone.</i>

637
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:45,066
<i>She trusts the girls mastering
their iambic pentameters,</i>

638
00:38:45,538 --> 00:38:47,726
but not with the little one.

639
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:50,502
So this is where you come in...
I said that you

640
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:52,903
would watch him
tomorrow afternoon.

641
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:57,215
Now, I'll try and stall her
on her way home.

642
00:38:57,872 --> 00:39:00,180
With a bit of luck, Chuck
will get back before she does

643
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,880
and you can use the time
and all of your charm

644
00:39:03,272 --> 00:39:05,270
<i>to try and win him over.</i>

645
00:39:05,272 --> 00:39:08,139
I will happily mind Achilles
if Vera will let me.

646
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:11,443
But if he doesn't like me,
he doesn't like me.

647
00:39:13,306 --> 00:39:17,991
<i>Tom really was enchanted
by this unusual, mysterious creature.</i>

648
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:21,333
<i>And even though she did not
satisfy his curiosity</i>

649
00:39:21,772 --> 00:39:24,020
<i>by saying anything about her past,</i>

650
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:26,483
<i>so as not to put anyone in danger,</i>

651
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:28,836
<i>she still fitted Tom's mission</i>

652
00:39:28,872 --> 00:39:33,028
<i>to educate Dogville on the subject
of acceptance like a glove.</i>

653
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:35,670
<i>Tom felt content.</i>

654
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:38,516
<i>Grace had been dangling
over the edge,</i>

655
00:39:38,939 --> 00:39:41,716
<i>and he had been the one
to pull her back onto the path.</i>

656
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,979
<i>It gave him a fine
sensation of mastery,</i>

657
00:39:45,438 --> 00:39:48,276
<i>new for him in terms
of the opposite sex.</i>

658
00:39:48,738 --> 00:39:52,604
<i>And his feelings unleashed
the best in his burgeoning love.</i>

659
00:40:03,872 --> 00:40:05,238
<i>Hello.</i>

660
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,846
This is Dahlia...

661
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,439
Olympia, Diana,

662
00:40:10,805 --> 00:40:12,853
Athena, Pandora,

663
00:40:13,206 --> 00:40:15,204
<i>Jason, Achilles.</i>

664
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:17,503
Go play.

665
00:40:20,206 --> 00:40:22,171
Your children are lovely.

666
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:24,389
They are good kids.

667
00:40:26,939 --> 00:40:28,937
And I love them.

668
00:40:34,072 --> 00:40:36,529
<i>Please don't say such
nice things about the kids.</i>

669
00:40:36,939 --> 00:40:39,127
I cry too easily...

670
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:44,642
both in sorrow and in joy.

671
00:40:45,172 --> 00:40:47,340
<i>- Okay, Vera.
- Hi.</i>

672
00:40:47,705 --> 00:40:49,703
- Ready to go?
<i>- I'm ready.</i>

673
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:51,976
<i>Thanks for leaving the map out.</i>

674
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:54,337
I'd have probably
forgot it, I'm sure.

675
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:56,271
How did you know
I was going that far?

676
00:40:56,272 --> 00:40:58,609
Last time I saw the thermos,

677
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:01,193
it was on the doorstep
and the map was beside it,

678
00:41:01,572 --> 00:41:03,570
so I just thought...

679
00:41:03,605 --> 00:41:06,382
when I saw the thermos this time
and no map that...

680
00:41:08,805 --> 00:41:10,803
You're a sweet girl, Grace.

681
00:41:12,105 --> 00:41:14,822
- Sweet as Miss Laura.
- Who's Miss Laura?

682
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,270
You gave yourself away again, Bill.

683
00:41:17,405 --> 00:41:21,761
I think Miss Laura is
what Ovid might call a Maenad.

684
00:41:27,206 --> 00:41:29,204
<i>Don't be ashamed, Ben.</i>

685
00:41:30,338 --> 00:41:33,146
We all have the right
to make the most of our lives.

686
00:41:33,605 --> 00:41:35,713
I'm sure that those ladies
in those houses,

687
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:38,679
they bring a lot of joy
to a lot of men.

688
00:41:40,438 --> 00:41:42,436
Ain't nothing I'm proud of.

689
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:46,803
It really ain't.

690
00:41:48,538 --> 00:41:50,536
<i>It's all right.</i>

691
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,183
I know what you're doing here.

692
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:09,570
You do?

693
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:12,303
You want people to like you...

694
00:42:12,638 --> 00:42:14,636
so you don't have to go away.

695
00:42:16,572 --> 00:42:18,570
You're very smart.

696
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:22,770
Yes, I like it here in Dogville.

697
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:26,411
So you want me to read to you

698
00:42:26,939 --> 00:42:28,937
<i>about the Cyclops?</i>

699
00:42:29,206 --> 00:42:31,813
I don't like the Cyclops.

700
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:35,469
Two eyes are prettier.

701
00:42:37,872 --> 00:42:39,870
Like yours.

702
00:42:44,105 --> 00:42:47,261
If you want my ma to like you
and let you stay,

703
00:42:47,772 --> 00:42:50,110
you just have to be nice to me.

704
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:55,146
Maybe you should help me
clean up instead.

705
00:42:55,538 --> 00:42:58,166
<i>- Come on.</i>
- My ma says I don't have to work.

706
00:42:58,605 --> 00:43:02,961
- Except in my head.
- But what about if I ask you?

707
00:43:03,638 --> 00:43:05,404
Please?

708
00:43:05,405 --> 00:43:07,403
Okay.

709
00:43:19,738 --> 00:43:21,704
What are you doing here?

710
00:43:21,705 --> 00:43:24,193
<i>Didn't I tell you
we don't need no help from you?</i>

711
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:27,262
- Ma asked her to mind me and Achilles... <i>
- Quiet! Get out,</i>

712
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,703
the lot of you.

713
00:43:32,505 --> 00:43:34,673
<i>Same nonsense.</i>

714
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,616
<i>They'd have done just great
in antiquity, no doubt.</i>

715
00:43:39,005 --> 00:43:42,481
How's it going otherwise,
with the fooling act?

716
00:43:46,271 --> 00:43:48,269
I wasn't trying to fool anyone.

717
00:43:49,805 --> 00:43:52,732
I mean Dogville.
Has it got you fooled yet?

718
00:43:56,205 --> 00:43:59,682
I thought you were implying
that I was trying to exploit the town.

719
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:02,606
Wishful thinking.

720
00:44:04,805 --> 00:44:06,771
This town is rotten...

721
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:08,770
<i>from the inside out.</i>

722
00:44:08,805 --> 00:44:11,352
<i>Wouldn't miss it
if it fell into the gorge tomorrow.</i>

723
00:44:12,738 --> 00:44:14,736
<i>I see no charm here.</i>

724
00:44:18,139 --> 00:44:20,137
You seem to.

725
00:44:21,072 --> 00:44:23,239
<i>Admit it,
you've fallen for Dogville.</i>

726
00:44:25,405 --> 00:44:27,423
The trees, the mountains...

727
00:44:27,772 --> 00:44:29,671
<i>the simple folk,</i>

728
00:44:29,672 --> 00:44:33,128
if all that ain't got you fooled yet,
I bet the cinnamon has.

729
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:36,709
<i>That damn cinnamon
in those gooseberry pies.</i>

730
00:44:38,305 --> 00:44:40,963
Dogville's got everything
you ever dreamed of in the big city.

731
00:44:41,405 --> 00:44:43,403
You're worse than Tom.

732
00:44:45,105 --> 00:44:47,103
How do you know
what I've dreamed of?

733
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:54,189
You're from the city yourself,
aren't you?

734
00:44:54,605 --> 00:44:56,237
<i>That was a long time ago.</i>

735
00:44:56,238 --> 00:44:59,635
I'm not that stupid anymore. I found out
that people are the same all over...

736
00:45:00,171 --> 00:45:02,169
<i>greedy as animals.</i>

737
00:45:03,072 --> 00:45:05,209
In a small town they're just
a bit less successful.

738
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:08,229
Feed them enough,
they'll eat till their bellies burst.

739
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,670
<i>That's why you want
to be rid of me,</i>

740
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:13,615
because you can't stand
that I remind you

741
00:45:14,072 --> 00:45:16,070
of what it was
you came here to find.

742
00:45:24,438 --> 00:45:26,516
I'm telling you for the last time
to get out of my home.

743
00:45:26,872 --> 00:45:28,980
<i>Moses don't like you,
and I don't like you.</i>

744
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:31,446
Kids are going crazy enough
from their ma's teaching.

745
00:45:31,805 --> 00:45:33,803
Thank you, Grace.

746
00:45:42,633 --> 00:45:49,258
CHAPTER THREE in which Grace
indulges in a shady piece of provocation.

747
00:45:51,738 --> 00:45:54,365
<i>The two weeks
had passed far too quickly.</i>

748
00:45:54,805 --> 00:45:57,202
<i>Grace had enjoyed herself.</i>

749
00:45:57,605 --> 00:46:00,442
<i>All she could say was
that she was fond of them all,</i>

750
00:46:00,905 --> 00:46:04,801
<i>including the folk who had greeted her
with reluctance and hostility.</i>

751
00:46:06,405 --> 00:46:09,422
<i>Even though she might not have won
everybody over completely,</i>

752
00:46:09,905 --> 00:46:12,302
<i>or even half way, as Tom put it,</i>

753
00:46:12,705 --> 00:46:14,703
<i>she cared for Dogville.</i>

754
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:16,913
<i>And she had shown the town her face.</i>

755
00:46:17,271 --> 00:46:19,269
<i>Her true face.</i>

756
00:46:19,572 --> 00:46:21,570
<i>But was that enough?</i>

757
00:46:21,572 --> 00:46:24,639
<i>During Jack McKay's
long lecture that evening,</i>

758
00:46:25,138 --> 00:46:28,006
<i>she had found herself
in a heart-searching mood.</i>

759
00:46:28,471 --> 00:46:32,367
<i>Whether heart searching or concern
for her future was the cause,</i>

760
00:46:32,972 --> 00:46:36,688
<i>the result was that
the otherwise so-lovable Grace</i>

761
00:46:37,271 --> 00:46:40,868
<i>indulged in a pretty shady
piece of provocation.</i>

762
00:46:41,438 --> 00:46:43,436
<i>So, you agree...</i>

763
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:45,779
<i>that the windows in St. Bridget's...</i>

764
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:48,169
the first time you saw them...

765
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,283
didn't live up
to their reputation?

766
00:46:50,638 --> 00:46:53,505
<i>I don't think it's the position...</i>

767
00:46:53,972 --> 00:46:56,869
of the church itself.

768
00:46:57,338 --> 00:46:59,766
No, no, maybe it's...

769
00:47:00,171 --> 00:47:02,169
the light in Los Angeles,

770
00:47:02,271 --> 00:47:05,428
and the mosaic glass
in those windows.

771
00:47:05,939 --> 00:47:08,046
They kind of collide.

772
00:47:10,305 --> 00:47:12,523
I remember thinking that.

773
00:47:13,971 --> 00:47:15,989
I think we've talked long enough

774
00:47:16,338 --> 00:47:18,556
about the way we remember
seeing things.

775
00:47:18,939 --> 00:47:21,156
<i>- Don't you?
- Well...</i>

776
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:24,285
Why don't we talk
about something...

777
00:47:25,705 --> 00:47:27,703
that we can see right now?

778
00:47:28,772 --> 00:47:30,910
There's not much
to see around here.

779
00:47:32,605 --> 00:47:34,603
Wretched town.

780
00:47:35,471 --> 00:47:37,469
Why don't we talk about the view?

781
00:47:39,305 --> 00:47:41,303
Well...

782
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:43,952
I don't go out much.

783
00:47:46,004 --> 00:47:48,342
<i>You know, the... the... the sun...</i>

784
00:47:48,738 --> 00:47:50,437
<i>my skin.</i>

785
00:47:50,438 --> 00:47:53,535
Yesterday, I was walking
in Chuck's apple trees.

786
00:47:55,605 --> 00:47:58,382
If you go right up
to the edge of the cliff...

787
00:47:59,938 --> 00:48:02,276
you just manage to peer
around Ben's garage,

788
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:05,389
and you get a view of your house
from the side facing the gorge.

789
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:09,204
- Well.
- I didn't realize there was...

790
00:48:10,738 --> 00:48:13,075
windows behind there.

791
00:48:13,471 --> 00:48:15,469
Huge windows.

792
00:48:17,305 --> 00:48:19,733
It must be a wonderful view.

793
00:48:21,405 --> 00:48:23,683
<i>Would you mind if I opened them?</i>

794
00:49:05,271 --> 00:49:07,489
<i>You're no fool, Miss Grace.</i>

795
00:49:10,305 --> 00:49:12,303
You're no fool.

796
00:49:13,605 --> 00:49:16,971
<i>You probably see that
those curtains are hard to open.</i>

797
00:49:17,505 --> 00:49:19,503
I'm sorry.

798
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:24,492
<i>And obviously concluded
it's because...</i>

799
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:27,779
- I'm sorry.
<i>- ...they're not used very often.</i>

800
00:49:30,338 --> 00:49:32,336
But the view is good.

801
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,102
Entrancing, even.

802
00:49:40,171 --> 00:49:42,169
<i>So...</i>

803
00:49:44,205 --> 00:49:47,422
ask me why a man
who loves the light...

804
00:49:50,038 --> 00:49:52,206
hanged these heavy curtains.

805
00:49:59,505 --> 00:50:02,961
Yes, I'm blind.

806
00:50:04,638 --> 00:50:07,005
Not weak-sighted,

807
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:09,423
not myopic,

808
00:50:09,772 --> 00:50:11,770
blind.

809
00:50:13,738 --> 00:50:16,255
So...

810
00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:18,779
please go...

811
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:25,106
<i>and let me be that on my own.</i>

812
00:50:31,871 --> 00:50:34,009
<i>In Switzerland,</i>

813
00:50:34,371 --> 00:50:36,337
<i>they call it</i>

814
00:50:36,338 --> 00:50:40,054
the <i>Alpenglünen.</i>

815
00:50:42,505 --> 00:50:44,437
That's the light

816
00:50:44,438 --> 00:50:47,155
that reflects
from the highest peaks,

817
00:50:47,605 --> 00:50:49,852
after the sun

818
00:50:50,238 --> 00:50:52,666
<i>goes down behind the mountains.</i>

819
00:50:54,938 --> 00:50:57,276
And now it's gone.

820
00:51:21,305 --> 00:51:23,303
<i>It was in complete silence</i>

821
00:51:23,405 --> 00:51:26,392
<i>that the people of Dogville turned up
for the meeting at the mission house</i>

822
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:30,378
<i>two weeks to the day since
the beautiful fugitive had come to town.</i>

823
00:51:32,904 --> 00:51:36,800
<i>Grace was standing beside Tom,
watching them convene</i>

824
00:51:37,405 --> 00:51:40,741
<i>and knew inside herself
that this might well be the last time</i>

825
00:51:41,271 --> 00:51:44,458
<i>she would see
these now-so-familiar faces.</i>

826
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:47,049
<i>She had at least
two of them against her,</i>

827
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:50,502
<i>and even one
would have been too many.</i>

828
00:51:51,004 --> 00:51:53,002
Welcome,

829
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:54,437
good people of Dogville,

830
00:51:54,438 --> 00:51:56,436
two weeks...

831
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,570
two weeks have passed

832
00:51:58,672 --> 00:52:01,708
and it's time for your verdict.

833
00:52:02,205 --> 00:52:05,861
Is it right that she should be here
while we talk?

834
00:52:06,438 --> 00:52:08,486
<i>Well, Mrs. Henson,
when Grace first came,</i>

835
00:52:08,837 --> 00:52:10,885
she made no attempt
to hide her weakness from us,

836
00:52:11,238 --> 00:52:13,606
I think it's only right
that we'd be as open with her.

837
00:52:14,004 --> 00:52:16,612
Tell her to her face if we...

838
00:52:17,038 --> 00:52:19,036
want her to leave.

839
00:52:19,371 --> 00:52:21,369
No, Mrs. Henson's right.

840
00:52:21,704 --> 00:52:24,771
Nobody should be prevented
from speaking their mind

841
00:52:25,271 --> 00:52:27,349
<i>out of politeness.</i>

842
00:52:27,704 --> 00:52:29,922
I'll wait at the mine

843
00:52:30,305 --> 00:52:32,852
and if the vote says
that I should leave,

844
00:52:33,271 --> 00:52:35,269
then I'll take the path
across the...

845
00:52:35,438 --> 00:52:37,655
across the mountains
while it's still light.

846
00:52:38,038 --> 00:52:40,036
<i>All of the things
that I've borrowed,</i>

847
00:52:40,338 --> 00:52:42,336
if you could return them
to everybody.

848
00:52:42,605 --> 00:52:45,851
- Of course.
- Nobody has to see me before I go.

849
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:49,528
Martha, if you'll just ring the bell,
then I'll understand.

850
00:52:50,038 --> 00:52:51,703
Well, I don't...

851
00:52:51,704 --> 00:52:53,702
how do you want me
to ring the bell?

852
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:57,195
Just ring it for every vote
that lets me stay.

853
00:52:57,704 --> 00:52:59,752
<i>I'll count.</i>

854
00:53:00,104 --> 00:53:02,791
<i>And if it doesn't reach 15, then...</i>

855
00:53:03,238 --> 00:53:05,635
then I'll leave.

856
00:53:13,538 --> 00:53:16,964
Tom is anxious
to speak in her behalf,

857
00:53:17,505 --> 00:53:19,553
but I think he's had
his allotted time.

858
00:53:19,904 --> 00:53:22,332
We know his view. We respect it.

859
00:53:22,737 --> 00:53:24,735
And now he must respect ours.

860
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:28,069
<i>Grace pulled her bundle out</i>

861
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,539
<i>from under the bureau
to change into her own clothes</i>

862
00:53:30,938 --> 00:53:33,366
<i>only to discover
that somebody had been in it</i>

863
00:53:33,771 --> 00:53:35,769
<i>and left a loaf of bread.</i>

864
00:53:37,305 --> 00:53:40,112
<i>Next to it
was a folded sheet of paper.</i>

865
00:53:40,572 --> 00:53:43,229
<i>It was a map Tom had drawn.</i>

866
00:53:43,671 --> 00:53:46,688
<i>He had known where the bundle was
and had put it there.</i>

867
00:53:47,171 --> 00:53:49,419
<i>It showed the path
across the mountain,</i>

868
00:53:49,804 --> 00:53:51,882
<i>and all the dangerous spots
were furnished</i>

869
00:53:52,238 --> 00:53:54,635
<i>with witty horrific little sketches.</i>

870
00:53:56,637 --> 00:53:58,635
<i>But there was more...</i>

871
00:53:58,704 --> 00:54:01,162
<i>several people
had had the same idea.</i>

872
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,319
<i>They had eased gifts
into the bundle for her.</i>

873
00:54:04,771 --> 00:54:09,017
<i>Jason's beloved little penknife
lay there, all polished and shiny.</i>

874
00:54:09,671 --> 00:54:12,568
<i>And a pie
from Ma Ginger and Gloria.</i>

875
00:54:13,038 --> 00:54:15,785
<i>And some clothing
and matches and a hymnal.</i>

876
00:54:16,238 --> 00:54:18,516
<i>Grace opened it at number 18</i>

877
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:21,561
<i>where Martha always had trouble
with the fingering,</i>

878
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:26,492
<i>and between the pages,
lay a dollar bill.</i>

879
00:54:27,004 --> 00:54:29,581
<i>Martha alone
could not have afforded it.</i>

880
00:54:31,071 --> 00:54:33,499
<i>Grace had friends in Dogville.</i>

881
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:35,437
<i>That was for sure.</i>

882
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,834
<i>Whether they were few or many
did not matter a jot.</i>

883
00:54:39,371 --> 00:54:41,588
<i>Grace had bared her throat
to the town</i>

884
00:54:41,971 --> 00:54:44,868
<i>and it had responded
with a great gift...</i>

885
00:54:45,338 --> 00:54:47,336
<i>with friends.</i>

886
00:54:52,138 --> 00:54:55,295
<i>No gangster could deprive her
of this meeting with the township,</i>

887
00:54:55,804 --> 00:54:58,521
<i>no matter how many guns
in the world.</i>

888
00:54:58,971 --> 00:55:01,598
<i>And should the strokes of the bell
not reach 15,</i>

889
00:55:02,038 --> 00:55:04,875
<i>she knew now that she meant
something to the town</i>

890
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:07,555
<i>and that her stay
had been of significance.</i>

891
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:09,936
<i>Not much perhaps,</i>

892
00:55:09,971 --> 00:55:13,368
<i>but nevertheless
a trace she had left.</i>

893
00:55:13,904 --> 00:55:15,902
<i>And the first in her young life</i>

894
00:55:16,171 --> 00:55:18,249
<i>in which she took pride.</i>

895
00:55:32,104 --> 00:55:35,381
<i>Grace stiffened
as the bell began its toll.</i>

896
00:56:12,004 --> 00:56:14,661
Twelve.

897
00:56:18,671 --> 00:56:20,370
14...

898
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:23,238
<i>14, Grace counted.</i>

899
00:56:23,704 --> 00:56:27,071
<i>So McKay must have
voted for her after all.</i>

900
00:56:27,604 --> 00:56:29,602
<i>And if so,</i>

901
00:56:29,904 --> 00:56:32,332
<i>why not Chuck too?</i>

902
00:57:13,837 --> 00:57:15,835
Everyone?

903
00:57:16,704 --> 00:57:18,702
- And Chuck.
<i>- Chuck?!</i>

904
00:57:18,737 --> 00:57:20,735
<i>Everyone.</i>

905
00:57:21,737 --> 00:57:23,735
I think they like you here.

906
00:57:38,133 --> 00:57:42,467
CHAPTER FOUR
"Happy times in Dogville"

907
00:57:42,537 --> 00:57:45,464
<i>The period of spring and early summer</i>

908
00:57:45,938 --> 00:57:47,836
<i>proved a happy one for Grace.</i>

909
00:57:47,837 --> 00:57:51,373
<i>Martha rang the hours,
conducting her through the day,</i>

910
00:57:51,938 --> 00:57:54,455
<i>so she could serve
as eyes for McKay,</i>

911
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,448
<i>- a mother for Ben, -</i> Right.

912
00:57:57,871 --> 00:58:00,089
<i>A friend for Vera,</i>

913
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,898
<i>and brains for Bill.</i>

914
00:58:12,737 --> 00:58:14,735
<i>And one day it had
occurred to Grace</i>

915
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:17,069
<i>to tread the pedals herself</i>

916
00:58:17,404 --> 00:58:19,270
<i>so as to get Martha to agree</i>

917
00:58:19,271 --> 00:58:21,103
<i>to play a couple of proper notes</i>

918
00:58:21,104 --> 00:58:23,851
<i>just to empty the bellows naturally
so that they wouldn't be</i>

919
00:58:24,304 --> 00:58:27,142
<i>left under pressure
and thus be spoiled.</i>

920
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:29,602
<i>And now they had tacitly agreed</i>

921
00:58:29,904 --> 00:58:32,801
<i>that as long as it was Grace
who trod the pedals</i>

922
00:58:33,271 --> 00:58:35,788
<i>Martha could play
without feeling any guilt.</i>

923
00:58:40,938 --> 00:58:44,334
<i>To Tom's pop, the old doctor
who imagined he had a new ailment</i>

924
00:58:44,871 --> 00:58:47,328
<i>every single day and was thus
increasingly addicted</i>

925
00:58:47,737 --> 00:58:50,754
<i>to the simpler coordination tests
from his medical school days,</i>

926
00:58:51,238 --> 00:58:53,070
<i>she had to be severe,</i>

927
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:56,407
<i>telling him that there was
nothing wrong with him.</i>

928
00:58:58,304 --> 00:59:00,912
<i>And now since the town had agreed</i>

929
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,505
<i>that everyone was to give
according to his abilities,</i>

930
00:59:03,871 --> 00:59:05,979
<i>she received wages... not much,</i>

931
00:59:06,337 --> 00:59:07,736
<i>but enough to save up</i>

932
00:59:07,737 --> 00:59:09,735
<i>for the first of the tiny
china figurines</i>

933
00:59:09,871 --> 00:59:12,119
<i>from the row of seven
that had stood for so long</i>

934
00:59:12,504 --> 00:59:14,932
<i>gathering dust in the window
of the store.</i>

935
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:18,869
<i>And she dreamed that in time,</i>

936
00:59:18,971 --> 00:59:21,189
<i>she would be able
to acquire them all.</i>

937
00:59:22,637 --> 00:59:24,570
- Don't make sense.
- I wanted to be...

938
00:59:24,571 --> 00:59:27,818
<i>Slowly those alabaster hands
turned into a pair of hands</i>

939
00:59:28,337 --> 00:59:32,283
<i>that could have belonged to anyone
in any little rural community.</i>

940
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:36,820
<i>And three weeks later,
she triumphantly moved into a place</i>

941
00:59:37,437 --> 00:59:39,625
<i>Tom and Ben had secretly restored...</i>

942
00:59:40,004 --> 00:59:42,002
<i>namely the old mill,</i>

943
00:59:42,171 --> 00:59:44,858
<i>which had once held
the town's ore crusher,</i>

944
00:59:45,304 --> 00:59:48,991
<i>but of which only the heavy
flywheel now remained.</i>

945
00:59:55,904 --> 00:59:57,336
Thanks.

946
00:59:57,337 --> 00:59:59,335
See, that's what I'm talking about

947
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,468
with the freight industry.

948
01:00:01,637 --> 01:00:04,974
Miss Laura had thrown that out.
It was no use to anybody

949
01:00:05,504 --> 01:00:07,582
just a good thing
in the wrong place, but...

950
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,936
From a truck, you know?

951
01:00:10,204 --> 01:00:12,662
You shouldn't poke fun
at the freight industry, that's all.

952
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:16,838
No, you're right, Ben,
they shouldn't.

953
01:00:24,071 --> 01:00:26,069
Grace?

954
01:00:27,138 --> 01:00:28,703
<i>What?</i>

955
01:00:28,704 --> 01:00:30,982
I just had to tell you I had
a really selfish reason

956
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,618
for voting to keep you
in Dogville.

957
01:00:37,837 --> 01:00:39,835
What was it?

958
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:43,338
It was such a relief
when you turned up,

959
01:00:43,704 --> 01:00:45,702
and you were the one
all the men had eyes for.

960
01:00:46,004 --> 01:00:48,052
<i>-</i> You know, Tom and them?

961
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:52,168
I had to put up with it for long.

962
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:55,868
Frankly, I just didn't have
the energy for it anymore.

963
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:59,235
They'll always have eyes
for you, Liz.

964
01:01:01,337 --> 01:01:03,335
You know that.

965
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:06,119
- They will.
- Okay.

966
01:01:06,504 --> 01:01:08,502
<i>- You're beautiful.</i>
- Thank you, Grace.

967
01:01:10,137 --> 01:01:11,770
<i>The very latest development</i>

968
01:01:11,771 --> 01:01:13,939
<i>now that summer was at its peak</i>

969
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:15,937
<i>was that Grace had been given leave</i>

970
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:18,625
<i>to help Chuck in the orchard.</i>

971
01:01:19,071 --> 01:01:21,618
<i>And every day at 5:00,
once their work was done,</i>

972
01:01:22,038 --> 01:01:25,344
<i>she could appreciate
that actually McKay was right.</i>

973
01:01:25,871 --> 01:01:27,803
<i>The shadow of the spire</i>

974
01:01:27,804 --> 01:01:30,641
<i>did indeed point at Ma Ginger's store.</i>

975
01:01:33,404 --> 01:01:36,062
<i>But today</i>

976
01:01:36,504 --> 01:01:39,251
<i>the tower did not only announce
that it was time to go shopping,</i>

977
01:01:39,704 --> 01:01:43,890
<i>but also... by a signal which nobody,
despite Martha's initial concerns,</i>

978
01:01:44,537 --> 01:01:47,055
<i>could have confused
with the ringing of the hours...</i>

979
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,658
<i>a warning that somebody
was approaching</i>

980
01:01:50,038 --> 01:01:52,435
<i>by a canyon road from Georgetown.</i>

981
01:01:52,837 --> 01:01:54,835
<i>For the first time in living memory</i>

982
01:01:55,004 --> 01:01:57,691
<i>law enforcers had come to Dogville.</i>

983
01:02:07,938 --> 01:02:09,936
Good evening, sir.

984
01:02:11,304 --> 01:02:13,522
<i>This the whole place?</i>

985
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:16,651
<i>- Is there a town hall?
- No.</i>

986
01:02:17,103 --> 01:02:19,241
I got me a notice to paste up.

987
01:02:19,604 --> 01:02:21,403
We've got the mission house.

988
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,622
<i>- That do you?</i>
- Sure.

989
01:02:25,237 --> 01:02:26,836
<i>What'd she do?</i>

990
01:02:26,837 --> 01:02:28,835
Missing, that's all it says.

991
01:02:28,837 --> 01:02:31,464
I guess somebody's
been missing her.

992
01:02:31,904 --> 01:02:34,421
Heard tell she was
last seen around here.

993
01:02:34,837 --> 01:02:37,324
We're putting these things up
all over the county.

994
01:02:38,938 --> 01:02:41,425
<i>If somebody sees her,
they ought to go to the police?</i>

995
01:02:41,837 --> 01:02:43,835
I guess that's the idea.

996
01:03:15,804 --> 01:03:18,461
These men were never
gonna give in easily.

997
01:03:18,904 --> 01:03:22,800
<i>Now these posters,
they hang all over the county...</i>

998
01:03:25,404 --> 01:03:27,712
which means nobody suspects
she's right here with us.

999
01:03:28,103 --> 01:03:30,036
No, but it was a policeman, Tom.

1000
01:03:30,037 --> 01:03:32,035
Isn't it a duty to respond
to the police?

1001
01:03:32,304 --> 01:03:35,141
I mean legally speaking.

1002
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:38,231
I... I'm sorry.

1003
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:41,038
I just...
when I get upset, I cough.

1004
01:03:41,437 --> 01:03:43,575
She's a missing person,
she hasn't done anything.

1005
01:03:43,938 --> 01:03:46,365
<i>- He even said so.</i>
- I think you should vote again.

1006
01:03:46,771 --> 01:03:49,198
<i>Why?
We can't resort to plebiscites</i>

1007
01:03:49,604 --> 01:03:51,792
time and time again.

1008
01:03:53,404 --> 01:03:55,402
<i>Come on,</i>

1009
01:03:55,537 --> 01:03:58,524
who's really got cold feet
because of a picture and piece of paper?

1010
01:04:15,175 --> 01:04:20,133
CHAPTER FIVE
"Fourth of July after all"

1011
01:04:23,103 --> 01:04:25,101
<i>The fourth of July came</i>

1012
01:04:25,337 --> 01:04:28,464
<i>with huge clouds of seeds
from some remote meadow</i>

1013
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:32,157
<i>gracefully floating down Elm Street
in the early evening.</i>

1014
01:04:32,671 --> 01:04:35,248
<i>Today was a day for celebration.</i>

1015
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,948
<i>Nobody was to worry
about the hard times.</i>

1016
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:41,404
<i>And Grace could stop
at Ma Ginger's window quite content</i>

1017
01:04:41,904 --> 01:04:45,650
<i>to ascertain that only two
of the little china figurines remained.</i>

1018
01:04:46,237 --> 01:04:48,169
<i>And were thus the only two</i>

1019
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:51,157
<i>she had not yet been able
to save up enough to purchase.</i>

1020
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:58,268
It looks great, girls.

1021
01:05:00,003 --> 01:05:02,491
Grace, will you put in
a couple of hours with me?

1022
01:05:02,903 --> 01:05:04,901
In the orchard again today?

1023
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:07,937
It's real nice down there
with the sunshine.

1024
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,402
Chuck, it's the Fourth of July.

1025
01:05:11,671 --> 01:05:14,158
What are you talking
about sunshine for?

1026
01:05:14,571 --> 01:05:16,998
<i>Have you turned
into a romantic like me?</i>

1027
01:05:21,637 --> 01:05:23,635
- No.
<i>- We're gonna have fun.</i>

1028
01:05:24,871 --> 01:05:26,978
During the winter,
we'll all starve.

1029
01:05:27,337 --> 01:05:29,795
Even Ben's taking the day off.

1030
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:33,948
- Hi.
- Hey, Tom.

1031
01:05:34,304 --> 01:05:36,302
Gracie, you got a moment?

1032
01:05:38,671 --> 01:05:41,598
- Now?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1033
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:44,088
I've got something
interesting to tell you.

1034
01:05:46,304 --> 01:05:48,302
Well, it has to be quick.

1035
01:05:55,437 --> 01:05:58,714
I got so much going on in my head.

1036
01:05:59,237 --> 01:06:01,255
That must be very tiring for you.

1037
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:06,597
I think I've done a pretty good analysis
of the folks in this town and...

1038
01:06:09,737 --> 01:06:12,104
I think I understand them...

1039
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:16,001
in a meaningful way.

1040
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:20,408
<i>But when I come to decipher you,</i>

1041
01:06:20,804 --> 01:06:22,802
<i>I get absolutely nowhere.</i>

1042
01:06:24,237 --> 01:06:26,235
You know, Liz...

1043
01:06:27,137 --> 01:06:29,135
Liz is easy to read.

1044
01:06:31,671 --> 01:06:34,128
And there was some
attraction between us.

1045
01:06:37,903 --> 01:06:40,531
But as I can see right through her,

1046
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:43,867
intellectually, I mean,
I can see right through her.

1047
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:48,143
My desire was purely of a physical...

1048
01:06:50,204 --> 01:06:52,202
<i>physical nature.</i>

1049
01:06:54,671 --> 01:06:56,669
But with you

1050
01:06:57,003 --> 01:06:59,001
it's...

1051
01:06:59,337 --> 01:07:01,944
<i>- What?
- It's more... it's more complicated.</i>

1052
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:04,368
What are you trying to say?

1053
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:09,458
No, I should get it clearer
in my head first.

1054
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:14,745
Are you trying to say that...

1055
01:07:17,404 --> 01:07:19,402
you're in love with me?

1056
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,468
No, I wouldn't...

1057
01:07:26,604 --> 01:07:28,602
Love is what... it's not...

1058
01:07:32,037 --> 01:07:34,035
It's a big word... yeah.

1059
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:40,368
Yeah.

1060
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,488
Well, that's good.

1061
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:48,935
Because...

1062
01:07:52,337 --> 01:07:54,675
I think that I'm in love with you too.

1063
01:07:57,537 --> 01:07:59,535
Very interesting, isn't it?

1064
01:08:01,836 --> 01:08:04,324
I mean it's interesting
in a psychological...

1065
01:08:11,637 --> 01:08:13,635
Did they call you?
I think they're...

1066
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:16,768
calling you.

1067
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:21,368
I didn't hear them.

1068
01:08:24,037 --> 01:08:26,035
No.

1069
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:30,169
You should...

1070
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:32,218
probably get back anyway.

1071
01:08:35,637 --> 01:08:38,733
I'll see you at the wedding...
celebration. Sorry.

1072
01:08:43,337 --> 01:08:45,335
<i>America</i>

1073
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,368
<i>America</i>

1074
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:53,296
<i>God shed his grace on thee</i>

1075
01:08:54,003 --> 01:08:58,069
<i>And crown thy good
with brotherhood</i>

1076
01:08:58,703 --> 01:09:03,209
<i>From sea to shining sea.</i>

1077
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:06,868
- Bravo.
- Yay.

1078
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:09,702
<i>Well done!</i>

1079
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:17,117
This year I didn't bring
any notes with me

1080
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:20,378
because I'm not gonna pretend
I can read them.

1081
01:09:23,437 --> 01:09:25,575
Which brings me to a point,

1082
01:09:25,937 --> 01:09:28,015
a point I want to make.

1083
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:30,647
And that point is,

1084
01:09:31,037 --> 01:09:33,035
<i>you, Grace.</i>

1085
01:09:33,204 --> 01:09:35,602
<i>Yes, you've made Dogville</i>

1086
01:09:36,003 --> 01:09:38,431
<i>a wonderful place to live in.</i>

1087
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:41,969
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

1088
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:46,186
somebody tells me they ran
into grumpy old Chuck on the street

1089
01:09:46,836 --> 01:09:49,703
<i>and he was actually smiling.</i>

1090
01:09:51,537 --> 01:09:53,754
<i>Well, I've never
seen your smile, Grace,</i>

1091
01:09:54,137 --> 01:09:58,053
<i>but I will bet you
I could describe it.</i>

1092
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:02,857
Because it obviously has every color

1093
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:06,137
that's refracted from the shiniest

1094
01:10:06,603 --> 01:10:08,681
<i>prism in the world.</i>

1095
01:10:09,037 --> 01:10:11,205
<i>And you probably have a face
to match that?</i>

1096
01:10:11,571 --> 01:10:13,503
<i>Does she have a face
to match that, Tom?</i>

1097
01:10:13,504 --> 01:10:14,869
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1098
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:16,888
<i>- Yes, sir.
- I'll bet she does.</i>

1099
01:10:17,237 --> 01:10:19,844
We are proud to have you among us.

1100
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:24,746
And we thank you

1101
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:27,488
<i>for showing us who you are.</i>

1102
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:30,978
Here's to you, Grace.

1103
01:10:31,337 --> 01:10:33,475
<i>Stay with us as long
as you damn please.</i>

1104
01:10:33,836 --> 01:10:36,054
To Grace.

1105
01:10:50,937 --> 01:10:52,935
Stop!

1106
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:59,368
A police car
has just been seen in town

1107
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:01,987
and it's just made the turn
up Canyon Road.

1108
01:11:02,404 --> 01:11:04,921
- So he'll be here any minute.
- Should I ring the bell?

1109
01:11:06,903 --> 01:11:08,901
No, Martha, Grace probably heard.

1110
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:13,218
- We'll get rid of him quickly-<i>-
-</i> Better go, honey, go.

1111
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,634
Don't worry.

1112
01:11:28,204 --> 01:11:31,361
Should have been celebrating myself
if this hadn't have come up.

1113
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,857
I got to change this
missing persons notice.

1114
01:11:36,304 --> 01:11:38,412
It's that lady again.

1115
01:11:39,736 --> 01:11:41,734
It's why she disappeared.

1116
01:11:43,503 --> 01:11:47,280
She's wanted in connection with some
bank robberies on the West Coast.

1117
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,418
<i>When did these robberies take place?</i>

1118
01:11:50,836 --> 01:11:52,769
Last couple of weeks.

1119
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:55,927
- All right.
- <i>You don't get much news up here?</i>

1120
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:59,044
My dad's radio only plays music.

1121
01:12:01,204 --> 01:12:03,861
All I know is they say
she's dangerous...

1122
01:12:04,304 --> 01:12:08,310
and that anyone with any information
about her better call us pronto.

1123
01:12:08,937 --> 01:12:10,935
<i>That's the law.</i>

1124
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:26,868
<i>Two weeks.</i>

1125
01:12:29,237 --> 01:12:31,235
Can't be our girl, Tom.

1126
01:12:31,503 --> 01:12:33,781
- No, she's been here all the time.
- <i>Right.</i>

1127
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:36,338
She couldn't have done
what they're accusing her of.

1128
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:39,935
<i>No, that's true, Tom, you're right.</i>

1129
01:12:40,204 --> 01:12:42,511
Still it's an unpleasant business
just the same.

1130
01:12:50,503 --> 01:12:53,191
<i>Grace was the same and so was the town.</i>

1131
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:56,634
<i>That the gangsters had fixed
to have charges</i>

1132
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:59,238
<i>made against Grace
and their efforts to neutralize her</i>

1133
01:12:59,636 --> 01:13:01,744
<i>came as no surprise.</i>

1134
01:13:03,204 --> 01:13:06,071
<i>But everything had changed a little
yet again.</i>

1135
01:13:06,536 --> 01:13:09,873
I'm telling you, you have exactly
the same kind of little lump

1136
01:13:10,404 --> 01:13:13,061
in exactly the same spot
on the other side of your back.

1137
01:13:13,503 --> 01:13:15,581
- Really?
- I can only assume...

1138
01:13:18,037 --> 01:13:20,375
that it belongs on your body.

1139
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:22,938
But you are the doctor,

1140
01:13:23,304 --> 01:13:25,382
so...

1141
01:13:25,736 --> 01:13:27,734
It's very unlikely, don't you think,

1142
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:31,027
that a cancer would develop
in such precise symmetry?

1143
01:13:31,503 --> 01:13:33,781
- Mr. Edison, please-<i>-
-</i> No, don't you... I mean...

1144
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:36,747
- we have been over this so many times.
- Anything's possible.

1145
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:39,168
I think you have to accept the fact

1146
01:13:39,503 --> 01:13:42,111
that you are an exceptionally healthy

1147
01:13:42,536 --> 01:13:44,534
elderly gentleman.

1148
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:47,131
I'm gonna rest just the same.

1149
01:13:47,536 --> 01:13:49,534
<i>I'll see you in the morning.</i>

1150
01:13:49,603 --> 01:13:51,601
I hope so.

1151
01:13:51,703 --> 01:13:54,041
What? What did they say?

1152
01:13:54,436 --> 01:13:56,434
<i>Well...</i>

1153
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:01,537
I couldn't really argue
that anything had changed, but...

1154
01:14:02,003 --> 01:14:06,189
by not telling the police they felt that
they were committing a crime themselves.

1155
01:14:10,503 --> 01:14:12,468
- I think I should leave.
<i>- No.</i>

1156
01:14:12,469 --> 01:14:14,717
- Enough is enough.
<i>- I have suggested the opposite.</i>

1157
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:20,432
<i>- You did?
- From a business perspective...</i>

1158
01:14:23,369 --> 01:14:25,887
from a business prospective your...

1159
01:14:26,304 --> 01:14:28,821
your presence in Dogville
has become more costly...

1160
01:14:30,369 --> 01:14:33,526
<i>because it's more dangerous
for them to have you here...</i>

1161
01:14:34,037 --> 01:14:36,035
<i>not that they don't want you.</i>

1162
01:14:37,037 --> 01:14:39,844
It's just they feel
there should be some

1163
01:14:40,304 --> 01:14:42,302
counterbalance.

1164
01:14:43,304 --> 01:14:45,302
Some quid pro quo.

1165
01:14:45,304 --> 01:14:47,821
That sounds like words
the gangsters would use.

1166
01:14:48,237 --> 01:14:51,953
But there is also more of an incentive
for you to want to stay.

1167
01:14:55,469 --> 01:14:58,536
<i>See, with all of those wanted posters
hanging around the place,</i>

1168
01:14:59,037 --> 01:15:01,964
I can hardly think of anywhere else
you could hide.

1169
01:15:04,369 --> 01:15:07,356
So what's the counterbalance
that you suggest?

1170
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,834
Right, well...

1171
01:15:11,003 --> 01:15:13,281
they wanted you
to work longer hours.

1172
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:17,036
But instead, what I proposed

1173
01:15:17,037 --> 01:15:19,255
is that

1174
01:15:19,636 --> 01:15:22,264
you just pay a visit to folks
twice a day now.

1175
01:15:22,703 --> 01:15:25,770
That way it would seem
that you're willing to contribute more

1176
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:28,607
without actually lengthening
your day too much.

1177
01:15:29,003 --> 01:15:31,660
<i>It's just a way of heading off
any unpleasantness.</i>

1178
01:15:38,237 --> 01:15:40,255
But it sounds...

1179
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:43,970
it sounds a little peculiar,
difficult to put into practice.

1180
01:15:44,503 --> 01:15:46,501
That's what I thought.

1181
01:15:47,636 --> 01:15:50,563
Martha, she said she'd ring her bell
every half hour

1182
01:15:51,037 --> 01:15:53,225
so you could keep track
of your new schedule.

1183
01:15:56,836 --> 01:15:58,834
Then they're all willing
to let me stay?

1184
01:15:59,037 --> 01:16:01,035
<i>No.</i>

1185
01:16:01,037 --> 01:16:03,964
Mrs. Henson, she also

1186
01:16:04,436 --> 01:16:06,484
thought we should cut your pay.

1187
01:16:06,836 --> 01:16:09,413
- So...
- Merely a symbolic gesture.

1188
01:16:09,836 --> 01:16:11,834
It was...

1189
01:16:12,603 --> 01:16:15,620
You see the word dangerous
on the poster worried her.

1190
01:16:18,103 --> 01:16:20,101
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

1191
01:16:20,137 --> 01:16:22,135
If I have to work

1192
01:16:22,269 --> 01:16:24,577
harder, longer hours for less pay,

1193
01:16:24,970 --> 01:16:27,627
then I'm wiling to do that,
of course I am.

1194
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:31,768
I just want to be sure

1195
01:16:31,803 --> 01:16:34,430
that they wouldn't prefer
that I left town.

1196
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:36,868
<i>Of course not.</i>

1197
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:41,168
<i>You think this is for the best?</i>

1198
01:16:42,203 --> 01:16:44,201
I know it is.

1199
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:49,534
I have to get some sleep.

1200
01:16:52,536 --> 01:16:55,114
My days are gonna be
much busier now.

1201
01:16:55,536 --> 01:16:57,534
I'm sorry.

1202
01:17:21,369 --> 01:17:23,367
<i>Tom.</i>

1203
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:27,968
I just need to know something.

1204
01:17:30,836 --> 01:17:34,172
You know the card
that the man in the car gave you?

1205
01:17:34,703 --> 01:17:36,701
<i>Yeah.</i>

1206
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:42,968
Did you show it to anyone?

1207
01:17:43,003 --> 01:17:45,220
Come on, Grace.

1208
01:17:47,236 --> 01:17:49,202
I burned it first thing.

1209
01:17:49,203 --> 01:17:51,201
I am being so silly,

1210
01:17:51,303 --> 01:17:53,301
of course you did.

1211
01:17:53,436 --> 01:17:55,434
<i>It's all right, it's all right.</i>

1212
01:17:55,436 --> 01:17:57,434
No, it's not all right.

1213
01:17:57,570 --> 01:17:59,968
I... I hate it for you
to see me like this.

1214
01:18:00,369 --> 01:18:02,235
I can't bear that I'm doubting you.

1215
01:18:02,236 --> 01:18:05,223
I'm sorry. Good night.

1216
01:18:25,102 --> 01:18:27,320
<i>Everybody was really against</i>

1217
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,310
<i>any changes to Grace's
working conditions at all</i>

1218
01:18:30,736 --> 01:18:33,074
<i>when the subject occasionally
came up in conversation.</i>

1219
01:18:41,603 --> 01:18:44,320
<i>Ben had declared in sympathy
that he wouldn't accept</i>

1220
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:47,487
<i>any more work than before...
and Grace was grateful for that.</i>

1221
01:18:47,937 --> 01:18:51,413
<i>Even if he was a bit drunk
when he said so.</i>

1222
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:58,127
<i>Busy minutes became busy hours,</i>

1223
01:18:58,536 --> 01:19:01,553
<i>and busy hours became busy days.</i>

1224
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:05,873
<i>And irrespective of whether they thought
the idea of increasing Grace's services</i>

1225
01:19:06,469 --> 01:19:09,306
<i>had any fairness
and justification to it or not,</i>

1226
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:12,077
<i>it didn't seem to make anyone
any happier,</i>

1227
01:19:12,469 --> 01:19:14,467
<i>more to the contrary.</i>

1228
01:19:16,937 --> 01:19:19,924
Grace,
you have to be more careful.

1229
01:19:20,403 --> 01:19:22,401
Liz wasn't very careful either,

1230
01:19:22,636 --> 01:19:24,468
<i>but she didn't break our glasses.</i>

1231
01:19:24,469 --> 01:19:27,156
I think you need to understand
that Mr. Henson

1232
01:19:27,603 --> 01:19:30,410
<i>works very hard
to grind off any traces of the molds.</i>

1233
01:19:31,836 --> 01:19:33,834
It makes the glass weak.

1234
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:37,593
<i>- I thought you knew that.</i>
- It won't happen again.

1235
01:19:38,069 --> 01:19:40,067
Of course I'll pay for it.

1236
01:19:40,136 --> 01:19:42,304
No, of course not,
you don't have to pay us for it.

1237
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:44,748
We'll get over it.

1238
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:49,557
<i>And off she went again
to keep her appointment with Chuck,</i>

1239
01:19:50,036 --> 01:19:52,114
<i>to free the last tree trunks
from the grass,</i>

1240
01:19:52,469 --> 01:19:54,957
<i>in order to keep
the ever busy mice away.</i>

1241
01:19:56,436 --> 01:19:58,434
<i>She was in a hurry
and took the shortcut</i>

1242
01:19:58,603 --> 01:20:00,468
<i>between the gooseberry bushes,</i>

1243
01:20:00,469 --> 01:20:02,467
<i>only to brought up by a shout.</i>

1244
01:20:02,636 --> 01:20:04,634
- Grace!
<i>- Yes.</i>

1245
01:20:10,469 --> 01:20:12,986
I didn't see that you just
raked the path. I'm sorry.

1246
01:20:13,403 --> 01:20:16,500
It isn't that I just raked it,
the idea is

1247
01:20:17,002 --> 01:20:20,159
for people to pass
around the bushes completely.

1248
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:23,157
<i>I prefer it that way,
as you should know.</i>

1249
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:26,557
<i>I thought that these chains
were put up to...</i>

1250
01:20:27,036 --> 01:20:29,084
to make a path between the bushes.

1251
01:20:29,436 --> 01:20:32,713
They were put up to protect the bushes.
It's not supposed to be a pathway.

1252
01:20:33,236 --> 01:20:35,514
But everyone goes this way.

1253
01:20:35,903 --> 01:20:37,901
<i>Yeah, that's right,</i>

1254
01:20:38,102 --> 01:20:40,001
but they've been living here for years,

1255
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:42,000
you haven't been here that long.

1256
01:20:43,369 --> 01:20:45,367
<i>Are you saying that I'm less entitled</i>

1257
01:20:45,603 --> 01:20:47,851
to use the shortcut because

1258
01:20:48,236 --> 01:20:49,936
I haven't always lived here?

1259
01:20:49,937 --> 01:20:51,602
Of course not.

1260
01:20:51,603 --> 01:20:54,320
No, I just thought it pleased you
to be here, that's all.

1261
01:20:56,102 --> 01:20:58,100
Go on, go on, it's all right.

1262
01:20:58,236 --> 01:21:00,234
- I'll see you this afternoon.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1263
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:03,587
And I'll rake those bushes
like they've never been raked before.

1264
01:21:04,069 --> 01:21:06,067
I promise.

1265
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:14,669
I'm sorry about that branch,

1266
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:16,668
there were so many apples on it.

1267
01:21:19,069 --> 01:21:22,026
I should have cut that branch,
but I got greedy.

1268
01:21:23,903 --> 01:21:25,901
<i>Is it greedy to want
to feed your family?</i>

1269
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:34,568
So how come you don't like me?

1270
01:21:38,536 --> 01:21:40,534
Why do you ask me that?

1271
01:21:40,536 --> 01:21:42,534
<i>When I get close to you,
you edge away.</i>

1272
01:21:45,703 --> 01:21:47,268
No, I don't.

1273
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:49,235
<i>You did so</i>

1274
01:21:49,236 --> 01:21:51,844
when we were thinning
the seedlings in the bottom row.

1275
01:21:53,236 --> 01:21:55,983
<i>How am I supposed to show you what I do
if I ain't allowed to touch you?</i>

1276
01:21:58,269 --> 01:22:00,267
You tried to kiss me.

1277
01:22:09,303 --> 01:22:12,200
Vera never took any interest
in the apples.

1278
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:14,668
<i>She hates the orchard.</i>

1279
01:22:16,036 --> 01:22:19,193
<i>This is the first time I ever met
anyone who understood about the apples.</i>

1280
01:22:22,369 --> 01:22:24,367
Sorry it made me so happy.

1281
01:22:29,036 --> 01:22:31,314
- It's all right.
- No, it ain't all right.

1282
01:22:31,703 --> 01:22:34,390
I reckon the stuff about the apples
is just words in your mouth.

1283
01:22:36,136 --> 01:22:38,134
You can't really share my pleasure.

1284
01:22:39,036 --> 01:22:40,402
I do.

1285
01:22:40,403 --> 01:22:44,529
Vera wants me picking apples from trees
that are barely in the ground.

1286
01:22:46,369 --> 01:22:48,367
Things take time, that's love!

1287
01:22:49,803 --> 01:22:53,169
Seeing what they need
and respecting those needs,

1288
01:22:53,703 --> 01:22:56,480
if anyone understands that it's you.
At least I thought so.

1289
01:22:56,936 --> 01:22:59,394
- I do understand that.
- But you edge away when I get close.

1290
01:22:59,803 --> 01:23:01,202
N...

1291
01:23:01,203 --> 01:23:03,068
Why do you find me so repugnant?

1292
01:23:03,069 --> 01:23:05,067
I don't find you repugnant, I...

1293
01:23:06,503 --> 01:23:08,501
Don't be upset.

1294
01:23:09,736 --> 01:23:12,133
I'm sorry if I doubted you.

1295
01:23:12,536 --> 01:23:14,534
It won't happen again...

1296
01:23:16,469 --> 01:23:18,467
I promise you.

1297
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:22,977
I wouldn't make that promise
if I was you.

1298
01:23:29,436 --> 01:23:31,714
When you fended me <i>off,
</i>a thought came into my mind.

1299
01:23:32,102 --> 01:23:34,380
<i>It made me ashamed.</i>

1300
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:36,768
A thought that you'd hate me for.

1301
01:23:38,236 --> 01:23:40,234
I would never hate you...

1302
01:23:41,036 --> 01:23:43,034
never.

1303
01:23:47,036 --> 01:23:49,034
<i>What?</i>

1304
01:23:50,236 --> 01:23:52,234
Chuck, I treated you unfairly,

1305
01:23:52,469 --> 01:23:54,637
it's all right
to have angry thoughts.

1306
01:23:58,403 --> 01:24:00,401
I thought of turning you in.

1307
01:24:03,002 --> 01:24:05,490
I thought of blackmailing you
into respecting me.

1308
01:24:15,336 --> 01:24:17,334
It means that much to you?

1309
01:24:19,203 --> 01:24:21,201
It does, doesn't it?

1310
01:24:23,002 --> 01:24:25,170
You've really been alone up here,
haven't you?

1311
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:28,934
<i>You haven't had anyone
to comfort you.</i>

1312
01:24:30,203 --> 01:24:32,721
And I should ask you
for forgiveness.

1313
01:24:41,169 --> 01:24:43,167
<i>Still friends?</i>

1314
01:25:12,169 --> 01:25:13,734
Sorry. Are you asleep?

1315
01:25:13,735 --> 01:25:15,733
No.

1316
01:25:15,969 --> 01:25:17,967
<i>Want me to leave?</i>

1317
01:25:18,102 --> 01:25:20,100
No, I was just resting.

1318
01:25:20,369 --> 01:25:23,406
Awful lot to do
here in Dogville considering...

1319
01:25:25,203 --> 01:25:27,750
nobody needs anything done.

1320
01:25:29,969 --> 01:25:32,367
Jason wants to sit
on my lap all the time.

1321
01:25:37,203 --> 01:25:39,391
I think you're doing a wonderful job.

1322
01:25:41,969 --> 01:25:44,137
<i>You give us all so much.</i>

1323
01:25:44,503 --> 01:25:47,190
What Mr. McKay said,
right on the button.

1324
01:25:47,636 --> 01:25:49,634
Right on the button.

1325
01:25:50,536 --> 01:25:52,703
He tried to put his hand
on my knee today.

1326
01:25:53,069 --> 01:25:55,117
Well, he's blind, after all.

1327
01:25:55,469 --> 01:25:57,487
It was probably an accident.

1328
01:26:01,102 --> 01:26:03,035
Ma Ginger

1329
01:26:03,036 --> 01:26:07,042
got angry at me
for running across the gravel path.

1330
01:26:09,869 --> 01:26:13,206
Well, good. She gets angry at me.

1331
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,501
It just means you're one of us now.

1332
01:26:17,769 --> 01:26:19,817
You can see through it all,
can't you?

1333
01:26:36,936 --> 01:26:39,364
I tell you, I'm gonna be asleep
in two minutes.

1334
01:26:39,769 --> 01:26:42,577
What if I don't want you
to go to sleep?

1335
01:26:43,036 --> 01:26:45,314
I don't think you have
a choice tonight.

1336
01:26:56,802 --> 01:26:58,850
I do love you, Grace.

1337
01:27:00,669 --> 01:27:04,146
I'm glad you love me,
I love you too.

1338
01:27:04,702 --> 01:27:06,700
<i>I really do.</i>

1339
01:27:10,835 --> 01:27:13,083
I mean I yearn for you when...

1340
01:27:13,469 --> 01:27:15,467
when I'm not with you.

1341
01:27:20,602 --> 01:27:24,109
I yearn for you even when we're...
alone like this.

1342
01:27:27,403 --> 01:27:30,649
I yearn to be even closer to you,

1343
01:27:31,169 --> 01:27:33,447
to touch you the way that people...

1344
01:27:33,835 --> 01:27:36,702
We have our whole lives
ahead of us.

1345
01:27:39,735 --> 01:27:43,861
The thing that I love about you is
that you don't demand anything of me,

1346
01:27:44,503 --> 01:27:48,369
that we can just... just be together.

1347
01:27:48,969 --> 01:27:51,017
Yeah.

1348
01:27:51,369 --> 01:27:54,675
Yearning will only make it better.

1349
01:28:02,902 --> 01:28:04,900
<i>Thank you for your...</i>

1350
01:28:04,936 --> 01:28:07,893
<i>your words, your wise, wise words.</i>

1351
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:12,700
You're welcome.

1352
01:28:15,735 --> 01:28:17,733
You want your shoes off?

1353
01:28:33,425 --> 01:28:39,758
CHAPTER SIX
in which Dogville bares its teeth.

1354
01:28:43,569 --> 01:28:45,647
Jason, what are you doing here?

1355
01:28:46,969 --> 01:28:49,017
That's wrong.

1356
01:28:49,369 --> 01:28:51,367
The words have to be
divided differently.

1357
01:28:54,203 --> 01:28:56,001
Stop it!

1358
01:28:56,002 --> 01:28:58,220
How's that for dividing the words?

1359
01:29:00,369 --> 01:29:03,236
This is not a good day.
Everybody should leave.

1360
01:29:03,702 --> 01:29:06,629
Everybody except Jason.
Jason, I want to talk to you alone.

1361
01:29:07,102 --> 01:29:10,029
<i>What is it? What's going on?</i>

1362
01:29:11,835 --> 01:29:14,003
- I can be very bad.
- What...?

1363
01:29:14,369 --> 01:29:16,068
Bet my Pa told you.

1364
01:29:16,069 --> 01:29:18,067
I don't think that.

1365
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:20,100
I think there is
another reason for this.

1366
01:29:21,769 --> 01:29:24,017
I would love to have you
on my lap all the time

1367
01:29:24,403 --> 01:29:26,401
but I can't,
not with the others here.

1368
01:29:28,602 --> 01:29:32,259
When somebody can't do all the things
they'd like to do for others,

1369
01:29:32,835 --> 01:29:35,582
sometimes the people
they promised get mad.

1370
01:29:37,203 --> 01:29:39,371
That's what Mrs. Henson says.

1371
01:29:41,669 --> 01:29:43,568
Yes, that's true.

1372
01:29:43,569 --> 01:29:46,117
I suppose I know why you won't let me
sit in your lap anymore.

1373
01:29:47,535 --> 01:29:49,533
- Why?
<i>- Because I've been mean lately.</i>

1374
01:29:49,602 --> 01:29:53,878
Come on, I'm sure you have
your reasons for that.

1375
01:29:54,535 --> 01:29:56,533
I've been mean to the others too.

1376
01:29:56,735 --> 01:29:59,073
Even baby Achilles.

1377
01:29:59,468 --> 01:30:02,096
And he's so tiny,
he can't put up a fight.

1378
01:30:04,303 --> 01:30:06,610
- It's not right.
- No, it's not.

1379
01:30:07,002 --> 01:30:09,000
I got it coming to me.

1380
01:30:09,936 --> 01:30:12,863
- I know, I deserve a spanking.
- What?

1381
01:30:13,336 --> 01:30:16,762
I should hit you?
I'm not gonna do that.

1382
01:30:17,303 --> 01:30:20,429
Your mother doesn't believe in physical
discipline, I'm not gonna hit you.

1383
01:30:20,936 --> 01:30:24,412
I know. She'd be awful mad
if she found out you whipped me.

1384
01:30:24,969 --> 01:30:27,956
I just said I won't do that, so...

1385
01:30:28,435 --> 01:30:31,183
It's good
having Ma on your side, right?

1386
01:30:32,669 --> 01:30:35,037
<i>It would be pretty serious
if she turned against you.</i>

1387
01:30:35,435 --> 01:30:38,652
I am the way I am. If people
in this town don't like me, then...

1388
01:30:39,169 --> 01:30:41,826
there's nothing I can do about that.

1389
01:30:42,269 --> 01:30:44,267
I feel bad, I need to be punished.

1390
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:47,876
In fact, I wouldn't have any respect for
you if you didn't give me a spanking.

1391
01:30:48,402 --> 01:30:50,800
I don't care how much fun
you think it would be

1392
01:30:51,203 --> 01:30:53,341
I'm not gonna spank you, Jason.

1393
01:30:55,136 --> 01:30:57,304
In that case...

1394
01:30:57,669 --> 01:31:01,146
when Ma gets home... maybe I'll just
have to tell her you hit me.

1395
01:31:01,702 --> 01:31:03,235
But I just said that I wouldn't.

1396
01:31:03,236 --> 01:31:06,572
<i>I reckon Ma'll take my word for it.</i>

1397
01:31:07,102 --> 01:31:10,119
If you give me that spanking,
nobody's ever have to know.

1398
01:31:16,635 --> 01:31:18,633
Stop it. Get away from Achilles.
Stop it!

1399
01:31:20,269 --> 01:31:22,576
I gave his crib a shove.

1400
01:31:22,969 --> 01:31:25,896
- Not my fault it didn't tip over.
- Don't you touch him.

1401
01:31:26,368 --> 01:31:28,366
Move away from the crib.
Stop it, Jason!

1402
01:31:28,502 --> 01:31:30,670
Stop it!
All right, you want a spanking?

1403
01:31:31,036 --> 01:31:33,433
I'll give you a spanking.
Come here. Come here.

1404
01:31:36,602 --> 01:31:38,600
There... there we go.

1405
01:31:38,669 --> 01:31:42,236
That wasn't hard. It's got to be hard
or it isn't punishment.

1406
01:31:42,802 --> 01:31:45,699
- All right.
- Harder.

1407
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:49,668
This is... Come on!

1408
01:31:49,669 --> 01:31:51,687
That's enough.
That's enough punishment now.

1409
01:31:52,036 --> 01:31:54,753
Maybe I should go stand in the corner
and be ashamed?

1410
01:31:55,203 --> 01:31:58,329
I don't care! Stand in the corner,
do whatever you're gonna do.

1411
01:31:58,835 --> 01:32:00,833
<i>Hey, there's Pa!</i>

1412
01:32:05,535 --> 01:32:07,501
He's early...
I hope nothing's wrong.

1413
01:32:07,502 --> 01:32:09,960
<i>Just as Dogville
had done from its open,</i>

1414
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:14,115
<i>frail shelf on the mountainside, quite
unprotected from any capricious storms,</i>

1415
01:32:14,702 --> 01:32:18,069
<i>- Grace too had laid herself open.</i>
- Ma Ginger says...

1416
01:32:18,602 --> 01:32:21,379
<i>And there she dangled
from her frail stalk</i>

1417
01:32:21,835 --> 01:32:24,292
<i>like the apple in the Garden of Eden,</i>

1418
01:32:24,702 --> 01:32:27,799
<i>an apple so swollen
that the juices almost ran.</i>

1419
01:32:30,435 --> 01:32:33,622
<i>And once again,
the police had come to Dogville.</i>

1420
01:32:35,869 --> 01:32:37,867
<i>I said I'd tell you...</i>

1421
01:32:38,102 --> 01:32:40,439
to save Martha
the confusion about the ringing.

1422
01:32:40,835 --> 01:32:43,262
But I forgot.
They're already down by Canyon Road.

1423
01:32:43,669 --> 01:32:46,856
The fellow in the other car is from
the Federal Bureau of investigation.

1424
01:32:47,368 --> 01:32:49,646
- You forgot?
- Yeah.

1425
01:32:50,036 --> 01:32:52,034
It's the busy time for the apples.

1426
01:32:52,136 --> 01:32:54,001
The FBI.

1427
01:32:54,002 --> 01:32:57,568
They were most interested in hearing
what I'd seen in the past six months.

1428
01:32:58,136 --> 01:33:00,883
<i>Anything related to that
wanted poster.</i>

1429
01:33:01,335 --> 01:33:03,413
They asked me if I'd seen
any signs in the woods

1430
01:33:03,769 --> 01:33:06,107
of anyone camping out there.

1431
01:33:06,502 --> 01:33:08,690
God only knows
what that woman is capable of.

1432
01:33:09,069 --> 01:33:11,376
You know
she is not capable of anything.

1433
01:33:11,769 --> 01:33:14,167
Well, that's what <i>you</i> say.

1434
01:33:14,569 --> 01:33:18,285
It sure didn't sound that way
coming from the laws.

1435
01:33:18,869 --> 01:33:21,087
<i>That's why I felt
I had to tell them what I knew.</i>

1436
01:33:24,302 --> 01:33:26,300
<i>What did you tell them?</i>

1437
01:33:26,569 --> 01:33:29,756
<i>I thought I'd seen something
in the woods recently.</i>

1438
01:33:30,268 --> 01:33:32,266
<i>An item of clothing, to be exact.</i>

1439
01:33:32,402 --> 01:33:35,769
Turned out it was just an old hat
Tom had lost.

1440
01:33:36,302 --> 01:33:38,730
- But could have been this.
<i>- Chuck, give me that.</i>

1441
01:33:39,136 --> 01:33:41,134
Expensive by the feel of it.

1442
01:33:41,402 --> 01:33:43,400
Your initials on it.

1443
01:33:46,468 --> 01:33:49,455
I imagine they'd draw the same
conclusions from this as anybody would.

1444
01:33:49,936 --> 01:33:54,561
I told the laws it will take me no time
at all to find this piece of clothing.

1445
01:33:56,235 --> 01:33:58,513
<i>I reckon we got us 10 minutes,
maybe 15,</i>

1446
01:33:58,902 --> 01:34:01,209
before they start knocking on doors.

1447
01:34:01,602 --> 01:34:04,259
<i>I wouldn't try to run away.</i>

1448
01:34:04,702 --> 01:34:06,700
<i>They're sure to see you.</i>

1449
01:34:06,802 --> 01:34:09,959
- Why would I want to run away, Chuck?
<i>- I wouldn't try to holler either.</i>

1450
01:34:10,468 --> 01:34:13,595
- Why would I want to do that?
<i>- It wasn't me who wanted you here.</i>

1451
01:34:14,102 --> 01:34:16,789
You're far too beautiful
and frail for this place.

1452
01:34:18,402 --> 01:34:20,830
You tricked me into feeling
that I meant something to you.

1453
01:34:21,235 --> 01:34:23,693
It's your own damned fault
I need your respect, Grace.

1454
01:34:24,102 --> 01:34:27,029
- You have my respect, Chuck.
- I want your respect.

1455
01:34:27,502 --> 01:34:29,500
Don't...

1456
01:34:42,502 --> 01:34:44,500
This is wrong.

1457
01:34:46,069 --> 01:34:48,556
If I can force the flowers
to bloom early in spring...

1458
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,576
I can force you.

1459
01:34:52,969 --> 01:34:54,967
Please...

1460
01:35:02,936 --> 01:35:05,713
No! Stop it!

1461
01:35:06,168 --> 01:35:08,166
Please stop, please.

1462
01:35:08,502 --> 01:35:10,500
Please don't, please.

1463
01:35:12,135 --> 01:35:14,183
Please, please, look at me.

1464
01:35:14,535 --> 01:35:16,553
Look at me and talk to me, please.

1465
01:35:16,902 --> 01:35:19,209
We're friends. You're my friend.

1466
01:35:21,702 --> 01:35:25,358
- No, no, Grace, we're not.
- Stop it.

1467
01:36:24,735 --> 01:36:26,534
Have you seen Grace?

1468
01:36:26,535 --> 01:36:28,903
She's at my place.

1469
01:36:29,302 --> 01:36:32,339
- She busy?
- Not anymore. Go right in.

1470
01:36:57,468 --> 01:36:59,466
<i>Yet again Grace had made</i>

1471
01:36:59,602 --> 01:37:03,228
<i>a miraculous escape from her pursuers
with the aid of the people of Dogville.</i>

1472
01:37:03,802 --> 01:37:07,398
<i>Everyone had covered up for her,
including Chuck,</i>

1473
01:37:07,968 --> 01:37:10,866
<i>who had to admit
that it was probably Tom's hat</i>

1474
01:37:11,335 --> 01:37:14,402
<i>he'd mistakenly considered
so suspicious.</i>

1475
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:26,467
CHAPTER SEVEN in which Grace
finally gets enough of Dogville,

1476
01:37:26,633 --> 01:37:30,300
leaves the town,
and again sees the light of day.

1477
01:37:30,702 --> 01:37:33,719
<i>That evening, Tom had sensed at once</i>

1478
01:37:34,202 --> 01:37:38,267
<i>that something had taken place,
but had to plead with Grace for ages</i>

1479
01:37:38,902 --> 01:37:40,920
<i>before she finally broke down</i>

1480
01:37:41,268 --> 01:37:43,266
<i>and unburdened herself.</i>

1481
01:37:43,435 --> 01:37:45,401
I have to confront him, I mean...

1482
01:37:45,402 --> 01:37:47,450
- No, no.
<i>- I have no choice.</i>

1483
01:37:47,802 --> 01:37:50,200
- No one will accept what he did to you.
<i>- I don't want you to.</i>

1484
01:37:50,602 --> 01:37:53,289
I came here with all these ideas

1485
01:37:53,735 --> 01:37:56,752
and these stupid prejudices...

1486
01:37:59,635 --> 01:38:02,762
He's not strong, Tom.

1487
01:38:03,268 --> 01:38:06,076
<i>He looks strong, but he's not.</i>

1488
01:38:07,835 --> 01:38:10,792
I'm gonna start looking for a way
to get you out of here.

1489
01:38:23,969 --> 01:38:25,967
<i>The end of the summer had come</i>

1490
01:38:26,069 --> 01:38:29,965
<i>and in Elm Street, the second clutch
of Dogville's scatty squirrels</i>

1491
01:38:30,569 --> 01:38:33,376
<i>scooted in and out of the legs
of children and grown-ups alike,</i>

1492
01:38:33,835 --> 01:38:37,781
<i>searching in vain
for Elm Street's nonexistent elms.</i>

1493
01:38:39,535 --> 01:38:43,571
<i>The heat had turned the soil
among the gooseberry bushes to stone.</i>

1494
01:38:44,201 --> 01:38:47,538
<i>But Grace did not complain.
She threw herself into her work,</i>

1495
01:38:48,069 --> 01:38:52,514
<i>happy that it was something you could
actually grasp between your fingers.</i>

1496
01:38:53,201 --> 01:38:55,889
- Hey, Liz, hey, Vera.
<i>- Better watch out, Grace.</i>

1497
01:38:56,335 --> 01:38:58,853
<i>Vera's got it in for you today.</i>

1498
01:38:59,268 --> 01:39:01,696
What are you talking about?

1499
01:39:02,102 --> 01:39:04,499
<i>Maybe you thought
he wouldn't tell me.</i>

1500
01:39:07,869 --> 01:39:10,057
Who?

1501
01:39:10,435 --> 01:39:12,433
You hit Jason.

1502
01:39:15,136 --> 01:39:18,003
- I did.
<i>- How could you do such a thing?</i>

1503
01:39:20,036 --> 01:39:24,221
I know it sounds implausible,
but he was asking for it.

1504
01:39:24,869 --> 01:39:28,175
It's true, Vera,
he's always asking for it.

1505
01:39:29,802 --> 01:39:32,110
I should have done it myself
a long time ago.

1506
01:39:32,502 --> 01:39:33,935
Liz!

1507
01:39:33,936 --> 01:39:35,934
It's your fault,
the way you've spoiled him.

1508
01:39:36,201 --> 01:39:38,199
I know how much
you love him, Vera.

1509
01:39:40,502 --> 01:39:42,434
So do I.

1510
01:39:42,435 --> 01:39:44,513
It won't happen again.

1511
01:39:44,869 --> 01:39:46,867
It really won't...

1512
01:39:47,069 --> 01:39:51,164
I know it won't, because I'll never
leave them with you again.

1513
01:39:51,802 --> 01:39:54,489
<i>That'd be far too dangerous
for any child of mine.</i>

1514
01:39:54,936 --> 01:39:58,272
- I've been tired.
- Well, maybe you should see

1515
01:39:58,802 --> 01:40:01,229
about sleeping at night
like most folks do.

1516
01:40:01,635 --> 01:40:04,242
Sleeping at night?

1517
01:40:04,669 --> 01:40:08,795
Martha saw
a certain Tom Edison Jr.

1518
01:40:09,435 --> 01:40:11,433
Sneak out of her shed

1519
01:40:11,769 --> 01:40:13,957
early this morning.

1520
01:40:19,002 --> 01:40:22,308
Grace, you won't hear anything from me
about whipping that idiot kid.

1521
01:40:22,835 --> 01:40:26,052
<i>I'm also grateful for you for turning
Tom's wandering eye away from my skirts,</i>

1522
01:40:26,569 --> 01:40:29,966
but on the other hand, I expected
more from you than that.

1523
01:40:32,435 --> 01:40:35,152
But if that's the kind of thing
you're after, then I'm sure

1524
01:40:35,602 --> 01:40:38,529
with your innocent looks you'll do
just fine in a place like Dogville.

1525
01:40:39,002 --> 01:40:41,000
It's not what I am after, Liz.

1526
01:40:41,036 --> 01:40:43,753
No? We all saw you
take his hand at the picnic.

1527
01:40:44,201 --> 01:40:46,389
Maybe that wasn't flirting.

1528
01:40:48,302 --> 01:40:51,729
Yes, maybe I was flirting.

1529
01:41:00,869 --> 01:41:03,676
<i>Next day, the weather changed.</i>

1530
01:41:04,135 --> 01:41:07,322
<i>The fog came rolling down
from the mountains.</i>

1531
01:41:07,835 --> 01:41:10,322
<i>And although there were
no sunsets to be seen,</i>

1532
01:41:10,735 --> 01:41:13,922
<i>McKay thought it best
that she sat by him anyway.</i>

1533
01:41:14,435 --> 01:41:17,362
<i>She had sat by Jack McKay
so many times now.</i>

1534
01:41:17,835 --> 01:41:21,521
<i>But Jack had not got better
at judging the distance between them.</i>

1535
01:41:22,101 --> 01:41:26,457
<i>On the contrary, where fingers alone
had previously brushed her young flesh,</i>

1536
01:41:27,135 --> 01:41:29,593
<i>now it was a hand
that remained in place</i>

1537
01:41:30,002 --> 01:41:32,000
<i>throughout the allotted span.</i>

1538
01:41:35,068 --> 01:41:39,224
<i>The hours in the orchard were long now,
for the harvest was underway.</i>

1539
01:41:39,869 --> 01:41:43,295
<i>And Grace had long since given up
arguing with Chuck's perception</i>

1540
01:41:43,835 --> 01:41:47,311
<i>that respect for cultivation,
harvest and fruit</i>

1541
01:41:47,869 --> 01:41:51,205
<i>could be directly measured
in provision of carnality.</i>

1542
01:41:51,735 --> 01:41:54,602
<i>Though reluctant
to leave Grace alone,</i>

1543
01:41:55,068 --> 01:41:58,345
<i>Tom wandered around
quite often now, lost in thought</i>

1544
01:41:58,869 --> 01:42:01,936
<i>as he tried to crack the problem
of possible escape.</i>

1545
01:42:02,435 --> 01:42:06,501
<i>And as Grace's wages no longer
found their way to her purse,</i>

1546
01:42:07,135 --> 01:42:09,133
<i>he had stepped in,</i>

1547
01:42:09,135 --> 01:42:11,353
<i>and together
they had triumphantly picked up</i>

1548
01:42:11,735 --> 01:42:15,481
<i>the last of the seven figurines
from Ma Ginger's window.</i>

1549
01:42:25,635 --> 01:42:28,652
- What's the matter?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

1550
01:42:29,135 --> 01:42:32,762
Are the police
on Canyon Road again?

1551
01:42:33,335 --> 01:42:35,353
<i>No...</i>

1552
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:40,196
this is just girl talk.

1553
01:42:40,635 --> 01:42:43,822
It's funny you should mention
Canyon Road though,

1554
01:42:44,335 --> 01:42:46,733
right, Martha?
She was just there this morning.

1555
01:42:47,135 --> 01:42:49,133
On the way home from church.

1556
01:42:49,268 --> 01:42:51,266
You see so much more on foot.

1557
01:42:51,602 --> 01:42:53,600
You know, when you're in a car,

1558
01:42:53,602 --> 01:42:57,138
you never notice
the apple orchard for example.

1559
01:42:58,935 --> 01:43:00,933
You can only see it

1560
01:43:01,035 --> 01:43:03,783
<i>from one spot on Canyon Road.</i>

1561
01:43:04,235 --> 01:43:06,543
<i>- That's right...
- You know that spot, Martha?</i>

1562
01:43:06,935 --> 01:43:08,933
<i>Yes I do.</i>

1563
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:11,901
<i>And...</i>

1564
01:43:11,902 --> 01:43:14,329
did you stop there to enjoy the view
this morning?

1565
01:43:14,735 --> 01:43:17,632
It's harvest time, you know,
in the orchard, after all.

1566
01:43:18,101 --> 01:43:21,408
The old masters always loved
a good harvest theme,

1567
01:43:21,935 --> 01:43:23,933
<i>redolent with fertility,</i>

1568
01:43:24,268 --> 01:43:26,786
not to mention sensibility,

1569
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:30,628
or even eroticism.

1570
01:43:33,569 --> 01:43:35,567
But how silly of me

1571
01:43:35,802 --> 01:43:38,869
to ask you that, Martha,
because you already said you did.

1572
01:43:43,001 --> 01:43:45,139
She saw you, Grace.

1573
01:43:49,035 --> 01:43:51,693
She saw you...

1574
01:43:54,535 --> 01:43:57,842
behind this pile of broken limbs...

1575
01:43:59,402 --> 01:44:01,650
with Chuck.

1576
01:44:05,001 --> 01:44:08,308
He said it wasn't the first time
you'd made advances towards him.

1577
01:44:10,602 --> 01:44:14,518
<i>He never told me before because he
wanted to spare my feelings.</i>

1578
01:44:16,769 --> 01:44:19,426
He's a withdrawn

1579
01:44:19,868 --> 01:44:22,386
and primitive man.

1580
01:44:23,901 --> 01:44:25,167
Vera...

1581
01:44:25,168 --> 01:44:27,596
But at heart, he's loyal!

1582
01:44:28,001 --> 01:44:29,999
And he's good.

1583
01:44:30,302 --> 01:44:32,849
What do you want with my husband?

1584
01:44:34,368 --> 01:44:38,024
I don't want anything...

1585
01:44:38,602 --> 01:44:40,969
with your husband

1586
01:44:41,368 --> 01:44:43,736
or anybody.

1587
01:44:44,135 --> 01:44:46,713
What about Tom
and the hand-holding at the picnic?

1588
01:44:47,135 --> 01:44:50,472
That's different, I like Tom.

1589
01:44:51,001 --> 01:44:53,169
But you don't like Chuck?

1590
01:44:53,535 --> 01:44:55,902
Liz and Martha are behind me

1591
01:44:56,302 --> 01:44:59,049
<i>when I tell you I'm gonna have
to teach you a lesson.</i>

1592
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:02,279
I believe in education.

1593
01:45:05,968 --> 01:45:07,367
Vera!

1594
01:45:07,368 --> 01:45:09,366
<i>I believe smashing them</i>

1595
01:45:09,402 --> 01:45:11,740
is less a crime than making them.

1596
01:45:13,669 --> 01:45:15,667
<i>Vera, remember</i>

1597
01:45:15,735 --> 01:45:17,733
how I taught your children...

1598
01:45:17,801 --> 01:45:20,549
<i>- What?
- Remember how happy you were...</i>

1599
01:45:21,001 --> 01:45:23,898
<i>- when I taught your children...
- When you what?</i>

1600
01:45:24,368 --> 01:45:28,114
About the doctrine of stoicism
and they finally understood it?

1601
01:45:29,768 --> 01:45:32,106
<i>All right, for that
I'm gonna be lenient,</i>

1602
01:45:32,502 --> 01:45:35,569
I am going to break
two of your figurines first.

1603
01:45:38,535 --> 01:45:41,991
And if you can demonstrate

1604
01:45:42,535 --> 01:45:45,901
your knowledge
of the doctrine of stoicism

1605
01:45:46,435 --> 01:45:48,513
<i>by holding back your tears,</i>

1606
01:45:48,868 --> 01:45:50,866
<i>I'll stop.</i>

1607
01:45:52,268 --> 01:45:54,266
<i>Have you got that?</i>

1608
01:46:06,535 --> 01:46:09,991
<i>In her lifetime,
Grace had had considerable practice</i>

1609
01:46:10,535 --> 01:46:13,492
<i>at constraining her emotions
and would never have believed</i>

1610
01:46:13,968 --> 01:46:16,216
<i>it would be hard
to control them now.</i>

1611
01:46:17,635 --> 01:46:20,382
<i>But as the porcelain
pulverized on the floor,</i>

1612
01:46:20,834 --> 01:46:24,641
<i>it was as if it were
human tissue disintegrating.</i>

1613
01:46:26,268 --> 01:46:28,546
<i>The figurines were the offspring
of the meeting</i>

1614
01:46:28,935 --> 01:46:31,073
<i>between the township and her.</i>

1615
01:46:31,435 --> 01:46:34,422
<i>They were the proof
that in spite of everything,</i>

1616
01:46:34,901 --> 01:46:38,148
<i>her suffering had created
something of value.</i>

1617
01:46:38,669 --> 01:46:42,095
<i>Grace could no longer cope.</i>

1618
01:46:42,635 --> 01:46:47,350
<i>For the first time
since her childhood, she wept.</i>

1619
01:47:17,335 --> 01:47:19,852
<i>Grace went to see Tom
that very night</i>

1620
01:47:20,268 --> 01:47:22,725
<i>and informed him that
she was ready to follow his advice</i>

1621
01:47:23,135 --> 01:47:25,133
<i>and leave the township.</i>

1622
01:47:25,235 --> 01:47:27,952
<i>And since Tom
had just made up his mind</i>

1623
01:47:28,402 --> 01:47:31,938
<i>that a third party would be needed
to ensure the success of an escape,</i>

1624
01:47:32,502 --> 01:47:35,489
<i>they agreed that Ben
possessed the greatest potential.</i>

1625
01:47:37,035 --> 01:47:40,811
<i>But it was a case where money
was required, Tom concluded.</i>

1626
01:47:41,402 --> 01:47:44,589
<i>And estimated
that considering the times and all,</i>

1627
01:47:45,101 --> 01:47:47,968
<i>$10 would suffice
for Ben and his truck.</i>

1628
01:47:48,435 --> 01:47:50,433
But we don't have $10.

1629
01:47:50,602 --> 01:47:52,969
Then we borrow it.

1630
01:47:53,368 --> 01:47:56,235
- From whom?
- From Dad.

1631
01:47:56,701 --> 01:47:59,069
He has more than that
in the medicine closet.

1632
01:47:59,468 --> 01:48:02,015
I'll talk to him in the morning,
arrange a loan.

1633
01:48:02,435 --> 01:48:04,433
But you have a word with Ben.

1634
01:48:04,768 --> 01:48:07,076
It's the end of the week,
he's bound to be flat broke.

1635
01:48:08,968 --> 01:48:11,596
Tell your father
that I will pay him back.

1636
01:48:12,035 --> 01:48:14,033
Of course!

1637
01:48:17,935 --> 01:48:19,933
Thank you.

1638
01:48:22,768 --> 01:48:26,225
You're always... rescuing me.

1639
01:48:29,968 --> 01:48:32,715
I can't believe you go on
being there for me.

1640
01:48:35,734 --> 01:48:37,732
Good night.

1641
01:48:39,868 --> 01:48:41,866
<i>You should get some sleep.</i>

1642
01:48:50,668 --> 01:48:53,326
<i>Grace went to see Ben next morning.</i>

1643
01:48:54,935 --> 01:48:57,153
Ben?

1644
01:48:57,535 --> 01:48:59,533
<i>When Grace presented the payment</i>

1645
01:48:59,868 --> 01:49:03,525
<i>as compensation between friends,
Ben did not object too heartily,</i>

1646
01:49:04,101 --> 01:49:07,258
<i>considering the trouble he could receive
from the rest of the townspeople</i>

1647
01:49:07,768 --> 01:49:09,906
<i>when they realized
what had happened.</i>

1648
01:49:10,268 --> 01:49:13,544
<i>Perhaps they'd all be relieved
that she was out of their lives,</i>

1649
01:49:14,068 --> 01:49:17,025
<i>but somehow
Grace wasn't too sure of that.</i>

1650
01:49:17,502 --> 01:49:20,718
<i>Ben agreed to drive her,
even though he wasn't out to profit</i>

1651
01:49:21,235 --> 01:49:24,162
<i>from other folks' misfortunes,
as he put it.</i>

1652
01:49:24,634 --> 01:49:27,352
I don't want to profit
from other folks' misfortunes.

1653
01:49:27,801 --> 01:49:28,934
No.

1654
01:49:28,935 --> 01:49:32,831
<i>The fact was Ben would have driven
to the gates of hell and back for $10.</i>

1655
01:49:33,435 --> 01:49:37,351
<i>And the criminal aspect bugged him less
than Grace would ever have guessed.</i>

1656
01:49:37,968 --> 01:49:41,305
<i>He had freighted
all kinds of things in his day.</i>

1657
01:49:41,834 --> 01:49:45,111
<i>The plan was for Grace
to hide among the apples.</i>

1658
01:49:45,634 --> 01:49:47,632
<i>"Knowing the exact time to harvest</i>

1659
01:49:47,901 --> 01:49:50,069
<i>is the greatest art of all,"
Chuck had said.</i>

1660
01:49:50,435 --> 01:49:52,334
<i>And the time had come</i>

1661
01:49:52,335 --> 01:49:55,142
<i>for the apples and for Grace.</i>

1662
01:49:55,601 --> 01:49:57,739
Grace, where you been?
If I'd have displayed

1663
01:49:58,101 --> 01:50:00,179
the same indifference
to the timing of my chores,

1664
01:50:00,534 --> 01:50:03,342
I'd be in for a whipping.
Now get a move on!

1665
01:50:03,801 --> 01:50:07,488
I'm sorry, Olivia,
I had to talk to Ben about something...

1666
01:50:08,068 --> 01:50:09,267
June is near to bursting.

1667
01:50:09,268 --> 01:50:11,575
She can't use the pot on her own,
as you well know.

1668
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:15,425
It ain't fittin' to toy with her because
she crippled and can't help herself.

1669
01:50:19,901 --> 01:50:23,557
<i>The evening before the escape,
Tom tactically thought it best</i>

1670
01:50:24,135 --> 01:50:27,322
<i>not to press his desires of the flesh
too hard upon Grace.</i>

1671
01:50:28,801 --> 01:50:32,637
<i>And instead, he adopted
a more sensitive approach.</i>

1672
01:50:34,768 --> 01:50:38,335
There's a right and a wrong time
to plant seeds.

1673
01:50:38,901 --> 01:50:40,899
You can't plant seeds in the winter.

1674
01:50:42,701 --> 01:50:44,699
That's true,

1675
01:50:44,768 --> 01:50:46,766
but I love you...

1676
01:50:46,801 --> 01:50:48,909
- I know.
- ...and you love me.

1677
01:50:49,268 --> 01:50:52,454
And we will meet again
in love and in freedom.

1678
01:50:52,968 --> 01:50:55,366
Absolutely.

1679
01:50:55,768 --> 01:50:57,766
I shouldn't be ashamed
wanting you, should I?

1680
01:50:58,068 --> 01:51:00,965
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- No.

1681
01:51:01,435 --> 01:51:02,700
I know.

1682
01:51:02,701 --> 01:51:05,628
No, it's lovely.
It's lovely that we want each other.

1683
01:51:07,834 --> 01:51:10,142
- But not this way.
- No.

1684
01:51:10,534 --> 01:51:12,672
It's not right.

1685
01:51:22,601 --> 01:51:24,649
<i>The next morning, when Grace</i>

1686
01:51:25,001 --> 01:51:27,608
<i>wanted to slip down
to Ben's as invisibly as possible,</i>

1687
01:51:28,035 --> 01:51:30,582
<i>it seemed to Grace
that the entire township</i>

1688
01:51:31,001 --> 01:51:33,399
<i>was out and about
at the same time.</i>

1689
01:51:33,801 --> 01:51:36,169
- Grace?
- Yes, Vera?

1690
01:51:36,568 --> 01:51:38,876
If you think that by hitting my child,

1691
01:51:39,268 --> 01:51:41,575
you can get out of working
for me, think again.

1692
01:51:41,968 --> 01:51:45,155
Why don't you just
come by as planned and we'll...

1693
01:51:45,668 --> 01:51:48,006
find something where
you won't be able to harm anyone.

1694
01:51:48,401 --> 01:51:50,399
At... 12:00?

1695
01:51:50,534 --> 01:51:52,167
Yes.

1696
01:51:52,168 --> 01:51:55,235
Why are you taking your copious
belongings around with you?

1697
01:51:55,734 --> 01:51:57,842
<i>Afraid you're gonna lose them?</i>

1698
01:51:58,201 --> 01:52:01,008
Grace, Ben is hauling apples today,
so we won't be loading glasses.

1699
01:52:01,467 --> 01:52:03,465
But that don't mean you're off work.

1700
01:52:03,501 --> 01:52:05,609
Dad wants you to repack
the whole last load.

1701
01:52:05,968 --> 01:52:08,545
Maybe you can do it better
and we'll have an extra crate.

1702
01:52:08,968 --> 01:52:11,575
<i>An old crate like that may not have
much value in your eyes,</i>

1703
01:52:12,001 --> 01:52:13,800
<i>but this is Dogville.</i>

1704
01:52:13,801 --> 01:52:15,799
We're not wealthy here.

1705
01:52:16,035 --> 01:52:17,867
And if your hands get a bit red,

1706
01:52:17,868 --> 01:52:20,206
I've got a tip about something
you can rub on them.

1707
01:52:20,601 --> 01:52:22,334
<i>Grace.</i>

1708
01:52:22,335 --> 01:52:24,472
- Martha.
- Hi.

1709
01:52:25,901 --> 01:52:28,358
We have to wash the flagstones
at the foot of the steps again.

1710
01:52:28,768 --> 01:52:31,395
<i>Dirt's gone and blown under the door.
I can't get the door open...</i>

1711
01:52:31,834 --> 01:52:33,832
Where have you been?

1712
01:52:34,101 --> 01:52:36,319
Harvest is the holiest time of the year.

1713
01:52:36,701 --> 01:52:39,329
Doesn't that sound like something
you could have said?

1714
01:52:39,768 --> 01:52:42,955
I'll be down in a minute, Chuck.

1715
01:52:43,467 --> 01:52:47,124
- I'll bring the crates down.
- Good.

1716
01:52:47,701 --> 01:52:50,309
<i>As Grace hastened
to the garage, she grew</i>

1717
01:52:50,734 --> 01:52:55,090
<i>more and more pleased with the decision
to keep her departure under wraps.</i>

1718
01:52:55,768 --> 01:53:00,244
<i>There was actually quite a bit of work
Dogville didn't need doing,</i>

1719
01:53:00,935 --> 01:53:04,441
<i>that its residents would have
to carry out for themselves in future.</i>

1720
01:53:05,001 --> 01:53:07,488
Grace, I don't like having to say this,

1721
01:53:07,901 --> 01:53:11,178
but I'd like to ask if I could have
the money up front.

1722
01:53:11,701 --> 01:53:15,268
See, it's always the way
in the freight industry...

1723
01:53:15,834 --> 01:53:18,491
once you deliver a load,
you ain't got much to bargain with,

1724
01:53:18,935 --> 01:53:21,772
<i>- if you catch my drift.</i>
- Of course, here's the money.

1725
01:53:22,235 --> 01:53:24,542
Not that this is a professional job,
of course.

1726
01:53:24,935 --> 01:53:28,182
- Don't get out, till I give the say-so.
- All right, Ben.

1727
01:53:49,701 --> 01:53:52,828
<i>Canyon Road
snaked down the valley and away</i>

1728
01:53:53,334 --> 01:53:55,672
<i>and Grace went too.</i>

1729
01:53:56,068 --> 01:53:57,833
<i>And with every bend,</i>

1730
01:53:57,834 --> 01:53:59,733
<i>the township and its noises</i>

1731
01:53:59,734 --> 01:54:02,311
<i>faded ever more mercifully
behind her.</i>

1732
01:54:51,935 --> 01:54:54,832
- Something wrong?
- Yeah.

1733
01:54:55,301 --> 01:54:58,258
There are a hell of a lot
of police up ahead.

1734
01:54:59,868 --> 01:55:02,415
I wasn't expecting that.

1735
01:55:02,834 --> 01:55:05,491
It's more dangerous than I thought.

1736
01:55:05,935 --> 01:55:08,652
We'll have to go back.

1737
01:55:09,101 --> 01:55:10,800
- Back?
- Yeah.

1738
01:55:10,801 --> 01:55:13,728
- No, we can't do that.
- No, but...

1739
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:16,598
it's just, if this was a...

1740
01:55:17,001 --> 01:55:19,109
- a professional transport job...
- No, Ben.

1741
01:55:19,467 --> 01:55:22,075
Paid proper like,
it would be a lot easier.

1742
01:55:24,768 --> 01:55:26,816
But it's been paid for.

1743
01:55:27,168 --> 01:55:30,065
Yeah, but in the freight industry

1744
01:55:30,534 --> 01:55:32,722
carrying a dangerous load,

1745
01:55:33,101 --> 01:55:35,099
it costs more.

1746
01:55:36,101 --> 01:55:38,908
A surcharge, they call it.

1747
01:55:39,367 --> 01:55:41,975
If this were a professional job,

1748
01:55:42,401 --> 01:55:45,388
I could just charge you.

1749
01:55:48,135 --> 01:55:50,882
But, Ben,
I don't have any more money.

1750
01:55:55,668 --> 01:55:58,735
That's no good then.

1751
01:56:02,401 --> 01:56:04,399
You said once...

1752
01:56:04,701 --> 01:56:06,699
you said once

1753
01:56:06,768 --> 01:56:09,165
that there aren't
many pleasures in my life.

1754
01:56:12,734 --> 01:56:15,361
You know I go to Miss Laura
once a week.

1755
01:56:15,801 --> 01:56:17,567
Yes.

1756
01:56:17,568 --> 01:56:20,555
And you, you got me to see that

1757
01:56:21,035 --> 01:56:23,782
it weren't nothing to be ashamed of.

1758
01:56:25,501 --> 01:56:27,839
And see...

1759
01:56:28,234 --> 01:56:31,481
I was gonna go there tonight.

1760
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:37,737
And of course, it costs me.

1761
01:56:42,501 --> 01:56:45,338
Not as much as...

1762
01:56:45,801 --> 01:56:50,017
not as much as a surcharge for...

1763
01:56:50,668 --> 01:56:52,666
for dangerous goods,

1764
01:56:52,768 --> 01:56:54,766
but still...

1765
01:56:56,267 --> 01:56:58,665
it does cost me, you know.

1766
01:56:59,068 --> 01:57:01,935
- No, Ben, no, please don't.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1767
01:57:02,401 --> 01:57:05,418
It's not personal, Grace,
it's not personal.

1768
01:57:05,901 --> 01:57:08,298
- I just...
- No.

1769
01:57:08,701 --> 01:57:11,128
I have to take due payment,
that's all.

1770
01:57:12,534 --> 01:57:15,721
- I don't have a choice.
- No, Ben.

1771
01:57:16,234 --> 01:57:18,952
I can't buck the freight industry,
can I?

1772
01:57:19,401 --> 01:57:22,498
No.

1773
01:57:23,001 --> 01:57:25,778
We're parked in the square
in Georgetown.

1774
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:29,198
Right outside the church.

1775
01:57:29,434 --> 01:57:32,211
You'd better keep your voice down.

1776
01:57:35,901 --> 01:57:37,899
No, Ben.

1777
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:41,364
This ain't something
I'm proud of, Grace.

1778
01:57:41,901 --> 01:57:44,418
Don't go thinking that.

1779
01:58:16,334 --> 01:58:18,702
<i>Grace fell asleep
on the long highway,</i>

1780
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:21,208
<i>thanks to her healthy ability</i>

1781
01:58:21,568 --> 01:58:24,465
<i>to push any unpleasantness
around her far away.</i>

1782
01:58:24,935 --> 01:58:27,802
<i>A generous God had blessed her
with the rare talent</i>

1783
01:58:28,267 --> 01:58:30,265
<i>of being able to look ahead</i>

1784
01:58:30,367 --> 01:58:32,365
<i>and only ahead.</i>

1785
01:58:34,067 --> 01:58:36,065
<i>And later
when the truck slowed down</i>

1786
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:38,198
<i>about to reach its destination</i>

1787
01:58:38,301 --> 01:58:40,759
<i>and she slowly returned
to consciousness,</i>

1788
01:58:41,167 --> 01:58:44,124
<i>she had no way of knowing
how long she had slept.</i>

1789
01:58:44,601 --> 01:58:48,577
<i>All she knew was that she would be happy
to see the light of day again.</i>

1790
01:58:50,568 --> 01:58:54,954
<i>And then she heard the dog.</i>

1791
01:59:00,367 --> 01:59:03,404
All your fondness for apples
seems less and less believable, see?

1792
01:59:03,901 --> 01:59:05,899
You bruised them.

1793
01:59:18,668 --> 01:59:21,535
We had a meeting last night
at the mission house.

1794
01:59:24,134 --> 01:59:27,291
They said you might be
gonna try to run away.

1795
01:59:27,801 --> 01:59:29,819
So when I discovered you'd...

1796
01:59:30,167 --> 01:59:32,355
hidden yourself away on my truck...

1797
01:59:33,801 --> 01:59:36,728
I didn't have no choice
but to bring you back to Dogville.

1798
01:59:39,134 --> 01:59:41,212
In the freight industry
we can't take sides.

1799
02:00:25,601 --> 02:00:27,599
<i>It didn't help Grace</i>

1800
02:00:27,668 --> 02:00:30,005
<i>that the first theft
ever registered in Dogville</i>

1801
02:00:30,401 --> 02:00:32,399
<i>had taken place
the previous evening</i>

1802
02:00:32,501 --> 02:00:35,218
<i>when most people were assembled
for the town meeting.</i>

1803
02:00:35,668 --> 02:00:39,034
<i>Old Tom Edison Sr.
had had a considerable sum of money</i>

1804
02:00:39,568 --> 02:00:42,994
<i>stolen from his medicine closet,
and suspicion soon fell on Grace,</i>

1805
02:00:43,534 --> 02:00:45,722
<i>who had apparently been
planning an escape</i>

1806
02:00:46,100 --> 02:00:48,208
<i>that would surely require funding.</i>

1807
02:00:49,534 --> 02:00:51,532
<i>Grace chose to remain silent</i>

1808
02:00:51,801 --> 02:00:53,938
<i>in the face of these new charges.</i>

1809
02:00:55,267 --> 02:00:58,953
<i>And then Bill, who had lately
improved his engineering skills</i>

1810
02:00:59,534 --> 02:01:02,930
<i>to an astonishing degree,
had by way of his first design</i>

1811
02:01:03,467 --> 02:01:06,833
<i>implemented a kind
of escape prevention mechanism.</i>

1812
02:01:07,367 --> 02:01:09,854
<i>Beautiful, it might not have been,</i>

1813
02:01:10,267 --> 02:01:13,394
<i>but effective, he dared say it was.</i>

1814
02:01:23,934 --> 02:01:25,982
Grace,

1815
02:01:26,334 --> 02:01:28,961
we don't like having to do this.

1816
02:01:29,401 --> 02:01:31,539
<i>We don't have much of a choice,</i>

1817
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:34,388
<i>if we're to protect our community.</i>

1818
02:01:34,801 --> 02:01:36,938
Could you, would you mind moving?

1819
02:01:37,301 --> 02:01:39,299
Try moving?

1820
02:01:58,967 --> 02:02:00,965
It works.

1821
02:02:01,267 --> 02:02:03,285
We had to make this heavy enough

1822
02:02:03,634 --> 02:02:05,941
<i>so that it could only move...</i>

1823
02:02:06,334 --> 02:02:08,166
<i>where the ground is level,</i>

1824
02:02:08,167 --> 02:02:10,685
<i>and the ground is level in town.</i>

1825
02:02:16,234 --> 02:02:18,692
May I go now?

1826
02:02:23,967 --> 02:02:27,154
I have to figure out
how I'm gonna get into my house.

1827
02:02:29,701 --> 02:02:33,067
Or is that part of the punishment,
having to sleep outdoors?

1828
02:02:33,601 --> 02:02:35,998
No, no, no, no, Grace.

1829
02:02:36,401 --> 02:02:38,828
Don't think of this as punishment,

1830
02:02:39,234 --> 02:02:41,452
not at all.

1831
02:02:41,833 --> 02:02:44,641
See, Bill, he made
the chain long enough

1832
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:47,348
<i>so that you can sleep in your bed.</i>

1833
02:02:57,900 --> 02:02:59,898
Grace, 6:00.

1834
02:03:02,601 --> 02:03:05,438
Yes, Mrs. Henson.

1835
02:03:12,383 --> 02:03:16,633
CHAPTER EIGHT in which there is
a meeting where the truth is told

1836
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:20,217
and Tom leaves
(only to return later).

1837
02:03:29,067 --> 02:03:31,145
I'm...

1838
02:03:33,634 --> 02:03:36,001
I couldn't run the risk
of Dad turning me down.

1839
02:03:36,401 --> 02:03:39,208
They think it was me
that took the money.

1840
02:03:39,668 --> 02:03:42,325
Because I told them so.

1841
02:03:45,934 --> 02:03:47,932
You did what?

1842
02:03:48,067 --> 02:03:51,284
First, they suspected me, but then
I convinced them that it was you

1843
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:54,288
since you were the one
using the medicine closet.

1844
02:03:55,667 --> 02:03:57,266
Why?

1845
02:03:57,267 --> 02:03:59,515
It's good I'm here
to do the thinking for you.

1846
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:02,857
If we are to have the slightest chance
of getting you out of here...

1847
02:04:04,767 --> 02:04:07,754
they can never know
how close we really are.

1848
02:04:09,301 --> 02:04:12,458
They can't know
I'm trying to help you.

1849
02:04:14,601 --> 02:04:16,648
If they knew it was me
that took the money,

1850
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,368
I wouldn't be here
talking to you now.

1851
02:04:21,634 --> 02:04:24,591
Please, don't disappear, Tom.

1852
02:04:30,568 --> 02:04:33,285
I need you.

1853
02:04:35,667 --> 02:04:37,665
<i>I'll break this one
with some thinking.</i>

1854
02:04:48,833 --> 02:04:50,851
<i>It was not Grace's pride</i>

1855
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:53,747
<i>that kept her going
during the days when fall came</i>

1856
02:04:54,167 --> 02:04:56,165
<i>and the trees
were losing their leaves,</i>

1857
02:04:56,501 --> 02:04:58,928
<i>but more of the trancelike state
that descends</i>

1858
02:04:59,334 --> 02:05:01,582
<i>on animals
whose lives are threatened,</i>

1859
02:05:01,967 --> 02:05:04,455
<i>a state in which the body
reacts mechanically,</i>

1860
02:05:04,867 --> 02:05:08,963
<i>in a low, tough gear,
without too much painful reflection,</i>

1861
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:13,786
<i>like a patient passively
letting his disease hold sway.</i>

1862
02:05:14,434 --> 02:05:17,561
<i>And now that Vera
had received proof</i>

1863
02:05:18,067 --> 02:05:20,065
<i>that it was in fact Chuck</i>

1864
02:05:20,234 --> 02:05:24,420
<i>who'd forced his attentions on Grace,
she was meaner than ever.</i>

1865
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:30,368
<i>Had Grace had friends in Dogville,</i>

1866
02:05:30,733 --> 02:05:33,600
<i>they too fell like the leaves.</i>

1867
02:05:35,367 --> 02:05:37,445
<i>Most townspeople of the male sex</i>

1868
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:39,798
<i>now visited Grace at night</i>

1869
02:05:39,934 --> 02:05:42,012
<i>to fulfill their sexual needs.</i>

1870
02:05:43,867 --> 02:05:46,325
<i>It had occurred to the children
to give the bell an extra ring</i>

1871
02:05:46,733 --> 02:05:49,720
<i>every time such an act
had been consummated...</i>

1872
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:52,717
<i>much to Martha's confusion.</i>

1873
02:05:54,301 --> 02:05:56,469
<i>But since the chain
had been attached,</i>

1874
02:05:56,833 --> 02:05:59,461
<i>things had become easier
for everyone.</i>

1875
02:06:00,867 --> 02:06:04,374
<i>The harassments in bed did not have
to be kept so secret anymore,</i>

1876
02:06:04,934 --> 02:06:07,771
<i>because they couldn't really
be compared to a sexual act.</i>

1877
02:06:08,234 --> 02:06:10,661
<i>They were embarrassing,
in the way it is</i>

1878
02:06:11,067 --> 02:06:13,065
<i>when a hillbilly has his way
with a cow,</i>

1879
02:06:13,334 --> 02:06:15,332
<i>but no more than that.</i>

1880
02:06:16,567 --> 02:06:19,584
<i>Tom saw everything. It pained him.</i>

1881
02:06:20,067 --> 02:06:23,344
<i>And the sexual visits
were a particularly severe blow.</i>

1882
02:06:23,867 --> 02:06:25,865
Good night.

1883
02:06:30,633 --> 02:06:33,670
<i>But he supported her
as best he could,</i>

1884
02:06:34,167 --> 02:06:36,165
<i>the way a spider supports</i>

1885
02:06:36,367 --> 02:06:39,963
<i>when it has been tangled
in its own web by the wind.</i>

1886
02:06:40,533 --> 02:06:43,051
<i>Tom.</i>

1887
02:06:48,867 --> 02:06:51,385
Everything I tried to do
went wrong.

1888
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:55,867
I can't come up with the answer
I was looking for.

1889
02:06:56,367 --> 02:06:58,794
You'll come up with it, you'll see.

1890
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:01,657
You're very clever.

1891
02:07:03,034 --> 02:07:05,032
I provoked them.

1892
02:07:05,367 --> 02:07:07,554
I wouldn't worry about it.

1893
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:16,197
We provoked them, now it's time
for us to provoke ourselves.

1894
02:07:16,733 --> 02:07:18,731
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

1895
02:07:20,434 --> 02:07:23,910
by showing them some trust.
It all started with a meeting,

1896
02:07:24,466 --> 02:07:27,304
so it would be logical
to end it with one too.

1897
02:07:27,767 --> 02:07:31,244
You'll talk, they'll listen.
They can't refuse to listen.

1898
02:07:33,267 --> 02:07:37,363
- What will I say?
- Everything, you'll say everything.

1899
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,998
<i>- Everything?</i>
- Yeah, the truth, the truth,

1900
02:07:40,334 --> 02:07:43,111
just the truth
about each and every one of them.

1901
02:07:43,567 --> 02:07:45,565
I don't think
they're gonna want to hear that.

1902
02:07:45,767 --> 02:07:48,724
No, I know, I know.
It's like a child...

1903
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:51,777
who doesn't want
to take his medicine.

1904
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:55,736
They'll be furious at first,
but in the end, they'll see that it's...

1905
02:07:56,301 --> 02:07:58,299
it's for their own good.

1906
02:07:58,567 --> 02:08:00,565
Just don't be hateful.

1907
02:08:00,667 --> 02:08:03,065
Don't be reproving.

1908
02:08:03,466 --> 02:08:06,743
If anybody can do it,
Grace, you can.

1909
02:08:07,267 --> 02:08:11,652
They'll all realize that this web
of misunderstanding and injustice

1910
02:08:12,334 --> 02:08:14,581
has only one true victim
and that's you.

1911
02:08:14,967 --> 02:08:18,364
And from there it's only
one small step to forgiveness.

1912
02:08:19,867 --> 02:08:24,173
You've done some hard thinking,
Tom Edison.

1913
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:28,887
I'm sure it's an excellent plan.

1914
02:08:29,367 --> 02:08:31,414
I'm sure.

1915
02:08:49,833 --> 02:08:52,700
<i>If forgiveness
was close at hand in the mission house,</i>

1916
02:08:53,167 --> 02:08:56,064
<i>they were all hiding it well.</i>

1917
02:08:56,533 --> 02:08:59,400
<i>It hadn't been easy for Tom
to get them there.</i>

1918
02:08:59,867 --> 02:09:01,915
<i>Appealing to consciences</i>

1919
02:09:02,267 --> 02:09:05,663
<i>stowed farther and farther away
by their owners every day,</i>

1920
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:09,676
<i>as if they were as fragile
as Henson's glasses after polishing,</i>

1921
02:09:10,234 --> 02:09:12,232
<i>had proved quite a task.</i>

1922
02:09:13,567 --> 02:09:16,904
<i>But if one was going, the others
might as well come along too...</i>

1923
02:09:17,433 --> 02:09:19,651
<i>so nobody could talk
behind anybody's back.</i>

1924
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:25,308
<i>Tom had set the scene
for Grace's speech.</i>

1925
02:09:25,767 --> 02:09:28,864
<i>Now, she'd have to sink or swim</i>

1926
02:09:29,366 --> 02:09:32,234
<i>and sincerity be brought to bear.</i>

1927
02:09:32,700 --> 02:09:34,698
<i>While Grace addressed</i>

1928
02:09:34,967 --> 02:09:37,744
<i>the silent congregation
in the mission house on Elm Street,</i>

1929
02:09:38,200 --> 02:09:42,096
<i>the first of the early autumn
snowstorms embraced the town.</i>

1930
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:45,977
<i>The snowflakes dusted down
over the old buildings</i>

1931
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:49,158
<i>as if this were just any old town.</i>

1932
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:51,598
<i>And they played
in the branches and twigs,</i>

1933
02:09:51,934 --> 02:09:53,932
<i>from which the apples had hung.</i>

1934
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,998
<i>But luckily the harvest was home</i>

1935
02:09:56,267 --> 02:09:58,574
<i>and, via the freight industry,
had found a market</i>

1936
02:09:58,967 --> 02:10:01,304
<i>despite the ever-disappointing prices.</i>

1937
02:10:01,700 --> 02:10:04,567
<i>Grace had presented
her story with clarity.</i>

1938
02:10:05,034 --> 02:10:07,721
<i>She had not embellished
or understated.</i>

1939
02:10:08,167 --> 02:10:12,732
<i>And just as she finished, the snowflakes
all at once stopped tumbling down,</i>

1940
02:10:13,433 --> 02:10:16,800
<i>leaving Dogville
clad in the daintiest,</i>

1941
02:10:17,333 --> 02:10:20,231
<i>whitest blanket of snow
imaginable.</i>

1942
02:10:27,466 --> 02:10:29,464
Hmph.

1943
02:10:40,333 --> 02:10:42,381
I don't think it went very well.

1944
02:10:42,733 --> 02:10:45,800
It's fine. You did good.

1945
02:10:53,167 --> 02:10:57,083
<i>The snow had
come early, perhaps too early...</i>

1946
02:10:57,700 --> 02:11:01,067
<i>a misplaced augury
of conciliation?</i>

1947
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:04,908
<i>Tom looked around, worried.</i>

1948
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:08,897
<i>Vera's teeth were clenched.
She was the first to speak.</i>

1949
02:11:09,466 --> 02:11:11,804
Copious lies, just lies.

1950
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:14,807
Yes, Tom, that didn't
accord with the perception

1951
02:11:15,233 --> 02:11:17,231
that I have of this town
and its residents.

1952
02:11:17,567 --> 02:11:20,994
I'm a doctor, damn it. I'm capable
of determining if I'm sick or not.

1953
02:11:21,533 --> 02:11:23,531
What do you have to say
for yourself, Tom?

1954
02:11:23,600 --> 02:11:25,998
Maybe it's time you picked sides.

1955
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:28,508
Are you for us or against us?

1956
02:11:28,867 --> 02:11:31,674
Liz is right, we've been
far too indulgent with Tom.

1957
02:11:32,134 --> 02:11:35,470
<i>Tom, I got to tell you,
even I have trouble defending that girl.</i>

1958
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:40,415
With your help, which I prefer
to think was accidental, Tom,

1959
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:44,876
she's been managed
to spread bitterness

1960
02:11:45,466 --> 02:11:48,943
and trouble throughout
this whole town. She has to go!

1961
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:51,198
<i>How do we get rid of her, Tom?</i>

1962
02:11:51,199 --> 02:11:53,337
<i>- How do we do it, Tom?
- I agree, Tom.</i>

1963
02:11:53,700 --> 02:11:56,357
You brought her in here, you have
to figure out how to get her out.

1964
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:58,798
Without her lies
and accusations spreading.

1965
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:04,398
I asked you here to listen.

1966
02:12:07,533 --> 02:12:09,991
You only came
to defend yourselves.

1967
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:14,556
I'm sorry. It's quite a blow to me,

1968
02:12:15,199 --> 02:12:19,295
to see all of my friends
act this way...

1969
02:12:22,166 --> 02:12:24,274
so uncivilized.

1970
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:21,417
Your plan didn't work out
very well, did it?

1971
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:27,136
- You'll think of another one.
- No.

1972
02:13:27,733 --> 02:13:30,890
No more plans, I promise.

1973
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:39,587
They asked me to choose
between you and them.

1974
02:13:41,867 --> 02:13:45,673
That's not difficult
on a day like today, I love you.

1975
02:13:46,266 --> 02:13:50,272
You may be stronger,
it's true, with the ideals,

1976
02:13:50,900 --> 02:13:52,898
the ideals we share.

1977
02:13:54,233 --> 02:13:56,661
I'm exhausted.

1978
02:13:58,600 --> 02:14:00,738
Lie down.

1979
02:14:07,199 --> 02:14:09,337
I've chosen, Grace,

1980
02:14:10,967 --> 02:14:13,334
I've chosen you.

1981
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:19,848
And now it's the time,

1982
02:14:20,266 --> 02:14:23,103
the time we've been waiting for.

1983
02:14:27,166 --> 02:14:30,033
We've freed ourselves of Dogville.

1984
02:14:36,033 --> 02:14:38,661
You're right.

1985
02:14:39,099 --> 02:14:42,846
You're right, Tom, it would be
so easy to make love right now.

1986
02:14:44,967 --> 02:14:47,424
They may kill us any minute,

1987
02:14:47,833 --> 02:14:50,490
it would be the perfect
romantic ending...

1988
02:14:50,934 --> 02:14:52,932
You know I feel it too.

1989
02:14:57,500 --> 02:15:00,367
It would be so beautiful,
but from...

1990
02:15:00,833 --> 02:15:05,048
from the point of view of our love,
so completely wrong.

1991
02:15:10,300 --> 02:15:12,668
We were to meet in freedom.

1992
02:15:25,867 --> 02:15:28,174
You're cold now, Grace.

1993
02:15:38,066 --> 02:15:42,132
I just rejected everybody
I've ever known in your favor.

1994
02:15:44,466 --> 02:15:47,303
Wouldn't it be worth compromising
just one of your ideals

1995
02:15:47,767 --> 02:15:50,344
just a little to ease my pain?

1996
02:15:53,533 --> 02:15:56,370
<i>Everybody in this town
has had your body but me.</i>

1997
02:15:57,900 --> 02:16:00,387
We're the ones
supposed to be in love.

1998
02:16:03,133 --> 02:16:05,131
<i>My darting Tom.</i>

1999
02:16:09,233 --> 02:16:11,721
You can have me if you want me.

2000
02:16:15,433 --> 02:16:17,431
Just do what the others do.

2001
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:21,147
Threaten me.

2002
02:16:21,533 --> 02:16:24,690
<i>Tell me that you'll turn me in
to the law, to the gangsters,</i>

2003
02:16:25,199 --> 02:16:27,687
and I promise you,

2004
02:16:28,099 --> 02:16:31,526
you can take
whatever it is you want from me.

2005
02:16:33,633 --> 02:16:35,851
I trust you.

2006
02:16:38,033 --> 02:16:40,781
But maybe you don't trust yourself.

2007
02:16:41,233 --> 02:16:44,660
Perhaps you've been tempted.

2008
02:16:45,199 --> 02:16:48,266
You've been tempted
to join the others and force me?

2009
02:16:48,767 --> 02:16:51,864
Perhaps that's why you're so upset.

2010
02:16:52,366 --> 02:16:54,444
All I've ever tried to do is help you.

2011
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:59,625
I'm just asking if you're afraid
you could be so human.

2012
02:17:00,366 --> 02:17:02,584
No, I'm not afraid of that,
not in the least.

2013
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:06,398
Good.

2014
02:17:09,800 --> 02:17:13,306
Let tomorrow bring
what it's gonna bring.

2015
02:17:16,166 --> 02:17:18,164
It's not a crime

2016
02:17:18,466 --> 02:17:21,093
to doubt yourself, Tom.

2017
02:17:23,966 --> 02:17:27,063
But it's wonderful that you don't.

2018
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:30,907
I can't find the rest.

2019
02:17:34,133 --> 02:17:36,621
I think I should go out
for a couple of minutes.

2020
02:17:38,933 --> 02:17:41,771
Take a walk
or something to get it...

2021
02:17:43,933 --> 02:17:46,421
get it all out of my system.

2022
02:17:48,366 --> 02:17:50,444
Trudge the streets,

2023
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:52,967
listen to the wind as it passes

2024
02:17:53,333 --> 02:17:55,960
through the woods
up through the valley

2025
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:58,648
and all that.

2026
02:18:02,066 --> 02:18:04,064
You go to sleep though.

2027
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:09,578
You go to sleep

2028
02:18:09,933 --> 02:18:12,421
and I'll be back

2029
02:18:12,832 --> 02:18:14,940
very soon.

2030
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:24,817
<i>Of course,
it was all a load of nonsense.</i>

2031
02:18:25,233 --> 02:18:29,589
<i>If anybody was capable of keeping
track of ideals and reality, he was.</i>

2032
02:18:30,266 --> 02:18:33,043
<i>After all, it was his job.</i>

2033
02:18:33,500 --> 02:18:36,307
<i>Moral issues were his home ground.</i>

2034
02:18:36,767 --> 02:18:39,803
<i>To think that he might
doubt his own purity</i>

2035
02:18:40,300 --> 02:18:42,378
<i>was really to think
very little of him.</i>

2036
02:18:42,733 --> 02:18:45,360
<i>Tom was angry.</i>

2037
02:18:48,099 --> 02:18:51,116
<i>And in the midst of it all,
he discovered why.</i>

2038
02:18:52,633 --> 02:18:55,150
<i>It was not because
he'd been wrongly accused,</i>

2039
02:18:55,567 --> 02:18:58,114
<i>but because the charges were true.</i>

2040
02:18:59,899 --> 02:19:03,056
<i>His anger consisted
of a most unpleasant feeling</i>

2041
02:19:03,567 --> 02:19:05,844
<i>of being found out.</i>

2042
02:19:08,533 --> 02:19:11,310
<i>It was all quite a blow
to the young philosopher.</i>

2043
02:19:11,766 --> 02:19:13,844
<i>And realistically enough,</i>

2044
02:19:14,199 --> 02:19:16,367
<i>he thought that if the doubt
was already present,</i>

2045
02:19:16,733 --> 02:19:19,600
<i>it could grow perhaps so great</i>

2046
02:19:20,066 --> 02:19:24,312
<i>that one day it would prove detrimental
to his entire moral mission.</i>

2047
02:19:24,966 --> 02:19:27,214
<i>Tom stopped.</i>

2048
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:29,817
<i>He almost began to shake
when the threat</i>

2049
02:19:30,199 --> 02:19:32,687
<i>to his career as a writer
dawned upon him.</i>

2050
02:19:33,099 --> 02:19:35,617
<i>It didn't take him long
to agree with himself</i>

2051
02:19:36,033 --> 02:19:38,311
<i>that the risk was
too great to run.</i>

2052
02:19:38,700 --> 02:19:41,067
<i>The danger Grace was to the town,</i>

2053
02:19:41,466 --> 02:19:43,464
<i>she was also to him.</i>

2054
02:19:43,766 --> 02:19:45,764
<i>Tom did not like it</i>

2055
02:19:45,766 --> 02:19:49,633
<i>and he was man enough
to take action to prevent it.</i>

2056
02:19:52,133 --> 02:19:56,549
<i>Fortunately, Tom was as conscientious
as regards his future profession</i>

2057
02:19:57,233 --> 02:19:59,231
<i>as he was practical.</i>

2058
02:19:59,233 --> 02:20:02,889
<i>He allowed sincerity and ideals
plenty of room in his life</i>

2059
02:20:03,466 --> 02:20:07,122
<i>without getting sentimental
about it, as he would put it.</i>

2060
02:20:07,699 --> 02:20:11,176
<i>Throwing away a document
that might be of significance to Tom,</i>

2061
02:20:11,732 --> 02:20:13,840
<i>and with him
future generations of readers,</i>

2062
02:20:14,199 --> 02:20:16,976
<i>as a basis of a novel
or indeed a trilogy</i>

2063
02:20:17,433 --> 02:20:20,180
<i>was not an act
he was so stupid to commit.</i>

2064
02:20:20,633 --> 02:20:23,560
<i>Although he had to admit
that in a moment of weakness</i>

2065
02:20:24,033 --> 02:20:26,051
<i>he might have said he would.</i>

2066
02:20:29,300 --> 02:20:31,667
<i>Before returning
to the meeting that night,</i>

2067
02:20:32,066 --> 02:20:35,782
<i>Tom opened the little drawer he had
opened the night of Grace's arrival</i>

2068
02:20:36,366 --> 02:20:38,703
<i>and found it still there...</i>

2069
02:20:39,099 --> 02:20:41,846
<i>the card from the gangster
in the car.</i>

2070
02:21:02,966 --> 02:21:06,423
<i>The next day, the sun was
shining in the brisk autumn sky</i>

2071
02:21:06,966 --> 02:21:09,154
<i>and the snow was long since gone.</i>

2072
02:21:11,166 --> 02:21:13,164
<i>For the first time for ages</i>

2073
02:21:13,366 --> 02:21:15,673
<i>the pile driver could be heard
in the marshlands</i>

2074
02:21:16,066 --> 02:21:18,064
<i>as it hammered in the piles</i>

2075
02:21:18,166 --> 02:21:21,672
<i>of what might
or might not be a penitentiary.</i>

2076
02:21:22,233 --> 02:21:24,231
<i>Grace opened her eyes,</i>

2077
02:21:24,567 --> 02:21:27,873
<i>after an almost unconscious sleep
and was confused...</i>

2078
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:31,297
<i>Judging by the light coming
through the cracks in the walls</i>

2079
02:21:31,766 --> 02:21:34,953
<i>it had to be nearly midday,
"the gray hour"</i>

2080
02:21:35,466 --> 02:21:38,802
<i>as Jack McKay, for some reason,
called noon in Dogville...</i>

2081
02:21:39,333 --> 02:21:41,990
<i>being a man of many ideas
and proclivities,</i>

2082
02:21:42,433 --> 02:21:46,149
<i>quite a few of which Grace would have
preferred to remain ignorant of.</i>

2083
02:21:46,732 --> 02:21:49,420
<i>But why had nobody roused her?</i>

2084
02:21:49,866 --> 02:21:52,354
<i>Nobody had hammered
furiously at her door,</i>

2085
02:21:52,766 --> 02:21:55,104
<i>not a child had thrown
mud into her bed</i>

2086
02:21:55,500 --> 02:21:57,957
<i>or broken
her remaining windowpanes.</i>

2087
02:21:58,366 --> 02:22:00,643
<i>Now she remembered.</i>

2088
02:22:01,033 --> 02:22:03,521
<i>She recalled
the meeting the previous day</i>

2089
02:22:03,933 --> 02:22:06,041
<i>and puzzled still more.</i>

2090
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:09,497
<i>Why had she not been confronted
with the outcome of that meeting</i>

2091
02:22:09,999 --> 02:22:11,997
<i>or even killed?</i>

2092
02:22:12,300 --> 02:22:14,298
<i>It was quite unlike Dogville</i>

2093
02:22:14,500 --> 02:22:17,277
<i>to restrain its indignation
on any point.</i>

2094
02:22:17,732 --> 02:22:20,250
<i>Perhaps things had
turned out well after all.</i>

2095
02:22:20,666 --> 02:22:24,063
- Good morning, Mrs. Henson,
- Morning.

2096
02:22:24,599 --> 02:22:27,207
I would have come earlier, but I...

2097
02:22:27,632 --> 02:22:29,399
<i>I overslept.</i>

2098
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:32,327
Never mind, Liz put
her back into it this morning.

2099
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:36,837
We thought some time off
would be good for you.

2100
02:22:40,599 --> 02:22:42,597
That was quite a speech
you made yesterday.

2101
02:22:42,699 --> 02:22:44,867
Gave us all something
to think about.

2102
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:52,047
- Hello, Liz.
- Hi, Grace.

2103
02:22:53,866 --> 02:22:55,864
Hi.

2104
02:22:59,799 --> 02:23:01,797
I overslept.

2105
02:23:02,599 --> 02:23:04,597
Morning, Miss Grace.

2106
02:23:05,532 --> 02:23:07,530
- Good morning.
- How you this morning?

2107
02:23:09,099 --> 02:23:11,906
- I overslept.
- That's all right.

2108
02:23:19,732 --> 02:23:21,598
It's Grace.

2109
02:23:21,599 --> 02:23:23,677
Hello, Grace.

2110
02:23:24,033 --> 02:23:26,031
Two seconds.

2111
02:23:26,133 --> 02:23:28,131
Good news.

2112
02:23:36,732 --> 02:23:38,730
I went back
to the meeting last night.

2113
02:23:40,699 --> 02:23:43,037
I wasn't gonna let them
get <i>off</i> so easy, but...

2114
02:23:45,799 --> 02:23:47,797
I'll be damned if the mood
hadn't changed.

2115
02:23:49,899 --> 02:23:51,897
I wouldn't say we won exactly,
not exactly,

2116
02:23:52,133 --> 02:23:54,470
but I think something very good
could come out of this...

2117
02:23:54,866 --> 02:23:58,902
- Why didn't you come back and tell me?
- No, I did, I did, but you were asleep.

2118
02:24:00,499 --> 02:24:02,497
And you looked like you needed it.

2119
02:24:03,666 --> 02:24:06,324
That made me suggest that maybe
you should have some time off.

2120
02:24:06,766 --> 02:24:08,814
And you know,

2121
02:24:09,166 --> 02:24:11,164
not one single person objected.

2122
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:19,207
- That sounds wonderful.
- I know it does, doesn't it?

2123
02:24:20,866 --> 02:24:23,613
The people in this town,
they surprise me again and again.

2124
02:24:25,732 --> 02:24:28,420
I might even have to revise
my theories a little bit.

2125
02:24:28,866 --> 02:24:31,054
You know how much I hate
doing that kind of thing.

2126
02:24:33,899 --> 02:24:37,116
You know, Grace, last night
when I came back

2127
02:24:37,632 --> 02:24:39,650
and I saw you

2128
02:24:39,999 --> 02:24:42,367
lying there asleep so sweetly,

2129
02:24:42,766 --> 02:24:44,764
I was suddenly inspired.

2130
02:24:45,099 --> 02:24:48,136
I wrote the first chapter of a story...

2131
02:24:48,632 --> 02:24:50,880
a story about a small town.

2132
02:24:51,266 --> 02:24:53,374
Guess where I got the inspiration?

2133
02:24:53,732 --> 02:24:56,419
<i>But I haven't come up with a name
for the town yet.</i>

2134
02:24:58,300 --> 02:25:00,298
Why not just call it Dogville?

2135
02:25:00,333 --> 02:25:03,669
It wouldn't work, wouldn't work,
it's got to be universal.

2136
02:25:04,199 --> 02:25:06,337
A lot of writers
make that mistake, you see.

2137
02:25:06,699 --> 02:25:09,596
<i>Hey, you want me to read it to you?-</i>...

2138
02:25:10,066 --> 02:25:12,084
if there's any love in it,
it comes from you.

2139
02:25:12,432 --> 02:25:14,430
Would you be offended
if I said no?

2140
02:25:16,499 --> 02:25:20,156
- No.
- If I really have the day to myself...

2141
02:25:20,732 --> 02:25:23,130
No, no.

2142
02:25:24,632 --> 02:25:26,630
Two people will
only hurt each other

2143
02:25:26,699 --> 02:25:29,067
if they doubt the love
they have in one another.

2144
02:25:31,133 --> 02:25:33,131
You can read it some other time.

2145
02:25:34,699 --> 02:25:36,299
You sit down some place,

2146
02:25:36,300 --> 02:25:38,377
gaze out at the mountains.

2147
02:25:38,732 --> 02:25:40,870
It's what
the girl in my novel does.

2148
02:25:44,099 --> 02:25:45,865
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

2149
02:25:45,866 --> 02:25:47,864
I'll see you. Good news.

2150
02:25:53,699 --> 02:25:56,356
<i>Sensibly,
Grace chose to hope for the best,</i>

2151
02:25:56,799 --> 02:25:58,797
<i>rather than fear the worst,</i>

2152
02:25:58,832 --> 02:26:00,498
<i>and planned to spend the day</i>

2153
02:26:00,499 --> 02:26:02,577
<i>calmly washing her clothes
and herself...</i>

2154
02:26:02,933 --> 02:26:06,030
<i>which for some reason or another
she was sure none of the characters</i>

2155
02:26:06,532 --> 02:26:09,809
<i>from Tom's fictitious township
would dream of doing.</i>

2156
02:26:14,099 --> 02:26:17,935
<i>And then it was
as if Dogville just waited.</i>

2157
02:26:18,532 --> 02:26:20,960
<i>Even the wind dropped,</i>

2158
02:26:21,365 --> 02:26:24,173
<i>leaving the town
in an unfamiliar calm,</i>

2159
02:26:24,632 --> 02:26:29,018
<i>as if somebody had put
a large cheese-dish cover over it</i>

2160
02:26:29,699 --> 02:26:32,506
<i>and created the kind of quietness</i>

2161
02:26:32,966 --> 02:26:36,332
<i>that descends
while you're awaiting visitors.</i>

2162
02:26:36,866 --> 02:26:40,552
<i>After two days off
Grace had been put back to work,</i>

2163
02:26:41,133 --> 02:26:44,439
<i>but the quietness remained.</i>

2164
02:26:44,966 --> 02:26:47,543
<i>Indeed, it intensified.</i>

2165
02:26:47,966 --> 02:26:50,154
<i>Until on the fifth day...</i>

2166
02:26:50,532 --> 02:26:53,549
<i>it swelled into a strange mood</i>

2167
02:26:54,033 --> 02:26:57,779
<i>that all of a sudden brought all
the citizens to the street to listen.</i>

2168
02:27:00,632 --> 02:27:04,259
<i>They asked each other
if the phone was really still down,</i>

2169
02:27:04,832 --> 02:27:07,929
<i>or if they'd heard about Ben
having had to turn his truck around</i>

2170
02:27:08,432 --> 02:27:10,430
<i>on his way to Georgetown
that very morning</i>

2171
02:27:10,599 --> 02:27:13,556
<i>on account of a large tree
blocking the road.</i>

2172
02:27:14,033 --> 02:27:16,430
<i>They were not worried.</i>

2173
02:27:16,832 --> 02:27:18,910
<i>Worried was not the right word.</i>

2174
02:27:20,233 --> 02:27:22,720
<i>And then Tom spotted the cars.</i>

2175
02:27:23,133 --> 02:27:24,798
- How many cars?
- Eight, eight.

2176
02:27:24,799 --> 02:27:27,137
Tom has binoculars
but you can see them with the naked eye.

2177
02:27:27,532 --> 02:27:29,990
- There must be at least eight.
- I thought the road was blocked.

2178
02:27:30,399 --> 02:27:32,477
They must have come through
before the tree came down.

2179
02:27:35,799 --> 02:27:39,016
June's bed! The sheets need changing.
I'll be there in a minute.

2180
02:27:39,532 --> 02:27:42,220
Hello, June.

2181
02:27:44,066 --> 02:27:47,492
<i>Grace had just started on
the bed which June had soiled yet again,</i>

2182
02:27:48,033 --> 02:27:52,278
<i>when an irritating feeling of wasting
her time forced itself upon her.</i>

2183
02:27:54,432 --> 02:27:57,499
<i>And it was without thinking
she then said the words...</i>

2184
02:27:57,999 --> 02:28:00,306
Nobody gonna sleep here.

2185
02:28:05,033 --> 02:28:07,031
<i>She didn't say them out loud</i>

2186
02:28:07,265 --> 02:28:10,302
<i>but even so,
was startled by the utterance</i>

2187
02:28:10,799 --> 02:28:12,907
<i>that had urged itself upon her.</i>

2188
02:28:14,866 --> 02:28:17,583
<i>Where had these
ominous words come from?</i>

2189
02:28:27,299 --> 02:28:31,545
<i>Darkness was falling as Grace made
her way home from work that evening.</i>

2190
02:28:32,198 --> 02:28:34,826
<i>The people on the square
overlooking the valley</i>

2191
02:28:35,265 --> 02:28:39,391
<i>had finally given up hope of seeing
anything else now the light had faded.</i>

2192
02:28:40,033 --> 02:28:43,050
<i>They trudged up Elm Street
in disappointment.</i>

2193
02:28:48,198 --> 02:28:50,032
- Tom.
- Hi, Grace.

2194
02:28:50,033 --> 02:28:52,051
There were some cars, but...

2195
02:28:52,399 --> 02:28:54,397
too dark, we can't see anymore.

2196
02:28:54,732 --> 02:28:57,799
We haven't seen
much of each other.

2197
02:28:58,299 --> 02:29:00,787
Yeah, I know. I've been busy
with my book, you know.

2198
02:29:01,198 --> 02:29:03,336
<i>Can I ask you something?</i>

2199
02:29:03,699 --> 02:29:05,717
<i>Yeah, anything.</i>

2200
02:29:09,033 --> 02:29:11,430
You couldn't bring yourself
to throw it away, could you?

2201
02:29:13,899 --> 02:29:16,476
<i>The number he gave you that night,
you couldn't throw it away.</i>

2202
02:29:16,899 --> 02:29:20,325
I told you how dangerous
that man was.

2203
02:29:20,866 --> 02:29:22,864
That was stupid.

2204
02:29:28,632 --> 02:29:30,740
<i>Stupid or not, Tom was soon</i>

2205
02:29:31,099 --> 02:29:34,195
<i>a passionate spokesman for
locking Grace in her shed that night.</i>

2206
02:29:36,699 --> 02:29:39,186
<i>If the vehicles were indeed
a sign that the call</i>

2207
02:29:39,599 --> 02:29:42,526
<i>Tom had placed five days earlier
on behalf of the community</i>

2208
02:29:42,999 --> 02:29:45,746
<i>to the number indicated
on the card from his bureau drawer</i>

2209
02:29:46,198 --> 02:29:48,196
<i>had at last led to action</i>

2210
02:29:48,432 --> 02:29:51,119
<i>and Grace was now
to be eliminated from their lives,</i>

2211
02:29:51,566 --> 02:29:55,132
<i>it would surely look good
if the town had also locked her up.</i>

2212
02:29:57,766 --> 02:30:01,192
<i>Grace was lying on the bed
when Jason was sent up with the key.</i>

2213
02:30:01,732 --> 02:30:03,980
<i>Grace heard it turn in the lock,</i>

2214
02:30:04,365 --> 02:30:07,522
<i>but she was deeply absorbed
by arguments and thoughts</i>

2215
02:30:08,033 --> 02:30:12,218
<i>on matters she had otherwise avoided
for the best part of a year now.</i>

2216
02:30:20,633 --> 02:30:27,967
CHAPTER NINE in which Dogville receives
the long-awaited visit and the film ends.

2217
02:30:31,632 --> 02:30:34,349
<i>From the moment when they'd finally
heard the sound of vehicles</i>

2218
02:30:34,799 --> 02:30:37,756
<i>starting one after the other from
the direction of the edge of the woods,</i>

2219
02:30:38,232 --> 02:30:40,340
<i>things had moved rapidly.</i>

2220
02:30:40,699 --> 02:30:44,645
<i>Tom had arranged a delegation
to provide a proper reception.</i>

2221
02:30:45,265 --> 02:30:50,360
<i>Dogville might be off the beaten track,
but it was hospitable, nonetheless.</i>

2222
02:31:04,132 --> 02:31:06,097
Welcome, gentlemen, welcome.

2223
02:31:06,098 --> 02:31:08,316
The town places itself
at your disposal.

2224
02:31:08,699 --> 02:31:11,716
I should have a large key to give you,
but I only have this small one.

2225
02:31:12,198 --> 02:31:14,196
- Where is she?
- Secured by this very key.

2226
02:31:14,365 --> 02:31:15,932
Where is she?

2227
02:31:15,933 --> 02:31:19,269
Okay... if you're wondering
about that sound,

2228
02:31:19,799 --> 02:31:22,516
they're driving piles
for the new penitentiary.

2229
02:31:22,966 --> 02:31:25,713
Tell me, has the crime rate
really gone up in this country

2230
02:31:26,165 --> 02:31:28,163
as we're led to believe?

2231
02:31:28,198 --> 02:31:31,265
Maybe people just regard
things as criminal because,

2232
02:31:31,766 --> 02:31:34,223
because they envy their success.

2233
02:31:34,632 --> 02:31:37,319
What's your opinion
on the subject?

2234
02:31:38,766 --> 02:31:41,423
Maybe you have none.
I'll get the door.

2235
02:31:41,866 --> 02:31:43,974
<i>-</i> Sorry.

2236
02:31:46,165 --> 02:31:48,243
Voila, as the French might say.

2237
02:31:48,599 --> 02:31:51,026
What the hell is this?

2238
02:31:51,432 --> 02:31:52,531
Who did that?

2239
02:31:52,532 --> 02:31:55,399
Billy, put your hand up!
Put your hand up!

2240
02:31:55,866 --> 02:31:57,798
Who's Billy? Come on,
just get your tools.

2241
02:31:57,799 --> 02:31:59,907
- It's okay.
- It's gonna be all right.

2242
02:32:04,499 --> 02:32:06,497
We felt safer
when she had the chain on.

2243
02:32:06,699 --> 02:32:09,686
You're probably more adept
at handling her kind.

2244
02:32:11,399 --> 02:32:13,976
None of us feel able

2245
02:32:14,399 --> 02:32:16,397
to accept money
for just helping people.

2246
02:32:16,699 --> 02:32:21,054
I mean, unless it would make you feel
better to divest yourself...

2247
02:32:21,732 --> 02:32:23,730
- Shut the hell up!
- Absolutely.

2248
02:32:28,699 --> 02:32:31,916
<i>Grace was no expert
in exclusive automobiles,</i>

2249
02:32:32,432 --> 02:32:34,890
<i>yet she recognized
with no difficulty</i>

2250
02:32:35,299 --> 02:32:37,697
<i>the sound of the vehicle
that was rounding the corner</i>

2251
02:32:38,098 --> 02:32:40,376
<i>from Canyon Road
at that very moment.</i>

2252
02:32:41,766 --> 02:32:43,764
<i>Alas, in Grace's memory</i>

2253
02:32:43,998 --> 02:32:47,655
<i>the legendary purr
of the Cadillac series 355 C</i>

2254
02:32:48,232 --> 02:32:52,828
<i>was inextricably linked with another
rather less sophisticated sound...</i>

2255
02:32:53,532 --> 02:32:56,719
<i>that of gunfire
directed against her person.</i>

2256
02:33:21,232 --> 02:33:23,230
Don't!

2257
02:33:46,965 --> 02:33:50,442
You need to justify your actions
before you shoot us?

2258
02:33:52,499 --> 02:33:54,497
That's new.

2259
02:33:58,465 --> 02:34:00,463
That could be interpreted
as weakness, Daddy.

2260
02:34:00,732 --> 02:34:03,099
<i>I'm disappointed in you.</i>

2261
02:34:03,499 --> 02:34:06,806
- I didn't come to shoot anybody.
<i>- You shot at me before.</i>

2262
02:34:07,332 --> 02:34:09,330
<i>Yes.</i>

2263
02:34:10,865 --> 02:34:13,173
<i>And so I regret that...</i>

2264
02:34:13,566 --> 02:34:15,564
<i>you ran away.</i>

2265
02:34:15,799 --> 02:34:19,695
But shooting at you
certainly didn't help matters.

2266
02:34:20,299 --> 02:34:22,547
Of course not,
you're far, far too stubborn.

2267
02:34:26,332 --> 02:34:28,500
If you don't want to kill me
then why did you come?

2268
02:34:28,865 --> 02:34:31,643
Our last conversation,
the one in which you told me what it was

2269
02:34:32,098 --> 02:34:36,074
you didn't like about me,
never really concluded, as you ran away.

2270
02:34:36,699 --> 02:34:39,885
I should be allowed to tell you
what I don't like about you.

2271
02:34:40,399 --> 02:34:45,194
That, I believe, would be a rule
of polite conversation, no?

2272
02:34:45,932 --> 02:34:47,930
That's why you showed up?

2273
02:34:51,332 --> 02:34:53,700
And you call <i>me</i> stubborn?

2274
02:34:54,098 --> 02:34:58,014
You're sure you're not here to force me
to go back and become like you?

2275
02:34:58,632 --> 02:35:00,849
If I thought there was
a chance of forcing you...

2276
02:35:01,232 --> 02:35:04,419
but of course,
that would never happen.

2277
02:35:04,932 --> 02:35:08,179
You're more... more than welcome

2278
02:35:08,699 --> 02:35:12,824
to return home,
become my daughter again anytime,

2279
02:35:13,465 --> 02:35:16,971
and I would even begin

2280
02:35:17,532 --> 02:35:22,747
<i>to share my power and responsibility
with you if you did.</i>

2281
02:35:23,532 --> 02:35:27,887
- Not that you care...
- So what is it?

2282
02:35:28,566 --> 02:35:31,373
What is it, the thing, the thing
that you don't like about me?

2283
02:35:31,831 --> 02:35:34,079
It was a word you used
that provoked me.

2284
02:35:34,465 --> 02:35:36,513
You called me arrogant.

2285
02:35:36,865 --> 02:35:40,052
To plunder, as it were, a God-given
right. I'd call that arrogant, Daddy.

2286
02:35:40,566 --> 02:35:43,752
But that is exactly
what I don't like about you.

2287
02:35:44,265 --> 02:35:47,422
- It's <i>you</i> that is arrogant.
- That's what you came here to say?

2288
02:35:51,632 --> 02:35:55,168
I'm not the one passing judgment, Daddy,
<i>you</i> are.

2289
02:35:55,732 --> 02:35:58,449
No, <i>you</i> do not pass judgment

2290
02:35:58,898 --> 02:36:02,525
because you sympathize with them.
A deprived childhood,

2291
02:36:03,098 --> 02:36:07,284
and a homicide really isn't
necessarily a homicide, right?

2292
02:36:07,932 --> 02:36:10,739
The only thing you can blame
is circumstances...

2293
02:36:11,198 --> 02:36:13,626
rapists and murderers

2294
02:36:14,032 --> 02:36:15,964
may be the victims,
according to you,

2295
02:36:15,965 --> 02:36:18,573
but I, I call them dogs.

2296
02:36:18,998 --> 02:36:20,996
And if they're lapping up
their own vomit,

2297
02:36:21,265 --> 02:36:23,263
the only way to stop them
is with the lash.

2298
02:36:23,465 --> 02:36:25,463
But dogs only obey
their own nature,

2299
02:36:25,731 --> 02:36:27,779
so why shouldn't we forgive them?

2300
02:36:28,132 --> 02:36:31,409
Dogs can be taught
many useful things,

2301
02:36:31,932 --> 02:36:35,848
but not if we forgive them
every time they obey their own nature.

2302
02:36:48,465 --> 02:36:50,463
So I'm arrogant?

2303
02:36:50,666 --> 02:36:53,033
I'm arrogant
because I forgive people.

2304
02:36:53,432 --> 02:36:55,430
My God,

2305
02:36:55,465 --> 02:36:58,422
can't you see how condescending
you are when you say that?

2306
02:36:59,865 --> 02:37:03,322
I mean you have...
you have this preconceived notion

2307
02:37:03,865 --> 02:37:07,781
that nobody, listen... that nobody
can possibly attain

2308
02:37:08,399 --> 02:37:12,205
the same high ethical standards as you,
so you exonerate them.

2309
02:37:12,798 --> 02:37:14,431
I cannot...

2310
02:37:14,432 --> 02:37:17,449
I cannot think of anything
more arrogant than that.

2311
02:37:17,932 --> 02:37:20,969
You, my child, my dear child,

2312
02:37:21,465 --> 02:37:23,603
you forgive others with excuses

2313
02:37:23,965 --> 02:37:26,333
that you would never in the world
permit for yourself.

2314
02:37:26,731 --> 02:37:29,309
Why shouldn't I be merciful? Why?

2315
02:37:29,731 --> 02:37:32,449
<i>No, no, no, you should,
you should be merciful</i>

2316
02:37:32,898 --> 02:37:35,086
<i>when there's time to be merciful.</i>

2317
02:37:35,465 --> 02:37:37,463
But, you must maintain
your own standards.

2318
02:37:37,765 --> 02:37:40,633
You owe them that,
you owe them that.

2319
02:37:41,098 --> 02:37:44,664
The penalty you deserve
for your transgression,

2320
02:37:45,232 --> 02:37:47,230
they deserve
for their transgressions.

2321
02:37:47,532 --> 02:37:49,809
- They're human beings, Dad.
- No, no, no, of course...

2322
02:37:50,198 --> 02:37:53,155
<i>but does every human being need to be
accountable for their actions?</i>

2323
02:37:53,631 --> 02:37:56,119
Of course they do, but you
don't even give them that chance.

2324
02:37:56,532 --> 02:37:58,869
And that is extremely arrogant.

2325
02:37:59,265 --> 02:38:02,332
I love you, I love you,
I love you to death,

2326
02:38:02,831 --> 02:38:06,228
but you are the most arrogant
person I have ever met.

2327
02:38:06,765 --> 02:38:09,223
And you call me arrogant.

2328
02:38:13,198 --> 02:38:15,196
I...

2329
02:38:15,399 --> 02:38:17,676
I have no more to say.

2330
02:38:19,731 --> 02:38:22,888
You're arrogant, I'm arrogant,
you've said it, now you can leave.

2331
02:38:23,399 --> 02:38:25,946
And without my daughter I suppose.

2332
02:38:32,731 --> 02:38:34,919
- I said without my daughter.
- Yes.

2333
02:38:36,665 --> 02:38:39,033
<i>- Well?</i>
- Yes!

2334
02:38:39,432 --> 02:38:41,480
You decide, you decide.

2335
02:38:44,798 --> 02:38:46,697
Grace, they...

2336
02:38:46,698 --> 02:38:48,776
they say you're having
some trouble here.

2337
02:38:50,332 --> 02:38:52,330
No.

2338
02:38:52,565 --> 02:38:54,673
No more trouble than back home.

2339
02:38:55,032 --> 02:38:57,340
I'm gonna give you a little time
to think about this,

2340
02:38:57,731 --> 02:39:00,598
<i>- perhaps you'll change your mind.</i>
- I won't.

2341
02:39:01,065 --> 02:39:03,063
<i>Listen, my love,</i>

2342
02:39:03,365 --> 02:39:05,582
<i>power is not so bad.</i>

2343
02:39:05,965 --> 02:39:08,982
I am sure that you can

2344
02:39:09,465 --> 02:39:12,092
find a way to make use of it
in your own fashion.

2345
02:39:15,265 --> 02:39:17,842
Take a walk and think about it.

2346
02:39:18,265 --> 02:39:20,263
The people who live here...

2347
02:39:22,132 --> 02:39:24,130
are doing their best

2348
02:39:24,332 --> 02:39:28,338
under very hard circumstances.

2349
02:39:28,965 --> 02:39:30,963
If you say so, Grace.

2350
02:39:33,332 --> 02:39:35,989
<i>But is their best...</i>

2351
02:39:38,365 --> 02:39:40,363
<i>really good enough?</i>

2352
02:39:41,798 --> 02:39:43,796
I do love you.

2353
02:39:53,831 --> 02:39:56,758
<i>Grace had already
thought for a long time.</i>

2354
02:39:57,232 --> 02:40:00,688
<i>She had known that if she were not shot
when the gangsters arrived,</i>

2355
02:40:01,232 --> 02:40:04,069
<i>she would be faced with her father's
suggestion that she return</i>

2356
02:40:04,531 --> 02:40:07,518
<i>to be become a conspirator with him
and his gang of thugs and felons.</i>

2357
02:40:07,998 --> 02:40:11,455
<i>And she did not need any walk
to reconsider her response to that...</i>

2358
02:40:13,299 --> 02:40:15,986
<i>even though the difference
between the people she knew back home</i>

2359
02:40:16,432 --> 02:40:18,430
<i>and the people she'd met in Dogville</i>

2360
02:40:18,731 --> 02:40:21,538
<i>had proven somewhat slighter
than she'd expected.</i>

2361
02:40:23,965 --> 02:40:27,422
<i>Grace looked at the gooseberry bushes,
so fragile in the smooth darkness.</i>

2362
02:40:28,965 --> 02:40:32,002
<i>It was good to know that
if you did not treat them ill,</i>

2363
02:40:32,498 --> 02:40:35,016
<i>they would be there come spring
as always,</i>

2364
02:40:35,432 --> 02:40:37,619
<i>and come summer
they'd again be bursting</i>

2365
02:40:37,998 --> 02:40:40,655
<i>with the quite incomprehensible
quantity of berries</i>

2366
02:40:41,098 --> 02:40:43,346
<i>that were so good in pies,</i>

2367
02:40:43,731 --> 02:40:45,729
<i>especially with cinnamon.</i>

2368
02:40:45,932 --> 02:40:48,709
<i>Grace looked around
at the frightened faces</i>

2369
02:40:49,165 --> 02:40:52,382
<i>behind the windowpanes
that were following her every step</i>

2370
02:40:52,898 --> 02:40:56,055
<i>and felt ashamed
of being part of inflicting that fear.</i>

2371
02:40:58,365 --> 02:41:00,363
<i>How could she ever hate them</i>

2372
02:41:00,432 --> 02:41:03,269
<i>for what was at bottom
merely their weakness?</i>

2373
02:41:03,731 --> 02:41:07,008
<i>She would probably have done
things like those that have befallen her</i>

2374
02:41:07,531 --> 02:41:09,609
<i>if she had lived
in one of these houses.</i>

2375
02:41:09,965 --> 02:41:13,501
<i>To measure them by her own yardstick,
as her father put it,</i>

2376
02:41:14,065 --> 02:41:16,063
<i>would she not, in all honesty,</i>

2377
02:41:16,399 --> 02:41:18,397
<i>have done the same as Chuck?</i>

2378
02:41:18,598 --> 02:41:21,555
<i>And Vera and Ben? And Mrs. Henson?</i>

2379
02:41:23,032 --> 02:41:26,129
<i>And Tom?
And all these people in their houses?</i>

2380
02:41:30,731 --> 02:41:32,729
<i>Grace paused.</i>

2381
02:41:32,865 --> 02:41:34,973
<i>And while she did,</i>

2382
02:41:35,332 --> 02:41:38,109
<i>the clouds scattered
and let the moonlight through.</i>

2383
02:41:45,965 --> 02:41:49,152
<i>And Dogville underwent another
of those little changes of light.</i>

2384
02:42:03,565 --> 02:42:06,632
<i>It was as if the light previously
so merciful and faint,</i>

2385
02:42:07,132 --> 02:42:10,528
<i>finally refused to cover up
for the town any longer.</i>

2386
02:42:12,032 --> 02:42:14,579
<i>Suddenly you could
no longer imagine a berry</i>

2387
02:42:14,998 --> 02:42:17,186
<i>that would appear one day
on a gooseberry bush,</i>

2388
02:42:17,565 --> 02:42:20,223
<i>but only see the thorn
that was there right now.</i>

2389
02:42:21,798 --> 02:42:25,664
<i>The light now penetrated every
unevenness and flaw in the buildings,</i>

2390
02:42:26,265 --> 02:42:28,782
<i>and in the people.</i>

2391
02:42:32,265 --> 02:42:35,921
<i>And all of a sudden, she knew
the answer to her question all too well.</i>

2392
02:42:38,531 --> 02:42:40,529
<i>If she had acted like them</i>

2393
02:42:40,865 --> 02:42:44,142
<i>she could not have defended
a single one of her actions</i>

2394
02:42:44,665 --> 02:42:47,562
<i>and could not have condemned
them harshly enough.</i>

2395
02:42:48,032 --> 02:42:53,127
<i>It was as if her sorrow and pain
finally assumed their rightful place.</i>

2396
02:42:54,865 --> 02:42:58,262
<i>No, what they had done
was not good enough.</i>

2397
02:43:00,132 --> 02:43:04,228
<i>And if one had the power to put it
to rights, it was one's duty to do so,</i>

2398
02:43:04,865 --> 02:43:06,863
<i>for the sake of other towns,</i>

2399
02:43:07,132 --> 02:43:09,499
<i>for the sake of humanity</i>

2400
02:43:09,898 --> 02:43:13,055
<i>and not least,
for the sake of the human being</i>

2401
02:43:13,565 --> 02:43:16,143
<i>that was Grace herself.</i>

2402
02:43:24,464 --> 02:43:26,462
If I went back and...

2403
02:43:28,132 --> 02:43:30,130
became your daughter again,

2404
02:43:30,364 --> 02:43:33,401
when would I be given
the power you're talking about?

2405
02:43:37,398 --> 02:43:39,264
Now.

2406
02:43:39,265 --> 02:43:41,372
At once?

2407
02:43:41,731 --> 02:43:43,729
<i>Why not?</i>

2408
02:43:48,531 --> 02:43:50,669
So that would mean
that I would also take on

2409
02:43:51,032 --> 02:43:53,809
the immediate responsibility,
at once.

2410
02:43:55,232 --> 02:43:57,230
And I'd be a part
of the problem solving...

2411
02:43:58,898 --> 02:44:00,896
like the problem

2412
02:44:01,065 --> 02:44:03,063
<i>of Dogville.</i>

2413
02:44:08,731 --> 02:44:11,189
We could start by shooting the dog

2414
02:44:11,598 --> 02:44:14,405
and nailing it to a wall over there,

2415
02:44:14,865 --> 02:44:17,203
beneath that lamp for example.

2416
02:44:18,798 --> 02:44:20,876
It might help,
it sometimes does, no?

2417
02:44:21,232 --> 02:44:23,689
It would only make the town
more frightened,

2418
02:44:24,098 --> 02:44:26,675
it would hardly make it
a better place.

2419
02:44:28,865 --> 02:44:30,863
And it could happen again.

2420
02:44:32,098 --> 02:44:34,096
Somebody...

2421
02:44:34,165 --> 02:44:36,352
somebody happening by,
revealing...

2422
02:44:41,798 --> 02:44:43,796
their frailty.

2423
02:44:48,065 --> 02:44:50,722
<i>That's what I want to use
the power for, if you don't mind.</i>

2424
02:44:55,132 --> 02:44:57,999
I want to make this world
a little better.

2425
02:45:01,364 --> 02:45:03,502
Yeah?

2426
02:45:03,865 --> 02:45:07,261
The damn kid won't shut up.
Says he wants to talk to you, miss.

2427
02:45:07,798 --> 02:45:09,876
<i>Can we just shoot him now?</i>

2428
02:45:10,231 --> 02:45:12,399
No, let me talk to him.

2429
02:45:17,231 --> 02:45:19,279
What? What is it?

2430
02:45:21,865 --> 02:45:24,053
A man can't really be blamed

2431
02:45:24,431 --> 02:45:26,397
for being scared, can he?

2432
02:45:26,398 --> 02:45:28,826
- No...
<i>- No.</i>

2433
02:45:29,231 --> 02:45:31,229
I'm scared, Grace.

2434
02:45:31,298 --> 02:45:34,016
<i>I used you and I am sorry.</i>

2435
02:45:34,464 --> 02:45:36,064
I am stupid. I am.

2436
02:45:36,065 --> 02:45:38,342
I'm maybe even arrogant sometimes.

2437
02:45:41,098 --> 02:45:43,146
You are, Tom.

2438
02:45:44,531 --> 02:45:47,928
Although using people
is not very charming,

2439
02:45:48,464 --> 02:45:51,591
I think you have to agree
that this specific illustration

2440
02:45:52,098 --> 02:45:54,205
<i>has surpassed all expectations.</i>

2441
02:45:54,565 --> 02:45:56,563
It says so much about being human.

2442
02:45:56,898 --> 02:45:59,585
It's been painful, but I think
you'll also have to agree

2443
02:46:00,032 --> 02:46:02,959
- it's been edifying, wouldn't you say?
- Not now, Tom.

2444
02:46:03,431 --> 02:46:05,429
Not now.

2445
02:46:09,798 --> 02:46:12,865
If there's any town this world
would be better without, this is it.

2446
02:46:19,298 --> 02:46:21,636
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Shoot them, burn down the town.

2447
02:46:26,965 --> 02:46:29,542
What? Something else, honey?

2448
02:46:30,965 --> 02:46:32,963
There's a family with kids.

2449
02:46:36,197 --> 02:46:38,715
Do the kids first
and make the mother watch.

2450
02:46:39,131 --> 02:46:42,558
Tell her you'll stop
if she can hold back her tears.

2451
02:46:47,364 --> 02:46:49,362
I owe her that.

2452
02:46:56,131 --> 02:46:58,849
I'm afraid she cries
a little too easily.

2453
02:47:01,731 --> 02:47:03,729
We'd better get you out of here.

2454
02:47:05,197 --> 02:47:07,505
I'm afraid you've learned
far too much already.

2455
02:47:11,464 --> 02:47:13,462
Come on, come on.

2456
02:47:15,364 --> 02:47:18,081
<i>Feeling cold, sweetie?
Would you like a wrap?</i>

2457
02:47:19,531 --> 02:47:21,197
<i>I'm fine.</i>

2458
02:47:24,032 --> 02:47:26,519
You want the curtains opened?
You don't need them anymore.

2459
02:47:28,197 --> 02:47:30,195
You think?

2460
02:47:35,464 --> 02:47:37,462
I think we should open them.

2461
02:47:39,531 --> 02:47:41,529
I think it's appropriate.

2462
02:47:58,998 --> 02:48:00,996
No!

2463
02:48:01,865 --> 02:48:03,863
- <i>No! No!</i>
- No, no.

2464
02:48:04,197 --> 02:48:06,195
No, No.

2465
02:48:10,965 --> 02:48:12,963
No!

2466
02:48:13,765 --> 02:48:15,763
- No, Dad, no.
- No.

2467
02:48:15,932 --> 02:48:17,930
<i>Dad!</i>

2468
02:48:22,264 --> 02:48:24,262
Chuck!

2469
02:48:28,031 --> 02:48:30,029
Mom!

2470
02:48:30,364 --> 02:48:32,552
<i>Mom, help, help!</i>

2471
02:48:33,965 --> 02:48:35,963
Mom!

2472
02:48:50,831 --> 02:48:52,564
Stay, Achilles.

2473
02:48:52,565 --> 02:48:55,342
Dear God.

2474
02:48:58,798 --> 02:49:01,755
<i>No! Oh god!</i>

2475
02:49:38,398 --> 02:49:40,416
Bingo, Grace.

2476
02:49:42,865 --> 02:49:44,863
Bingo.

2477
02:49:46,364 --> 02:49:49,461
I have to tell you, your illustration,
it beat the hell out of mine.

2478
02:49:52,565 --> 02:49:54,753
It's frightening, yes,

2479
02:49:55,131 --> 02:49:57,129
but so clear.

2480
02:49:58,464 --> 02:50:00,462
<i>Do you think I can
allow myself to use it</i>

2481
02:50:00,731 --> 02:50:03,448
as an inspiration in my writing?

2482
02:50:13,665 --> 02:50:15,663
Goodbye, Tom.

2483
02:50:41,565 --> 02:50:43,753
Some things
you have to do yourself.

2484
02:50:45,097 --> 02:50:47,095
Really?

2485
02:50:50,097 --> 02:50:52,405
That one you're gonna have
to explain to me on the way home.

2486
02:50:53,765 --> 02:50:56,542
<i>Suddenly there was a noise...</i>

2487
02:50:56,997 --> 02:51:00,744
<i>not so persuasive and powerful as it
had been on one rainy night in spring,</i>

2488
02:51:01,331 --> 02:51:04,518
<i>but loud enough to work its way
through the final sighs of the timber</i>

2489
02:51:05,031 --> 02:51:08,398
<i>that was rapidly burning out.</i>

2490
02:51:08,931 --> 02:51:11,948
<i>It came again, everyone heard it.</i>

2491
02:51:12,431 --> 02:51:15,498
<i>- Grace was the first to recognize it.</i>
- That's Moses.

2492
02:51:15,997 --> 02:51:18,685
<i>"That's Moses," she said
and jumped out of the car.</i>

2493
02:51:20,131 --> 02:51:22,908
<i>She quickly covered the distance
to the dog pen through what,</i>

2494
02:51:23,364 --> 02:51:26,521
<i>now the buildings were gone,
could scarcely be called a street,</i>

2495
02:51:27,031 --> 02:51:29,868
<i>and certainly not Elm Street,
as there wasn't a tree left</i>

2496
02:51:30,331 --> 02:51:33,318
<i>on Dogville's little mountain ledge,
let alone an elm.</i>

2497
02:51:33,798 --> 02:51:35,905
<i>It was Moses.</i>

2498
02:51:36,264 --> 02:51:38,632
<i>His survival was astonishing,
a miracle.</i>

2499
02:51:40,031 --> 02:51:41,963
No, no.

2500
02:51:41,964 --> 02:51:44,042
No, just let him be.

2501
02:51:44,398 --> 02:51:47,705
<i>They will have spotted the flames
in Georgetown by now.</i>

2502
02:51:48,231 --> 02:51:50,599
Someone will come and find him.

2503
02:51:56,131 --> 02:51:58,559
He's just angry
because I once took his bone.

2504
02:52:10,231 --> 02:52:12,196
<i>Whether Grace left Dogville,</i>

2505
02:52:12,197 --> 02:52:14,745
<i>or on the contrary
Dogville had left her...</i>

2506
02:52:15,164 --> 02:52:16,763
<i>and the world in general...</i>

2507
02:52:16,764 --> 02:52:18,812
<i>is a question
of a more artful nature</i>

2508
02:52:19,164 --> 02:52:21,791
<i>that few would
benefit from by asking,</i>

2509
02:52:22,231 --> 02:52:24,399
<i>and even fewer
by providing an answer.</i>

2510
02:52:24,764 --> 02:52:27,482
<i>And nor indeed
will it be answered here.</i>
