1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,469
Please, get me to a hospital!

2
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,431
I can't breathe.

3
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,173
You know what? If you were smart,
you would stop talking right now.

4
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,709
Sue me. I just know that women
should never work for women.

5
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,902
How can you say that?

6
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,138
Because they're always threatened.

7
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,408
Especially if you're beautiful,
and they're not.

8
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,143
Fine! You never had a fight with your boss?

9
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,377
Never. You know why?

10
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,014
Because he's a man.

11
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,680
Can we please drop this?

12
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,690
I just want to go home and kiss my son.
Honey.

13
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,853
See, you have to mention
that you have a child and we don't.

14
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,693
-There's my point.
-Erit, I didn't say anything of the sort.

15
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,199
Don't apologize, it's genetics.

16
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,326
Women are always competing
with each other.

17
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,200
That's why you're having problems
with your boss.

18
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,500
-Because she's a woman.
-Exactly.

19
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,702
Women should work under men,
men under women. That's it.

20
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,100
What about men under men?

21
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,344
That's fine, too.
I mean, they can deal with it.

22
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,216
-Can we go now?
-Either of you guys want another drink?

23
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,375
-We're good.
-Shot? Double?

24
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,352
Women can do amazing things.
I am one. I know.

25
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,945
But even I would never work for me.

26
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,853
That we can agree on. Good night, Mick.

27
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,585
We are in a bad mood.

28
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:44,060
She's got a point, bro, you know.
I'd much rather work under you than her.

29
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,164
That's nice. I'd rather work under him, too.

30
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,193
You'd rather "work" under John?

31
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,600
You have a problem with that, too?

32
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,470
No! Why would I have a problem
with your Iittle sexual innuendo?

33
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:57,702
What is up your ass tonight?

34
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,772
So I should just sit here while you come on
to my husband right in front of me?

35
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:05,715
Lara, if I wanted your husband,
I would have him, Iike that.

36
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,013
How? You couldn't possibly show him
more of those tits.

37
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,748
-You know what your problem is?
-Okay...

38
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,086
My problem is your brain
is as big as those tits.

39
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,557
-Baby, this is your fault!
-Huge, exactly!

40
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,627
This is your...

41
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,820
If you had half a brain,
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

42
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,659
Baby. Let it go, Iet it go, Iet it go.

43
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,523
-Good night, brother dear!
-Good night!

44
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,364
-She's completely full of herself.
-Don't try and agree with me now!

45
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,199
I don't even think
she's a member of the dental profession.

46
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,568
Shut up!

47
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,541
She probably can't even
spell "anesthesiologist."

48
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,874
-The woman's a complete fraud.
-We went to her office party, you idiot!

49
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,210
And I believe she hit on me
that night as well.

50
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,877
You are completely delusional. She didn't
even hit on you in there. I just don't Iike her.

51
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,353
I understand your point of view. I really do.
I agree with you.

52
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:47,119
Somebody who Iooks Iike that should not
be allowed anywhere near oral surgery.

53
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,127
You are an asshole!

54
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,762
You're sitting in the chair,
you're trying to stay calm,

55
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,959
and you got them things
hanging in your face...

56
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,028
-So, see you next weekend. AII right?
-Okay.

57
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,160
-Thank you.
-Good night.

58
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,636
-Bye.
-Bye!

59
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,865
Bye!

60
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,740
Oh, gee.

61
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,280
Look at this.

62
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,626
-Now you say go.
-Go!

63
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,422
Smash.

64
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,159
AII right, squeeze in.

65
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,667
You know, you can't do this every morning.
It's way too corny.

66
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,397
Come on. Smile.

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,498
It's just till he's 18.

68
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,637
-A present.
-Oh, great. What's that?

69
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:17,147
You hate brushing your teeth
and that brushes them in 30 seconds.

70
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,378
I Iove brushing my teeth.
Don't believe everything your mother says.

71
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,011
-What time's your Iast class?
-3:00.

72
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,317
But I got some papers to grade.
Can you pick up Luke?

73
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,826
After yesterday,
I probably don't have a job anyway, so...

74
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,123
Was it wrong of me
to call her a useless cow?

75
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,462
I think bosses admire
that kind of frank exchange.

76
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,963
-Did you call your dad?
-When?

77
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,636
Birthday, yesterday!

78
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,107
Yeah, I sent him some freshly cut flowers,
Iittle pink roses.

79
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,802
I sent him a handmade card.

80
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,813
And I finished that quilt I've been sewing
since spring.

81
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,940
You are completely impossible.

82
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,417
Did you notice what I got for my birthday
this year? I got a grunt.

83
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,751
Mom said, "Happy birthday, sweetheart,"
and Dad went...

84
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,382
It was just... It was a beautiful moment
in my Iife. I teared up.

85
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:04,288
Ever think that somebody has to be
the bigger person here?

86
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,888
Now I want you to remember this
for the custody hearing,

87
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,058
how Mommy is always
scolding Daddy, okay?

88
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,226
Can you remember that?

89
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,598
You know, how are you gonna feel

90
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,104
when Luke grows up
and doesn't call you on your birthday?

91
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,072
And now she's trying to drive a wedge
between us.

92
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,042
-I give up.
-And now she's abandoning you.

93
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:26,342
Hey, buddy, do you wanna try
and knock him over again?

94
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,820
You ready? Line it up.

95
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,792
-Line it up now and you say go.
-Go!

96
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,026
I got it.

97
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,767
Pittsburgh Police.
This is an arrest warrant for Lara Brennan...

98
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,929
-Arrest for what?
-...and a search warrant for the premises.

99
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,130
-Hold on!
-Lara Brennan?

100
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,300
-You touch me again, I'm gonna arrest you.
-Hold on.

101
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,775
-Stay where you are!
-This is my house!

102
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:52,936
-Lara Brennan?
-Yes!

103
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,012
I will arrest you.

104
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,910
You're under arrest for the murder
of EIizabeth Gesas.

105
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,482
-Calm down!
-I got my kid in the kitchen!

106
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,050
What are you doing?
Arrest her for what?

107
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,086
-Turn around!
-Mommy!

108
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,586
-John! John!
-You have the right to an attorney...

109
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,121
Go get Luke. Go get Luke.

110
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,190
-...understand these rights...
-Luke!

111
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,849
It's okay, buddy! It's okay!

112
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,089
-Mommy!
-Luke!

113
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,456
It's all right. It's okay!

114
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,742
Daddy! Daddy!

115
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,941
-Daddy!
-What's wrong? What's wrong, buddy?

116
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,015
What's wrong?

117
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,518
I got you.

118
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,320
Well, you can stay in here

119
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:51,301
as Iong as you sleep on this side of the bed,
all right?

120
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:56,842
You Iittle snake.

121
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:02,003
I don't know why I keep falling
for the same old trick.

122
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,415
You have your tricks, don't you?

123
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,611
Hey, go to sleep.

124
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,485
Go to sleep.

125
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:31,004
-But Sam is your friend, right?
-Not at Iunch.

126
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,041
-Why, does he steal your food?
-No.

127
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,877
-Did he say something mean? About Mom?
-Yeah.

128
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,556
-Did you hit him?
-Yeah.

129
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,058
Good. Where'd you hit him?

130
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,856
On the playground.

131
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,259
Wow! That must have hurt.

132
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,393
Hold it there, son.

133
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,176
It's a toy.

134
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,918
Thank you.

135
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,184
Hey. AII right.

136
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,260
And the other arm.

137
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,356
Don't worry about the car.
We'II get it back Iater, okay?

138
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,108
Hey!

139
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,630
Hi, honey!

140
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,792
Hey.

141
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,999
You won't give Mommy a kiss?

142
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,638
Can Mommy please have a kiss?

143
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,039
Rat-bag. Give your mom a kiss.

144
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:17,175
-Is Daddy reading you my Ietters?
-Every night at bedtime.

145
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,443
Yeah?

146
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,054
You smell so good.

147
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,988
What are you gonna build today?

148
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,886
You gonna build a fort?

149
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,333
A door? Or a castle?

150
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,499
Hey.

151
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,017
Was he scared going to school?

152
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,521
No. I walked him to his class,
gave him a kiss, he just walked right in.

153
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,148
Didn't even turn back for a wave.

154
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,865
Look at his friends!

155
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,533
And his desk.

156
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,541
-How was your first day?
-Excellent.

157
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,884
Half the class stayed awake, you know.

158
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,820
-I talked to your mom.
-When is she coming?

159
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:37,318
She's having a Iot of trouble
with her business, so...

160
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:43,361
Well, it's only been a couple of years,
I'm sure she'II get around to it.

161
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,273
Have you heard anything?

162
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,241
About the appeal?

163
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,311
Yeah, and I've just decided not to tell you.

164
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,870
-Remember what Meyer said.
-Don't.

165
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:59,007
It can take months for a court
to make a ruling.

166
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:03,179
I saw that woman. She was there.
She couldn't have just disappeared.

167
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,756
Meyer is Iooking for a new investigator.

168
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,792
Her coat snagged my purse,
and I felt that button pop,

169
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,417
and they're blind if they can't find it.

170
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,497
He's gonna go through
all the evidence again.

171
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,595
That's great,
because we're not quite bankrupt yet.

172
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,260
We're fine.

173
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,265
How you just Iie and Iie.

174
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,510
But you're so handsome.

175
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,045
Can you do me a favor?

176
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,278
I don't know, I'm kind of busy.

177
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:35,884
I need you to run for governor.

178
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,216
I can do that.

179
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,554
You can change this rule
about no conjugal visits,

180
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,755
'cause I don't think
I can Iast another 20 years.

181
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,120
Hey.

182
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,800
I'm okay.

183
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,875
-I'm okay.
-Everything is gonna be all right.

184
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,235
I promise.

185
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,847
You think he'II ever kiss me again?

186
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,833
I need you to stand up.

187
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,343
Tag, you're it.

188
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,119
Tag, you're it.

189
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:56,192
Luke! Let's go, yard ape.

190
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,497
Hey.

191
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,830
-Have fun?
-Yeah.

192
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,910
She's kind of crazy, that Iittle girl, right?

193
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,269
Time to go, Carrie!

194
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:11,875
No!

195
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,976
He didn't even read the thing. Half the time,
I'm telling you... We'II get him in there.

196
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:07,256
What happens if we find the woman
who was Ieaving the parking Iot?

197
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,227
The PCRA has been rejected.

198
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,996
No new evidence can be submitted.
Not anymore.

199
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,129
It was a robbery.

200
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,265
And if they had used her credit card,
we could have argued that.

201
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,037
I'm... I'm sorry.

202
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,309
John...

203
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,738
This sucks.

204
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,243
Okay. That's that.

205
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,691
AII we have now
is the Supreme Court, right?

206
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,589
John, in the Iast 30 years,

207
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,164
the Supreme Court
has not heard one murder case.

208
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,294
No decent Iawyer
would even file the pleadings.

209
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,673
So, all I have to do is find an indecent one?
That shouldn't be too hard.

210
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,406
I'II file it.

211
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,945
But I need you to do something for me.

212
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,848
What?

213
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:09,283
I need you to Iook at the evidence
and forget that Lara's your wife.

214
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,928
I've seen the evidence, Meyer.

215
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,230
I'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty,
I'm just saying Iook at it.

216
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,601
Her co-worker sees her Ieaving the scene,

217
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,768
the victim's blood is on her clothes,
her fingerprints are on the murder weapon.

218
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,902
And then we went out to dinner.

219
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,879
How do you do that
if you just killed somebody?

220
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,074
That would make her a psychopath.

221
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,980
-And the fight...
-Is Lara a psychopath?

222
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,212
-The fight in the office?
-Everyone fights with their boss!

223
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,413
But this one ended up dead.

224
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,991
So what you're saying is that
you never believed in her innocence?

225
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,925
-How can you say that?
-What are you saying, Meyer?

226
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,055
I'm saying that it no Ionger matters
what we believe,

227
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,498
Lara is not getting out!

228
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,738
And you have no idea
how much I hate to say that.

229
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,707
I will find someone to file the pleadings.

230
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,786
John.

231
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,178
John, come on. John!

232
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:11,716
John!

233
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,817
John! For Christ's sakes!

234
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,053
Come on.

235
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,182
We'II find Scout, okay?

236
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,140
Thank you.

237
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:31,891
"And give a big hug to Pengui,
Little Pengui, Kiki and Opossumy.

238
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,825
"Lots and Iots of Iove, Mommy."

239
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,064
Should we write her back?

240
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,196
Can I have a quarter?

241
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,334
Can you have a quarter?

242
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,940
Yeah, but you know you can't spend these.

243
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,574
Because they come from the cottage
where Mom and I used to take you

244
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,482
when you were a baby.

245
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,047
Then can I have them all?

246
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,418
Sure.

247
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,475
My wife, Lara Brennan,
she was sent up here.

248
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:29,042
-Brennan, B-R-E-N-N-A-N.
-I'm sorry, but she can't have visitors.

249
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,416
That's ridiculous. I have to see her.

250
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:31,955
-Lara! Lara!
-I'm sorry.

251
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,024
You can't go down there!

252
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,926
-You can't be in here!
-Hey, hey, stop. Stop right there.

253
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,325
-Where you going? Hey, come back here.
-Lara!

254
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,919
-Lara!
-Sir!

255
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,726
-What the hell is going on?
-My wife attempted suicide.

256
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,265
They brought her up here.
I have to see her, please.

257
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,232
-She's not allowed visitors.
-So why isn't she in the ER?

258
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,237
-Because she's a transfer from County Jail.
-Just two minutes, please.

259
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,666
Two minutes.

260
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,173
Okay.

261
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,016
Thank you.

262
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,291
Two minutes.

263
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,993
So, The Life and Times of Don Quixote.

264
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,899
What is it about?

265
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:56,667
That someone's belief in virtue
is more important than virtue itself?

266
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:01,077
Yes, that's in there. But what is it about?

267
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:08,342
Could it be about
how rational thought destroys your soul?

268
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,719
Could it be about the triumph of irrationality
and the power that's in that?

269
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,720
You know, we spend a Iot of time
trying to organize the world.

270
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,823
We build clocks and calendars
and we try and predict the weather.

271
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:29,437
But what part of our Iife
is truly under our control?

272
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:48,890
What if we choose to exist purely
in a reality of our own making?

273
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,888
Does that render us insane?

274
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,903
And if it does,
isn't that better than a Iife of despair?

275
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:19,253
It's a course that investigates what
drives men to be free, no matter the cost.

276
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,323
Some other teacher had dibs on Papillon?

277
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,288
You escaped from jail seven times.

278
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,331
What do you want to know?

279
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,870
How you escaped when no one else could.

280
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,167
Balls and a Iittle Iuck.

281
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,499
No prison in the world is airtight.

282
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,272
Each one has a key. You just have to find it.

283
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,878
How do you do that?

284
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,140
A Iot of Iooking.

285
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,519
Especially at things
that break up the daily routine.

286
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,554
Guards get comfortable
doing the same thing day in, day out.

287
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,251
Something happens,
that's when they make mistakes.

288
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,158
When you see it, you have to be ready.

289
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,697
You have to have the entire plan
already in place,

290
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,666
even before you know
how you're going to get out of jail.

291
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,862
Escaping is easy,
the hardest part is staying free.

292
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:11,799
You have to know where you're gonna go
and how you're gonna get there.

293
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,676
You have to know how they plan
to catch you, where and when.

294
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,611
Well, how the hell
are you supposed to know that?

295
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,776
You pay off someone who knows.

296
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,650
And a Iot depends on
if the prison is in the country or the city.

297
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:24,813
City.

298
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,327
Where are you from?

299
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,836
Pittsburgh.

300
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,003
Pittsburgh's tough.

301
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:50,072
So many bridges and tunnels
they can block off.

302
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,543
From the time they make the call,

303
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:56,644
the police can have the center of the city
sealed tight in 15 minutes.

304
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,222
How can they be so exact?

305
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,759
After 9/11, Homeland Security
made every city have a Iockdown plan.

306
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,353
Downtown Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston,
Minneapolis, 15 minutes.

307
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,663
They can do D.C. in under 10.

308
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:12,863
Within 35 minutes, they can have cops
at every tollbooth on the interstate

309
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,735
and be running rolling stops
on the secondary roads.

310
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,468
They won't have your photograph yet,
but they will have your description.

311
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,574
What if you can't get out?
Thirty-five minutes is not a Iot of time.

312
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:23,670
Then surrender.

313
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:28,219
Because they will shoot you on sight,
along with anyone else you're with.

314
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,185
Stay far away
from the train and bus stations.

315
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,985
Forget the local airports.
Leave from another state.

316
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,886
Second, identity.
It's easy to find fake papers,

317
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,726
harder to find ones
that will get you through an airport.

318
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:45,269
You'II need a passport, a driver's Iicense
and a social security number.

319
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,771
If you have to rent a car,
find a place that will take a cash deposit.

320
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:53,239
They'II still run a credit check,
so use a real person's name on the ID.

321
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,972
Third, destination.

322
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,139
You want somewhere
that doesn't attract American tourists.

323
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,841
Think Yemen, and you get the idea.

324
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,117
And money, you'II need a truckload of it.

325
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:07,680
Everything's expensive,
hotels, travel, information.

326
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:09,550
How much?

327
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,891
Enough to last at least five, six years.

328
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:15,130
You run out of money,
you run out of friends.

329
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:23,163
But before you do anything,
you have to ask yourself if you can do it.

330
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:26,304
Can you forget about ever seeing
your parents again?

331
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:30,142
Can you kill a guard?
Leave your kid at a gas station?

332
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,482
Push some nice old Iady to the ground

333
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,609
just because she gets
between you and the door?

334
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:38,348
Because to do this thing,
that's who you have to become.

335
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,289
And if you can't, don't start,

336
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,259
'cause you'II just get someone killed.

337
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,099
How did you get caught?

338
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,065
I gave myself up.

339
00:27:55,573 --> 00:28:00,374
I couldn't take wondering when someone
was gonna come through the bedroom door.

340
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,544
So, what do you have in your pocket?

341
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,093
Good Iuck.

342
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,692
No prison in the world is airtight.

343
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:35,102
Each one has a key. You just have to find it.

344
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,868
How do you do that?

345
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,204
A lot of looking.

346
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,108
Especially at things
that break up the daily routine.

347
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,758
And on the left, the Allegheny County Jail,
now the largest jail in the world.

348
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:01,093
There have been three escape attempts
of which no one has made it out alive.

349
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,190
If you look to the right, south side...

350
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:09,867
"On the first Ianding, which was as small
as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed,

351
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,499
"there was a niche in the column,
about half a yard wide,

352
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,068
"and in this niche, the prince felt
convinced that a man stood concealed.

353
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,911
"He thought he could distinguish
a figure standing there..."

354
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,752
25, 26, 27,

355
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,658
28, 29, 30.

356
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,165
Good?

357
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,425
And money, you'll need a truckload of it.

358
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,338
Everything's expensive,
hotels, travel, information.

359
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,339
It's gonna take our selection.

360
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,744
Then we're gonna wanna use
our magic Iasso tool

361
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,749
to get the door out of the background.

362
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,217
Hey.

363
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,074
Identity. It's easy to find fake papers,

364
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:20,576
harder to find ones
that will get you through an airport.

365
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,304
-OxyContin.
-$10 apiece.

366
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,901
Give you five for $40.

367
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,719
Hey, I need some passports.

368
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,153
Piss off, man! Beat your feet.

369
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,697
Okay, boy!

370
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,172
You got to pay upfront for the passports, yo.

371
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,547
-I can do that.
-You know the Hotel Lafayette?

372
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:39,783
It's on Main Street. When you get there,
go to the bar, ask for Harv.

373
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,517
What's your name?

374
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,850
Tell him Mouss sent you.

375
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,569
Harv? I'm Iooking for Harv.

376
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,559
-Are you Harv?
-Yeah.

377
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,799
Mouss told me to come and see you.

378
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,728
He did, did he? What do you want?

379
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:32,543
Three passports, a driver's Iicense,
and a real social security number.

380
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,178
How do you know Mouss?

381
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,844
He babysits my kid.

382
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,018
Okay, follow me.

383
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,202
-You got the photos on you?
-Yeah.

384
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,168
-How much?
-$1,500.

385
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,982
If I ever see your face again,
you're gonna Iose an eye.

386
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:59,196
Yeah, it was stupid. I fell off the bike.

387
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:03,429
You mean the bike that's been in our garage
for two years?

388
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,365
Put your head back.

389
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:10,506
Some guy made a crack about Lara.

390
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,843
So that's what you do now? You punch
everybody who thinks she's guilty?

391
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,435
What's that supposed to mean?

392
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,810
It means it's important what you believe,

393
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,405
-not what somebody else...
-Really?

394
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,985
-Do you believe, Mom?
-Why are you trying to start a fight?

395
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,678
Come on, buddy. Let's go. Where's his bag?

396
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,949
-Why are you doing this?
-No reason.

397
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,615
I just stupidly thought that the people
who Ioved her

398
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,091
would actually believe she's innocent.
My mistake.

399
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:31,218
Stop this!

400
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,735
Go give Grandma a kiss.

401
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,770
Come on.

402
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,069
Does your face hurt?

403
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,103
A Iittle.

404
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,041
Did you hit him back?

405
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,238
No, I... I didn't.

406
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,473
That's okay.

407
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:38,784
Okay, buddy?

408
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:08,258
I'm Iooking for someone
who does high-end IDs.

409
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,486
Passports, social security cards.

410
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,256
Get out of here.

411
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:53,927
Yeah?

412
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:58,364
I was at the bar.
I know what you are Iooking for.

413
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,641
I'm deaf, you idiot. I read your Iips.

414
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:19,957
What do you need?

415
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,329
Passports, driver's Iicense,

416
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,062
a social security number
that'II take a credit check.

417
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,738
$3,700.

418
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,007
That's too much.

419
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,505
It is if you never get them.

420
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,043
I need photos and $1,000 in advance.

421
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,659
-I'II bring them Wednesday.
-Hey, not here.

422
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,767
I don't want you coming back here again.

423
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:08,309
Parking Iot of Don's. Eckert Street.
Under the bridge, 2:00.

424
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,545
If I'm not there on time, Ieave.

425
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,191
Put your thumb right there.

426
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,498
-Thanks. That's all I need.
-Thank you.

427
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,535
I'II just be a few moments.

428
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:17,644
GIasses?

429
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,742
Yes.

430
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:24,085
Yeah, I found myself falling asleep
grading papers.

431
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,382
When?

432
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,450
I guess about a year ago.

433
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,718
A year ago.

434
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:38,261
Look at you.
How can you do this to yourself?

435
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,135
I am hopeless without my wife.

436
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,867
I can't even ride a bike.

437
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,740
Sorry about the house.

438
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,120
I won't know where to picture you.

439
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:04,050
I close my eyes, I see Luke in his bedroom,
and you on the sofa by the window.

440
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:10,398
I won't know where to picture you anymore.

441
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,847
Show me where the bullets go.

442
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:31,555
Hi, it's John.

443
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:32,980
Luke's not feeling too well.

444
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,355
So I'm gonna pick him up
and take him home, okay?

445
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,452
I need Carl to cover my 3:00 class.

446
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:41,925
Thanks.

447
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:28,339
You ever gonna answer
your goddamn phone?

448
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,311
You were supposed to Ieave.

449
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,313
I need them.

450
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,255
You notice that guy was a cop?

451
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:49,488
Just give me the money.

452
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,877
You want this too much.

453
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,780
You're gonna fuck it up.

454
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,175
Hey, Mr. Brennan.

455
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:47,254
Today I'm gonna show you
how to make a key that can open any lock.

456
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,019
It's called a bump key.

457
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,420
First thing you need to do
is you need to find a key

458
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,088
that can fit into the type of lock
that you're trying to open.

459
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,564
Here I have a key
that fits into my front door,

460
00:43:56,667 --> 00:44:00,501
but I just changed the locks,
so it won't open.

461
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,232
First thing you need to do
is secure your key,

462
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,800
take a metal file and go through and
start taking those mountains and valleys

463
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:10,471
all the way down
to the lowest possible setting on the key.

464
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,106
The bump key works
by momentarily bumping those pins up,

465
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,309
so that for a split second,

466
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:18,946
the chamber is cleared of pins
and thus, able to turn and open.

467
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,278
-Here you go.
-Don't touch that.

468
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,509
-Sorry.
-Trying to do my job?

469
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:59,845
So you are where in here?

470
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:04,786
I'm in the middle there.

471
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,322
In the middle. Can you point to yourself?

472
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:09,985
That's me.

473
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:11,422
There.

474
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,293
So that's not you back there
by the elevators.

475
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:22,562
No, no, I was around here somewhere.

476
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,634
You wanna tell me what's going on?

477
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:30,072
You want me to tell you?

478
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:33,842
Yes.

479
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:37,649
Do you know what a bump key is?

480
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:39,949
Sorry?

481
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,290
If this was you,

482
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,129
you might wanna think about
what's gonna happen to your kids

483
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,432
if both their parents end up in prison.

484
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,931
Dad?

485
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:10,835
Dad!

486
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,474
Yeah, bud.

487
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,739
Yeah.

488
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,109
Thanks.

489
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:26,547
So we arrested his wife, and now
we're gonna charge the man with vomiting.

490
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,489
He's selling the house. Or he has a buyer.

491
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,995
In this market? Lucky man.

492
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,894
Can we possibly go do police work now?

493
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,834
I don't know how you managed
to stay single this Iong.

494
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,315
Dad, can I have my cookies?

495
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:02,956
-You hungry? You want a sandwich?
-No.

496
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,329
-There you go.
-Thanks.

497
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,031
Carrie!

498
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:20,040
I'm sorry.
She's just already got it all figured out.

499
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:23,640
Nicole.

500
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,549
-I remember.
-Really?

501
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:29,914
I remember your daughter.

502
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,448
Well, she's hard to forget.

503
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:47,059
Luke was supposed to bring this home.

504
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,297
He has his father's memory.

505
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,506
It's for Carrie's birthday party.
PIease, come. I'd Iove to meet your wife.

506
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:57,642
She won't be there.

507
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,777
It's complicated.

508
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:04,615
I understand. With me, too.

509
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,148
Carrie, come on, Iet's go.

510
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,718
We're gonna grab a bite to eat.
Would you Iike to come?

511
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:17,031
-No, I don't... We're kind of...
-Busy?

512
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:22,329
Come on. We owe you for the cookies.

513
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:25,899
Well, that's true.

514
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,377
And I did make those cookies myself.

515
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,469
And Iearned how to pre-package them.

516
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,347
Come on, Luke.

517
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,759
So, do you trade off time with Luke?

518
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,522
No, Luke and I are together full-time.

519
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,758
Wow. I guess that's why I see you so much.

520
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,058
She'd Iike nothing better than to be here,
with him.

521
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,368
Lara, she... She misses all this.

522
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,271
I guess it's all about priorities, isn't it?

523
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,541
No, she's not Iike that.

524
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:11,448
She's in prison.

525
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,792
-I don't tell most people.
-I understand.

526
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:19,623
She's innocent. She didn't kill that woman.

527
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,089
Good. I mean...

528
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,198
I'm sure she didn't.

529
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,304
We really should be going home.

530
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,602
Okay.

531
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,709
Thank you very much for the invitation.
We'II try and make it.

532
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,576
That would be great.

533
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:41,008
-Goodbye. Luke!
-Bye.

534
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,180
Come on.

535
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,387
Carrie, come on!

536
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:24,700
-Hey.
-Hey.

537
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,298
What's wrong?

538
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,376
What is it?

539
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:37,711
No.

540
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,279
No.

541
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:43,021
They can't move you without notice.

542
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,117
Three days isn't notice.

543
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:49,459
I was only here through the appeal.
We knew I was going to a prison.

544
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,667
No, no, I don't have two weeks.
I gotta close the escrow tomorrow.

545
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,572
Well, the title hasn't even been cleared yet.
I mean, there's no way I can...

546
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:01,871
How much can they give me?

547
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:03,402
Nothing!

548
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,068
What are you doing here?

549
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:35,802
I've got class.

550
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,777
You be good, okay?

551
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:45,943
Thanks.

552
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:00,990
Are you okay? You're okay?

553
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,428
-Are you okay?
-What are you doing?

554
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:03,692
You almost killed us!

555
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,858
I'm so, so sorry.

556
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:06,697
You're out of your mind. You don't Iook.

557
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,902
Get away. Get away from us!

558
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,432
Hey.

559
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:52,706
What's wrong?

560
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:53,782
Nothing.

561
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:55,548
Is it Luke?

562
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,085
-No.
-What?

563
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:03,615
I... I asked Meyer

564
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,661
to Iook into not having you moved.

565
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:12,624
I told him that traveling that distance
would be a hardship on us,

566
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:14,794
that Luke was already having problems
at school, which is true.

567
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,895
I haven't been spending
enough time with him.

568
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:18,838
You haven't?

569
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,267
No.

570
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,643
You haven't?

571
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,349
Jesus, John.

572
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:31,444
You really are too much.

573
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:36,390
Luke is having a hard time,
because Mommy's in jail for murder,

574
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:39,859
not because Daddy doesn't spend
enough time with him.

575
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:44,592
Your father was right. You really don't
Iive in the same world we do.

576
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,665
That's nice, that the two of you talk.

577
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,464
What world do I Iive in, Lara?

578
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:55,135
Well, I don't know, John,
but it's not the real one.

579
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,508
The one in which I'm in here
for the rest of my Iife.

580
01:01:57,613 --> 01:02:01,208
So don't be talking to me about fantasies
Iike there's some happily ever...

581
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,007
We good here?

582
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,683
Yes. Sorry.

583
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:23,266
Now you're gonna sit here all Iong-faced,
Iike you Iet me down.

584
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:26,205
I mean, what do you want me to do here?
You want me to make you feel better?

585
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:27,503
Got it.

586
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:29,809
I'm sorry.

587
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,470
Now you're apologizing.

588
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,515
You really are a gem.

589
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:36,744
-What do you want from me, Lara?
-What do I want from you? Nothing.

590
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:38,548
You're already too perfect.

591
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,684
You know,
you never even asked me if I did it.

592
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,822
-If I killed her.
-Because I know you didn't.

593
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,952
Well, then you'd be wrong.

594
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,443
I'm done.

595
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:40,041
Sir, you can't stand there.

596
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,650
Sir, I need you to Ieave the building now.

597
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:45,479
Sir?

598
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:04,464
-What?
-Shut up.

599
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:09,139
I don't care what you say or how you say it.

600
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:12,471
I don't believe you did it.

601
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:15,978
And I never will.

602
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:22,389
I know who you are.

603
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:26,795
And I promise you

604
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:30,625
this will not be your Iife.

605
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,123
Shut up!

606
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,267
-I don't know what's going on, man.
-You done?

607
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,345
Everybody is out.

608
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:05,346
I gotta get back to Jimmy.

609
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:09,584
Back away! Back away!

610
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:13,446
Drop the gun! Drop it!

611
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:15,188
Put the dog away!

612
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,622
You shoot the dog, I'II kill you!

613
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:19,886
-You want the police here, asshole?
-Good idea!

614
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:24,592
Get in, get in, get in!

615
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,258
-You, too!
-I'm not getting in there!

616
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:27,995
Get in there!

617
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,071
Get in! Get in! Get in!

618
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,898
AII right, Iock it. Lock the door.

619
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:37,578
-Move!
-You are dead.

620
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,477
-I didn't do anything.
-You brought him here!

621
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:41,049
I didn't bring him!

622
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:45,215
On your knees! On the floor!

623
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:54,690
AII right. Where's your money?

624
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:59,557
Here. It's worth it to get rid of you.

625
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,459
-Where's the rest?
-Here.

626
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:04,035
-Take more.
-Where do you keep your money?

627
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,937
I'm gonna give my money to you. Yeah.

628
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,009
-I'II shoot you.
-You can't even shoot a dog.

629
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:09,771
-I'II kill you both!
-No, I'm gonna kill you both!

630
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:12,677
-Just give him your money!
-Keep your dead bitch mouth shut!

631
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:13,748
Give him your money!

632
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,239
Jesus!

633
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,120
See? You ain't gonna kill me.

634
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:25,853
This is the worst you could do?

635
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:30,962
Go home.
I'II come, I'II find you and I'II kill you.

636
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:42,066
You're wasting some good shit there!

637
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,145
Yeah, good shit.

638
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:44,471
High alcohol content.

639
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,119
What are you gonna do?
You gonna burn me out?

640
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,447
Yeah. That's what I'm gonna do.

641
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:55,581
Jesus Christ!

642
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,488
This is a meth Iab, you idiot!

643
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:59,019
No.

644
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:01,059
It was.

645
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:04,227
Tell me! Where's your money?

646
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:06,062
My kid is upstairs!

647
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:08,167
My kid is upstairs!

648
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,532
-Get up!
-Jesus!

649
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,834
Get up!

650
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:34,956
PIease.

651
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:38,095
PIease, Iet me go, please.

652
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:19,540
Anybody here?

653
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,066
Don't Ieave me here.

654
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:51,833
I don't wanna die here.

655
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:58,271
PIease!

656
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,941
PIease, get me to a hospital!

657
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,178
I can't breathe.

658
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:46,922
PIease.

659
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,530
I can't breathe.

660
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,500
I can't... I can't...

661
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,080
Get out of my way.

662
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:26,056
-What do we have?
-A freaking miracle.

663
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:28,925
Meth Iab in the basement,
the house still standing.

664
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,760
Should be just a crater.

665
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:31,958
We know him?

666
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:35,503
AIex Gaidar,
history of violence and drug trafficking.

667
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:46,509
He have a kid?

668
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,810
Neighbor said wife Ieft with him Iast year.

669
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:50,981
Big surprise there.

670
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:53,013
And this blood,

671
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:57,315
they type it all yet?

672
01:14:57,426 --> 01:15:00,452
No, but someone Ieft through
the back door bleeding.

673
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:04,191
Zone Three found a gunshot victim dead
on a transit bench.

674
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:51,479
Hey.

675
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:55,442
I've just come to pick up Luke.

676
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,143
He's sound asleep.

677
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:02,288
Yeah, I've just come to get Luke.

678
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:08,129
John.

679
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:13,128
Are you all right?

680
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:15,393
Yeah. I'm fine.

681
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:27,446
Hey, buddy.

682
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:30,181
Wake up, bud, we're going home.

683
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:34,880
So, what do you say?

684
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,742
Thank you, Grandma.

685
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:39,514
I think you should give Grandma a big kiss.

686
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:41,714
-I'm too tired for kisses.
-Buddy.

687
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:45,657
That's okay.
I'II get Iots of kisses next weekend.

688
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,459
We want to take him
