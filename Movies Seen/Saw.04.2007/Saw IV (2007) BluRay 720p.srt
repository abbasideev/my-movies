1
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,664
The subject's name is John Kramer,

2
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,583
a 52-year-old male Caucasian.

3
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,546
He's seen better days.

4
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,250
We have a recent
rectangular transection

5
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,544
to the left occipital lobe.

6
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,839
Some kind of backdoor
brain surgery.

7
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,307
Let's check the stomach.

8
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,370
What the hell?

9
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,500
Get homicide here, now.

10
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,759
Where is it?

11
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,512
lt was in his stomach.

12
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,932
Cut it out.

13
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,217
Are you there, Detective?

14
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,511
lf so, you are probably

15
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,972
the last man standing.

16
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,308
Now perhaps you will succeed

17
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,935
where the others have failed.

18
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,897
You think you will
walk away untested?

19
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,732
l promise

20
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,234
that my work will continue.

21
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,237
You think it's over
just because l'm dead?

22
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,239
lt's not over.

23
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,076
The games have just begun.

24
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:25,133
What the fuck? What the fuck?

25
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,095
What the fuck?

26
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,931
My eyes!

27
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,266
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

28
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,852
What the fuck is this?

29
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,072
Who's that?

30
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,826
Talk to me.
What are you doing?

31
00:06:50,910 --> 00:07:07,467
Talk to me.

32
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,435
Stop it!

33
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,438
Stop.

34
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,737
Stop it.

35
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,346
What are you doing to me?

36
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,724
What did l do?
Help!

37
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,267
Help!

38
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,686
Who's doing this to me?

39
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,453
Just get away from me!

40
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,086
What did l do?

41
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,682
- Right side clear.
- Left side clear.

42
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,142
Clear.

43
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,481
ln position.
Standing by.

44
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,567
Hold right there.

45
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,945
l see movement.

46
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,827
We have a device.

47
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,495
You get eyes in there
before you go in.

48
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,623
Get some eyes in here.

49
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,708
Moving now.

50
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,892
The doorway is clear.

51
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,804
lt's Kerry!

52
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,348
- Rigg!
- Don't do it! We're not secure!

53
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,392
- Rigg, l said no!
- Kerry!

54
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,644
- Stop him!
- Do not go through that door.

55
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,563
Kerry!

56
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,649
Shit.

57
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,258
- Get me the coroner's office.
- Copy.

58
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,343
Somebody get those rats off her.

59
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,976
Let's get the light on this.

60
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,398
Cut her down.

61
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,316
You know l can't do that.

62
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,738
l said cut her down.

63
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,533
Please.

64
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,875
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

65
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,254
You know never to go
through an unsecured door, ever.

66
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,173
l thought she was still alive,

67
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,842
thought l could save her.

68
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,970
Did you ever think
that we would end up here

69
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,055
when we first started?

70
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,726
No.

71
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,353
l didn't see it
happening like this.

72
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,816
Why the hell do we still do it?

73
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,611
lt's in our nature to save them.

74
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,363
- lt's what we do.
- Right.

75
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,658
"Cherish Your Life."

76
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,660
- What?
- The fucking motto.

77
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,663
We're supposed to cherish
our lives.

78
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,457
How the hell are we
supposed to do that

79
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,542
when this is our life?

80
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,673
We chose this.

81
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,592
- You go home.
- Hoffman, there are two agents

82
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,969
- here to see you.
- Copy.

83
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,016
- Detective Hoffman?
- Yes.

84
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,560
l'm special agent Lindsey Perez.

85
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,354
This is special agent Peter Strahm.

86
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,523
How can l help the FBl?

87
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,818
We're here about Detective Kerry.
She was our liaison.

88
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,778
"Open the door
and you will find me."

89
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,322
What?

90
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,079
- What's this?
- The key that came

91
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,039
with out last message
from Detective Kerry.

92
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,708
"Open the door and you will find me"
mean anything to you?

93
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,418
No.

94
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,095
Where's the body?

95
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,723
The crime scene photographer's flash
picked up this bullet casing.

96
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,809
lt was lodged between the body
and the device.

97
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,894
Run it for prints.

98
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,237
Give us the room for a minute,
would you? Thanks.

99
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,412
The lock was open.

100
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,788
She couldn't get out.

101
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,750
lt was constructed for her execution.
Betrayed the rules.

102
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,752
Not a Jigsaw trap then?

103
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,213
No, Amanda Young,
the accomplice--

104
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,966
- This wasn't done by Amanda Young.
- Excuse me?

105
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,385
Detective Kerry weighed
approximately 1 30 lbs.

106
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,429
Amanda Young's arrest report
has her at 107.

107
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,764
- She couldn't get her up there alone.
- John Kramer was--

108
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,183
The bedridden cancer patient?
He's brains, not brawn.

109
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,436
He was also an engineer.
He could have rigged pulleys--

110
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,606
Or someone else
could have helped him.

111
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,775
Special agent, if you're here for any
other reason than just to assist...

112
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,236
We're here to find the person
your department couldn't, Detective,

113
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,071
the one helping Jigsaw
and Amanda Young.

114
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,116
Excuse me.

115
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,083
We found a harlequin doll in your
possession. What's that about?

116
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,419
lt's a toy.
The kids play with toys.

117
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,796
That's all it is.

118
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:27,008
How about the tricycle?

119
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,218
The tricycle is from John's youth.

120
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,388
A grown man has
a tricycle his whole life?

121
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,724
l'm sure you've kept things
that were important to you.

122
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,809
Look, Ms. Tuck,

123
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,811
is there any reason
we should be concerned

124
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,897
for your safety?

125
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,399
Perhaps you should be
more concerned for yourself.

126
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,443
Why don't you tell me
everything you know about John?

127
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,903
And let's start at the beginning.

128
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,823
John's life defies chronology
and linear description.

129
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,077
So why don't we start at the end
and work our way backwards?

130
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,912
l represent Ms. Tuck.

131
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,832
She knows something.

132
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,834
l thought you were going home.

133
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,797
You have vacation time, right?
Take it.

134
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,049
Finish the remodeling,
spend some time with Tracy.

135
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,760
- She understands.
- Then don't take her for granted.

136
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,931
- Eric is still out there, man.
- Eric's been missing for six months.

137
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,017
Kerry was gone for four days.
l can only be as optimistic

138
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,687
- as the facts allow.
- Yeah, well, l'm in it till l find him.

139
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,522
Finding his body is not gonna
vindicate us.

140
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,440
Finding him alive will.

141
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,693
lt's time to let go.

142
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,695
l want you to go home.

143
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,572
l'll call you later to make sure
everything is okay.

144
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,704
Who's he?

145
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,497
Lieutenant Rigg,
our SWAT commander.

146
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,959
- What's his problem?
- Everyone around him keeps dying.

147
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,399
What's it say?

148
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,569
lt says, "l tried calling you
four times."

149
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,988
lt says, "Dinner is in the fridge."

150
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,035
And at the bottom it says,
"l love you."

151
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,203
l need to help my mom

152
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,581
for a few days.

153
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,458
Just...

154
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,669
come with me, okay? Now.

155
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,713
l can't.

156
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,592
You can,

157
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,927
but you won't.

158
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,346
What you can't do

159
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,724


is save everyone.

160
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,735
Tracy.

161
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,362
Tracy, please listen to me.

162
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,587
John Kramer owned a company called
The Urban Renewal Group.

163
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,798
No irony in that, huh?

164
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,966
What was Rigg watching?

165
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,929
Jill Tuck's interrogation.
She was Jigsaw's ex. lt's old.

166
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,972
Why is a SWAT guy watching that?

167
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,935
Strahm, l really think
we should tell Hoffman

168
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,937
what Detective Kerry said
in her last message.

169
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,148
She said two officers
might be in danger,

170
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,234
but until we know who,
we're not causing a panic.

171
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,903
lf Detective Hoffman or anyone else
in this precinct is in danger,

172
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,822
- l think they should know it.
- Not your call.

173
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,536
Making any progress?

174
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,873
We're fine, thanks.

175
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,626
Hey, boss, looks like another doctor
went missing from the hospital.

176
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,628
- Maybe it's--
- Thanks.

177
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,672
l'll check it out.

178
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,716
lf you need me, call my cell.
Coffee machine is around the corner.

179
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,136
- A boy or a girl?
- A girl.

180
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,971
- l didn't know you were married.
- l'm not.

181
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,515
lt's a short story, believe me.

182
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,122
Tracy.

183
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,722
Tracy?

184
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,662
Hello, Officer Rigg.

185
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,747
Welcome to your rebirth.

186
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,082
Fuck.

187
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,293
For years you've stood by
and witnessed

188
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,336
as your colleagues have fallen.

189
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,172
You have remained untouched

190
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,550
while Eric Matthews
has disappeared.

191
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,678
But with your survival
came your obsession--

192
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,722
obsession to stop
those around you

193
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,890
from making the wrong choices,

194
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,019
thus preventing you
from making the right ones.

195
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,062
You wanted to save everyone.

196
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,189
Tonight l give you
the opportunity

197
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,942
to face your obsession.
Look closely.

198
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,195
Eric Matthews is still alive.

199
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,948
- Eric.
- The block of ice he stands upon

200
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,825
is melting.

201
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,995
He has but 90 minutes
to save himself.

202
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:15,082
Detective Hoffman's fate is linked
to Eric's survival.

203
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,210
Heed my warning,
Officer Rigg.

204
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,421
Their lives hang in the balance

205
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,465
of your obsession.

206
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,801
Will you learn how to let go
and truly save them?

207
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,262
The choice is yours.

208
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,341
Don't fucking move.

209
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,107
Jesus.

210
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,692
Take off the mask.
Put your hands in the air.

211
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,278
l can't!

212
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,292
Officer Rigg, your first test.

213
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,671
The person in front of you
is in desperate need of help.

214
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,298
But it is not your job
to save them.

215
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,300
You view this person as a victim.

216
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,302
But if you want to see what l see,

217
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,055
beneath the mask lies a criminal

218
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,141
undeserving of the life she leads.

219
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,608
Your obsession tells you
to save the victim.

220
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,946
l tell you to walk away.
The choice is yours.

221
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,283
- Are you a cop?
- What?

222
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,410
- Are you a cop?
- Yeah, l'm a cop.

223
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,541
What is that?
What did you do?

224
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,886
- They're in the gears.
- What's in the gears?

225
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,389
The combination.
Get me out.

226
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,852
Cut my hair. Just get me out.
Cut my hair.

227
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,437
- Relax, relax.
- Hurry!

228
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,357
Fucking cut my hair, please.

229
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,026
Get me out!

230
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,489
Please.
Where are you going?

231
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,908
Wait wait wait wait.

232
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,868
Wait wait.

233
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,077
- Shit.
- Wait!

234
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,080
Stop!

235
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,458
Fucking let me out!

236
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,961
Get back here, you fucking--!

237
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,466
Okay, l'm sorry.
Please come back.

238
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,696
Where the hell is the combination?

239
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,615
Shit. Shit.

240
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,704
Hold on! Hold on!

241
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,085
l got one.

242
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,420
l got one. Hold on!

243
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,714
- Hold on.
- Hurry!

244
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,219
Oh, God.

245
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,808
- Yeah?
- We pulled a print off that casing.

246
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,851
We've got a match.

247
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,437
Jesus. Did you check this?

248
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,522
Twice.

249
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,193
Come on, come on, come on.

250
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,071
l got another one. Hold on!

251
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,783
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Hurry!

252
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,035
l got it. 617. 617.

253
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,121
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

254
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,921
Go!

255
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,841
Shit.

256
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,468
Okay okay okay, listen,

257
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,554
stay here. Don't touch anything.

258
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,911
What the fuck?

259
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,167
What the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing?

260
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,501
Drop the fucking knife!

261
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,503
- Please.
- Put the knife down.

262
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,505
Put the knife down.

263
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,216
l just saved your fucking life.

264
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,554
- l'm gonna kill you!
- Drop the knife.

265
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:31,982
Hey, these prints just came in.
They're from Officer Rigg.

266
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,567
- Fisk.
- Not now.

267
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,445
We just got a call of "shots fired"
from 23 Park Place.

268
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,822
That's Rigg's apartment.

269
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,873
Hello, Brenda.

270
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,000
l want to play a game.

271
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,920
An officer will try to save you.

272
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,715
lf he is successful,
then your game begins.

273
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,385
This man will use these photos

274
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,012
to sentence you for your crimes.

275
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,056
And the only way to stop him

276
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,183
is taped underneath the TV.

277
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,354
Let him save your life

278
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,648
and accept your fate
to rot in prison,

279
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,317
or kill him

280
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,569
and guarantee your freedom.

281
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,030
Make your choice.

282
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,346
l'll fucking kill you,

283
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,766
you fucking bitch!

284
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,114
Rigg!

285
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,827
- Rigg, you in here? Rigg!
- Go! Move move move!

286
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,705
Christ.

287
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:39,711
l got one.

288
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,723
lt's started.

289
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,727
An APB has been issued for Rigg.
Everybody's looking.

290
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,814
- He has a wife. Where is she?
- We haven't located her yet.

291
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:01,733
Strahm...

292
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,069
two detectives. You see this?

293
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,864
Hoffman-- you got a 20 on him?

294
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,365
Not yet.

295
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,908
- Hoffman.
- Calling.

296
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,119
How do you explain
Detective Matthews?

297
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,996
- He's alive.
- Six months.

298
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,291
- Jigsaw never kept anyone that long.
- No one but Amanda Young.

299
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,127
You think he's been fixed?

300
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,045
Why these six?

301
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,760
Hoffman's a decorated lieutenant.
He doesn't fit the profile.

302
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,847
That's what you see.
But what does he see?

303
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,183
- Rigg trying to save his two friends.
- Maybe.

304
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,769
You got names and locations
on any of these people?

305
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,730
- Working it.
- This is overkill.

306
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,357
lt's a setup to announce
Rigg is the accomplice.

307
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,277
Or a setup for his alibi.
Everyone around him keeps dying.

308
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:48,030
Where is he to tell us he's innocent
or what the hell these photos

309
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:51,325
are doing in his apartment?
Look there.

310
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:55,287
Move, please.

311
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,623
"Four Walls Build a Home."

312
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,666
What does he want us to see
on these walls?

313
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,668
The victims?

314
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,504
One of these pictures
doesn't belong.

315
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,513
This is who we're looking for.

316
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,059
Let's talk to her, now.

317
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,232
Jill Tuck-- where is she?

318
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,160
Have them turn off the air in there.

319
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,835
Ms. Tuck,

320
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,838
l'm special agent Perez.
This is special agent Strahm.

321
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,549
l'd like to apologize for pulling
you out of your place of work.

322
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,134
What more do you think
l can offer you?

323
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,054
My 100 hours of interrogation tapes

324
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,431
and the volumes of evidence
taken from my house

325
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,934
weren't enough for you
to understand John?

326
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,854
Actually, it's not John we want
to talk about, Ms. Tuck. lt's you.

327
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,439
Me?

328
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,984
Why do you want to talk about me?
This isn't about me.

329
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,861
So stop wasting both of our time
and get to the real reason

330
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,489
why you've brought me here.

331
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,725
Hey, you.

332
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,899
Let me go!

333
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,735
Hey!

334
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,031
You hear me?

335
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,907
You fucking hear me,

336
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,952
you fucking motherfucker?

337
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,679
Who's my girl?

338
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,809
What the fuck are you looking at?

339
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,561
Huh? What the fuck--?

340
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,938
Hey, you!

341
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,733
Sir, sir,

342
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,902
sir, can l help you?

343
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,304
Hello, Officer Rigg.
ln order for you

344
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,640
to fully understand my way,

345
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:47,060
you must...
feel what l feel.

346
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,604
The photo before you is of a man

347
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:53,024
- in desperate need of help.
- Sir?

348
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,653
ln the next room are the tools
to his salvation.

349
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,322
His life is in your hands.

350
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,868
But in the end
only he can save himself.

351
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:08,081
Be careful.
There are cameras watching...

352
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,128
and you must hide your identity.

353
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,673
Make your choice.

354
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,801
- Sir?
- What the fuck's he doing?

355
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,053
l don't know. You're gonna have to--
Look, look,

356
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,055
- you're gonna have to go.
- People are trying to sleep.

357
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,516
Yeah, l know people are
trying to sleep. You're the one--

358
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,060
Yeah, you can't sleep here.
You have to go.

359
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,313
Yeah, well, you can't sleep
in here, okay?

360
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,857
That's not a bed.
No, you've got to go.

361
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,067
No, you can't use the bathroom.
Look, look, no.

362
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,694
You're gonna have to go.
All right...

363
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,994
Chance, here, girl.

364
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:53,084
Chance. Chance.

365
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,172
Chance.

366
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,675
What are you doing?
Come on.

367
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,761
Chance.

368
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,811
Chance, come here.
Come here.

369
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,364
What you got there, huh?
What you got?

370
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,950
Come here. Come here.
What do you got there?

371
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:38,255
Okay, "Four walls build a home."

372
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,633
- Care to shed any light on that?
- Light on what?

373
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,885
On what your photos are doing
at the crime scene.

374
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,224
"Four walls build a home"
ring any bells?

375
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,395
"Cherish your life"?

376
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,773
"Cherish your life"
is the concept

377
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,817
that this whole clinic
was built on--

378
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,944
cherish your life-- your life.

379
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,863
- That's his motto.
- No, it's your motto--

380
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,574
of the clinic you run.

381
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,036
Fuck, man.
l've been here for three fucking hours!

382
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,372
- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut up.

383
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,165
Are you out of your fucking mind?

384
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,251
Hey hey.

385
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,211
Hey, guys, come on.
Calm down.

386
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,338
Cecil!

387
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,590
Stop it, Gus.

388
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,093
Knock it off now, please!

389
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,558
You don't want to do that.

390
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,893
- What the fuck is your problem?
- You're my problem.

391
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,814
You're becoming
everybody else's too.

392
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:49,242
How do you feel about a husband

393
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,995
who takes a motto
from your drug clinic,

394
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,205
designed to help people,
and twists it

395
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,375
into some manic torture mantra?

396
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,171
That part of John
has nothing to do with me.

397
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,217
Look, Ms. Tuck,
l just left a room

398
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,219
with more blood on the walls
than paint.

399
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,181
Two officers are missing and
there's a growing pile of bodies

400
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,559
in their wake.
And every detail we unearth

401
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,228
about your Hall of Fame
psychopath husband...

402
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,105
- Ex.
- ...points to you

403
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,940
as a possible accomplice.

404
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,235
l am just curious as to why.

405
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,237
You know, there's a lot of people
out there

406
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,281
looking for answers,

407
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,658
wanting to place blame
on someone.

408
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,536
That person is you.

409
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,747
But you know
what the best part is?

410
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,124
l don't have to
convince everybody.

411
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,335
Just 1 2 people.

412
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,840
Okay, tell me
about his workshop.

413
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,349
Stay there.
Let me get the lights.

414
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,145
Wow, it's big.

415
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,273
This is exactly
what you've been looking for.

416
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,733
Nice, huh?

417
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,444
Ta-da!

418
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:10,281
This is the clock?
What's so special about it?

419
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,325
Except for the fact
the whole deal hung on it?

420
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,285
The mechanism inside it.

421
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,663
lt's 300 years old.

422
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,665
Still ticking.

423
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,793
Withstood the test of time.

424
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,382
Wait till you see this space.

425
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,389
l've got a surprise for you.

426
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,780
Why are you doing this?

427
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,451
Why?

428
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,331
This was-- this was a mistake.

429
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,918
lt happened a long time ago.
And l paid for this.

430
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,795
Just let me--
just let me go, okay?

431
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,342
What's behind that door?

432
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,679
"One saves a life.
One takes it away."

433
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,309
Try that on the door.
Try that.

434
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,900
- Oh, no no.
- Get back. Get back. Get back.

435
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,526
Let's go. Go.

436
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:05,063
Eric. Jesus.

437
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,899
- Help! Help me!
- Get away from there.

438
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,403
What do you know about the guy on TV?
What do you know about Eric Matthews?

439
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,489
l don't know who that is.

440
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,743
- What the fuck is this?
- l don't know.

441
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,291
What are you gonna do to me?

442
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,421
lf you are playing this tape,
then you are one step closer

443
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,550
to truly understanding
how to save a life.

444
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,427
As an officer of the law,
you find yourself torn--

445
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,346
- Who is that?
- Shut up.

446
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,516
--is the man before you a victim
or a perpetrator of violence?

447
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,727
You sick fuck.

448
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,146
His salvation is out of your hands.

449
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,693
lt is your choice, if you wish,

450
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,736
to put it into his own.

451
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,780
Once this lesson is learned,

452
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,865
you will find yourself
one step closer

453
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,451
to truly saving Eric Matthews.

454
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,454
Without you this man's game
cannot begin.

455
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:07,208
Force him into position
to face his demons

456
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,336
and let him make the decision.

457
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,928
Shh. Don't wake up our neighbors.

458
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,434
Fuck. ls this what you do
with your spare time, huh?

459
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,476
No.

460
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,479
Take it all, little girl.
Be a good little whore.

461
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,190
Get on the fucking bed.
Get on the bed!

462
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,484
Move!

463
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,279
Strap yourself in.
Strap yourself in.

464
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,489
Please don't make me do this.
l know--

465
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,617
l know l was wrong.
l know.

466
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,704
Hurry up. Hurry up.

467
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,624
Put your fucking hands up.

468
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,294
l don't know. l don't know.

469
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,587
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

470
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,927
Listen, l'm really sorry.

471
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:03,222
What does that say?
What does that say?

472
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,434
What is that?

473
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,607
- Take them.
- Why?

474
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,322
Hello, lvan. As a voyeur,

475
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:22,075
you've kept photos of those
you have victimized.

476
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,036
- Let me go!
- Can you see the pain

477
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,080
you have brought them?

478
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,415
You have torn apart their lives.

479
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,127
You have used your body
as an instrument of abuse.

480
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,546
Now l give you the chance
to decide

481
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,549
what is more important--

482
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,969
your eyes which have led you
blindly astray

483
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,430
or your body

484
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,474
which has caused those around you

485
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,810
endless suffering.

486
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,979
You have been handed the tools
which can save your life.

487
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,816
Decide quickly, though.
ln 60 seconds

488
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,653
the choice will be made for you.

489
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,875
l can do it. One more.
l can do it.

490
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,782
You're gonna have to tell me
how you got

491
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:48,453
those bruises on your hand
and your neck.

492
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:53,124
Was this an accident or did someone
do this to you on purpose?

493
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:57,420
You can stop it from happening
if you tell me the truth.

494
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,631
Take a seat, please.

495
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,592
l want to go home now.

496
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,640
The son of a bitch is lying.

497
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:12,643
He's done this before.
She's allowing it.

498
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,105
The child's story doesn't corroborate.
What can l do?

499
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,649
Jane, l can't let you go home
right now, okay?

500
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,526
Go back to class, honey.

501
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,653
l told you, Officers,
sometimes these kids--

502
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,739
they just get out of control.

503
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,783
- Get your hands off me!
- Hey, take it easy.

504
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,659
Rigg! Rigg!

505
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:32,663
No. Get out. Get out now.

506
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,749
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life.

507
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,667
You hear me?
l will take him

508
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,378
for everything he's got,
that fucking cocksucker.

509
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,590
That's sweet, Ms. Tuck,

510
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:45,551
but if you love the guy so much,
why leave him?

511
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,221
- He left me long before l left him.
- Okay, people break up.

512
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,473
Relationships end.
lt's called life.

513
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,142
l mean, he started
massacring people.

514
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,686
- Gideon meant everything to him.
- Gideon? l'm sorry, who?

515
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,689
Do you know anything
about the Chinese zodiac?

516
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,775
Aw, Jill, no no.

517
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,819
l didn't just get pregnant.

518
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,862
lt was carefully planned.

519
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,990
Everything with John was.

520
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,453
- Thanks.
- See you.

521
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,497
- Bye-bye.
- Bye. Let me get that for you.

522
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,208
Thank you.

523
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,502
- Thanks. Have a good night.
- You too.

524
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,128
- Good night.
- Good night.

525
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,594
Hey, honey,
you want some company?

526
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,222
What are you doing?

527
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,307
You know what this building is?

528
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,729
lt's a health clinic.

529
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,774
You're a beautiful girl.
Go home.

530
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,032
My jacket.
l forgot my jacket.

531
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,076
- l forgot my jacket.
- Cecil, no.

532
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,786
Oh, please please, Jill.
lt's right there.

533
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,415
Look, it's right there.
Please please. Come on.

534
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,418
Thank you.

535
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,469
Thanks.

536
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,432
Listen to me.
l don't want to hurt you, all right?

537
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:15,975
You're gonna open up
that fucking door.

538
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,644
Open that fucking door.
Open it.

539
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,855
Open it.

540
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:23,774
Fuck!
What fucking key?

541
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,860
- What key?
- That one.

542
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,862
Fuck.

543
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,866
Fucking stay there.

544
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,996
Cecil?

545
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:59,185
Don't cry.
No no, hey, you're gonna be okay.

546
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,273
Fuck.

547
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,746
l need some help here.

548
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,831
Orderly.

549
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,667
This is my wife.
She's pregnant.

550
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,544
- How far along is she, sir?
- Seven months.

551
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,046
All l wanted to do was help them.

552
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,967
You can't help them.

553
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,970
They have to help themselves.

554
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:29,900
Okay, let's review:

555
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,902
Girl loves boy.
Boy loves girl.

556
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:35,906
Boy gets girl pregnant.
Girl loses baby.

557
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:39,201
Boy turns into a serial killer.

558
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,496
Jill, l'm not buying it.

559
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,666
You're gonna want
to take a look at this.

560
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,752
All right, she doesn't leave.

561
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,932
He's been identified
as lvan Landsness.

562
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,976
Acquitted of rape three times.

563
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,146
Had to gouge out his own eyes
in order to release himself.

564
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:11,484
How does something like this
get into a motel room undetected?

565
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,527
Piece by piece.

566
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,654
The room's been rented
for the past six days

567
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,949
to a lawyer named Art Blank.
Get this: he went missing two weeks ago.

568
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,826
Run his name.
Get his addresses.

569
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:24,205
Two out of five people on Officer Rigg's
apartment walls are dead.

570
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:27,124
Every partner
he's ever worked with-- dead.

571
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:30,586
Rigg didn't kill lvan.
lvan made his own choice.

572
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,588
lsn't that the whole Jigsaw mantra?

573
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,423
This wasn't about lvan.
lt wasn't his test.

574
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,426
lt was about Rigg.

575
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,637
Look at these photos.
Tell me how you feel.

576
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,472
Look at these women and tell me
how you feel.

577
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,557
- Angry. Enraged.
- Exactly.

578
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:47,853
The pimp, the rapist--
Jigsaw wanted Rigg to see what he sees.

579
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,107
He wants him to feel what he feels.

580
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,651
This wasn't about Rigg
saving his friends.

581
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,445
He's being recruited.

582
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,490
Thanks. Art Blank's got
a bunch of properties.

583
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:02,076
Last known address
is a couple of blocks from here.

584
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,502
- Right side clear.
- Left side clear.

585
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,254
- Clear.
- Clear.

586
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,339
Clear.

587
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,986
What does this mean?

588
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,655
We're the two Jigsaw targets.

589
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,546
Fuck you.

590
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,678
Hey.

591
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,724
Hey. Hey.

592
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:25,492
Hey, asshole,
you jump off that block,

593
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,077
you electrocute him.

594
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,664
lf that ice had melted more,
he'd be fried. You understand?

595
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,750
Listen to him.

596
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,928
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life,

597
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,137
- cocksucker!
- Calm down.

598
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,306
We'll get somebody to take
a look at it, all right?

599
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,684
My client has a broken nose
and a fractured cheekbone.

600
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,438
Administrative leave with pay
is not acceptable.

601
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,192
The lA investigation is underway.

602
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:02,112
lnto this precinct? Wow.
What's that gonna get me, huh?

603
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,406
- The truth.
- l'll tell you what the truth is.

604
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,117
The truth is,
l have an eyewitness.

605
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,828
The man's wife? She stands to gain
as much as he does

606
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,872
if there were to be
a financial settlement,

607
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,540
which is not gonna happen
because he's lying.

608
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,584
He attacked Officer Rigg first.

609
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,628
That's according to whom?

610
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,214
Me. l saw the whole thing.

611
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,259
You want to testify
before the grand jury?

612
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:26,720
l've already signed lA's affidavit.
The charges are being dismissed.

613
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,098
Oh, you guys are-- you're good.

614
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:32,142
You know, you're obviously as thick
as thieves in this precinct.

615
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,353
But it'll come back to you.
You know that, right?

616
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,231
l mean, one day someday it will.
lt will come back to you.

617
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,283
You understand?

618
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,034
Motherfucker.

619
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,245
Hey, do you understand?

620
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,417
Okay.

621
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,382
Motherfucker.

622
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,774
You're gonna have to tell me
how you got

623
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:24,278
those bruises on your hand
and your neck.

624
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,414
Rigg! Rigg!

625
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:42,398
l did it! l won!

626
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,274
What the hell did you do?

627
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,485
l--

628
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,121
What's happening?

629
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,293
The human body is
a fascinating organism.

630
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,712
lt can withstand
the most brutal injury...

631
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,842
and yet repair itself miraculously.

632
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,885
But you know this all too well.

633
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,971
How many broken bones
have you suffered

634
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,598
at the hands of your husband?

635
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,351
How many flesh wounds
have you endured?

636
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,769
Help!

637
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:24,731
With time, the bruises have healed,
but your pain has not.

638
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:31,697
Today l empower you
to take control of your life.

639
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,866
Can you disconnect
from the one thing

640
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,660
that has brought you and others
so much pain?

641
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:39,329
With time your wounds will heal.

642
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,041
His, however, will not.

643
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,340
Remove the ties that bind...

644
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,341
Get me out of here!

645
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,719
...or bleed to death
from you inactivity.

646
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,762
The choice is yours.

647
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:58,515
Okay.
Okay okay!

648
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,058
Here we go.

649
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,440
l'm sorry.

650
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:12,821
Morgan, Morgan,
what the fuck are you doing?

651
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:48,398
Help me.
Please help me. l can't do this.

652
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,526
- Please help me!
- Calm down.

653
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,778
No, don't go. Don't go.
Don't go. Wait for me.

654
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,863
Please get me out.
Please get me out.

655
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,449
Don't. Don't go. Don't leave me here.

656
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,410
Help me down.

657
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:03,455
Hello, Officer Rigg.
What have you learned thus far?

658
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,958
Experience is a harsh teacher.

659
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,043
First comes the test.

660
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,754
Second comes the lesson.

661
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:13,423
lf you are to save as l save

662
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:16,260
then you will see
that the person before you

663
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,803
is but a student.

664
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,556
So l ask you, Officer Rigg,

665
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,599
has the pupil learned her lesson?

666
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:26,228
Has she been taught
the error of her ways?

667
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,938
Does she now

668
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,065
- view the world differently?
- Please help.

669
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:34,444
Officer Rigg,
the key to this person's freedom

670
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:37,447
lies in the palm of your hand.

671
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,825
But only after she has done
her own part

672
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:43,453
can you play your role
in her salvation.

673
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,789
Once judgment has been made,
though,

674
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:48,458
the key to finding
your next destination

675
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,003
is just off the map.

676
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:54,256
- Who did this to you?
- l don't know.

677
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,467
Help, please.
Help, please.

678
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,678
Stay still.
l'm gonna try to take this out.

679
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,150
Thank you.
Thank you.

680
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:15,235
Oh, fuck.

681
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,947
That's it.
"Just off the map."

682
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,033
Just off the map.

683
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,911
Tracy.

684
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,415
"Go home."

685
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,836
Where is she?

686
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,589
l'm so cold. Please.

687
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,931
l want to live.

688
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,812
You have to save yourself.

689
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,526
Don't leave me.
Please don't leave.

690
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,654
Help me, please.
Don't leave.

691
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,786
l want to stop playing.

692
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,667
Why don't you fucking kill me?

693
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,627
No.

694
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:19,633
- Shut up!
- l don't want to play anymore.

695
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,262
"Save as l save."

696
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,515
So what did he do,
free her and let him die?

697
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,558
This guy didn't have a chance.
He's got rods going through

698
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:31,520
every major artery in his body.
"Your life is in her hands."

699
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,563
Rigg didn't kill this guy.
His wife did.

700
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,566
She identified Officer Rigg,
said he saved her.

701
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,235
- Saved?
- Yeah.

702
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,821
She passed Rigg's judgment,
got fixed and got her freedom back.

703
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,661
- Yeah.
- Second address?

704
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:52,582
Really? Okay, yeah.
That's good. Good.

705
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:55,043
But l still need that address.
Text me.

706
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:58,422
l just found out something interesting
about the three people in the traps.

707
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,758
They were all represented by a lawyer
named Art Blank.

708
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,136
- He got them all off?
- Yeah. But wait, it gets better.

709
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,679
He's also Jill Tuck's lawyer.

710
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,890
Look out!

711
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:16,064
- The lair-- where's the lair?
- Raided. lt doesn't exist.

712
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,608
Jigsaw wanted us to find that place.
Where's the new game being played?

713
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,235
We find that place-- we find Rigg.

714
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,612
We got a second address.
There's a co-owner.

715
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,030
- Who?
- Jill Tuck.

716
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,908
- Jill Tuck? Where's the building?
- Here. This building.

717
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,729
Hello, Agent Perez.

718
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:41,691
And welcome to the world
that you have long studied.

719
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,693
Your partner Agent Strahm

720
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:47,364
will soon take the life
of an innocent man.

721
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,825
Heed my warning, Agent Perez.

722
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:53,119
Your next move is critical.

723
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,205
Open the door...

724
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,876
What is that?

725
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:13,598
l got you.

726
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,729
Paramedics!

727
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,773
Help!

728
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,360
Stay with me.
Okay, come on.

729
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,404
Shallow breaths. Come on.

730
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:28,905
Stay with me. All right.

731
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,533
All right. You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

732
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,691
Hey.

733
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,652
Hey, you. Come here.

734
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,195
Look.

735
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,073
Hey. Hey.

736
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:13,783
Come on.

737
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,870
Hey. Hey.

738
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,581
Fuck.

739
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,796
- Stop. Stop.
- Son of a bitch!

740
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,715
Fuck.

741
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,720
Stop. Fuck.

742
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:35,555
Hey.

743
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,183
Listen to me. l'm not the one
you've got to worry about.

744
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,019
You understand me? l'm not
the one you've got to worry about,

745
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,271
asshole.

746
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:46,775
As a matter of fact,
l recommend you stay alive

747
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:50,278
until the fucking clock
counts down.

748
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:55,325
Here's the good news:
lf this other guy passes his test,

749
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:58,662
the three of us can go free.

750
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,580
Hey, look at me.

751
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,457
Look at me.

752
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:05,669
lf you don't stay on the block,
your partner gets electrocuted.

753
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:07,921
Now for my final task.

754
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,300
There you go.

755
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,303
Live or die.

756
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,138
You make the choice.

757
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,850
Mrs. Perez?

758
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,771
Hi. This is Peter Strahm.
l work with your daughter Lindsay.

759
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:27,941
Yeah.
l have some bad news.

760
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:08,148
See that, Jill? That's a federal fucking
indictment. lt's got your name on it.

761
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:11,359
Wanna put somebody else's name on it?
You start talking to me, okay?

762
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,069
What's with the doll?
What's with the tricycle?

763
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,530
Who were John's business associates
before he went insane?

764
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:17,782
He wasn't the associate type.

765
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,702
Where the hell is Art Blank?

766
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:22,912
Obstruction of justice.
Aiding and abetting.

767
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,081
Conspirator to murder.

768
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:26,583
Talk to me!

769
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:29,711
ln 1 5 minutes, more people
are gonna die, Jill-- police officers.

770
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:31,504
He's a business partner.
He's a friend.

771
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,840
He's the accomplice
we have been looking for

772
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:35,633
and he is your fucking lawyer.

773
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:40,930
You see this?
This is my partner's blood.

774
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,349
She's fighting for her life right now

775
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:46,561
because of your lunatic husband.

776
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:49,314
What happened between Jigsaw
and Art Blank?

777
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,399
John?

778
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:55,695
John.

779
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:59,074
l guess he's not here either.

780
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,660
What the fuck is this place, Jill?

781
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,627
- Don't be mad.
- What?

782
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:16,800
Hey, are you all right?

783
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:20,720
You weren't returning
my calls, buddy.

784
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:24,557
Listen, John, l--

785
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,601
l'm sorry.
l understand.

786
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:29,562
What happened was a tragedy.

787
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:32,190
But l gotta tell you--

788
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,818
listen, John, l gotta tell you,
those buildings we're working on...

789
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,861
You take 'em.
You give my share to Jill.

790
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,989
That's not the way it works, John.
You see, we're partners.

791
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:42,408
Your designs will make
those buildings special.

792
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,994
We've got 40 families ready to move in--
40 families, John,

793
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:47,163
low-income families.

794
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,998
You can't just walk away.

795
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,000
You're their savior, John.

796
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:53,128
Get the fuck out of here.

797
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,463
Who are you talking to like that?
lt's me, John.

798
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:58,258
- Did you hear what l said?
- Oh, l heard you, John.

799
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,805
Get the fuck--

800
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:07,392
You heard me.

801
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:14,065
Okay, John.
You take good care of yourself.

802
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:18,111
Gimme a call
when you're feeling better.

803
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,798
He blamed me.

804
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:41,384
l don't think he could
ever forgive me.

805
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:44,095
ln his mind
our time was over.

806
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,640
He was diagnosed with cancer
soon after that.

807
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,320
Did you try to contact him again?

808
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,155
l tried.

809
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:05,867
But a different person
crawled out of the wreckage.

810
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:08,161
Someone else survived.

811
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,569
- l asked you not to come here.
- l need to talk to you.

812
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,613
John, John,

813
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:46,950
look at this.
What is this, hmm?

814
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:48,993
Why do you have Cecil's picture?

815
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,037
What have you done to him?

816
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:55,541
l told him not to take life
for granted.

817
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:57,585
l want to play a game.

818
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,713
Your life is a lie.

819
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,757
Now comes your moment of truth.

820
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:04,801
As a drug user and a hustler,

821
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:08,137
you've played roulette
with other people's lives.

822
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:10,431
Today you play with your own.

823
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,289
Fuck.

824
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:23,129
Fuck!

825
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:30,219
Hey, it's you.

826
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,971
You did this to me.

827
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:35,058
No, you did this to yourself.

828
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:38,728
Your greed took the life
of an innocent child.

829
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:41,856
Could you give me time
to explain, please?

830
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,442
l can't give you time.
No one can.

831
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,152
Time's an illusion.

832
01:12:46,236 --> 01:12:49,280
Look, look, l'm sorry.
l'm sorry.

833
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,407
l forgive you, Cecil. l do.

834
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:53,242
Addiction has ruined your life.

835
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:55,203
l'm bleeding, man.

836
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:57,622
Please just let me go.

837
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,874
l could let you go.

838
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,835
That wouldn't serve you.

839
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,964
l'll tell you what l will do, though.
l'll give you a tool

840
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,009
to reclaim your life,

841
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:13,262
to discard the vices that have
so corrupted your soul.

842
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,264
l don't have a fucking soul.

843
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:17,266
Maybe you will in the next life, Cecil.

844
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:19,685
You see, things aren't sequential.

845
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:22,313
Good doesn't lead to good,
nor bad to bad.

846
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,273
People steal,
don't get caught,

847
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,275
live the good life.

848
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,277
Others lie, cheat

849
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,279
and get elected.

850
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:33,116
Some people stop
to help a stranded motorist

851
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,828
and get taken out
by a speeding semi.

852
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,288
There's no accounting for it.

853
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:42,542
How you play the cards you're dealt--
that's all that matters.

854
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:45,044
Look at me.

855
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:46,921
Do you understand
what l'm saying to you?

856
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:49,590
Oh, yeah.

857
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,884
l understand.

858
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,179
You're fucking nuts!

859
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:11,571
Whoa! What the fuck is that?

860
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:14,782
lt's the tool--

861
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,784
the tool that's going to
save your life.

862
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,662
l want to play a game.

863
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:23,458
Your life is a lie, Cecil.

864
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,794
Now comes your moment of truth.

865
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:29,797
As a drug addict and a thief,

866
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:32,091
you've preyed on the kindness
of others

867
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,177
to fuel your addiction.

868
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,429
Today we're bringing

869
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:39,265
the ugliness inside you
out into the open.

870
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:41,350
Now in order for you
to stay alive

871
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:43,936
we have to match your face

872
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:46,814
with the ugliness of your soul.

873
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:52,361
Just lean forward into the knives
with your face.

874
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,739
Press hard enough

875
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:57,867
and you'll release
the arm and the leg restraints

876
01:14:57,951 --> 01:15:00,369
that bind you.

877
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:02,455
Press hard, though.

878
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,541
And you'll be free.

879
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:08,377
You sick fuck! Fuck you!

880
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:13,466
Or you can sit idly
and bleed out on the floor.

881
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,719
Live or die, Cecil.

882
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:18,804
Make your choice.

883
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:31,067
Fuck you, you sick fuck!

884
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:32,652
Help!

885
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:25,830
You're dead.

886
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,541
You're fucking dead.

887
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:32,295
Fucking dead.

888
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:47,727
What's happened to you?

889
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:52,732
What's happened to me?

890
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:54,650
What's happened
to me?

891
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:05,453
Now you don't come back.

892
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:09,206
You do it for yourself
if you can't do it for me.

893
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,585
l lost him too.

894
01:17:48,538 --> 01:17:50,831
"Four Walls Build a Home."

895
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:01,509
Your son was named
after John's first building, right?

896
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:03,719
- Yes.
- Where is it?

897
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:06,514
Where is it?
Where is it?

898
01:18:06,598 --> 01:18:09,100
Where is it?

899
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,330
What the fuck does that mean?

900
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:28,846
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

901
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:34,477
You'd better hope he doesn't
come through that door.

902
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:37,730
Who? Who's coming
through the door?

903
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:44,612
Who is it?

904
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:19,688
Where the fuck are you?

905
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:23,442
Gideon Meat Packing,
1 1 235 Blake Drive.

906
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:25,528
l don't have two minutes.

907
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,425
Who's coming through the door?

908
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:42,855
Fuck.

909
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:04,376
Congratulations, Art.

910
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:40,537
Who is it?

911
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,876
Who's coming through the door?

912
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,671
Here he comes.

913
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:49,922
Who the fuck is it?

914
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:58,931
Shit.

915
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:03,352
Fix me, motherfucker!

916
01:23:05,855 --> 01:23:08,691
l'm standing right here.

917
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:12,361
Your time's running out.

918
01:23:12,445 --> 01:23:14,530
Please think about
what you're doing.

919
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:21,870
Think about
what you promised me.

920
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:23,414
Think about tomorrow.

921
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,499
Lynn?

922
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:30,212
Lynn! Lynn!

923
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:41,098
Who is it?

924
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:52,818
What is that?

925
01:23:52,902 --> 01:23:55,946
This will release us
when the timer's up.

926
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,661
Release me!

927
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:09,251
Which is it gonna be, Jeff?

928
01:24:09,335 --> 01:24:11,295
Live or die, Jeff.

929
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:13,505
You've got a choice.

930
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:15,257
l forgive you.

931
01:24:16,259 --> 01:24:18,218
Jeff.

932
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,304
Jeff!

933
01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:26,518
- Eric!
- Don't open the door!

934
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:28,479
What the fuck?

935
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:32,024
Shit.

936
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,399
"Open the door and you will find me."

937
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:29,081
- Let me see your fucking hands.
- Where is my daughter, you mother--?

938
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:32,751
Fuck.

939
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:43,095
Jesus.

940
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:57,234
- Fuck!
- Aw, you stupid motherfucker.

941
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:59,361
- What did you do?
- l had more time.

942
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:03,031
- l still had fucking time.
- Why did you open that door?

943
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,950
- You fucking did this!
- No, you idiot.

944
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:09,037
No, Jigsaw's testing you,
you fucking piece of shit.

945
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:11,707
Put your fucking hands
where l can see them!

946
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:14,126
- Jigsaw's fucking testing you.
- Don't fucking move!

947
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:19,798
Hello, Officer Rigg.

948
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:22,426
lf you are hearing this,
then you have reached

949
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:25,262
Detective Matthews
and Detective Hoffman

950
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:27,931
in under 90 minutes,

951
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,058
resulting in their deaths.

952
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:32,227
The rules were clear.

953
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:34,146
You were warned.

954
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:36,064
- lt's Kerry!
- Do not go through that door.

955
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:39,151
You know never to go
through an unsecured door, ever.

956
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:42,529
Tonight you face your obsession.

957
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:45,324
What you can't do
is save everyone.

958
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:47,492
Will you learn how to let go?

959
01:26:48,494 --> 01:26:51,079
- Eric is still out there, man.
- lt's time to let go.

960
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:53,624
Detective Matthews has
but 90 minutes.

961
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:56,043
l recommend you stay alive

962
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:58,086
until the fucking clock
counts down.

963
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:00,172
They had to save themselves.

964
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:03,175
Take 'em.

965
01:27:05,178 --> 01:27:08,847
Their salvation was
out of your hands.

966
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:10,891
Time was on your side,

967
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:13,602
but your obsession
wouldn't let you wait.

968
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:16,521
lnstead of saving
Detective Matthews,

969
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:18,565
you cost him his life.

970
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,859
You failed your final test.

971
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:31,536
What l don't understand is
how the hell could Jigsaw do all this?

972
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:33,538
He was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him.

973
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:35,624
l'm not so sure he did.

974
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:44,508
- This wasn't done by Amanda Young.
- Excuse me?

975
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:46,593
- She couldn't get her up there alone.
- John Kramer was--

976
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:48,345
He's brains, not brawn.

977
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:51,390
We're here to find the person
helping Jigsaw and Amanda Young.

978
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:03,986
Looks like another doctor
went missing from the hospital.

979
01:28:08,032 --> 01:28:09,241
You go home.

980
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:13,912
We chose this.

981
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:33,223
Game over.

982
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:03,420
You feel you now have control,
don't you?

983
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:08,300
You think you will
walk away untested?

984
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:18,977
l promise that my work
will continue.

985
01:29:19,062 --> 01:29:22,230
That l have ensured.

986
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:24,483
By hearing this tape
some will assume

987
01:29:24,567 --> 01:29:26,318
that this is over.

988
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:29,821
But l am still among you.

989
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:33,241
You think it's over
just because l am dead?

990
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:37,120
lt's not over.
The games have just begun.
