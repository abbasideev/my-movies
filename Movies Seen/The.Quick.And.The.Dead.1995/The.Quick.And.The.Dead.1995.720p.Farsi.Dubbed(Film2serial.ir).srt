1
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:24,806
50 feet north of the wagon.

2
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:29,268
Or was it 50 feet
south of the wagon?

3
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:33,232
I can't remember.

4
00:02:00,552 --> 00:02:04,890
You ain't gonna take my gold.
No, sir!

5
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,921
Asshole.

6
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:41,804
I'm gonna kill you, bitch.

7
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:49,730
Damn you!

8
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:57,154
Don't you leave me here. I'm gonna
kill you if I ever see you again.

9
00:02:57,321 --> 00:03:01,408
I'm gonna kill you, bitch!

10
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,980
MARSHAL

11
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:38,845
5'8". Am I right?

12
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,725
I ain't ever wrong.

13
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:46,584
That's a girl. Thanks.

14
00:05:51,756 --> 00:05:56,845
- How about a room?
- Whores next door.

15
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,270
- Say that again.
- Whores next door.

16
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:17,659
Now, do you have a room available?

17
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:21,496
A room and bath.
Yes, ma'am. Coming up.

18
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:26,877
Katie, let's go get the lady a room
and a bath.

19
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:51,153
Barkeep,
I want a bottle of champagne.

20
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,533
And don't you dare open it.
I want to know what I'm drinking.

21
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:05,085
- You want to play poker with me?
- You keep playing with yourself.

22
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:08,004
This is a very special pack.

23
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:12,759
I put an ace in it
every time I kill a man.

24
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:34,448
Interested in first-class whisky?
Fine cigars, Indian ink, or perfume?

25
00:07:34,615 --> 00:07:38,745
Just shine my boots.

26
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:48,839
John Herod owns that house. He gets
50 cents of every dollar in town.

27
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:53,594
- What does the town get?
- They get to live.

28
00:07:56,347 --> 00:08:00,852
Another gun in town.

29
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:19,705
Hi, Scars.

30
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:23,125
Stand back.

31
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:59,581
That makes... 15.

32
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:21,396
- I just got out of prison.
- Congratulations.

33
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:25,900
- I got 35 years, but got out early.
- How long did you do this time?

34
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:29,780
Three days.

35
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:33,534
- You're pretty.
- You're not.

36
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:38,956
- I need a woman.
- You need a bath.

37
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:51,261
I'm so clumsy, I must be blind.

38
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:03,983
- We prayed you'd come to help us.
- This is strictly business.

39
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:10,072
- These candelabras are worth $200.
- That's not good enough.

40
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:13,284
Is that it?

41
00:10:29,718 --> 00:10:34,223
Don't mind my daddy.
He's just stupid.

42
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:39,979
You look like you've been riding
a long time. Where are you from?

43
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:45,276
Are you here for the contest?
I've never seen a woman carry a gun.

44
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:49,531
If you're a good shot,
maybe you could...

45
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:56,205
I guess I'd better go now.

46
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:05,111
Gold teeth!
I've got all sizes. Gold teeth.

47
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,575
I've got uppers. I've got lowers.
You're wasting my time.

48
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:14,997
Quiet!

49
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:21,337
I now declare
the quick-draw competition open.

50
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:27,052
Each man who enters the contest
will fight once a day.

51
00:12:27,218 --> 00:12:34,809
Anybody can challenge anybody.
Fight times to be drawn from a hat.

52
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:38,730
For the duration of the contest -

53
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:46,364
- fighters are entitled to whatever
they want, courtesy of Mr. Herod.

54
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,826
But the man who wins the contest
gets this...

55
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:56,458
$123,000!

56
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:01,088
Compliments of Mr. Herod
and Wells-Fargo.

57
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:05,217
All right, gentlemen,
what do you say?

58
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:09,680
Do we have any real gunmen
in this room?

59
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:13,851
- Do we?
- Yes.

60
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:20,525
Gutzon.

61
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:26,322
- I am the Swedish champion.
- Mr. Gutzon is the first to go up.

62
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:29,034
Anyone else?

63
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:34,915
- Put an ace up there for me.
- Ace Hanlon.

64
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:39,545
You'd better put me
and my friend Eugene on the list.

65
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:42,631
I ain't joining no contest.

66
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:48,096
Did I hear a clucking? Did somebody
bring a chicken in here?

67
00:13:48,263 --> 00:13:53,518
- I'll kill you with my bare hands.
- No, it's a gunfight.

68
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:57,105
We aim, we fire, you die.
You'll get the idea.

69
00:13:57,272 --> 00:14:00,317
The fighting begins tomorrow.

70
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:03,696
- Put my name up there.
- Anybody else?

71
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:07,450
- Sergeant Cantrell.
- How do you spell that?

72
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:13,831
Correctly.

73
00:14:13,998 --> 00:14:16,877
- Anyone else?
- Spotted Horse.

74
00:14:17,044 --> 00:14:20,922
Many white men will leave this town
in wooden boxes.

75
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:23,842
Spotted Horse. Any others?

76
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:28,513
- Put my damn name up.
- Scars.

77
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:37,648
I'm worth $3,000 in four states.
75 offences and no convictions.

78
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:43,863
My name's Fee...
but everyone calls me The Kid.

79
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,451
Congratulations.

80
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:55,042
I can wake up at dawn, rob two
banks, a train, a stagecoach, -

81
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:59,213
- shoot the feathers
off a duck's ass at 300 feet, -

82
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:05,470
- and be back in bed before you
wake up next to me. How are you?

83
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:12,102
- Just fine.
- Virgil Sparks, the pride of Texas.

84
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:18,066
Horace said you drink this.
You sure must want to die young.

85
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,986
I do now.

86
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:25,241
We've got a lot of spaces here.
Let's fill 'em up, men.

87
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:29,495
We've got a lot of spaces here.
Let's fill 'em up, men.

88
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:13,167
- How many brave men do we got?
- 12, Mr. Herod.

89
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:17,755
13 if you count Foy,
but he and Ratsy aren't back yet.

90
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:22,886
They'll be here. They're just
running a little errand for me.

91
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:37,442
- Add my name to the list.
- Yes, sir.

92
00:16:55,754 --> 00:17:01,009
- We beat the hell out of him.
- He ain't nothing.

93
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:08,392
Hello, Cort. I was beginning to
worry you wouldn't make it in time.

94
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:13,690
It's been a while. I hear you have
a mission down in Hermosillo.

95
00:17:13,856 --> 00:17:17,860
Is that right?
Your own little piece of heaven.

96
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:24,158
Sunshine, cactus flowers
and you and the orphan children.

97
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:28,622
We burned that mission down,
just like you said.

98
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:31,542
All that work, Cort...

99
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:37,923
All those years of hard work
destroyed for no reason.

100
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:44,305
It must make you angry.
You used to be fast.

101
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:48,852
Are you still fast?

102
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:52,981
Don't I get an answer?

103
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:57,027
Have you taken a vow of silence?

104
00:17:58,404 --> 00:18:02,616
I said, are you still fast?

105
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:05,995
Faster than you.

106
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:13,502
But I have renounced violence.

107
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:16,465
We'll see.

108
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:21,678
String him up.
In here, on the chair.

109
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:29,936
Adjust your collar, Reverend.

110
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:37,695
Pull him up, Foy.

111
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:54,046
Let me make it clear...
I want you in that contest.

112
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:56,507
No.

113
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:08,061
Think about it.

114
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:27,748
Last chance.

115
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:32,461
- Yes or no?
- Go to hell.

116
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,971
Sign me up.

117
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:46,435
- No women in quick-draw.
- There's no rules against ladies.

118
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:50,732
It's just that women
can't shoot for shit.

119
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:56,404
Adios, Reverend.

120
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:19,636
Put 'em both in the contest.

121
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:23,183
Move it, Preacher.

122
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:27,187
Take him out by the trough.

123
00:21:00,222 --> 00:21:03,183
- Come back here.
- No!

124
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,229
Come back here! You hear me?

125
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:11,025
Daddy!

126
00:21:24,664 --> 00:21:31,547
Good morning. You definitely
had a good time last night.

127
00:21:31,714 --> 00:21:38,220
Want some breakfast? Or how about
some more of what we had last night?

128
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:42,809
You certainly won
that drinking contest.

129
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:47,397
But then again, I won you in poker.

130
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:55,321
You puked and passed out,
so let's not plan the wedding yet.

131
00:21:56,156 --> 00:22:03,039
- Why do you sleep on this thing?
- That way nobody will steal it.

132
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,585
DYNAMITE

133
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:12,673
- Who are you gonna challenge today?
- Herod.

134
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:21,058
Bad idea. I'm the only guy who can
take him and I ain't gonna rush it.

135
00:22:21,224 --> 00:22:28,023
- Why not?
- Hell, he's my father.

136
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:20,996
Have you been challenged yet?

137
00:23:21,163 --> 00:23:25,543
You have now. I'll go get us a time.

138
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:30,089
These are my boys.
They don't get to church much.

139
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:33,760
Daddy's gonna kill you, Preacher.

140
00:23:49,318 --> 00:23:54,782
- Sleep well?
- Not as well as you.

141
00:23:54,949 --> 00:24:01,539
- I saved your life last night.
- You just stretched it out a bit.

142
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:05,753
- I might already be in heaven.
- Sorry.

143
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:20,810
- Don't you even want to fight back?
- Of course I do.

144
00:24:20,977 --> 00:24:24,731
I'd like to kill them all
for what they've done... but I won't.

145
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:31,237
- Killing people is wrong.
- Some people deserve to die.

146
00:24:34,282 --> 00:24:40,498
It was a little lean this week.
The whisky was flat.

147
00:24:40,664 --> 00:24:45,377
Horace, your excuses
are getting worse every week.

148
00:24:45,544 --> 00:24:51,384
I took everything
out of the register, sir.

149
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:55,764
- That's all there was.
- Barkeep...

150
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,334
I challenge you...

151
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:28,799
- I'm not fighting you.
- You ain't got no choice.

152
00:25:28,966 --> 00:25:33,679
- I told you!
- What are you doing here?

153
00:25:33,846 --> 00:25:38,308
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here for the money.

154
00:25:38,475 --> 00:25:42,772
The rules say
you have to accept every challenge.

155
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:47,026
If you've got a problem with that,
get out of town.

156
00:25:47,193 --> 00:25:51,239
- I've got no problem.
- The lady fights Mr. Kelly.

157
00:25:51,406 --> 00:25:55,326
They fight at seven o'clock tonight.

158
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:18,310
- Pick a card, honey.
- Thank you.

159
00:26:28,028 --> 00:26:31,449
He's so hot.

160
00:26:31,616 --> 00:26:34,702
Hold it up.

161
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:45,130
Ace of spades.

162
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:52,554
Thank you.

163
00:26:52,721 --> 00:26:58,644
I heard you blew a little girl's
thumb off in Reno doing that.

164
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:04,234
- I'm the best you'll ever see.
- So I keep hearing.

165
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:08,446
Shall we find out?

166
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,129
Look, girls, there he is.

167
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:25,195
It's lights out, Kid.

168
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:30,784
I'm gonna be pissing on your grave
tonight. You're through!

169
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,878
Quiet!

170
00:28:42,797 --> 00:28:46,467
- What's the odds on The Kid?
- Three to one.

171
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:52,140
Gentlemen, remember,
you must not draw -

172
00:28:52,307 --> 00:29:00,190
- until that clock
makes the first chime of the hour.

173
00:29:00,357 --> 00:29:03,735
What if somebody gets excited
and starts shooting early?

174
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,158
Any cheats
will be eliminated from the contest.

175
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:19,419
Whoever is standing after the draw
is the winner.

176
00:29:19,585 --> 00:29:28,137
If both men are still standing,
you must continue firing.

177
00:29:28,303 --> 00:29:32,266
Gentlemen, the street is yours.

178
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,066
I'll only wound you, Kid.

179
00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:43,570
You're a kind man.

180
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:11,641
Damn, am I fast!

181
00:30:11,808 --> 00:30:15,145
Did you even see me, I was so fast?

182
00:30:17,731 --> 00:30:23,737
Mr. Swedish Champion, are you done?
Stay down if you're finished.

183
00:30:24,738 --> 00:30:27,658
Yes, I give up.

184
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:36,250
- The Kid's the winner.
- Am I fast or is Sweden very small?

185
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:53,519
Come on, Kid, I'm gonna
get you something to drink.

186
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,399
How does it feel, Cort?

187
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:03,738
Does it remind you
of the good old days?

188
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:09,244
Is your heart beating faster?
Is your pulse racing?

189
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:17,002
- Good shooting, Kid.
- Good shooting?

190
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:24,760
If the Swede had been any slower,
birds would've nested in his hat.

191
00:31:24,927 --> 00:31:27,972
Come on, Kid.

192
00:31:31,142 --> 00:31:36,940
Spotted Horse cannot be killed
by a bullet. See.

193
00:31:37,107 --> 00:31:44,823
Four bullets in my arm, three in
my left leg and two in the back.

194
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:51,122
Another bullet went through my lip.
Another through my left foot.

195
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:56,753
Today a bullet went into my head
and it's not even come out yet!

196
00:33:57,298 --> 00:34:00,968
- It's time.
- I'm not gonna fight.

197
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:09,435
You don't want to fight?
We'll see about that.

198
00:34:09,602 --> 00:34:15,984
Get up! Come on,
don't keep Mr. Herod waiting.

199
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:20,155
Come on, Preacher, move it.

200
00:34:20,322 --> 00:34:25,535
- Turn the other cheek, Preacher.
- Kick his ass!

201
00:34:25,702 --> 00:34:29,082
He's gonna forgive us all.

202
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:37,882
And that concludes
the lessons for today.

203
00:34:40,176 --> 00:34:40,760
- My nose!
- I'm shocked.

204
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,931
- My nose!
- I'm shocked.

205
00:34:44,098 --> 00:34:48,769
- The reverend needs a gun.
- There's plenty of other gun shops.

206
00:34:48,936 --> 00:34:54,274
- Nowhere as cheap.
- No place is cheap enough for you.

207
00:34:54,441 --> 00:34:59,781
Your mouth gets faster every day.
Pity your hands are so slow.

208
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:06,287
- I ain't got slow hands.
- Put your hand on the counter.

209
00:35:06,454 --> 00:35:10,792
Put your gun hand on the counter.

210
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:19,593
See, Cort. Here's a gunfighter's
hand, and here's a farmer's hand.

211
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,513
I ain't got a farmer's hand.

212
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,686
Cort and me are killers,
the genuine article, but you...

213
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:32,399
You're from different stock.

214
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:36,945
My friend here needs a gun.

215
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:48,332
This is the Eagle-butt Peacemaker.
Solid ivory handle.

216
00:35:48,499 --> 00:35:51,836
Only 30 of these were ever made.

217
00:35:52,837 --> 00:35:58,593
This is the customized
Remington new model.

218
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:05,851
It's more accurate than the Colt.
The handles are solid silver.

219
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:13,734
Used with great success on
35 bank robberies by its late owner.

220
00:36:18,823 --> 00:36:26,122
This is the best help a man can get.
A Smith & Wesson Schofield.45.

221
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:32,212
Me and Jesse James think
it's the best handgun in the world.

222
00:36:32,378 --> 00:36:35,925
Trigger guard removal
saves drawing time.

223
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:39,637
But if you're drunk,
you'll kill your feet.

224
00:36:40,304 --> 00:36:45,601
- When did you last hold a gun?
- You know when.

225
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:51,233
I got offered 120 for this Colt.
You want to try it out?

226
00:36:56,071 --> 00:37:01,743
- Have you got $120, Cort?
- I don't have any money.

227
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:06,541
The Lord provides me
with everything I need.

228
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:11,712
We're wasting this boy's time then.

229
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:17,218
I'll be a good Samaritan.
What's the cheapest gun you've got?

230
00:37:17,385 --> 00:37:23,225
The cheapest piece of crap you've
got in the whole miserable store.

231
00:37:24,143 --> 00:37:27,479
All right...

232
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:33,444
- Five bucks.
- Sold.

233
00:37:40,452 --> 00:37:43,079
What are you doing?

234
00:37:43,246 --> 00:37:48,084
The Preacher's got the Lord on
his side. He only needs one bullet.

235
00:37:48,251 --> 00:37:54,300
Otherwise he might be tempted
to shoot his way out of town.

236
00:37:55,384 --> 00:38:00,139
- That gun shoots straight.
- It's okay, I won't draw.

237
00:38:00,306 --> 00:38:08,689
You will. I know you. When it comes
down to it, you'll pull the trigger.

238
00:38:12,611 --> 00:38:16,531
I've got money on you, Preacher.

239
00:39:00,662 --> 00:39:06,709
- I've got 20 bucks on you, Foy.
- That's money in the bank, Jimmy.

240
00:39:07,752 --> 00:39:11,506
Preacher boy, you're a dead man.

241
00:39:56,554 --> 00:40:00,767
Bless me, Lord.
Forgive me for my sins.

242
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:36,514
- He shot me!
- You didn't lay down and die.

243
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,559
You said you weren't gonna fight.

244
00:40:42,186 --> 00:40:47,525
It felt natural, didn't it?
Nice and smooth.

245
00:40:51,655 --> 00:40:55,617
I thought you weren't gonna fight.

246
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:07,171
You're pretty fast.
I hope I don't have to fight you.

247
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:11,926
- You have a choice to be here.
- He made you do it.

248
00:41:12,093 --> 00:41:16,472
I was the only one
who pulled the trigger.

249
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,351
This ain't much of a town
for a preacher.

250
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:31,572
- I wasn't always a preacher.
- Cort was an outlaw. Like us.

251
00:41:31,738 --> 00:41:35,367
Weren't you?

252
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:39,414
In fact, he used to ride with me.

253
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:47,338
Of course, that's all changed now.
He's a man of peace.

254
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,925
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

255
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:54,680
Easy...

256
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:58,976
There was a time
when you couldn't tell us apart.

257
00:42:08,027 --> 00:42:10,864
Is that true?

258
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:14,159
- Is that true?
- Yes.

259
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:19,080
I should've let you die.

260
00:42:26,297 --> 00:42:30,301
It's yours. Go ahead, take it.

261
00:42:30,468 --> 00:42:32,762
You smell good.

262
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:44,900
- What are you looking at?
- A dirty old man and a little girl.

263
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:50,572
This is a business discussion.
I'm offering her a job.

264
00:42:53,158 --> 00:42:59,124
Just make sure you wash
wherever he touches you.

265
00:43:04,963 --> 00:43:10,885
One of these days, I'm gonna
have to shoot you up real good.

266
00:43:26,777 --> 00:43:32,367
Mr. Hanlon, I wanted to ask you
about Indian Wells.

267
00:43:32,534 --> 00:43:38,415
- Did that fight really take place?
- It sure did.

268
00:43:39,332 --> 00:43:45,298
- You gunned down four men?
- I had a gun in each hand.

269
00:43:45,465 --> 00:43:50,595
The truth is
I am just as good with either hand.

270
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:57,602
You must be the fastest gun
in the West... or the biggest liar.

271
00:43:58,352 --> 00:44:02,941
It's a pity
you weren't there to find out.

272
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:10,157
But I was. I was the one who really
killed the Terence brothers.

273
00:44:10,324 --> 00:44:16,706
I doubt that a lying chicken-shit
like you was even in the same state.

274
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:32,848
How about that left hand, Ace?

275
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:39,480
How about that left-handed draw?

276
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:03,505
Mr. Ace Hanlon,
scourge of the sagebrush.

277
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:08,928
The terror of Tucson.

278
00:45:11,931 --> 00:45:14,225
A bladder full of hot air.

279
00:46:48,408 --> 00:46:50,994
Daddy!

280
00:46:58,795 --> 00:47:03,508
String him up! Put him on a chair.

281
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,428
Daddy!

282
00:47:16,438 --> 00:47:19,900
They're calling for you
on the street.

283
00:47:20,484 --> 00:47:26,282
Are you really gonna do it?
What if you get killed?

284
00:47:26,448 --> 00:47:30,787
Then I won't have to answer
any more of your dumb questions.

285
00:47:30,954 --> 00:47:34,207
- Miss...
- What?

286
00:47:34,374 --> 00:47:37,502
You can do it.

287
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:57,315
There's a click before the strike.
Listen to the clock.

288
00:48:23,259 --> 00:48:27,013
The last fight of the day.

289
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,266
Fire at the first chime.

290
00:48:30,433 --> 00:48:34,021
You're gonna die now, girl.

291
00:48:36,232 --> 00:48:39,485
You're dead meat.

292
00:48:39,652 --> 00:48:46,325
Look at you. Are you scared?
You're trembling like a leaf.

293
00:48:57,629 --> 00:49:03,135
There's a click before the strike.
Listen to the clock.

294
00:49:48,975 --> 00:49:51,645
The lady is the winner.

295
00:49:53,189 --> 00:49:56,442
- Damn!
- Come back here.

296
00:50:17,255 --> 00:50:21,968
Quick-firing resumes
tomorrow at noon.

297
00:50:22,135 --> 00:50:26,933
- I think you're great.
- Grow up.

298
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:29,769
Thanks.

299
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:53,210
DINNER TONIGHT
JOHN HEROD

300
00:51:36,047 --> 00:51:39,092
Thirsty?

301
00:51:39,259 --> 00:51:43,222
No need to go to all that trouble
just for me.

302
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:48,769
Last night The Kid. Tonight Herod.
You're a busy woman.

303
00:51:48,936 --> 00:51:53,232
- Any man you're not interested in?
- Yeah, you.

304
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:22,347
You're looking at me and thinking:
We have nothing in common.

305
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:27,143
But we do. We're both winners.

306
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,688
How do you feel
after surviving your first day?

307
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:35,236
- The same as yesterday.
- No. Your eyes are shining.

308
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:40,699
You've passed a test.
You feel alive.

309
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:46,873
I guess it doesn't excite me
as much as it does you.

310
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:52,879
You think I do this contest
because it's fun?

311
00:52:53,046 --> 00:52:57,884
Look at this town. These people
would kill you for your bootlaces.

312
00:52:58,051 --> 00:53:04,350
This way I get to face my enemies.
They can't shoot me in the back.

313
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:10,982
- And of course I always win.
- One day your luck will run out.

314
00:53:11,149 --> 00:53:14,402
I don't win because I'm lucky.

315
00:53:14,569 --> 00:53:17,488
Apres vous.

316
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:44,642
- Why did you come here tonight?
- You invited me.

317
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:48,855
You could've turned me down.

318
00:53:50,106 --> 00:53:55,863
- I wanted to see what you're like.
- What kind of man am I?

319
00:53:57,448 --> 00:54:00,409
The kind people hate.

320
00:54:03,787 --> 00:54:10,337
I'm not trying to be popular.
The people in this town need me.

321
00:54:10,504 --> 00:54:14,799
I bring a sense of order
to their lives.

322
00:54:14,966 --> 00:54:19,262
- Not law, order.
- Like hanging a preacher?

323
00:54:19,429 --> 00:54:25,061
He's no preacher. He's a fraud.

324
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:28,356
If a man is a killer,
that's what he is.

325
00:54:28,523 --> 00:54:33,736
That same man can't tell me
it's not in his blood any more.

326
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:39,618
- He's the worst kind of liar.
- Why does he upset you so much?

327
00:54:41,787 --> 00:54:49,044
I find myself almost
uncontrollably attracted to you.

328
00:54:52,965 --> 00:54:57,804
I'd think a man like you
would have a woman.

329
00:54:58,847 --> 00:55:03,643
I was married to a beautiful woman.

330
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:08,022
- She was unfaithful.
- Where is she now?

331
00:55:08,189 --> 00:55:12,319
I told you... she was unfaithful.

332
00:55:18,284 --> 00:55:23,080
- Why are you really here?
- Like I said, for the money.

333
00:55:23,247 --> 00:55:26,376
I'd give you all the money you want.

334
00:55:26,543 --> 00:55:30,088
I wouldn't feel like I'd earned it.

335
00:55:30,255 --> 00:55:34,134
Yes, you would.

336
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:46,105
- Did you ever kill anyone?
- Sure.

337
00:55:49,442 --> 00:55:57,325
I don't think so. It all comes down
to how far you're prepared to go.

338
00:55:58,494 --> 00:56:00,704
All the way.

339
00:56:06,293 --> 00:56:10,631
My father was a judge.

340
00:56:10,797 --> 00:56:13,884
That surprises you.

341
00:56:14,052 --> 00:56:20,141
He used to make my mother and me
watch people being hanged.

342
00:56:20,308 --> 00:56:24,521
One day he said there was
too much bad in this world.

343
00:56:24,687 --> 00:56:30,152
He took a bullet, put it in his gun
and spun the chamber.

344
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:34,323
Then he took it in turns,
clicking it at each of us, -

345
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:41,914
- until he blew the back of his
head off... with the final click.

346
00:56:49,756 --> 00:56:56,972
Understand this: There is nothing
on this earth that frightens me now.

347
00:56:57,138 --> 00:57:02,019
- Nothing.
- I have to go.

348
00:57:03,729 --> 00:57:07,191
I shouldn't have come here.

349
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:13,906
- Who are you?
- Let me go.

350
00:57:47,692 --> 00:57:53,949
I apologize for my behaviour, but
it's hard to get a drink round here.

351
00:58:03,751 --> 00:58:08,465
I was only a kid
when I hitched up with Herod.

352
00:58:18,058 --> 00:58:21,771
He singled me out because...

353
00:58:21,938 --> 00:58:26,901
...I was a little smarter
and a little faster than most.

354
00:58:27,944 --> 00:58:34,325
A completely fearless man, and he
wanted me to be just like him.

355
00:58:38,247 --> 00:58:44,169
We used to go revenue collecting
along the border, just the two of us.

356
00:58:44,336 --> 00:58:50,509
We took the bank in Nogales... and
ran out to a street full of troops.

357
00:58:50,676 --> 00:58:54,055
We got shot up so bad.

358
00:58:56,182 --> 00:59:03,147
This padre hid us in his mission.
He cared for us and fed us.

359
00:59:03,314 --> 00:59:07,151
He talked to us both for hours.

360
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:13,200
When we were strong enough to ride,
Herod told me to shoot him.

361
00:59:15,244 --> 00:59:18,914
When I said no, -

362
00:59:19,081 --> 00:59:25,463
- he put a gun to my head
and started to count down from ten.

363
00:59:31,761 --> 00:59:34,890
So I killed the priest.

364
00:59:36,391 --> 00:59:41,314
It doesn't matter what I do now.
I'm already damned, I know that.

365
00:59:42,356 --> 00:59:47,862
Don't go down that road.
You don't have to become like me.

366
00:59:51,282 --> 00:59:57,998
- Why did you call me up here?
- I wanted to ask you one question.

367
00:59:58,165 --> 01:00:03,378
Who brought you here to fight me?

368
01:00:09,301 --> 01:00:12,513
Mr. Herod...

369
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:18,478
I'm just a gentleman adventurer
after the challenge of a gunfight.

370
01:00:20,355 --> 01:00:25,944
I thought Ace Hanlon was
the hired gun. I was so sure of it.

371
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:30,699
But he was just a buffoon.
You're not.

372
01:00:33,035 --> 01:00:38,707
My name's Clay Cantrell,
and I'm a shootist.

373
01:00:38,874 --> 01:00:41,919
I've killed 17 men.

374
01:00:42,086 --> 01:00:47,092
Killing is purely business for me.
It doesn't give me any pleasure.

375
01:00:47,259 --> 01:00:51,596
My employer is confidential.

376
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:56,017
Do we have business together today?

377
01:00:56,184 --> 01:01:01,482
As soon as the rain stops, I'm
going to make an example of you.

378
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:18,792
Then he said, "Give me the gun."
What could I do? I gave it to him.

379
01:01:18,959 --> 01:01:21,670
Like hell I did.

380
01:01:21,837 --> 01:01:28,093
That was it for Flat Nose Freddy.
He currently resides six feet under.

381
01:01:29,845 --> 01:01:32,974
You were brave to enter the contest.

382
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:39,022
You've made your point.
Now I want you to step down.

383
01:01:39,189 --> 01:01:42,317
I'll step down when you step down.

384
01:01:42,483 --> 01:01:48,198
I'm telling you to step down.
Your time will come.

385
01:01:49,074 --> 01:01:52,536
Not with you still around.

386
01:01:52,703 --> 01:01:55,956
Don't ever cross me.

387
01:01:56,123 --> 01:02:00,169
And don't try to stare me down
like you're doing now.

388
01:02:00,336 --> 01:02:06,635
I'm not sick or old,
and you're not half the man I am.

389
01:02:15,477 --> 01:02:18,146
Round two.

390
01:02:18,313 --> 01:02:23,319
Four fights today, featuring
the eight remaining contestants.

391
01:02:23,486 --> 01:02:27,281
The winner
is the contestant left standing.

392
01:02:27,448 --> 01:02:31,827
Left alive.

393
01:02:31,994 --> 01:02:38,502
Left alive!
From now on, we fight to the death.

394
01:02:38,669 --> 01:02:41,463
What a surprise, John,
you changing the rules...

395
01:02:41,463 --> 01:02:44,508
What a surprise, John,
you changing the rules...

396
01:02:44,675 --> 01:02:48,095
Any problem with that?

397
01:02:49,304 --> 01:02:54,894
I was planning to kill you anyway.

398
01:02:55,061 --> 01:02:59,357
Gentlemen, the street is yours.

399
01:03:45,198 --> 01:03:48,159
I'm confused.

400
01:03:48,326 --> 01:03:53,581
All I hear from you weak cowards
is how poor you are.

401
01:03:53,748 --> 01:03:57,085
How you can't afford my taxes,
my protection.

402
01:03:57,252 --> 01:04:01,465
Yet somehow you've all managed
to find the money -

403
01:04:01,632 --> 01:04:06,720
- to hire a professional gunfighter
to kill me.

404
01:04:08,722 --> 01:04:12,560
Where's all this money coming from?

405
01:04:13,645 --> 01:04:16,648
What am I to think?

406
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:24,989
If you've got so much to spare,
I'm gonna have to take more off you.

407
01:04:25,156 --> 01:04:28,327
This is my town!

408
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:37,586
If you live to see the dawn,
it's because I allow it.

409
01:04:37,753 --> 01:04:41,757
I'm in charge of everything.

410
01:04:42,967 --> 01:04:47,764
I decide who lives or who dies.

411
01:04:56,481 --> 01:04:59,734
Your gunfighter's dead.

412
01:05:00,444 --> 01:05:03,865
Old news.

413
01:05:38,693 --> 01:05:41,112
Is it possible?

414
01:05:41,279 --> 01:05:44,616
Is it possible
to improve on perfection?

415
01:05:44,782 --> 01:05:48,078
The man's dead.
The Kid's the winner.

416
01:05:48,245 --> 01:05:52,291
I heard him.
I heard him move his hand.

417
01:05:52,458 --> 01:06:01,133
People, I am on a different level.
I am the new mayor of this town.

418
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:06,181
- Wonderful.
- He stinks worse dead.

419
01:06:06,348 --> 01:06:13,313
Storm coming up. No more fights
till we see what it's gonna do.

420
01:06:18,151 --> 01:06:23,783
We're gonna have to bury him deep.
He stinks something awful.

421
01:06:51,019 --> 01:06:54,274
Get the hell out of here!

422
01:07:14,128 --> 01:07:20,551
That little girl
is gonna be a real good earner.

423
01:07:43,409 --> 01:07:46,662
Deal me in, boys.

424
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:52,376
- I feel lucky.
- Was she good?

425
01:07:52,543 --> 01:07:55,672
Wriggled like a fish.

426
01:07:59,551 --> 01:08:03,013
Get up!

427
01:08:09,061 --> 01:08:15,443
- Bitch! I'll kill you.
- Outside, you bastard!

428
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:22,867
You goddamn filthy bitch!

429
01:08:40,553 --> 01:08:46,977
Please, don't kill me.

430
01:08:51,773 --> 01:08:58,530
Finish him off! This contest
isn't over until one of you is dead.

431
01:08:58,697 --> 01:09:04,036
Please, don't kill me.

432
01:09:12,587 --> 01:09:16,174
This contest is not over yet.

433
01:09:25,434 --> 01:09:28,812
A drink.

434
01:09:29,771 --> 01:09:32,817
Thank you.

435
01:09:39,866 --> 01:09:42,243
Die!

436
01:10:01,472 --> 01:10:06,228
Gold teeth.
A whole mouthful of gold teeth.

437
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:12,442
The lady moves to round three.

438
01:10:16,154 --> 01:10:20,660
There's always forgiveness
if you ask for it.

439
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:46,979
Come on, Preacher.

440
01:11:09,253 --> 01:11:13,173
- Thank you, Ratsy.
- Goodbye.

441
01:11:32,694 --> 01:11:38,700
What are you doing?
You're not quitting, are you?

442
01:11:39,201 --> 01:11:44,332
I know this is probably
the wrong time...

443
01:11:44,498 --> 01:11:49,962
...but I like you
and I want you to stay.

444
01:11:50,129 --> 01:11:54,508
- How can you live like this?
- Live like what?

445
01:11:54,675 --> 01:11:59,431
- Are you going to see Cort's fight?
- No, I'm not.

446
01:11:59,598 --> 01:12:06,438
I don't care about him... or you,
or anybody else in this town.

447
01:12:10,275 --> 01:12:12,487
I'm through.

448
01:12:19,369 --> 01:12:25,083
I don't think you heard me right.
I said I liked you.

449
01:12:29,213 --> 01:12:33,759
Spotted Horse
cannot be killed by a bullet.

450
01:13:45,877 --> 01:13:49,798
The man's dead.
Cort's the winner.

451
01:13:49,965 --> 01:13:53,093
He killed that Indian.

452
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:11,321
Spotted Horse
cannot be killed by a bullet.

453
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:16,076
- Give me another bullet.
- I explained the rules to you.

454
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:19,372
You have to kill the man.

455
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:29,340
Give me another bullet, John.
Somebody give me a bullet!

456
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:34,053
.38, Long Colt.

457
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:37,808
"I shall not kill."
That's what you told me.

458
01:14:39,017 --> 01:14:43,105
- "I have renounced all violence."
- Now!

459
01:15:28,236 --> 01:15:34,534
Congratulations, you're going
to the next round, Preacher.

460
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:39,206
Applause.

461
01:15:48,966 --> 01:15:52,386
Bravo.

462
01:15:52,553 --> 01:15:56,475
Welcome back... killer.

463
01:16:02,105 --> 01:16:04,775
Enough.

464
01:16:08,445 --> 01:16:11,783
Give me that.

465
01:16:42,232 --> 01:16:47,153
- I knew I'd find you here.
- You know who I am?

466
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:52,075
Of course I do.
I brought you into this world.

467
01:16:58,082 --> 01:17:01,669
- Your father...
- I don't want to talk about it.

468
01:17:01,836 --> 01:17:07,174
You've been hours looking
for his grave. He's not here.

469
01:17:08,426 --> 01:17:13,807
Herod's men... they smashed
the gravestone I made.

470
01:17:13,974 --> 01:17:19,396
Then they burned his body
till there was nothing left.

471
01:17:19,563 --> 01:17:26,945
There are good people here.
They're just cowards... like me.

472
01:17:27,112 --> 01:17:33,036
They're waiting for someone like you
to come and stop him.

473
01:17:33,202 --> 01:17:39,417
I can't! I can't kill him!

474
01:17:39,584 --> 01:17:44,005
I had my chance and I was scared.

475
01:17:44,172 --> 01:17:51,430
- I'm scared of dying.
- You've been dead since that day.

476
01:17:51,597 --> 01:17:55,517
You're more scared of living.

477
01:17:55,684 --> 01:18:00,064
It will be the same
if you keep riding.

478
01:18:03,944 --> 01:18:07,280
I pulled this from the fire.

479
01:18:07,447 --> 01:18:11,076
He was the best friend I ever had.

480
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:17,541
String him up. Put him on a chair.

481
01:18:19,418 --> 01:18:23,589
- Say your prayers.
- Here's the rope.

482
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:49,450
Daddy! No!

483
01:18:52,287 --> 01:18:55,248
Put her down!

484
01:19:18,731 --> 01:19:21,568
Hey, beautiful.

485
01:19:21,735 --> 01:19:25,280
What's wrong with you?

486
01:19:46,761 --> 01:19:53,352
What the hell!
That's Mr. Herod's prisoner.

487
01:19:55,354 --> 01:20:00,734
I hope you don't think I've sunk
to some base level of humanity.

488
01:20:00,901 --> 01:20:07,074
The Bible speaks
of drawing a sword against evil.

489
01:20:07,241 --> 01:20:10,828
I feel that it must be God's will
that I'm here.

490
01:20:10,995 --> 01:20:15,792
So I...

491
01:20:27,763 --> 01:20:31,058
Oh God...

492
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:42,404
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Because we could be dead tomorrow.

493
01:21:35,501 --> 01:21:40,840
Promise me
you'll leave Herod for me.

494
01:22:01,321 --> 01:22:04,241
I challenge you.

495
01:22:04,407 --> 01:22:09,829
I'm not fighting anybody else.
I want you.

496
01:22:09,996 --> 01:22:13,124
I've already been challenged.

497
01:22:16,044 --> 01:22:21,467
It's time for me to see
if I'm my father's equal.

498
01:22:26,973 --> 01:22:30,935
You would fight your own son.

499
01:22:31,102 --> 01:22:36,275
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Do you have a problem with me?

500
01:22:39,528 --> 01:22:42,990
I'll let you know.

501
01:23:01,801 --> 01:23:06,807
- I'm not fighting you.
- I'm not fighting you.

502
01:23:06,974 --> 01:23:10,686
I came here to kill Herod,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

503
01:23:10,853 --> 01:23:14,315
- Stand down.
- I will not.

504
01:23:14,481 --> 01:23:19,820
Stand down and let me take him
in the final. He'll be just as dead.

505
01:23:21,448 --> 01:23:24,576
Let me make something clear:

506
01:23:24,743 --> 01:23:29,831
You are going to fight.
Nobody walks out on this contest.

507
01:23:29,998 --> 01:23:33,752
You don't tell me what to do.

508
01:23:34,961 --> 01:23:40,426
If you try to leave town or refuse
to fight, my men will kill you.

509
01:23:40,593 --> 01:23:45,806
You had your chance to quit
and now it's gone.

510
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:05,619
Clear the street!

511
01:24:05,786 --> 01:24:12,001
Round three!
Only four contestants left.

512
01:24:12,168 --> 01:24:18,633
Mr. Herod fights The Kid.
Then the lady fights Cort.

513
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,885
Clear the street!

514
01:24:21,052 --> 01:24:25,933
You don't have to do this.
Everybody knows you're the best.

515
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:30,771
It ain't about that. I'm his son.

516
01:24:30,938 --> 01:24:37,444
If this is the only way
he'll admit that...

517
01:24:37,611 --> 01:24:40,740
...then so be it.

518
01:24:40,907 --> 01:24:47,372
What can you get out of this?
What do you want?

519
01:24:54,462 --> 01:24:58,301
All I want is his respect.

520
01:25:45,726 --> 01:25:49,188
I love you.

521
01:26:04,537 --> 01:26:08,708
Drop out. You've made your point.

522
01:26:08,875 --> 01:26:15,841
The gunfight is in the head,
not in the hands.

523
01:26:16,008 --> 01:26:22,640
The thing that makes him invincible
is that you all think he is.

524
01:26:23,975 --> 01:26:29,855
Maybe five years ago
he was the fastest...

525
01:26:30,022 --> 01:26:33,568
...but time catches up
with everyone.

526
01:26:33,735 --> 01:26:40,200
He's just a little bit slower than
he used to be. As for myself...

527
01:26:44,955 --> 01:26:48,710
I just reached my peak.

528
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:10,524
Shit, that was fast!

529
01:27:42,141 --> 01:27:47,188
- Did I get him?
- Yeah, Kid, you got him.

530
01:27:47,355 --> 01:27:50,316
Did I kill him?

531
01:27:50,483 --> 01:27:55,906
- You were so fast, Kid.
- I don't want to die.

532
01:27:57,699 --> 01:28:01,870
I don't want to die.

533
01:28:07,418 --> 01:28:10,546
I know.

534
01:28:36,031 --> 01:28:41,246
It was never proved
that he was my son.

535
01:28:41,413 --> 01:28:48,044
It was a farmer that...
He wasn't mine.

536
01:28:52,007 --> 01:28:58,055
I gave him a way out.
He wouldn't take it.

537
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:06,586
- What kind of ink do you have?
- Any kind you need.

538
01:30:07,963 --> 01:30:11,049
DYNAMITE

539
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:45,608
If neither one of you fire
by the time I count down from ten, -

540
01:31:45,775 --> 01:31:49,153
- my men will gun you down.

541
01:31:56,453 --> 01:32:00,457
Ten... nine...

542
01:32:00,624 --> 01:32:04,711
- Draw your gun. He'll do it.
- Eight.

543
01:32:06,464 --> 01:32:08,591
- Seven.
- Draw!

544
01:32:08,758 --> 01:32:12,470
- Six.
- Kill me, Ellen.

545
01:32:12,637 --> 01:32:16,265
- Five.
- Kill me!

546
01:32:16,432 --> 01:32:21,854
Kill me! Kill me,
or I'm gonna kill you.

547
01:32:22,815 --> 01:32:25,067
One!

548
01:32:50,969 --> 01:32:55,349
She's dead.

549
01:32:55,516 --> 01:33:01,814
She's dead! Leave her alone,
you vultures. Don't touch her!

550
01:33:01,981 --> 01:33:05,109
Nice shooting, Reverend.

551
01:33:05,276 --> 01:33:10,741
You put a fox in the hen house
and you'll have chicken for dinner.

552
01:33:10,907 --> 01:33:13,535
You're gonna burn for this.

553
01:33:13,702 --> 01:33:18,582
Is this what you wanted all along?
Come and get some.

554
01:33:24,630 --> 01:33:27,550
Son of a bitch!

555
01:33:31,596 --> 01:33:35,266
Of course we'll fight,
but the rules say tomorrow.

556
01:33:35,433 --> 01:33:39,979
- I'll even let you name the time.
- Dawn.

557
01:33:54,078 --> 01:33:57,206
Break my nose twice?

558
01:33:59,584 --> 01:34:04,798
Now we'll see how fast you can draw.

559
01:35:17,374 --> 01:35:21,129
- Who did that?
- I did that, Mr. Herod.

560
01:35:21,296 --> 01:35:25,216
You've got 20 seconds
to get out of town.

561
01:35:25,383 --> 01:35:29,679
That's not fair. I've only ever done
what you told me to.

562
01:35:29,846 --> 01:35:34,060
- You now have 15 seconds.
- Goodbye, Ratsy.

563
01:35:36,937 --> 01:35:42,485
What do you think? There's a lot of
people here that want entertainment.

564
01:35:42,652 --> 01:35:48,240
I could draw with my left hand.
How does that sound?

565
01:35:48,407 --> 01:35:52,621
Unlike Mr. Ace Hanlon,
I really can fight with both hands.

566
01:35:52,788 --> 01:35:56,166
How do you feel? I'm nervous.

567
01:35:56,333 --> 01:36:02,547
It takes a lot to scare me.
I love the sensation.

568
01:36:05,509 --> 01:36:09,514
Time's up, Ratsy!

569
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:20,858
I always wanted to fight you, Cort.
Ever since the first time I saw you.

570
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:26,824
It's just this itch
that I had to scratch.

571
01:36:39,879 --> 01:36:45,051
If he's still standing at the end,
gun him down.

572
01:38:54,105 --> 01:38:57,608
You're dead! You're dead!

573
01:39:27,849 --> 01:39:32,187
Sorry, John.
Changed the rules.

574
01:39:32,354 --> 01:39:37,443
- From now on all fights are fair.
- Who are you?

575
01:39:54,252 --> 01:39:57,339
You stole my life.

576
01:39:57,506 --> 01:40:01,259
Let her go, you son of a bitch!

577
01:40:06,683 --> 01:40:13,231
Don't make my little girl watch.
Let her go, before you kill me.

578
01:40:13,398 --> 01:40:17,193
I can't do that.
I've had my three shots.

579
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:22,449
I'll give you three shots
to save your daddy's life.

580
01:40:22,616 --> 01:40:29,248
Shoot the rope, and if it breaks,
your daddy can live.

581
01:40:30,249 --> 01:40:33,377
You can do it, darling.

582
01:40:36,673 --> 01:40:39,926
- I can't.
- You can do it.

583
01:40:40,093 --> 01:40:46,516
Hold the gun in both hands
and pull the hammer back.

584
01:40:46,683 --> 01:40:51,980
- I can't.
- You can. You can do it.

585
01:40:52,147 --> 01:40:57,028
- No, I can't.
- Don't you worry about this.

586
01:40:57,194 --> 01:41:01,866
None of this is your fault.
Don't you blame yourself.

587
01:41:02,033 --> 01:41:08,582
Just remember
that your daddy loves you.

588
01:41:09,541 --> 01:41:14,796
I'll always love you...
Just remember that. Now, come on.

589
01:41:29,812 --> 01:41:32,774
That's close enough.

590
01:42:04,808 --> 01:42:09,562
- You're not fast enough for me.
- Today I am.

591
01:43:31,691 --> 01:43:35,112
The law's come back to town.

592
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:43,668
