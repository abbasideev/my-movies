1
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:18,583
What is it going to take to make you
heed the warnings of this court?

2
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,880
It is obvious to me that you are not
taking this matter seriously.

3
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,923
I will not allow you to continue
to harass these people.

4
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,178
Is that clear?

5
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,138
If you violate this restraining order,
I assure you,

6
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:39,191
you will spend 40 days in the county jail.

7
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:40,934
I mean it.

8
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,853
One more offense.

9
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,070
What is obvious to this court

10
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,614
is that you're in need of professional help

11
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,992
and anger management counseling.

12
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,243
This court has suggested
that you seek counseling,

13
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,499
but since you can't
or won't do it voluntarily,

14
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,754
I am requiring it as part
of your staying out of jail.

15
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,793
Do I make myself clear?

16
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,306
Do I make myself clear?

17
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,050
Melinda?

18
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,936
Yes, Your Honor.

19
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,660
So,

20
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,660
do you think you have an anger problem?

21
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,168
Motherfucking right, I got an anger problem.

22
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,086
Do you feel that
you're entitled to this anger?

23
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,727
That's like asking me
if I'm entitled to being hungry.

24
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,850
He caused all of this.

25
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,393
All of it.

26
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,021
It's not me. That son of a bitch owes me.

27
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,606
What do you think he owes you?

28
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,113
Every damn breath in his body.

29
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,075
Why do you feel that way?

30
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,916
You don't know what he did to me.

31
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,085
You don't know.

32
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,384
Would you like to share what he did?

33
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,754
Do I have a choice?

34
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,765
We all have choices.

35
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,890
Not when some damn judge
is making me sit here.

36
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:44,859
- You know what?
- This is bullshit, okay?

37
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,411
This motherfucker torments me,
and he gets to walk away free.

38
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,038
What are you writing?

39
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,290
Just my notes.

40
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,460
And what do your notes say?

41
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,422
I'm a stereotype?

42
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,964
Is that what you think you are?

43
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,047
Hell, no!

44
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,682
Sick and tired of hearing that.

45
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,608
Every time a black woman gets mad,
she's a stereotype.

46
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,357
"Ooh, she emasculates men."

47
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,275
Is that what you think you did?

48
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,197
Bitch...

49
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,030
are you not listening to me?

50
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,448
I never did anything to him.

51
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,083
I was everything he needed me to be.

52
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,256
I was...

53
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,133
I was strong when he needed me to be.

54
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,966
I played weak when he needed me to.

55
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,139
I was pathetic.

56
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:07,440
I was...

57
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,028
Don't tell me I don't have
a right to be angry. Hmm?

58
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,906
Is that what you think I said?

59
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,243
I really don't give a damn what you said.

60
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,496
But this is wrong.

61
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,290
All of this is wrong.

62
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,247
Why don't we do this?

63
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,875
Why don't we just start from the beginning?

64
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,504
Help me understand this injustice.

65
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,384
Just tell me what happened.

66
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,896
How far back do you wanna go?

67
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,234
I remember every damn day.

68
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,689
That's the problem.

69
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,360
Can't forget it.

70
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,239
I can't get it out of my head.

71
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:02,829
So...

72
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,075
How far do you wanna go?

73
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,336
Well, let's start at the beginning.

74
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,214
Okay.

75
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,920
How'd you meet him?

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,422
It was raining.

77
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,847
<i>I was in college...</i>

78
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,934
<i>and I was studying late.</i>

79
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,269
<i>It was raining really hard.</i>

80
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,266
<i>I don't know.
Crazy shit happens to me in the rain.</i>

81
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,021
<i>Around water.</i>

82
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:37,484
<i>I was trying to get back to my dorm,
and I ran into him.</i>

83
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,191
- No!
- Damn!

84
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,112
- No, no!
- You can't watch what you're doing?

85
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,695
Move! You the idiot who bumped into me!

86
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,618
Girl, what's wrong with you?

87
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,251
Damn!

88
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,169
Hi.

89
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,845
Is Melissa here?

90
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,431
There's no Melissa here.

91
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,929
Oh, Melinda. Melinda's...

92
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,180
What do you want?

93
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,978
- Who's this?
- The asshole.

94
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,476
I'm sorry. Here.

95
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,808
I have some of your papers.

96
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,689
Great. Just great.

97
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,941
And I think you may have one or two of mine.

98
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,989
No, I don't. Sorry.

99
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:24,195
Here. Forgive her.
She's really bad at history,

100
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,075
- and she had a paper to turn in today...
- Sarah!

101
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,365
Goodbye.

102
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,912
Look, I feel really bad
about bumping into you.

103
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,586
I can be in my own head
when I'm working on a project.

104
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,205
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,459
Okay, yeah. Fine.

106
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,128
But if you don't mind now,

107
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,336
I have less than 24 hours to finish my paper.

108
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,465
So, goodbye.

109
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,551
Well, your basis is way off
in the first four pages,

110
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,178
and the facts of
the Spanish-American War are wrong.

111
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,477
And Professor Huff
will catch that in a second.

112
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,558
How do you know that?

113
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,185
I took his class last year.

114
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,942
I'm sorry for reading your first pages.

115
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,025
I got an A in his class.

116
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,569
I can help you if you'd like.

117
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,903
<i>I was so mad the first time I saw him</i>

118
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:09,034
<i>that I didn't even realize
how handsome he was.</i>

119
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,241
Please?

120
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,162
<i>He was beautiful. Gotta give him that.</i>

121
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,916
<i>The devil sure knows
how to put a package together.</i>

122
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:20,045
<i>Standing in front of me
was all the things I loved.</i>

123
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,753
<i>He was dark, sexy.</i>

124
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,051
- It was 1497.
- No.

125
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,383
Look, this is too hard for me to remember.

126
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,511
Can we take a break?

127
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,468
I don't wanna talk about this stuff anymore.

128
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,679
You don't have much time.

129
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,683
It's too much, okay?

130
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,562
I'm on a brain overload.

131
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,440
So, let's talk about you.

132
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,443
Those papers you needed, what were they?

133
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,445
Tell me.

134
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,027
I think I've found a solution
to an age-old problem.

135
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,989
I'm creating a battery
that can recharge itself.

136
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:55,246
If it works, it can be used in cars,
homes, you name it.

137
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,248
And I'm gonna be so rich.

138
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,042
While saving the environment, of course.

139
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,795
Of course.

140
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,010
<i>He was so charming.</i>

141
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,134
<i>So slick.</i>

142
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,426
<i>I just wish to high heaven</i>

143
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,261
<i>someone would have said to me
right then and there,</i>

144
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,846
<i>"Girl, get up and run as fast as you can</i>

145
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,728
<i>because this man will leave you devastated."</i>

146
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,026
How'd you do?

147
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,193
Tell me.

148
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,065
But we studied.

149
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,194
Yo, I'm sorry.

150
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,988
Let me talk to Professor Huff.
Maybe we get you a make-up.

151
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,195
No. No, okay?

152
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,201
I mean, this is all just a waste of money.

153
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,537
I can't keep doing this to my mother.

154
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,661
To be honest with you, I mean,

155
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,122
she was surprised I was even going to school.

156
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,749
I wasn't as smart as my sisters.

157
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,593
Come here.

158
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,007
Melinda.

159
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,971
Hey, what are you doing here?

160
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,475
Mama...

161
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,104
<i>My sisters came to tell me
that my mother had died.</i>

162
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,525
<i>My mother and I always been close.</i>

163
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,859
May she rest in peace. Amen.

164
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,444
<i>I was numb.</i>

165
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,996
<i>I was so desperate to feel anything.</i>

166
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,449
<i>You see, that's how this happened.</i>

167
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:19,162
<i>He was there at the right time
to take advantage of me.</i>

168
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,716
Hi.

169
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,967
I'm Brenda.

170
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,299
Hey, I'm Robert.

171
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,343
You have a last name?

172
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,513
Gayle.

173
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,345
- Hmm.
- How do you know Melinda?

174
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,724
- School.
- Oh.

175
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,729
Well, we haven't seen you around here.

176
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,898
Yeah, I'm from Kirkwood.

177
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:45,945
Oh.

178
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,823
Well, this is a different side
of the tracks for you.

179
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,117
What do you do for a living?

180
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,073
I'm in school right now.

181
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,116
Oh. That's good. That's good.

182
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,038
Yeah.

183
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,248
Well, if you don't have a job,
then who's paying for it?

184
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,042
Student loans. Scholarships.

185
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,249
That kind of thing.

186
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,252
Oh. So you must be smart.

187
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,629
Or an athlete.

188
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,095
- No, no athlete.
- No? Oh.

189
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,843
Oh. This is my boyfriend, Casey.

190
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,637
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi, man.

191
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,055
- Hey. Nice to meet you, man.
- Good to meet you, too.

192
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,848
And this is Kalvin, Brenda's fiancé.

193
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,100
- What's up, man?
- Good to meet you.

194
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,351
Good to meet you as well.

195
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,977
So what are you studying?

196
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,434
Mechanical engineering.

197
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,564
- Oh. Devon, come here.
- Hey.

198
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,982
Hey.

199
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,150
Sorry about your mom.

200
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,276
Thank you so much.

201
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,278
- How are you?
- I'm good.

202
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,985
Oh. I'm so rude. Um...

203
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,532
What's your name again?

204
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,454
Robert.

205
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,409
Robert. Robert, this is Devon.

206
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,286
Devon, this is Robert.

207
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,744
- Devon is Melinda's boyfriend.
- Nice to meet you.

208
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,872
Ex-boyfriend.

209
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,043
- You know she still loves you.
- Mmm-hmm.

210
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,091
Oh, Mel, look who came!

211
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:50,798
Hey.

212
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,091
I'm sorry about your mom.

213
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,509
Thank you.

214
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,217
Oh, uh, Devon, come with me for a second.

215
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,677
Melinda, we have to thank the pastor.

216
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,182
- You know him, right?
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.

217
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,230
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

218
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,872
Robert!

219
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,083
- Hey.
- Hey.

220
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,502
Why are you leaving so soon?

221
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,372
Well, you have your family.

222
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,172
I just wanted to make sure that you're okay.

223
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,051
Thank you.

224
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,378
Yeah.

225
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,797
Of course.

226
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,802
I'll see you later, all right?

227
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,853
Wait, where are you going?

228
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,686
To the train.

229
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,980
The train? I mean, that's a long way.

230
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,312
Did you walk here?

231
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,858
You walked here? Look, no, I can just...

232
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,065
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- I can drive you.

233
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,319
No, no, look. I'll get my keys.

234
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,112
I'll be right back, I'll drive you.

235
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,410
Mel. Melin...

236
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,126
Wow, is that your house?

237
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,379
No. That's my house.

238
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,542
You live in there?

239
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,801
Yeah.

240
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,679
Can I come in?

241
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,223
Yeah.

242
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,265
Watch your step.

243
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,315
Thank you.

244
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,196
What kind of music is this?

245
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,831
Are you kidding me?

246
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,325
What?

247
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,168
This is Nina Simone.

248
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,621
You've never heard of her?

249
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,540
No.

250
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,670
I need to play something
for you then. Hold on.

251
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,421
- I'll pass.
- No, no, no.

252
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,798
You have to hear her voice.

253
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,676
Her singing is like going to church.

254
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,094
Listen.

255
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,598
It's kind of sad.

256
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,142
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no. It's fine.

257
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,226
You can leave it on.

258
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,201
So how long have you lived here?

259
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,199
A while.

260
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,908
I know it's not much,
but my uncle left it to me,

261
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,961
and my aunt lets me stay here
in the driveway for free.

262
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,165
Where are your parents?

263
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,125
My father's in prison.

264
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,627
And my mother left me with my grandmother,

265
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,179
who raised me until she died, when I was 14.

266
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,803
Then I moved out here with my aunt,
and I've been living out here ever since.

267
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,437
I'm sorry to hear about your mother.

268
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,273
She sounded like a good lady.

269
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,195
Yeah.

270
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,782
Yeah, she was amazing.

271
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,489
You know, she...

272
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,113
It's okay.

273
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,247
Come here.

274
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,503
I'm sorry.

275
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,251
<i>There was something about
the way he said he was sorry</i>

276
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,674
<i>that made me believe it.</i>

277
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,626
<i>And the way he held me.</i>

278
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,882
<i>I know this sounds so stupid,</i>

279
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:24,091
<i>but you have to know, I was a kid.</i>

280
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,803
<i>He made me feel safe and strong and...</i>

281
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,057
You're beautiful.

282
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,229
<i>...beautiful.</i>

283
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,475
<i>My mother wasn't even cold in the ground yet,</i>

284
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,980
<i>and there I was.</i>

285
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,734
<i>What kind of man takes advantage
of a girl's grief, huh?</i>

286
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:40,815
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

287
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,697
<i>A low-life maggot of a motherfucker,
that's who.</i>

288
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,076
<i>He had to know that grief can leave you open</i>

289
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,495
<i>to not knowing yourself at all.</i>

290
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,203
<i>Add that to me being so young.</i>

291
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,089
<i>He had my mind, my heart, my head...</i>

292
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,420
<i>and, let's not forget...</i>

293
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,797
<i>my virginity.</i>

294
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,694
Oh. What are you listening to in here?

295
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,779
You never heard of Nina Simone?

296
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,659
Oh. That's Mama's music.

297
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,241
Or it's that boy's.

298
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,045
You going out with him again?

299
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,000
Yeah.

300
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,708
And I wish you would stop saying "him."

301
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:45,341
His name is Robert,
and I really like him, okay?

302
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,173
And I want you to like him, too.

303
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,759
Are you having sex with him?

304
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,972
Well, it's a fair question.

305
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,648
But what I wanna know is,

306
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,352
who's paying when
y'all going out on all these dates?

307
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:01,779
What?

308
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,115
Look, Melinda.

309
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,987
Don't tell that boy

310
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,070
that Mama left you that money and this house.

311
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,120
- I'm telling you.
- All right.

312
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,953
<i>Ugh. I hate to admit it,
but Brenda was right.</i>

313
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,669
<i>I had made the mistake
of telling Robert about the house</i>

314
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:25,049
<i>and the $350,000 that my mom left me.</i>

315
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,801
<i>But that didn't matter to him, right?</i>

316
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,557
<i>He wanted me.</i>

317
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,058
<i>Right?</i>

318
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,182
So the name of the company is called
Prescott & Howard Industries.

319
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,099
Okay.

320
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,728
And the owner, David Prescott,
is a super cool guy.

321
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,687
Man, he's always looking
for the next big thing.

322
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,564
And he's a tree-hugger billionaire

323
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,569
always talking about
saving the environment, you know?

324
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,821
So he finds people who just have great ideas

325
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,700
and he changes their lives.

326
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,200
You know, he's made millionaires
out of a lot of people

327
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,705
just by investing in their project.

328
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,081
And it's a lottery.

329
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,084
He goes through the mail and finds ideas.

330
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,837
But if he likes them,
then he contacts you for a meeting,

331
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,341
and you have to come right when he says come,

332
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,384
which is pretty cool.

333
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,341
So I send a letter to his office every week

334
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,514
talking about my battery idea.

335
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,062
You know what I call it?

336
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,728
The Gayle Wind.

337
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,227
You know, my last name. Yeah.

338
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,561
Okay, but, look.

339
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,863
So is the battery, like, that powerful?

340
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,315
Yeah.

341
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:32,200
Yeah, well, I think you should call it
Gayle Force Wind.

342
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,575
- Oh, man!
- Yeah?

343
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,032
- I like that better.
- Yeah.

344
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,207
I love that.

345
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,247
I need to write it down.

346
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,712
I'll be around to remind you.

347
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,791
You promise?

348
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,089
What, you planned on kickin' me out?

349
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,011
No.

350
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,007
Just a lot of disappointments, that's all.

351
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,059
Mmm. I won't disappoint you.

352
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,193
And I won't disappoint you.

353
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,568
We're gonna be so rich.

354
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,901
The Gayle Force Wind is gonna allow us
to live in that building right there,

355
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,531
on the top floor.

356
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,697
And we're gonna have one of those.

357
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,827
What? A tugboat?

358
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,034
No, a yacht.

359
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,955
And I will name it the <i>Mrs. Gayle.</i>

360
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,623
The <i>Mrs. Gayle?</i>

361
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,252
Yeah, I'm gonna name it after you
when we get married.

362
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,294
You're gonna be my wife forever.

363
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,427
<i>"Forever." That's what he said.</i>

364
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,185
<i>Those were his words. "Forever."</i>

365
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,220
<i>And I believed him.</i>

366
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,805
<i>I trusted him.</i>

367
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,560
<i>I was so in love with him,</i>

368
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,605
<i>I didn't see the con man for the con.</i>

369
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,732
<i>Man!</i>

370
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,900
We could have our first kid
before, like, the age of 28.

371
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,358
And then we can have one,
like, right after, so...

372
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,568
keep this body in shape.

373
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,205
A little baby, I can't wait.

374
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,957
Look, we're gonna have all the kids we want

375
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,456
because we'll have all the money we want.

376
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,290
- I sent another letter to Prescott, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

377
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,967
And I was thinking, what if he calls
and I have to wait for a bus?

378
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,554
I mean, I can just drive you when he calls.

379
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,470
What if you're not around?

380
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,471
<i>You see the game?</i>

381
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,600
<i>He had a way of not asking but suggesting</i>

382
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,059
<i>to make me think
I wanted to do things for him.</i>

383
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,686
<i>And wouldn't you know it?</i>

384
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:33,235
<i>A few days after he got the car,
the only time I talked to him</i>

385
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,283
<i>was when I called him.</i>

386
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,785
<i>One day, I waited a whole day to see
if he would call me, and he didn't.</i>

387
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,244
<i>So I waited two days,
and he still didn't call me.</i>

388
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,289
<i>Melinda...</i>

389
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:49,210
we need to tell you that now
that we're all married,

390
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,792
we're gonna be moving out.

391
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,131
- Okay.
- Thank you, babe.

392
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:58,592
So, you need to get a job
so you can keep up this place.

393
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:01,802
Yeah.

394
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,061
Okay.

395
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,058
I'll be right back.

396
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,964
<i>Hello?</i>

397
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:35,886
Hey.

398
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,968
<i>Oh. Hey, there! How are you?</i>

399
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,721
<i>"Hey, there. How are you?"</i>

400
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:45,474
<i>Wait. Wait. Why the hell
was he talking to me like that?</i>

401
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,018
I don't know. You tell me.

402
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,645
<i>Oh. Nothing, baby.</i>

403
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,814
<i>I've been working on my battery.</i>

404
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:55,444
Okay, well, you haven't
called me in two days.

405
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,610
<i>Well, you didn't call me.</i>

406
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,281
<i>I thought you were busy.</i>

407
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,488
Doing what?

408
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,822
<i>I don't know.</i>

409
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,119
<i>But, baby, I need both my hands
for this soldering.</i>

410
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,701
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

411
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,497
<i>You ever get that feeling</i>

412
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:12,832
<i>when a man is telling you something,
and you know it's bullshit,</i>

413
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,211
<i>but you just go with it?</i>

414
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,755
Yeah. Yeah.

415
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,761
<i>Well, I knew this was bullshit,
and I tried to go with it.</i>

416
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,094
<i>But as nice as I could be,</i>

417
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,146
<i>there was also another side to me
that he hadn't met yet.</i>

418
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,974
<i>If he was lying to me,</i>

419
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,481
<i>maybe it was time for me
to introduce him to my bitch.</i>

420
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,690
<i>And, I mean, she's a motherfucker.</i>

421
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,401
<i>Call it women's intuition.</i>

422
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,236
<i>I don't know. Call it whatever.</i>

423
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,823
<i>All I know is that something
made me drive over there.</i>

424
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,747
<i>Not only did I drive over there,
but the same thing that made me drive</i>

425
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:53,297
<i>told me to park across the street
and not get too close.</i>

426
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,215
<i>After sitting there for almost an hour,
I felt kind of stupid.</i>

427
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,342
<i>I was trying to talk myself</i>

428
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,844
<i>out of the voice that was deep inside myself.</i>

429
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,767
<i>That was myself.</i>

430
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,849
<i>I started thinking, "How dumb is this?</i>

431
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,393
<i>Oh, God. This looks desperate."</i>

432
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,313
<i>There I was, sitting outside
of a man's house...</i>

433
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,689
<i>well, RV...</i>

434
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,022
<i>trying to see if he's lying to me.</i>

435
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,195
<i>I already knew he was lying!</i>

436
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,364
<i>It was in my damn gut!</i>

437
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,789
<i>And here I am trying to confirm
what I already knew.</i>

438
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,328
<i>I'm not doing this.</i>

439
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,512
<i>There is something about my crazy.</i>

440
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,516
<i>It's blind.</i>

441
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,809
<i>It's not rational.</i>

442
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,061
<i>It rages. It doesn't stop.</i>

443
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,564
<i>It doesn't subside. It doesn't quit.</i>

444
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:57,771
<i>It's immediate.</i>

445
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,790
Robert, what was that?

446
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,713
I don't know. Are you okay?

447
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,976
This what you do to me?

448
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,558
- Huh?
- Give me your hand.

449
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,439
Is this what you do to me?

450
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,146
Is this what you do to me?

451
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,276
- Melinda! Melinda!
- This is what you do to me?

452
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,983
And then you lying with this bitch!

453
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:44,988
Melinda!

454
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,076
Yeah!

455
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,323
What you looking at, bitch?

456
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,656
You didn't tell me
you were in a relationship, Robert!

457
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,240
- Go!
- What you looking at? Yeah!

458
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,412
- Stop, stop! Please!
- Don't touch me!

459
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,289
- Please, what? Please, what?
- Come on, please!

460
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,332
- Please!
- Please, what?

461
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,875
Stop it. Stop it!

462
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,628
- Let go of me!
- Stop!

463
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:04,004
You're bleeding. We gotta stop the bleeding.

464
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,883
Christ. Melinda.

465
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,720
Melinda! Melinda!

466
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,051
Fuck!

467
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,764
<i>I had so much adrenaline that I didn't know</i>

468
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,272
<i>I slammed my body against
the steering wheel so hard.</i>

469
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,106
<i>Internal bleeding.</i>

470
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,940
<i>And worse, ruptured ovaries.</i>

471
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:28,277
<i>A full hysterectomy,
and I wasn't even 21 years old.</i>

472
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,577
<i>Children, never.</i>

473
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,545
No. No, no.

474
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,500
So you cheat on her, you take her money,

475
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,798
she buys you a car, and you do that?

476
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,005
You do that?

477
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,134
She better be all right.

478
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,091
That's all I know, you know?

479
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:52,722
- Hey, hey...
- Just get out!

480
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,515
Get out of here!

481
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,563
- Get out of here!
- Maybe it's best you leave.

482
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,232
You're not welcome here!

483
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,401
- Get out!
- Go.

484
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,657
I'll call you.

485
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:08,488
I'll call you.

486
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,653
How could he do this to her?

487
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,825
How could he do that to her?

488
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,124
<i>I was laid up for three weeks.</i>

489
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,993
<i>I was in so much pain.</i>

490
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,038
Melinda, you've been doing this

491
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,792
- since you were a little girl.
- Yes.

492
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,669
You get mad and nothing matters.

493
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,467
You have to stop doing that.

494
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,048
I know.

495
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:28,963
<i>I did know that.</i>

496
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,593
<i>For some reason, I couldn't control it,</i>

497
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,392
<i>any more than I could control
how I was feeling about him.</i>

498
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:38,851
<i>I soon realized that most of
my pain wasn't physical. It was...</i>

499
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:39,898
Melinda!

500
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,105
No, no, no. Look,

501
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,229
you have to let him talk to me.

502
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,985
Please? I just want to know why.

503
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,237
Baby, sometimes men don't have a why.

504
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,364
No. They just got a bunch of lies.

505
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,118
June, can you go get him for me? Please?

506
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,995
He ain't coming in here
to do nothing but lie to you.

507
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,542
He probably just broke and hungry
and needs some more money.

508
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,044
Why don't you just let him get it

509
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,468
from the whore you just caught him with, huh?

510
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,268
Can we have a moment, please?

511
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:18,895
Please?

512
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,685
We will be right on
the other side of this door.

513
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,358
Okay. All right.

514
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:25,690
Come on.

515
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,623
I'm so sorry, baby.

516
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,746
I don't even know why I was with her.

517
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,748
She didn't mean nothing to me.

518
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:43,704
Nothing.

519
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,416
It was just sex.

520
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,001
<i>And here we go.</i>

521
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,463
<i>How many times has a woman
heard this bullshit?</i>

522
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:56,392
And I felt so bad because
you been there for me.

523
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,772
I love you. Just you.

524
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,392
I'm sick without you.

525
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,776
I need you.

526
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,523
<i>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...</i>

527
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,029
<i>I promise I won't do it again.</i>

528
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,616
<i>And somehow, that shit always worked.</i>

529
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,948
<i>Until it didn't.</i>

530
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:23,497
<i>After all, he had me by a four-letter word.</i>

531
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:24,624
<i>Love.</i>

532
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,164
<i>And I did love him.</i>

533
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:31,088
<i>And that part I couldn't help,
no matter what he did.</i>

534
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,672
<i>Love is a bitch when she's chained
to a tormentor.</i>

535
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:40,261
<i>And when that tormentor is a con man,
well, what do you do?</i>

536
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,105
<i>Just wait for the next con.</i>

537
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,560
What?

538
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,687
What is it?

539
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,395
I lost my scholarship.

540
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,648
And I don't have a way of paying for it.

541
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,233
I can't get a student loan.

542
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,193
It's too late, so...

543
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,410
How much are your last two semesters?

544
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,916
<i>Yep... You heard me.</i>
<i>My dumb ass paid</i>

545
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,961
<i>for his two final semesters of school.</i>

546
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,796
<i>I was still with my man, holding him down.</i>
<i>You know?</i>

547
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,676
<i>My lying, cheating, son of a bitch of a man.</i>

548
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,303
- <i>There I was.</i>
- You sure?

549
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,186
<i>I couldn't even believe I said it.</i>

550
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,059
<i>You don't have to judge me,
I'm my own jury. Okay?</i>

551
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,395
<i>And I had already convicted
and sentenced myself.</i>

552
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,902
<i>I was guilty of stupidity.</i>

553
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,280
<i>So guess what he did</i>
<i>when I wrote that check?</i>

554
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,156
<i>You guessed it.</i>

555
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,656
<i>The bastard didn't even have a ring.</i>

556
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,824
This is temporary.

557
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,494
One day, I'm going to replace it
with three diamonds.

558
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,963
One big one in the center for our love,

559
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,836
and a yellow one on this side

560
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,214
to remind us to always look towards the sun.

561
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,131
And a chocolate one on this side
that reminds us

562
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,924
that there may be dark times ahead.

563
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,885
<i>And then I heard myself say...</i>

564
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,264
Yes!

565
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,846
Yes! Yes!

566
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:20,569
That man cheated on you and you almost died.

567
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,325
What happens when he does something
to you the next time?

568
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:24,368
There won't be...

569
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,826
No, don't say there won't be a next time.

570
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,411
That man is throwing out
all kinds of red flags,

571
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,747
and now you wanna just go and marry him?

572
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,292
I can't and I will not stand for this!

573
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,676
If you go, and you go and do that,
I won't be there!

574
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,223
I won't.

575
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,222
June.

576
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,435
- This is a mistake.
- Mmm-hmm.

577
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:51,816
<i>And yet,</i>

578
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,273
<i>there I was, walking down the aisle</i>

579
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,653
<i>with more questions in my head
than petals in my bouquet.</i>

580
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,280
<i>I couldn't help but look over
at the empty seats</i>

581
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,863
<i>where my sisters should have been sitting.</i>

582
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,697
<i>I couldn't believe they didn't come.</i>

583
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,202
<i>But I should have understood,</i>

584
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,411
<i>seeing as how I wasn't even sure
why I was there.</i>

585
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,746
<i>There was Sarah at the altar,</i>

586
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,627
<i>my maid of honor, cheering us on.</i>

587
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,798
<i>She loved the thought of us.
I guess I did, too.</i>

588
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:22,302
<i>But the thought of us was better
than the reality of us.</i>

589
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:28,020
<i>And there was Robert,
standing at the altar, smiling...</i>

590
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,103
<i>as I walked, moth to a flame.</i>

591
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:37,065
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

592
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,239
You may kiss the bride.

593
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:43,778
<i>Burned.</i>

594
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:51,331
<i>Years ticked by like seconds
on that big clock in my mother's hallway.</i>

595
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,291
<i>And with every tick,
there was a subtraction sign</i>

596
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,834
<i>from the account for something.</i>

597
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,004
<i>Something he needed,
supplies for his battery,</i>

598
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,179
<i>books for research, metals, plastics.
Always something.</i>

599
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,678
<i>And as the money got low,
so did his affection for me,</i>

600
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,512
<i>his tolerance of me,</i>

601
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,097
<i>his patience.</i>

602
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,564
<i>Damn.</i>

603
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,063
<i>Did I just say I was being tolerated?</i>

604
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,149
I need you to see this.

605
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,859
I mean, I'm worried.

606
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,570
Is this right?

607
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,238
Yeah.

608
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,656
Damn.

609
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,162
I'll get a job, babe.

610
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,619
I'll try to help out.

611
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,332
<i>"Try"?</i>

612
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,501
<i>I couldn't believe
that bastard just said "try."</i>

613
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,503
But you know it's gonna be
hard for me to study

614
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,381
and work, and work on this.

615
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,464
But I'll try. I mean, I will. I will.

616
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,387
<i>For some reason, I just smiled.</i>

617
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,679
I just need a little more time.

618
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,601
Okay.

619
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,735
- Hi, Ms. Hilderbran?
- Yes.

620
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,116
- My name is Robert Gayle.
- I know who you are.

621
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,449
Will you please stop calling
and writing letters?

622
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,996
That's not how this works.
It won't get you seen.

623
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,040
It's a lottery system for a reason.

624
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,497
I know, but could you just...

625
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,926
<i>Sarah helped me get a job
in her office as an office assistant.</i>

626
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,724
They need these by morning.

627
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,181
- Sorry.
- Sarah.

628
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,141
It's good overtime.

629
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,857
<i>I was actually working two jobs.</i>

630
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,233
<i>I would leave there</i>

631
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,156
<i>and clean offices at night.</i>

632
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,109
<i>Anything I had to do</i>

633
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,656
<i>to keep from having
to ask my sisters for anything.</i>

634
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,612
<i>I just...</i>

635
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,449
<i>I just had to get through
the next year, you know?</i>

636
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,165
<i>I thought, "Just work hard, girl,
this man loves you."</i>

637
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:09,097
Yes!

638
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,392
Yes!

639
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,611
Yes!

640
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,581
- Robert.
- Baby!

641
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,334
Robert, you have every light on
in this house.

642
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,041
The light bill was &300 last month!

643
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,462
Baby, this won't run up the light bill.

644
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,131
This is my battery working.
It's running the whole house.

645
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,175
Robert, did you talk to an electrician?

646
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,382
Why?

647
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:54,802
Oh, my God!

648
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,984
Sorry.

649
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,523
<i>Not only did he almost
burn down my mother's house,</i>

650
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,153
<i>he burned up all the wiring.</i>

651
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,533
It almost worked.

652
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:14,074
<i>Cost to repair? $37,000.</i>

653
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,201
<i>That was it.</i>

654
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,410
<i>We were in the hole.</i>

655
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,992
At least I didn't break nothing.

656
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,041
<i>Thomas Fry.</i>

657
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,375
<i>But then the day came
that I had been waiting for.</i>

658
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,089
<i>Robert Gayle.</i>

659
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,299
<i>I was so happy.</i>

660
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,057
<i>I thought for sure that the very next day,
our lives would change.</i>

661
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,064
<i>I thought all of our troubles were over.</i>

662
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,770
<i>I mean, he had three job interviews.</i>

663
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,025
<i>Each started at $150,000 a year.</i>

664
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,609
<i>I was so excited.</i>

665
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,652
<i>But...</i>

666
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,821
How could all three turn you down?

667
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,278
I mean, they recruited you.

668
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:57,247
When I was 15,

669
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,244
I was in a gang,
and we robbed a grocery store.

670
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,628
I got charged as an adult,

671
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,506
and I spent two years in jail.

672
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,210
I thought I could get it
expunged off my record

673
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,967
since I was only 15, but it's still there...

674
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,009
and no one will hire a felon.

675
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:21,516
<i>You have no idea how much
I was looking forward to a break.</i>

676
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,098
<i>Room to breathe, you know?</i>

677
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,147
<i>To relax. Let him take care of me
for a change.</i>

678
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,230
<i>But there I was, hearing this.</i>

679
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,900
<i>A felon.</i>

680
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,357
<i>And now he tells me?</i>

681
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,909
<i>This motherfucker says this to me now!</i>

682
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,282
<i>The con game. You see?</i>

683
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,326
Baby, it's not the end of the world.

684
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:41,954
Look, I have an idea.

685
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,204
I figured out all the bugs,
and now it's even better than ever.

686
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,583
I just need to get it to Prescott.

687
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,165
I know he'll love it, okay?

688
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,461
I'm still sending letters.

689
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,668
I'm going by and I'm calling.

690
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,002
And I'm gonna call his secretary.

691
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,088
I know we're low on money.

692
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,174
But I was thinking, if we mortgage the house,

693
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,095
we can pay for the rest
of my research on this

694
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,639
and make it top notch, a new design.

695
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,392
I know it'll work.

696
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,982
Okay. Mel, look at me. I know it'll work.

697
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,817
- No.
- Come on.

698
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,982
Don't stop believing in me now.

699
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,026
Please trust me.

700
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,859
It's gonna work, I know it will.

701
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,034
<i>What the hell?</i>

702
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:22,285
<i>I felt like my back was against the wall
and I had no choice, you know?</i>

703
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,037
<i>I couldn't keep doing this.</i>

704
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,664
<i>I couldn't keep working like this.</i>

705
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,706
Come on.

706
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,584
<i>So I had to fall for the con.</i>

707
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,591
<i>I was in too deep to stop and walk away.</i>

708
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,753
<i>So guess what my stupid ass did.</i>

709
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,759
<i>My mama's house.</i>

710
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:42,602
<i>A house that was paid for,
that she left to me.</i>

711
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:47,058
<i>The house that she had worked
her entire life to pay for.</i>

712
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:49,810
<i>I mortgaged it.</i>

713
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,278
Melinda!

714
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:04,283
<i>Working to keep my sisters
from knowing what I had done.</i>

715
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,665
<i>And every time I would see him
sleeping in the bed</i>

716
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,667
<i>when I was headed to one of my two jobs,</i>

717
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,624
<i>I would get mad, you know?</i>

718
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,459
<i>I would get resentful.</i>

719
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,597
<i>And this was my routine every day.</i>

720
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:27,056
<i>To the bastard's credit,
he did get odd jobs from time to time.</i>

721
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,184
<i>But they...</i>

722
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,768
<i>They didn't even cover the utilities
most of the time.</i>

723
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:36,568
<i>How do two people live through two decades
and miss everything?</i>

724
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,446
<i>Every moment of it?</i>

725
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,613
<i>I'll tell you how.</i>

726
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,115
<i>You just feel trapped.</i>

727
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,536
<i>But fuck that. This trap wouldn't destroy me.</i>

728
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,242
<i>Or did it?</i>

729
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,629
<i>One of the saddest parts
of our lives was that</i>

730
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,752
<i>we were just existing.</i>

731
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,254
<i>No coloring outside of the lines,
no excitement,</i>

732
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,964
<i>no birth of a child to mark our age,</i>

733
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:04,597
<i>or his or her first step,
or his or her graduation.</i>

734
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,514
<i>Nothing to be a mile-marker
for the years that were passing.</i>

735
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,807
<i>There were no warning signs.</i>

736
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,235
<i>Eighteen years seemed to pass like days.</i>

737
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,234
<i>How does that happen?</i>

738
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:30,501
Diana.

739
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,625
Wow. You look great.

740
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,082
Robert Gayle.

741
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,086
How have you been?

742
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,254
I've been good.

743
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,547
God, I haven't seen you since...

744
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,129
Yeah, yeah.

745
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,183
She destroyed your RV.

746
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,096
I don't blame her though.

747
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,389
You should have been honest.

748
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,687
We were kids.

749
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,560
No, but you lied to me also, Robert.
I didn't know about her.

750
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,354
Yeah, I know, I know, I'm sorry.

751
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,778
Anyway, whatever happened to her?

752
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,025
I married her.

753
00:39:59,105 --> 00:39:59,947
Okay.

754
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,861
So what are you doing here?

755
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,363
Yeah, well, get this.

756
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:06,696
I've been sending letters to Prescott here
for years, telling him about my battery.

757
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,531
You remember, in school,
what I was working on?

758
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,621
No, sorry, I don't.

759
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,704
Well, anyway, I've been trying to get
a meeting with him,

760
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,834
and I found out that Ms. Hilderbran retired

761
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,291
and that you took her place...

762
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,420
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Mmm-hmm.

763
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,128
So I figured this must be God
helping me out, you know?

764
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,724
No, it's not God. I can't help you.

765
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,596
What? Why?

766
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:31,180
No, I can't. We have new policies now
about receiving information.

767
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,889
But look, Robert, it was really...

768
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,599
It was nice to see you.

769
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,939
Can I take you for a coffee sometime,
maybe catch up?

770
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,987
Yeah, sure, if you invite your wife.

771
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,108
Look, I do not cheat on my wife.

772
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,362
I don't do that.

773
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,738
This is strictly business.

774
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,365
I can't help you.

775
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:48,783
- Look, I know.
- I'm sorry.

776
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,740
I know, I understand. I just...

777
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,702
I just need some advice, that's all.

778
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,508
Okay, look. Here's my card.

779
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,756
I usually grab coffee at Q & A

780
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,384
on 52nd Street in the mornings
at about 7:00 a.m.

781
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,842
- If you happen to be there...
- Yeah.

782
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,428
...then maybe we can talk, okay?

783
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,933
Okay, thanks. Maybe I'll catch you there.

784
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:14,855
Okay.

785
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,779
Carly, can you get me the file
on Robert Gayle?

786
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,235
You want the file on the psycho

787
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,488
who's been sending letters here
since before I was born?

788
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,990
That's what I said.

789
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,247
Sure.

790
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,456
Thank you.

791
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,508
Hello?

792
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,005
<i>Robert Gayle?</i>

793
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:45,086
Yeah.

794
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,591
<i>My name is Melvin White.</i>

795
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,390
<i>I'm the head of security
for Prescott & Howard Industries.</i>

796
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:50,845
<i>I'm calling to inform you</i>

797
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,514
<i>that you've been put into our system
as a credible threat.</i>

798
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,308
<i>You are not to send
another letter to our office,</i>

799
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:58,061
<i>nor contact or visit
any one of our employees.</i>

800
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,769
<i>You're not to come within
300 yards of our campus.</i>

801
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,276
<i>If you come near the building again,
you will be arrested.</i>

802
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:09,994
Fuck!

803
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,197
Damn it!

804
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,004
What happened?

805
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,592
They won't see me.

806
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,844
Prescott. They won't see me!

807
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,551
Okay? They won't!

808
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,810
All these years wasted!

809
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,611
Damn it. I wanted this for us, baby.

810
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,989
I wanted it to work for us.

811
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,747
I wanted to get you that ring.

812
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:58,413
The apartment, the boat, the private jet.

813
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,336
I wanted you to have it all.

814
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,043
I wanted you to have it all.

815
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,591
Have you ever asked me what I wanted?

816
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,889
I just want you to get a job,

817
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,567
help me out consistently, that's all.

818
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:29,570
Now that we know this battery
is not going to work...

819
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,786
we can put it away, okay?

820
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,908
Because that's over.

821
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,160
That's it.

822
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,459
Move on. Let's just move on.

823
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,415
Okay?

824
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:44,039
I know this could work.

825
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,795
Please.

826
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,174
Please.

827
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,511
Please. Come on.

828
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,592
Just a job.

829
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:56,801
Okay?

830
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:58,769
Yeah.

831
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,308
I'll find the best job I can.

832
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,279
Baby.

833
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,244
If you give up on me now, I got nothing left.

834
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:23,999
Tell me you love me.

835
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,584
I love you.

836
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:32,219
I do.

837
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,638
But I'm so tired.

838
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,220
I'm so tired.

839
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,306
<i>Go, go. It's recording.</i>

840
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,854
<i>Hi, my name is Robert Gayle,
and this is my wife, Mel.</i>

841
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,232
<i>Hi, I'm Melinda Gayle.</i>

842
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:52,191
<i>And we are excited to show you
my new invention!</i>

843
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:55,277
<i>It's called the Gayle Force Wind.</i>

844
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,362
<i>And it's powering this room right now.</i>

845
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,665
Melinda?

846
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,085
Melinda?

847
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,212
Hey.

848
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,300
Did you know this house
was about to be foreclosed on?

849
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,057
Did you?

850
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,179
That damn Audra at the bank.

851
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,603
She's not supposed to be telling my business.

852
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,438
Mel, that's our cousin.

853
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,268
Did you know this house
was about to be foreclosed on?

854
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,438
Yeah, I was just getting
my battery ready for...

855
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,235
We all know about that damn battery.

856
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,611
That shit ain't never gonna work.

857
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:36,818
It's a joke.

858
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,532
Get a job and help her.

859
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,576
- Baby, that's enough, okay?
- Yes, Brenda, stop it.

860
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,033
We need to be able to talk about this.

861
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,288
Melinda, this is Mama's house.

862
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:46,914
We grew up here.

863
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,167
And you mortgaged it for him?

864
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,043
His ass needs a job.

865
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,296
Why are you putting up with this shit, huh?

866
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,672
- Why?
- Brenda, let up...

867
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,004
Move, Kalvin.

868
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:00,008
The things our daddy did to keep this house.

869
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,094
And you gonna lose it?

870
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:03,848
I knew this would happen.

871
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,725
- Okay, okay. Listen.
- I knew it.

872
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,852
We know the problem,
and we know you don't have the money.

873
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,353
So Audra told you that, too?

874
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,731
Mel, we're trying to help you.
Just listen. We have a plan.

875
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,814
Babe, tell her the plan.

876
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:18,070
Look, Kalvin and I went to the owners
of one of the restaurants we deliver for.

877
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,615
He will advance us money
for future deliveries

878
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,072
three weeks at a time.

879
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,782
But if we mess this up,
he'll take our trucks.

880
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,913
I do not like this at all.

881
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,831
Baby, it's all right.
We're just trying to help.

882
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,750
We worked our asses off for those trucks.

883
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:31,957
Baby, stop!

884
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:33,799
Just listen.

885
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,461
Look, man.

886
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:40,177
All we need you to do is help us
keep the requirements, all right?

887
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:44,013
You gotta drive and you gotta
be on time to his chains.

888
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,220
That's all.

889
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:47,642
We can get this paid back in, like,
three months.

890
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:48,849
But you can't be late.

891
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,685
You can't miss a delivery or a pickup,
or we'll lose everything.

892
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,019
Everything!

893
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,856
- And we can't pay you.
- And we shouldn't do it.

894
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,737
He don't give a damn about nothing
and nobody but himself.

895
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,864
Look, promise us that you'll do this, Robert.

896
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,947
And you'll do this right.

897
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,282
Promise us.

898
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:11,670
Yeah.

899
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,672
I'm in.

900
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,170
See, he's in.

901
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,844
I'll see you at the lot
at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.

902
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,304
I'm there.

903
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:22,718
And I'm changing the locks.

904
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,512
Mel, we're just trying to help.

905
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:25,638
Mmm-hmm.

906
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:27,181
She gotta want to help herself.

907
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,262
You're right.

908
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,308
- Have a good night.
- 6:00 a.m.

909
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,061
He'll be there. Just go.

910
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:40,158
You know why I know how you don't
love me the same?

911
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,450
You didn't even try to defend me.

912
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:53,087
<i>That bastard actually said that to me.</i>

913
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,839
<i>He actually said that.</i>

914
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,041
<i>Another morning.</i>

915
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,543
<i>No kiss, no hug.</i>

916
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,173
Good morning.

917
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,173
<i>Another night of him sleeping downstairs.</i>

918
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,973
<i>At first, I was sad about it.</i>

919
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,892
<i>Then I started to get mad.</i>

920
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,182
<i>It's good.</i>

921
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,726
Right? I mean, it's good.
At least he's working.

922
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,024
Yeah, right.

923
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,230
He's so mad at me, though.

924
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,402
- Is he?
- Yeah.

925
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,318
He's not touching me.

926
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:04,150
He sleeps downstairs.

927
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:05,654
We haven't had sex in months.

928
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:06,735
Really?

929
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,282
Yeah, it's like we're roommates.

930
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,912
Well... Hey. At least
he's a roommate with a job.

931
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,704
Right.

932
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,785
Yep.

933
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,087
But I know that man.

934
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,753
And he is very sexual.

935
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,878
So if he's not getting it from me,
he's getting it from somewhere.

936
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,804
No, Mel, no.

937
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,216
I don't believe that, not for one second.

938
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,093
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

939
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:33,976
I'm sure. He learned his lesson
before y'all got married.

940
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,056
Okay.

941
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:41,020
If he's cheating, he better pray to God
that I don't find out.

942
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,401
Yeah, for all our sakes.

943
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,403
- Stop it.
- You a little crazy.

944
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,076
- Hey!
- You know it.

945
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,450
<i>I love my wife.</i>

946
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,251
<i>And I just wanna do so much for her.</i>

947
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,124
<i>She's done so much for me.</i>

948
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:03,379
<i>And if you can find the time to just
take a look at the Gayle Force Wind,</i>

949
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:07,007
<i>it will truly, truly change this planet.</i>

950
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,427
<i>The Gayle Force Wind.</i>

951
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,931
<i>The Gayle Force Wind.</i>
<i>The Gayle Force Wind.</i>

952
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:20,769
Hey, they need this delivery
by 11:00 am this morning.

953
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,398
- It's a big one.
- Okay.

954
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:24,606
They're having a corporate luncheon
or something like that.

955
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,113
All the execs will be there,
and they need this fish fresh.

956
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,655
And he likes it an hour before they open.

957
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,826
Okay.

958
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,283
It's our biggest client,
so you can't be late.

959
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,037
- Okay.
- Look, man...

960
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,539
you've been killing it around here.

961
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,207
All right. Keep up the good work.

962
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,789
And don't worry about the Moore sisters.

963
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,670
They're just close.

964
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,960
Yeah.

965
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,340
Yeah, I know.

966
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,473
Hey.

967
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,935
So, I see. You just not
gonna say nothing to him?

968
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,314
Not a damn thing.

969
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:06,239
I just need him to work,
like all of us have to do.

970
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:14,114
Let me see, 9 times 16.

971
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,285
Let's see here.

972
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,455
Let's see here.

973
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:23,539
27...

974
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,382
2...

975
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:27,668
Okay.

976
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:30,884
What is this?

977
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,600
<i>Hi, Mr. Prescott. My name is Robert Gayle.</i>

978
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:43,688
<i>I invented this battery, Gayle Force Wind.</i>

979
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:46,980
<i>I would appreciate it</i>

980
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,065
<i>if you would consider reviewing my materials.</i>

981
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:50,110
<i>Thank you.</i>

982
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,988
Are you still watching those videos?

983
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,028
Yeah.

984
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,412
Is Prescott in yet?

985
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,168
Let me check.

986
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:14,639
Yeah.

987
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,509
<i>Hey, man. It's 9:30.</i>

988
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,639
Just wanted to be sure
you're gonna be there at 11:00.

989
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:19,561
<i>Yeah.</i>

990
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,185
I'm tracking you. It's a lot of traffic.

991
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,983
Yeah. I'm close.

992
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,651
You the man.

993
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,440
<i>I'll call you when it's done.</i>

994
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,362
Okay.

995
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:42,202
Look, the last letter I sent was
the morning before you called.

996
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,536
You must have just gotten it.

997
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,165
I won't send another.
I won't call your office.

998
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,543
Plus, I threw the battery out,
so no need to threaten me.

999
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:48,794
<i>Well, that's too bad.</i>

1000
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,878
<i>I saw your research. It's brilliant.</i>

1001
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,963
<i>I've shown it to Mr. Prescott.</i>

1002
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:55,009
Oh, my God.

1003
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:59,430
<i>He wants to meet with you today at 11:30,
but if you've thrown out the prototype...</i>

1004
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,763
No, no, no. I have it, I have it.

1005
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:02,808
<i>Can you make it at 11:30?</i>

1006
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:03,980
11:30.

1007
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,684
Does it have to be today?

1008
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,895
<i>Robert, you're joking, right?</i>

1009
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:14,194
Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes.
I'll be there. I'll be there.

1010
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,072
<i>Okay, I'll see you then.</i>

1011
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,114
Oh, shit.

1012
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:43,933
- Kalvin!
- Yo.

1013
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,224
Check this out, man.

1014
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,607
Where's he going?

1015
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,313
Shit.

1016
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:55,824
He's not pickin' up.

1017
00:53:58,819 --> 00:53:59,661
Babe.

1018
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:01,075
<i>Hey, Kalvin.</i>

1019
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:02,242
Yeah, you're not gonna believe this.

1020
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,619
- <i>What's up?</i>
- Where you at?

1021
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,201
- <i>I'm going to Mel's.</i>
- You with Melinda?

1022
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:06,411
<i>No. Not yet. What?</i>

1023
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,995
- It looks like he's heading to her house.
- <i>What?</i>

1024
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,750
Yeah. Meet us over there, all right?

1025
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,168
- <i>All right.</i>
- All right. Love you.

1026
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,249
Come on, man.

1027
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:13,717
Come on.

1028
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,087
Hey! Hey!

1029
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:48,460
Hey!

1030
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,250
Hey, hey, hey!

1031
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,501
Sorry, sorry.

1032
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:54,670
I need that, I need that, I need that.

1033
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,796
- That?
- Yeah, yeah.

1034
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:56,843
Of course.

1035
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,886
- Hey, Mel.
- Mmm-hmm.

1036
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:08,977
Mel, honey, your sisters are here.

1037
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,609
This can't be good.

1038
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,570
<i>Do you know what the last thing
a woman wants to hear about her man?</i>

1039
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,071
<i>It's that he's cheating on her.</i>

1040
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,903
Wait up, I'm coming.

1041
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,952
<i>And the last person in the world
she wants to hear that shit from</i>

1042
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,660
<i>is the damn family member
who told her he would.</i>

1043
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,849
Hey, baby, you're not gonna believe this!

1044
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,225
The fuck is wrong with you, man?

1045
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,852
You're gonna cost us our biggest client!

1046
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:53,309
- Where the keys?
- Let me show you, man.

1047
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,105
- Right here.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

1048
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,188
- You trying to destroy us?
- Look, I'm sorry!

1049
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,399
- Let it go, man.
- I'm sorry, man.

1050
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,080
Hey, baby, you're not gonna believe this.

1051
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,084
But they called...
They called about the battery.

1052
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,579
Prescott called, baby.

1053
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:14,754
What is this?

1054
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,590
Why was her wallet in your truck?

1055
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:23,218
What?

1056
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,312
After all these years,

1057
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:34,895
you still messin' around with her,
aren't you? Hmm?

1058
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,147
- After all we've been through, Robert?
- No. Baby, no.

1059
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,195
Baby, no. I promise you. Listen.

1060
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,773
I saw her.

1061
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,945
It must've fallen out in the truck.

1062
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:46,370
Why was she in your truck, Robert?

1063
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:48,956
Listen, listen.

1064
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,034
Listen, I gotta go.

1065
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:55,082
- You gotta go?
- I promise you it isn't... Listen.

1066
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:57,376
I will explain everything
when I get back, okay?

1067
00:56:57,456 --> 00:57:00,710
Robert, if you walk out of that door,
there is no coming back.

1068
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:04,547
Prescott called me.
I have to go. I have to go.

1069
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,553
So you're just gonna leave?

1070
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,809
You're just gonna leave?

1071
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,476
Where you goin', huh?

1072
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,895
Where you goin'? Where you goin'?

1073
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,188
Baby, I need my keys!

1074
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,690
You ain't getting a damn thing!

1075
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,691
What, you just gonna just leave?

1076
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,273
Baby, I gotta go. Give me the keys!

1077
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:24,069
No! Take 'em.

1078
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,901
Take 'em. Please, take 'em.

1079
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,611
I can call the cops,
I'll have your ass arrested.

1080
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,782
- Take 'em!
- Damn it, baby!

1081
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,200
You don't understand! I need to see Prescott!

1082
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,326
What? Her?

1083
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,328
- No!
- After all these years...

1084
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:36,378
Baby, I didn't do anything! Baby...

1085
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:39,290
Baby! Mel!

1086
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:41,667
Get off of me. Get off of me!

1087
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:45,926
- Get your hands off of me!
- Mel, stop!

1088
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,133
- Mel, you need to stop!
- No!

1089
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,013
- Stop it!
- Melinda!

1090
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:52,686
- Give me the damn keys!
- Melin...

1091
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,515
Get off of her! Get off of her!

1092
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,269
Get your ass off of my sister!

1093
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,441
- No!
- Get off of me so I can...

1094
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:04,524
Get off of me! Don't let him go!

1095
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,109
- Come on! Help me!
- Don't let him go!

1096
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,364
Don't let him go!

1097
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,492
Don't let him go! You're letting him go!

1098
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,533
Why are you letting him go?

1099
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,414
You better not come back!

1100
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,498
- Go!
- Don't let him go!

1101
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,674
Help me, June. Get her up here. Go!

1102
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:34,519
Damn it.

1103
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,599
Robert.

1104
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:19,101
What a way to make
the wrong first impression.

1105
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,978
- You look terrible.
- I'm sorry.

1106
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:24,062
Gonna be hard to convince people
you're not crazy looking like this.

1107
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,566
Follow me, come on.

1108
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,705
Are you okay?

1109
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:40,786
Robert...

1110
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:42,708
My wife...

1111
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:44,665
You're melting down.

1112
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,213
You left this in my truck.

1113
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:49,344
Robert, did you steal my wallet?

1114
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,714
You left it in my truck.

1115
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,513
No, Robert. Is this what this is about?

1116
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,306
Did she find it?

1117
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,229
I'm so sorry.

1118
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,979
I got nothing left. Okay? I got nothing left.

1119
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,565
Yeah, I risked everything
for this meeting with Prescott, okay?

1120
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:07,983
And I'm not even sure if I can do this.

1121
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:11,236
Look... Look at me, Robert! Look at me.

1122
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,319
If this is as good as your research suggests

1123
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,865
then your dreams have come true.

1124
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:18,160
Now you need to put the personal shit aside

1125
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,992
and you go in there and you own that room.

1126
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:21,959
You got me?

1127
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,248
Come on, let's go.

1128
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:28,966
Leave that.

1129
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:51,782
Mr. Prescott, this is Robert Gayle.

1130
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,571
The persistent Mr. Gayle.

1131
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,615
Like a gale force wind.

1132
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:58,322
All right. Let's hear this pitch.

1133
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,374
What happened? Did we make it in time?

1134
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:07,421
No.

1135
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:08,999
So we're gonna lose our trucks?

1136
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,463
- We can keep the trucks.
- We lost him as a client.

1137
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,298
He won't give us the money for this house.

1138
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,348
It's gonna be okay, baby.

1139
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,189
Is she okay?

1140
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:28,276
No.

1141
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:30,691
<i>I wasn't.</i>

1142
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,032
<i>I was in that place that scares me.</i>

1143
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,327
<i>That place between present and furious.</i>

1144
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,696
<i>I had lost all rhyme and reason.</i>

1145
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:43,078
<i>It's like nothing mattered but getting even.</i>

1146
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:46,456
<i>I was told I get it from my daddy,
but his was quiet.</i>

1147
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,537
<i>Mine...</i>

1148
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:51,044
<i>I would burn a whole house down with me in it</i>

1149
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,468
<i>to get to the motherfucker
that done me wrong.</i>

1150
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:57,551
...and the lipo and nickel,
and the Gayle Force Wind...

1151
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,383
Okay, I've heard enough.

1152
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,514
Our team has received your research.

1153
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:05,564
They believe it can work,
even though you don't have a prototype.

1154
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:10,687
We wanna offer you &800,000 today

1155
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:14,985
for all your notes and research,
and any plans that you have.

1156
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:18,035
You will have to sign
a non-compete, of course.

1157
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,695
$800,000. Um...

1158
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:26,205
You wanna buy... Buy my work?

1159
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:27,873
Yes.

1160
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,709
That's how this goes.

1161
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:34,213
We are prepared to write you a check today.

1162
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,461
Um...

1163
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,636
No offense, Mr. Prescott...

1164
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,969
I have no intentions of selling my work.

1165
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:49,728
I wanna own my copyrights
and license it to you for a term.

1166
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:54,109
When this thing hits the market,
it will bring billions to your firm.

1167
01:02:56,273 --> 01:03:00,153
I only think it's right for me
to participate in that upside.

1168
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:04,957
Yes. But I would be taking all the risk
and spending all the money to perfect it.

1169
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:09,789
$800,000 is my offer to you, Mr. Gayle.

1170
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,712
And it's not changing.

1171
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:14,924
Take it or leave it.

1172
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,216
Um...

1173
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,012
I'm gonna have to say no.

1174
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,772
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

1175
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:35,855
Sure. Okay.

1176
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:41,702
- Well, thank you.
- Sorry, Mr. Prescott.

1177
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,303
Robert. Robert!

1178
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,513
Wait, Robert!

1179
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,060
There's no way I can take that deal.

1180
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,143
- It's a lot of money...
- Not for him.

1181
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:16,861
This is my life.

1182
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,658
What did I do?

1183
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:25,866
I'm sorry.

1184
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:29,157
Robert, I'm sorry,
especially about the wallet.

1185
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,787
Robert. Robert.

1186
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,808
Look, first let me just say this.

1187
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,937
I did not do anything with Diana.

1188
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:58,020
I found out that she worked at Prescott,

1189
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:01,281
and we went out for coffee
to talk business, and that was it.

1190
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,778
And she got into the truck because her daddy

1191
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,701
was some kind of driver
or something like that.

1192
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:08,700
And her... Her wallet fell out of her purse.

1193
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:11,158
Look, listen, I know it makes no damn sense,

1194
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,834
but it's the truth.

1195
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:21,380
And the reason why
I didn't make the deliveries

1196
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,299
because Prescott called me, baby,

1197
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,595
to see the battery.

1198
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:31,140
They offered me $800,000.

1199
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,184
And he was ready to write that check today.

1200
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,938
And I'm sure if I had a prototype,
it would have been a lot more.

1201
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:41,022
$800,000 today?

1202
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:43,940
- Yeah.
- You need to take the money.

1203
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,278
Look, I can't.

1204
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,486
There is no damn money. He lying.

1205
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,363
Baby...

1206
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:56,081
- Can we talk by ourselves?
- Sure.

1207
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:57,288
Sure.

1208
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,882
Just let me understand this.

1209
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:07,506
Some random bitch
that I caught you with before

1210
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:10,642
just happens to be in your truck

1211
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:13,303
and leaves her wallet?

1212
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:18,354
This house is getting foreclosed on.

1213
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:24,531
And you turned down an $800,000 check

1214
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,319
that Mr. Prescott

1215
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:29,486
was gonna write you today?

1216
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,326
Is this the bullshit you selling me?

1217
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,577
Baby, this is not bullshit.

1218
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,995
Then call him and take the offer.

1219
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,122
It's not a good offer.

1220
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,708
- It's not a good offer, baby.
- "It's not a good offer."

1221
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:43,007
So I just lose my mother's house?

1222
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,421
Baby, I'll buy you a bigger house.

1223
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,097
As a matter of fact,

1224
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:54,678
we're gonna live in a high-rise building
overlooking the city.

1225
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,764
And that diamond...

1226
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,020
I'm gonna get you.

1227
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,321
And the <i>Mrs. Gayle,</i> private jet.

1228
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,068
We're gonna make it, baby.

1229
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,194
This is it.

1230
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,696
No, we're not.

1231
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:13,579
No, we're not gonna make it.

1232
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:16,908
You had a good woman.

1233
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,169
I would do anything for you.

1234
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:25,466
And I did.

1235
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:28,969
And you lie

1236
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:32,637
and you cheat on me.

1237
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,141
You're a motherfucking loser.

1238
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:45,737
Don't talk to me like that, baby, please.

1239
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:50,238
I'm done with you. I'm done.

1240
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:54,905
I need you to get your shit while you can,
and I need you to get out.

1241
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,248
I want a divorce.

1242
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,246
Mel...

1243
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:02,790
Mel, please.

1244
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,747
- No.
- Mel, I love you.

1245
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:05,707
Please.

1246
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:07,712
You're really gonna do this?

1247
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,921
Why don't you go find that bitch
and let her take you in?

1248
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:12,256
- Get out.
- Mel.

1249
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,262
Get out!

1250
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,431
Come on, man. You should leave.

1251
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:21,856
I'm not leaving.

1252
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,320
You know me.

1253
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:35,120
You know I can be the motherfucking devil.

1254
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:31,337
<i>Three months later, I lost my mama's house.</i>

1255
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,091
<i>You know, that bastard didn't
even call to see if I was okay.</i>

1256
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,303
<i>He didn't even bother.</i>

1257
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,100
<i>He was done with me.</i>

1258
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,179
<i>He had gotten all he could.</i>

1259
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:47,066
<i>I guess he was off looking
for his next victim.</i>

1260
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,897
<i>Not caring that I was devastated.</i>

1261
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:53,026
<i>I can't believe I let that son of a bitch...</i>

1262
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:55,359
<i>Damn.</i>

1263
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:14,044
<i>I was humiliated.</i>

1264
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,345
<i>I had to move in with my sister.</i>

1265
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:22,597
<i>At this age, living with my sister?</i>

1266
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:25,431
<i>All I needed was a bunch of damn cats.</i>

1267
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:26,480
<i>Fuck him!</i>

1268
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:58,471
Who the hell took my damn phone?

1269
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:04,305
<i>I had wasted too many years with Robert.</i>

1270
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:07,389
<i>Too many years feeling lonely
whenever he was around.</i>

1271
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:10,934
<i>Thought it was time for me to move on,
and so did Brenda.</i>

1272
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:15,026
<i>So she wasted no time trying to
get me hooked up with Devon.</i>

1273
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,733
<i>She heard that he was divorced.</i>

1274
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:22,696
<i>So, much to my disapproval,
she called him up and we went out.</i>

1275
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:27,993
<i>My divorce wasn't even final,
but what the hell?</i>

1276
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:32,880
<i>So there I was, out with a man.</i>

1277
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:35,211
<i>A man that could pay the check</i>

1278
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,919
<i>and who commanded attention
when he walked into the room.</i>

1279
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,299
<i>All eyes on him.</i>

1280
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:42,469
<i>And yet, it felt strange.</i>

1281
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:45,176
<i>It felt foreign. It felt wrong.</i>

1282
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,387
<i>It... It was like I was starting over</i>

1283
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:50,690
<i>and learning how things
were really supposed to be.</i>

1284
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:54,645
<i>And I thought about Robert from time to time.</i>

1285
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:57,400
<i>Sometimes with sympathy
but mostly with anger.</i>

1286
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,029
<i>Especially when I looked up and saw his ass.</i>

1287
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:04,117
<i>There he was in the damn kitchen,
washing dishes.</i>

1288
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:09,201
<i>All that money I wasted helping him,
and his ass is in the damn kitchen?</i>

1289
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:10,626
<i>Of all restaurants!</i>

1290
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:13,003
<i>I got mad all over again.</i>

1291
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:19,712
<i>I wanted my $1,234,908.07</i>

1292
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:22,673
<i>And that's with him
paying me back every dime,</i>

1293
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:25,429
<i>and then half of all
the bills for all those years.</i>

1294
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:29,683
<i>Looks like his ass will be washing
a lot of dishes to pay me back.</i>

1295
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,056
<i>Fuck it, I'll cut my losses.</i>

1296
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,436
<i>Just give me a divorce.</i>

1297
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:42,863
Sorry I'm late.

1298
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:49,702
It's a family divorce, I see.

1299
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:52,167
She wanted us here.

1300
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,711
Is your lawyer here, Mr. Gayle?

1301
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:58,085
I can't afford a lawyer.

1302
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,634
No, you can't, working as a dishwasher.

1303
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,883
Ma'am, you're a guest in this mediation.

1304
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:04,964
Please.

1305
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,677
Mel, are you sure you wanna do this?

1306
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:12,180
I still love you so much.

1307
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:13,397
I do.

1308
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:17,611
We're prepared to let you
have the car and your clothes.

1309
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,316
No, no. You keep it.

1310
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,649
Keep it all. Everything.
I don't want anything.

1311
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:26,034
I just wanna say this and I'm done...

1312
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:31,787
Mel, I am so sorry that
I couldn't be what you needed.

1313
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:33,872
But I...

1314
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:39,337
I never cheated on you again,
after I saw what it did to you.

1315
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,253
I found out what love is

1316
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:46,590
for the first time in my life because of you.

1317
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:52,388
I can honestly say with all my heart
that I love you.

1318
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,145
I will always love you, Mel.

1319
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:03,322
I'm sorry.

1320
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:08,778
I'm sorry, Mel.

1321
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:14,834
Please, Mel, just...

1322
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:16,961
Just look at me.

1323
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:55,408
Well...

1324
01:14:56,742 --> 01:15:00,372
At least you don't have to
give that bastard another thing.

1325
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:17,729
Hello?

1326
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,188
- Hello?
- <i>Hello.</i>

1327
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:24,065
Where the hell have you been?

1328
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:26,108
<i>Someone stole my phone. Sorry.</i>

1329
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:27,652
<i>I've been trying to reach you all week.</i>

1330
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:28,699
I'm sorry.

1331
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,527
<i>So Victor called.</i>

1332
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:32,987
<i>He said that you called him
to represent you in the deal.</i>

1333
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,618
If there's ever a deal.

1334
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,992
Prescott will come back, okay?
You'll see.

1335
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:40,373
<i>Just keep your fingers crossed.</i>

1336
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,917
<i>Hey, I asked Victor for your home address
or your phone number,</i>

1337
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:45,500
and he said he had
to wait for you to call him.

1338
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,586
<i>What's going on, Robert?</i>

1339
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:50,257
I'm just... I'm just...

1340
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:53,056
We're just between places right now.

1341
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:55,722
Robert, did she put you out?

1342
01:15:58,262 --> 01:15:59,639
Um...

1343
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:03,229
We're... We're divorced now.

1344
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:05,398
<i>I've been staying in the Genesis Shelter</i>

1345
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:09,568
<i>on 4th for the past three months,</i>
<i>and I'm just</i>...

1346
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:10,820
I'm coming to get you.

1347
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:11,867
<i>No, Diana.</i>

1348
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:20,994
You okay, baby?

1349
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:22,169
She is fine.

1350
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,126
More champagne?

1351
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:27,967
She's celebrating her divorce.

1352
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:32,380
But my favorite part

1353
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:36,134
is when that bastard said
how much he loved her.

1354
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:38,769
I almost threw up.

1355
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:43,225
You know, I never thought
he was lying to you, Mel.

1356
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:44,854
I always believed he loved you.

1357
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,857
You would, but she didn't.

1358
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,316
<i>I did believe him.</i>

1359
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,239
<i>I even felt sorry for him.</i>

1360
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:53,821
<i>What is that about us as women?</i>

1361
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:56,825
<i>Why do we feel bad
when we didn't do shit, huh?</i>

1362
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,699
<i>And yet, there I was feeling bad about him,</i>

1363
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,954
<i>feeling sad that he never made it.</i>

1364
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,456
<i>That he was a dishwasher.</i>

1365
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:05,375
<i>Why the hell should I care?</i>

1366
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:07,794
<i>So you know what I did?</i>

1367
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:11,545
<i>I got that tall, sexy thing
standing over there</i>

1368
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,299
<i>to take my mind off it.</i>

1369
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:14,925
Can we go back to your place?

1370
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,382
- Now?
- Yeah.

1371
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:17,845
So sorry.

1372
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:20,019
- Good night, folks. I'm outta here.
- Go on, Devon. It was nice to see you.

1373
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,059
- Get home safe.
- Brenda.

1374
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:24,474
Babe, wait up.

1375
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,985
This will do you good.

1376
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:35,283
Thanks.

1377
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:37,703
Sure.

1378
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,120
You should have told me
you were in a shelter.

1379
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:46,999
It doesn't matter.

1380
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,709
Robert, I know you're upset
that you lost your wife,

1381
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:54,170
but listen to me.

1382
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:58,136
It's okay.

1383
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:03,395
Sometimes things just happen, you know?

1384
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,610
I'm a firm believer that when

1385
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,229
someone falls out of your life maybe...

1386
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:14,990
Maybe they're supposed to.

1387
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:19,196
Maybe they're not supposed to share
the level that you're going to.

1388
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:24,333
Maybe you're supposed to leave them behind.

1389
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,957
I hate seeing you this broken, this defeated.

1390
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:36,216
You're a good man, Robert. You are.

1391
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,349
And you're gonna be okay.

1392
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,012
I know that you'll be okay.

1393
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:53,271
<i>Devon was just okay in bed,
but he wasn't Robert.</i>

1394
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:56,026
<i>Robert mastered my body.</i>

1395
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:57,069
<i>He knew my curves.</i>

1396
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,743
<i>He knew how I liked it slightly to the left.</i>

1397
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,788
<i>Robert would at least try to hold me.</i>

1398
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,327
<i>And the thought of him
being with another woman</i>

1399
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:06,996
<i>still made me jealous.</i>

1400
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:08,164
Good night.

1401
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:09,665
<i>You know what I found out?</i>

1402
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,585
<i>The truth always comes when a man comes.</i>

1403
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:14,461
<i>When Devon was finished, he was done.</i>

1404
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:15,542
Good night.

1405
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:16,964
<i>Didn't matter what I felt.</i>

1406
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:18,762
You gotta take me home.

1407
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:22,091
You wore me out. Don't you wanna stay?

1408
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:23,721
No! Take me home.

1409
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,368
Still asleep?

1410
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:48,954
Shit. Damn it.

1411
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:50,581
I can't believe I slept this long.

1412
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:53,247
I gotta get to the restaurant.

1413
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,957
I called them and told them you quit.

1414
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,378
What? What?

1415
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,506
No, Diana, you have no idea how hard it is
for me to get a damn job.

1416
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:01,554
Why would you do that?

1417
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:07,137
What's this?

1418
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:21,696
Is this real?

1419
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:24,369
Yeah.

1420
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,709
This is... This is the offer?

1421
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:38,633
Yeah.

1422
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,880
I begged Victor to let me tell you.

1423
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:45,592
I'm pretty sure this is
Prescott's best and final.

1424
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:48,681
And this the best part, Robert,

1425
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:51,058
that this is a license for the technology.

1426
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:52,811
You still own the LP.

1427
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:56,443
You did it.

1428
01:20:58,228 --> 01:20:59,320
You did it.

1429
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:18,669
- Mel.
- What?

1430
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:20,046
Melinda!

1431
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:21,802
- What?
- Look.

1432
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:27,967
What the hell?

1433
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:30,894
- No way.
- Go.

1434
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:55,789
How are you?

1435
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:56,791
I'm busy.

1436
01:21:58,038 --> 01:21:59,881
I just need 10 minutes of your time.

1437
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:01,759
You have two.

1438
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:03,802
Okay.

1439
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:07,803
I just wanted to come here to tell you
thank you for loving me.

1440
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:11,807
You know, there were times
when I doubted myself...

1441
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:14,847
You kept working and kept me believing.

1442
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,645
Um... We are never getting back together.

1443
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:19,688
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1444
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:21,236
- Never.
- I know.

1445
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:24,569
So what is this?

1446
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:28,655
You borrow a suit,
and you come up here and try to...

1447
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:30,908
...impress me?

1448
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:32,285
For what?

1449
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:34,875
My battery. It...

1450
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:37,127
It hit.

1451
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:40,046
Yeah. I signed a deal.

1452
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:42,508
And I'm in business with Prescott.

1453
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:46,053
Good for you.

1454
01:22:53,844 --> 01:22:55,062
Good for us.

1455
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,980
I know our divorce is finalized,
but I wanted you to have this

1456
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,188
for everything you've done for me
over the years.

1457
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:07,611
I don't know of any woman
who would have put up with me,

1458
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:10,194
loved me, cared for me...

1459
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,076
Believed in me.

1460
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,449
I don't blame you.

1461
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:18,627
Like I said, I started to doubt myself.

1462
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:22,457
I'm just sorry that my dream
took so long to come true.

1463
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,462
Anyway, look.

1464
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:28,341
You gave me two minutes,
I'm sure it's just about up.

1465
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:30,843
I love you, Mel.

1466
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,013
I always will.

1467
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:41,066
Oh. I almost forgot.

1468
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,312
Your mama's house.

1469
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,818
It's yours again.

1470
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:50,026
Might look a little different on the inside

1471
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:52,361
'cause of the last owners, but...

1472
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:53,696
It's yours.

1473
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:33,235
- You're taking all day, baby.
- My partner got it.

1474
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:34,319
It's mine.

1475
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,241
- Bam!
- Boo.

1476
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:37,534
- That's what I'm talking about.
- I got you on this one.

1477
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:38,741
All right. Let's go, let's go.

1478
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:40,621
- Hey, sissy.
- Thank you, thank you.

1479
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:42,453
- Hey, Melinda.
- Where you been?

1480
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:45,289
You're late, babe.

1481
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:47,875
- What's up, Mel?
- Yeah, I know.

1482
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:51,754
- Did Robert give you this?
- Yeah.

1483
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,635
Along with these keys

1484
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:56,053
and the deed to Mama's house.

1485
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:57,055
What?

1486
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,765
Yeah, his battery hit.

1487
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:02,064
He's in business with Prescott.

1488
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:05,896
I'm calling the bank
first thing in the morning.

1489
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:08,730
I already did, and it's good.

1490
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:10,652
Damn.

1491
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,904
He hit like this?

1492
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:16,325
I knew he would. That dude is smart.

1493
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:18,159
Mel, when did you see him?

1494
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:21,286
He came to my job to tell me he was sorry,

1495
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:25,041
and that he loved me,
and he wanted to give me that.

1496
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:26,997
Oh, my God.

1497
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:30,418
That is so sweet.
We ain't never had this kind of money.

1498
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,342
Wow.

1499
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:34,175
He really did it.

1500
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,180
Well...

1501
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:38,976
you always thought he would.

1502
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,436
$10 million.

1503
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:43,597
Hell, go cash this before
he changes his mind or something...

1504
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,057
He won't.

1505
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,562
Well, let's not take no chances.

1506
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:47,729
Let's go to the bank
first thing in the morning.

1507
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:48,981
That bastard
might have a change of heart or...

1508
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:51,359
Shut the fuck up.

1509
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:54,858
Why did I listen to you?

1510
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:59,113
I mean, both of you are
some miserable bitches.

1511
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:01,073
Neither one of you are happy
with these bastards,

1512
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:02,995
and I listened to you.

1513
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:05,499
- Now you just wait one minute.
- No, no.

1514
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:11,336
Everybody in this town knows Kalvin
has a baby in Ellenwood.

1515
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:15,046
And, well, Casey, you know
what they say about you.

1516
01:26:15,128 --> 01:26:16,216
Melinda!

1517
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:19,675
Devon, you should go home
and never call me again.

1518
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:22,720
You are horrible in bed.

1519
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,100
You snore,

1520
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:27,308
and you are too big
to have such a little dick.

1521
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:31,979
Fucking shit.

1522
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:47,085
Hold on.

1523
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:57,303
Hi.

1524
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:00,178
The address was on the check.

1525
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:02,767
Yeah. Yeah.

1526
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:05,971
And I remembered the building.

1527
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:16,857
This is the building
you said we would live in.

1528
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:22,367
You look great.

1529
01:27:24,114 --> 01:27:25,081
Thank you.

1530
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:28,414
And this view...

1531
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:31,751
Oh!

1532
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:34,003
This view!

1533
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,383
Top floor.

1534
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,223
You said the top floor.

1535
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:45,010
Out of your dreams.

1536
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:48,347
This is just like everything
you described to me.

1537
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:51,479
I'm so proud of you.

1538
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:54,481
Thank you.

1539
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:56,404
And when you said you loved me,

1540
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:02,202
I realized I still love you very, very much.

1541
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:07,285
And I should have believed you

1542
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:09,493
when you said you weren't with her.

1543
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:12,546
But my sisters, my sisters.
They got in my head.

1544
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:15,168
That's all behind us now, Mel.

1545
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:17,546
I'm so glad you said that.

1546
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:22,513
Sorry I'm late, babe.

1547
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:31,481
Hey...

1548
01:28:32,641 --> 01:28:35,315
Baby, this is Melinda, my ex-wife.

1549
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,152
Hi.

1550
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:42,993
I'm Diana. I'm Robert's fiancée.

1551
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:45,783
<i>There she was.</i>

1552
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:49,745
<i>The bitch I tried to kill all those years ago</i>

1553
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:52,954
<i>standing in my apartment,</i>

1554
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:55,255
<i>wearing my ring.</i>

1555
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:57,503
<i>Looking at me.</i>

1556
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:16,645
<i>That son of a bitch humiliated me again
in front of that same whore.</i>

1557
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:20,442
<i>I can't believe he let me pour my heart out
and she was in there all that time.</i>

1558
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:23,820
<i>This bitch was living my life.</i>

1559
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,528
<i>The one I bought and paid for.</i>

1560
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:29,284
<i>He would always like to do it in the shower</i>

1561
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:33,119
<i>because he said it reminded him of us
when we met in the rain.</i>

1562
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:35,499
<i>You see why I hate the rain?</i>

1563
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:39,129
<i>I'm sure he was with that bitch
in the shower.</i>

1564
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:42,711
<i>That was supposed to be mine.</i>

1565
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:44,838
<i>Tasting her.</i>

1566
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,801
<i>Fucking her.</i>

1567
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:56,229
<i>Using what I taught him.</i>

1568
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:59,686
<i>Using my tricks on that trick.</i>

1569
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:05,442
<i>And I know Nina was somewhere close.</i>

1570
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:13,913
<i>By now, Robert was spooning her, I'm sure.</i>

1571
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:17,457
<i>Breathing ever so slightly
on the back of her neck.</i>

1572
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:21,002
<i>I can still smell the slightest hint
of whiskey on his breath.</i>

1573
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:23,050
<i>I can feel it on my neck.</i>

1574
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:24,635
<i>Bitch!</i>

1575
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:27,093
<i>And she just moved in?</i>

1576
01:30:27,464 --> 01:30:29,592
<i>Oh, no. I don't think so.</i>

1577
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:32,013
<i>I put every jewel in that crown,</i>

1578
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:35,142
<i>and I was not about to let
another bitch wear it!</i>

1579
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,862
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

1580
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:49,906
<i>He could just leave and walk away.</i>

1581
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:51,113
<i>He said he loved me,</i>

1582
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:54,786
<i>but he moved her into my place
like I never existed.</i>

1583
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:57,539
<i>I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep.</i>

1584
01:30:57,619 --> 01:31:01,340
<i>All I did was think about him and her.</i>

1585
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:03,375
<i>I had alerts on everything I owned.</i>

1586
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:06,303
<i>Every time that bitch posted something,
I knew it.</i>

1587
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:11,303
<i>And you know what?
Everything he said to me...</i>

1588
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:14,728
<i>He would take me to Paris,
and there they were in Paris.</i>

1589
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:18,599
<i>He said he would take me on our private jet.</i>

1590
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:20,525
<i>And there they were.</i>

1591
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:24,605
<i>Day and night, I just watched her page.</i>

1592
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:26,526
<i>I couldn't help it.</i>

1593
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,859
<i>Her wedding ideas. And her.</i>

1594
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:31,281
<i>She even chose a dress by the same designer</i>

1595
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:32,908
<i>that I wanted to make mine.</i>

1596
01:31:32,988 --> 01:31:34,659
<i>At the same boutique.</i>

1597
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,286
- <i>I got you.</i>
- <i>Babe...</i>

1598
01:31:36,366 --> 01:31:38,619
- <i>I will not let go of you.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

1599
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:40,955
<i>Walking. So get ready...</i>

1600
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:42,710
<i>Okay.</i>

1601
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:44,674
<i>Not yet.</i>

1602
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:47,795
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>No, just... Right there.</i>

1603
01:31:47,877 --> 01:31:49,174
<i>All right.</i>

1604
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,218
<i>Can I open?</i>

1605
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:52,724
<i>Open them now.</i>

1606
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:56,389
<i>Look behind you.</i>

1607
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:57,557
<i>Surprise.</i>

1608
01:31:57,637 --> 01:31:59,605
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1609
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:03,730
<i>The</i> Mrs. Gayle.

1610
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:06,654
<i>I told you I would buy it for you.</i>

1611
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:29,005
- I love this, I love this!
- Mmm.

1612
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:30,928
Oh, my God. I like this, but in white.

1613
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:32,380
- Hmm.
- Yeah?

1614
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:33,677
How about this one?

1615
01:32:33,757 --> 01:32:35,303
As you're waving goodbye to your guests.

1616
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,847
Perfect! I love it. They're gonna love it!

1617
01:32:37,927 --> 01:32:38,849
Hi, John.

1618
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:42,143
Hey, babe. Look at this.

1619
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:45,647
Okay, what do you think about this with
the "bon voyage" and I wave goodbye?

1620
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:47,104
- It's beautiful.
- Right? Ain't it pretty?

1621
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:48,188
Listen, baby, can I talk to you?

1622
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:49,398
Yeah, sure.

1623
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:53,363
Okay, well, John, we'll talk more
about the wedding tomorrow?

1624
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:54,570
Some other time? Okay.

1625
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:55,824
- Okay, thank you.
- Thanks, John.

1626
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,241
What's...

1627
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,790
Melinda, she's...

1628
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:04,579
She's suing us.

1629
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:07,882
She's claiming that the deal
happened before the divorce.

1630
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:10,343
We both know that's not true.

1631
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:13,179
Yeah, I know. It's just so sad.

1632
01:33:14,464 --> 01:33:16,091
Yeah, I'm gonna call Franklin.

1633
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:19,469
Yeah, I already talked to him
this morning about her.

1634
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,262
What? Why?

1635
01:33:21,888 --> 01:33:24,016
I didn't wanna tell you,
but I received, like,

1636
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:27,147
3,300 nasty comments from
somebody named Pissed.

1637
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:28,854
And, of course, it's Melinda.

1638
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:29,938
I'll talk to her.

1639
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:32,149
- No.
- Maybe I can give her more money.

1640
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:34,781
No. It's not about the money.

1641
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:38,405
You cannot negotiate with crazy.

1642
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:41,162
- It'll be okay.
- Yeah.

1643
01:33:47,163 --> 01:33:48,005
Mel?

1644
01:33:49,415 --> 01:33:50,837
- Mel?
- Hey, Sarah!

1645
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:52,044
Hey. Hey.

1646
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:53,629
Look, she's not calling us.

1647
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:55,508
- I don't think we should be here.
- Something's wrong.

1648
01:33:55,588 --> 01:33:59,183
Guys, I don't think it's a good idea
for us to go in there. Come on!

1649
01:34:00,009 --> 01:34:02,478
Where are you going? What is...

1650
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,103
It is still that easy to get in here?

1651
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:08,059
Melinda?

1652
01:34:08,977 --> 01:34:10,945
- Melinda?
- Melinda?

1653
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:14,277
Melinda, where are you?

1654
01:34:14,357 --> 01:34:15,700
Mel?

1655
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:20,158
What is going...

1656
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:22,161
- What the hell is all this?
- What?

1657
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,167
Oh, my God.

1658
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:28,708
Oh, my God. What is...

1659
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:31,542
We're certain he made the deal
with Prescott & Howard Industries

1660
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:33,797
while he was still married
to my client, Your Honor.

1661
01:34:34,294 --> 01:34:36,132
He also received all the investments

1662
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:39,302
for the Gayle Force battery
from my client's income alone,

1663
01:34:39,382 --> 01:34:42,180
and the mortgage from the family house,
which she lost.

1664
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:45,683
Counselor, I'm looking at all
the dates on these contracts,

1665
01:34:45,763 --> 01:34:47,310
and the email chains,

1666
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:50,105
and an affidavit from
Prescott & Howard Industries.

1667
01:34:50,185 --> 01:34:52,313
They attest that the deal wasn't offered

1668
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:55,570
until well after Mr. Gayle
and your client were divorced.

1669
01:34:57,734 --> 01:35:00,698
And seeing as he didn't ask
for the divorce, she did,

1670
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:01,905
I'm confused.

1671
01:35:02,572 --> 01:35:04,495
- Well, Your Honor...
- I'm not done.

1672
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:10,164
After the divorce, he gave your client
$10 million voluntarily.

1673
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:12,585
And then he rebought the family house

1674
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:14,337
and gave that to her.

1675
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:15,714
Is that right?

1676
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:17,128
Yes, Your Honor.

1677
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:19,884
And how much are you claiming for damages?

1678
01:35:19,964 --> 01:35:22,428
Well, she invested over $1.2 million

1679
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:23,885
over the course of their marriage.

1680
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:26,972
And we're asking for half the value
of the Gayle Force battery,

1681
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:30,685
which deems to exceed
approximately $150 million.

1682
01:35:30,767 --> 01:35:33,270
Okay, enough. That's ridiculous.

1683
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:38,488
It is apparent to the court that Mr. Gayle
has been more than fair.

1684
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:40,655
I'm going to dismiss this case.

1685
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,487
This is not fair.

1686
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:45,574
I should get half of what he got.
That is fair.

1687
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,370
Listen. This court has spoken.

1688
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:51,624
Don't you understand that
he didn't have to give you anything?

1689
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:55,044
This is one of the most generous gestures
this court has ever seen.

1690
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:57,377
This case is dismissed.

1691
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:01,384
Also, Your Honor,
there's another matter on the docket.

1692
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:04,092
Mrs. Moore has been harassing
the future Mrs. Gayle.

1693
01:36:04,968 --> 01:36:07,891
You'll see all the evidence
presented there in front of you.

1694
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:11,350
We're asking for a restraining order
for both Mr. and Mrs. Gayle.

1695
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:13,104
I'm the one who should get
the damn restraining order.

1696
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:15,732
- Counselor, control your client!
- Melinda.

1697
01:36:15,812 --> 01:36:18,406
I don't need to be controlled.
I'm not an animal.

1698
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:21,488
Did you send these messages?

1699
01:36:22,568 --> 01:36:23,911
This is America.

1700
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:26,614
I have freedom of speech.

1701
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:27,785
These are threats.

1702
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:30,163
You could spend time in jail, Mrs. Moore.

1703
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:32,582
Do it again, and you will.

1704
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:34,335
The restraining order is granted.

1705
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:36,875
Mrs. Moore,

1706
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:41,090
you are to stay 300 yards away
from Mr. and Mrs. Gayle.

1707
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:43,673
- Do you understand?
- They're not married.

1708
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:46,134
Stay away from both of them.

1709
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:47,764
Is that clear enough for you?

1710
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:49,395
Yes.

1711
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:57,899
Wait, go!

1712
01:36:58,313 --> 01:36:59,400
Melinda!

1713
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,777
- Go!
- Mel, don't!

1714
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:02,860
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Stop, stop, stop.

1715
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:04,034
Let them go.

1716
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:06,738
- Melinda, no.
- Melinda!

1717
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:11,167
This is Melinda,
and I am live recording on the Internet.

1718
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:14,207
<i>I want you to see this injustice.</i>

1719
01:37:14,287 --> 01:37:17,961
This whore slept with my husband.

1720
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:20,044
<i>And he left me with nothing...</i>

1721
01:37:20,126 --> 01:37:21,839
- Stop it now. Please stop.
- Enough, enough!

1722
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:23,007
Please stop!

1723
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:24,676
Mel, it's not healthy. I'm serious.

1724
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:26,804
You have to stop the way
you're dealing with him.

1725
01:37:27,216 --> 01:37:28,888
I don't want to talk about him.

1726
01:37:28,968 --> 01:37:30,556
Fine, we won't.
We'll talk about your sisters,

1727
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:32,558
and how they love you,
and they're worried about you.

1728
01:37:32,638 --> 01:37:33,765
And so am I.

1729
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:35,350
That stuff that we found in your house.

1730
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:36,605
- It was...
- Wait.

1731
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:39,566
You went to my house?

1732
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:41,693
Yeah.

1733
01:37:41,773 --> 01:37:43,319
Y'all motherfuckers don't wanna help me.

1734
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:44,776
Come with me, so we can talk about it.

1735
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:46,531
- Melinda, just...
- No, I see what's going on.

1736
01:37:46,611 --> 01:37:48,614
- Melinda?
- Fuck that!

1737
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:50,289
I'm going to June's.

1738
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:58,957
Thank you, guys, for coming.

1739
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:02,465
Look, we're worried about Melinda.

1740
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,883
She has really lost it over you two.

1741
01:38:05,338 --> 01:38:08,137
Now, we're gonna try to get a judge
to force her and get some help.

1742
01:38:08,508 --> 01:38:09,554
That might be a good idea.

1743
01:38:09,634 --> 01:38:12,137
But in the meantime, you need to be careful.

1744
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:13,221
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1745
01:38:13,304 --> 01:38:14,351
Both of you do.

1746
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:17,937
We have the restraining order.

1747
01:38:18,017 --> 01:38:20,020
You guys might wanna have
security at the wedding.

1748
01:38:20,103 --> 01:38:21,855
- Yeah.
- Seriously.

1749
01:38:21,938 --> 01:38:23,190
Look, guys,

1750
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:24,569
I know she's upset.

1751
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:27,068
Like you said, I know your sister.

1752
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:28,903
She'll be fine once she calms down.

1753
01:38:28,986 --> 01:38:32,081
If you think that, you don't know her at all.

1754
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:35,788
Oh, my God. No, no, no.

1755
01:38:35,868 --> 01:38:37,540
You two, you cannot be here right now.

1756
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:39,463
- She's right behind me.
- Oh, shit.

1757
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:42,670
Why the fuck are y'all
still coming in my house

1758
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,502
- without my permission?
- Sweetie.

1759
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:46,299
So what y'all been doing?

1760
01:38:46,379 --> 01:38:49,093
- Talking about me behind my back?
- Melinda.

1761
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:50,511
- Go!
- That's why you brought her here?

1762
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:51,554
No! No!

1763
01:38:51,634 --> 01:38:53,352
- Let me talk to her!
- No!

1764
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:56,225
Y'all have to hold me back! No!

1765
01:38:56,305 --> 01:38:58,770
I need that bitch to know that's my car!

1766
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,727
Why would you bring her here, Robert?

1767
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:02,732
That's my car, bitch!

1768
01:39:02,812 --> 01:39:03,939
It's not worth it, honey.

1769
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:06,024
- That's my car!
- No! No!

1770
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:08,280
- Go!
- Get off of me!

1771
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:10,995
- I'm okay. Okay!
- All right!

1772
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:14,623
I'm okay.

1773
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:16,993
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1774
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:20,124
Stop treating me like this.

1775
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:22,298
Why would you let him bring her here?

1776
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:25,877
So disrespectful!
What kind of family are you, huh?

1777
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,087
What about me?

1778
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:29,839
- God!
- Melinda!

1779
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:32,512
Melinda!

1780
01:40:02,872 --> 01:40:04,544
Hi, may I help you?

1781
01:40:04,624 --> 01:40:06,342
No, I'm just looking.

1782
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:07,718
Thank you.

1783
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:13,424
Here we go.

1784
01:40:14,217 --> 01:40:15,263
It's really lovely.

1785
01:40:15,343 --> 01:40:17,266
Yeah, I love the buttons.

1786
01:41:06,561 --> 01:41:07,523
Hey, wait!

1787
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:10,197
And she ruined the future
Mrs. Gayle's wedding dress.

1788
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:12,400
This court apologizes to you.

1789
01:41:12,483 --> 01:41:14,110
I shouldn't have been so lenient.

1790
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:15,445
It's okay, Your Honor.

1791
01:41:15,528 --> 01:41:17,030
I couldn't fit the dress anymore anyway.

1792
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:19,666
This little one's growing pretty fast.

1793
01:41:22,243 --> 01:41:26,214
What is it going to take to make you
heed the warnings of this court?

1794
01:41:26,789 --> 01:41:30,089
It's obvious to me that you're not
taking this matter seriously.

1795
01:41:31,043 --> 01:41:34,388
I will not allow you to continue
to harass these people.

1796
01:41:35,131 --> 01:41:36,178
Am I clear?

1797
01:41:36,841 --> 01:41:39,430
If you violate this restraining order,

1798
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:42,855
I assure you, you will spend 40 days
in the county jail.

1799
01:41:43,264 --> 01:41:44,265
I mean it.

1800
01:41:44,348 --> 01:41:45,975
One more offense.

1801
01:41:46,058 --> 01:41:48,607
Do I make myself clear?

1802
01:41:54,191 --> 01:41:55,568
Yes, Your Honor.

1803
01:41:56,819 --> 01:41:58,116
<i>Melinda.</i>

1804
01:41:59,155 --> 01:42:02,580
Have you ever considered that maybe
there's another way to look at this?

1805
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:05,290
Maybe he did mean what he said.

1806
01:42:06,662 --> 01:42:09,666
Maybe the deceit isn't what you think.

1807
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:12,794
Would you allow room for that possibility?

1808
01:42:13,502 --> 01:42:16,342
Would you feel better
if he was really being honest

1809
01:42:16,422 --> 01:42:19,426
and he really meant well?

1810
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:24,806
I am not wrong.

1811
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:28,852
You're just like everybody else.

1812
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:31,357
See...

1813
01:42:33,022 --> 01:42:34,240
I get dogged...

1814
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:36,609
and it's my fault.

1815
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:38,781
That's not what I'm saying.

1816
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:39,988
That's what you're saying.

1817
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:43,575
I just wanted to know
if you would consider it.

1818
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:45,204
Let me ask you another question.

1819
01:42:45,284 --> 01:42:46,411
Okay.

1820
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:52,543
Have you ever heard of something called
Borderline Personality Disorder?

1821
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:54,753
It's when a person has...

1822
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:56,178
You know what?

1823
01:42:57,296 --> 01:42:58,798
I'm not doing this.

1824
01:42:59,507 --> 01:43:02,056
Fuck you and this bullshit.

1825
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,057
I'm not crazy.

1826
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:05,687
What?

1827
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:09,772
Get out of here with this bullshit.

1828
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:13,776
As a matter of fact, I'm out.

1829
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:16,358
We are gathered here...

1830
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:19,489
<i>That bitch wasted
no time taking over my life.</i>

1831
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:22,997
<i>I just can't believe
Robert married that whore...</i>

1832
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:26,747
<i>and gave her my boat. My boat!</i>

1833
01:43:27,576 --> 01:43:29,374
<i>The boat with my name on it.</i>

1834
01:43:30,121 --> 01:43:31,873
<i>She was living my life.</i>

1835
01:43:34,834 --> 01:43:35,881
<i>Fuck her.</i>

1836
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:37,796
<i>Fuck him.</i>

1837
01:43:38,754 --> 01:43:40,381
<i>Fuck them both.</i>

1838
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:45,849
Hey.

1839
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:20,550
Melinda?

1840
01:44:21,797 --> 01:44:22,673
Melinda?

1841
01:44:41,317 --> 01:44:43,365
It's a beautiful night.

1842
01:44:44,028 --> 01:44:45,029
Mmm-hmm.

1843
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:46,489
Mmm-hmm.

1844
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:48,328
I love you.

1845
01:44:51,035 --> 01:44:52,628
Look at those stars.

1846
01:44:55,247 --> 01:44:57,294
You're that one. What are you doing?

1847
01:44:57,374 --> 01:44:59,126
I meant to start a bath.

1848
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:00,506
Let the staff do it.

1849
01:45:00,586 --> 01:45:03,340
No, no. I need to get up.
I need to get sea legs.

1850
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:07,468
You wanna join me in a few?

1851
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:09,516
You know it.

1852
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:14,608
See you.

1853
01:45:53,347 --> 01:45:54,685
Where's my wedding dress?

1854
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:56,562
It was hanging in the closet, ma'am.

1855
01:45:56,642 --> 01:45:57,643
I didn't see it.

1856
01:45:57,726 --> 01:45:59,190
I'll check with housekeeping.

1857
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:00,271
Okay.

1858
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:24,587
The bath is ready already?

1859
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:26,013
No.

1860
01:46:26,755 --> 01:46:27,677
Sit down.

1861
01:46:28,173 --> 01:46:29,220
Mel.

1862
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:31,435
What are you doing?

1863
01:46:31,844 --> 01:46:33,596
What are you doing?

1864
01:46:34,722 --> 01:46:36,190
What are you doing, Robert?

1865
01:46:36,765 --> 01:46:39,143
- Come on, Mel, you know this is not right.
- No.

1866
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:42,196
What's not right is what you did to me.

1867
01:46:42,897 --> 01:46:44,068
What did I do?

1868
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:45,945
Don't act like you don't remember.

1869
01:46:46,025 --> 01:46:48,073
Okay, okay, okay.

1870
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:51,367
Tell me so that I'm sure.

1871
01:46:51,447 --> 01:46:52,539
You left me.

1872
01:46:53,532 --> 01:46:56,035
You took the best parts of my life.

1873
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:58,413
And you gave that bitch my ring,

1874
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:00,623
my apartment,

1875
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:02,712
my boat,

1876
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:04,256
my life.

1877
01:47:05,169 --> 01:47:08,467
And you promised those things to me.
Didn't you, Robert?

1878
01:47:08,547 --> 01:47:09,635
Didn't you?

1879
01:47:09,715 --> 01:47:11,011
I did, I did.

1880
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:12,218
I did.

1881
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:14,519
I did.

1882
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:18,936
So why... Why did you give it to her?

1883
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:21,144
Mel, you divorced me.

1884
01:47:21,393 --> 01:47:22,394
You left me!

1885
01:47:22,478 --> 01:47:24,025
You didn't fight.

1886
01:47:24,605 --> 01:47:26,402
- You didn't fight.
- Mel.

1887
01:47:26,482 --> 01:47:29,702
No, you used me to work
and take care of you until you made it.

1888
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:31,282
You never loved me.

1889
01:47:31,362 --> 01:47:33,581
- Mel, that's not true. I loved you.
- Then why?

1890
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:36,785
Why did you give it all to her, huh?

1891
01:47:38,077 --> 01:47:41,250
Why are you here with her and not me?

1892
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:43,377
You promised me forever.

1893
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:46,380
You promised me forever,
and she was there all the time.

1894
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,924
No, no. That is not true, Mel.

1895
01:47:49,004 --> 01:47:50,676
I never cheated on you.

1896
01:47:50,756 --> 01:47:52,094
Then why?

1897
01:47:52,174 --> 01:47:54,051
I never cheated on you, Mel.

1898
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:55,552
Never!

1899
01:47:56,804 --> 01:47:58,147
I love you.

1900
01:48:01,225 --> 01:48:02,568
I always will.

1901
01:48:04,603 --> 01:48:05,445
Good.

1902
01:48:06,605 --> 01:48:08,152
Then make her jump off the boat.

1903
01:48:08,857 --> 01:48:09,695
- Mel, Mel.
- Come on.

1904
01:48:09,775 --> 01:48:11,402
So we can start our life together.

1905
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:13,824
- No, come on, get up. Let's go get her.
- No, Mel, Mel.

1906
01:48:13,904 --> 01:48:14,746
Get up!

1907
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,908
Listen, let's just talk about this, okay?

1908
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:19,580
Come on.

1909
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,128
Give me the gun.

1910
01:48:21,537 --> 01:48:22,789
Just give me the gun.

1911
01:48:26,375 --> 01:48:28,047
- I heard a shot!
- It came from up top!

1912
01:48:28,127 --> 01:48:29,174
What's going on?

1913
01:48:30,421 --> 01:48:31,468
Jump!

1914
01:48:33,048 --> 01:48:34,011
Jump!

1915
01:48:34,091 --> 01:48:35,262
You better jump!

1916
01:48:56,155 --> 01:48:57,873
Mel, what are you doing?

1917
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:00,626
Mel.

1918
01:49:03,579 --> 01:49:05,417
Where are you going, huh?

1919
01:49:05,497 --> 01:49:07,124
Stop, bitch, before I shoot you in the...

1920
01:49:17,176 --> 01:49:18,847
Give me the ring.

1921
01:49:18,927 --> 01:49:19,848
What ring?

1922
01:49:19,928 --> 01:49:21,396
That ring, bitch!

1923
01:49:22,723 --> 01:49:23,850
Give it to me.

1924
01:49:24,266 --> 01:49:25,813
You bitches are something.

1925
01:49:25,893 --> 01:49:28,315
The first wife puts in all the work,

1926
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:30,567
and you whores reap the benefits?

1927
01:49:30,647 --> 01:49:32,695
No, ma'am. Give it here.

1928
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:34,659
Give it to me.

1929
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:36,995
No!

1930
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:39,077
Robert!

1931
01:49:41,450 --> 01:49:42,913
I need to stop the boat.

1932
01:49:42,993 --> 01:49:44,666
Okay. Okay.

1933
01:49:56,507 --> 01:49:58,100
Pull the throttle.

1934
01:50:10,229 --> 01:50:11,275
Okay. Are you okay?

1935
01:50:11,355 --> 01:50:12,948
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1936
01:50:13,649 --> 01:50:14,821
Okay, babe.

1937
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:19,324
I need you to get in the tender,
and I need you to go get the crew.

1938
01:50:19,404 --> 01:50:20,326
The crew?

1939
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:22,749
She made them jump.

1940
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:24,955
- Go.
- I'm not leaving you!

1941
01:50:25,035 --> 01:50:27,129
Go, baby. I'm bleeding out.

1942
01:50:28,205 --> 01:50:29,206
Robert.

1943
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:30,586
They can help me.

1944
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:32,092
Go!

1945
01:50:36,255 --> 01:50:37,302
Be careful.

1946
01:50:40,175 --> 01:50:41,393
Hurry, baby.

1947
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:42,727
Hurry.

1948
01:50:56,984 --> 01:50:58,531
Robert.

1949
01:51:01,572 --> 01:51:03,950
It's all your fault, Robert.

1950
01:51:07,244 --> 01:51:08,712
Now look at you.
