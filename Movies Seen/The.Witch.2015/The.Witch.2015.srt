1
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,669
What went we out
into this wilderness to find?

2
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,679
Leaving our country, kindred...

3
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,196
...our father's houses?

4
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,074
We travailed a vast ocean...

5
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,034
For what? For what?

6
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,792
We must ask thee to be silent.

7
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,830
Was it not for the pure
and faithful dispensation of the Gospels

8
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,992
- and the Kingdom of God?
- No more!

9
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,032
We are your judges,
and not you ours.

10
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,998
I cannot be judged
by false Christians,

11
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,591
for I have done nothing
save preach Christ through gospel.

12
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,591
Must you continue to dishonor

13
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,312
the laws of the commonwealth and the
church with your prideful conceit?

14
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,030
If my conscience sees it fit.

15
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,511
Then shall you be banished
from this plantation's liberties!

16
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,308
I would be glad on it.

17
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,031
Then take your leave
and trouble us no further.

18
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,031
How sadly hath the Lord
testified against you.

19
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,033
Katherine.

20
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,272
Thomasin.

21
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,635
Come.

22
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,393
I will confess Jehovah with all heart

23
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,828
In secret and in assembly of the just...

24
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,155
I here confess
I've lived in sin.

25
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,031
I've been idle of my work,
disobedient to my parents,

26
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,390
neglectful of my prayer.

27
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,633
I have, in secret,
played upon my Sabbath.

28
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,349
And broken every one of thy
commandments in thought.

29
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,916
Followed the desires of mine own
will, and not the Holy Spirit.

30
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,714
I know I deserve more shame
and misery in this life...

31
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,678
...and everlasting hellfire.

32
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,592
But I beg Thee...
for the sake of Thy Son...

33
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,755
forgive me, show me mercy,

34
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,559
show me Thy light.

35
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,273
Thomasin.

36
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,953
Boo!

37
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,079
There you are, there you are.

38
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,239
Boo!

39
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,791
Where is Sam?
Where is Sam?

40
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,753
Where is that little man?

41
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,916
Boo!

42
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,912
There you are, there you are.

43
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,997
Boo!

44
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,670
Sam.

45
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,592
Samuel!

46
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,634
Thomasin.

47
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,679
Sleep.

48
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,390
All will be well, sleep.

49
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,232
Caleb.

50
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,113
God give you good morrow.

51
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,555
All are still a-bed.

52
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,029
Save Mother.

53
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,072
Tis no ease to rise on a gray day.

54
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,833
The Devil holds
fast your eyelids.

55
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,716
- I'll wake em.
- No, let em be.

56
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,952
Thy Mother's not slept
a night since...

57
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,556
We can search no more, Caleb.
We cannot.

58
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,311
If not a wolf, then hunger
would have taken him yet.

59
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,632
Let's to the wood.

60
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,320
Been a'layin traps
for some while now,

61
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,550
even before this new misery.

62
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,198
Within the wood?

63
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,475
Will thou not help thy father?

64
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,791
You and Mother have always
forbade us to set foot there.

65
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,958
Caleb, our harvest
cannot last the winter.

66
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,999
We must catch our food
if we cannot grow it.

67
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,789
We will conquer this wilderness.
It will not consume us.

68
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,314
Aren't thou then born a sinner?

69
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,269
Aye, I was conceived in sin
and born in iniquity.

70
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,634
Then what is thy birth sin?

71
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,430
Adam's sin imputed to me and a corrupt
nature dwelling within me.

72
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,559
Well remembered, Caleb, very well.

73
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,234
And canst thou tell me
what thy corrupt nature is?

74
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,392
My corrupt nature is empty of grace,

75
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,474
bent unto sin, only unto sin
and that continually.

76
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,357
Soft now.

77
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,831
We must lay it again.

78
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,712
Was, was Samuel born a sinner?

79
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,193
Aye.

80
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,633
Am I then...

81
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,230
We pray he hath entered
God's Kingdom.

82
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,673
What wickedness hath he done?

83
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,796
Place faith in God, Caleb.

84
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,519
We'll speak no more on thy brother.

85
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,431
Why?

86
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,273
He hath disappeared,
not one week passed.

87
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,436
Yet you and Mother
utter not his name.

88
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,511
He's gone, Caleb.

89
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,433
- Tell me!
- Tell thee what?

90
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,351
- Is he in hell?
- Caleb!

91
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,396
Mother will not stop her prayer.

92
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,596
And if I died, if I died this day...

93
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,910
- What is this?
- I ought evil in me heart.

94
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,632
- Me sins are not pardoned!
- Thou art youngly yet...

95
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,631
And if God will not
hear my prayers?!

96
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,870
- Caleb!
- Tell me!

97
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,270
Look you,
I love thee marvelous well,

98
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,793
but 'tis God alone, not man,

99
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,872
what knows who is the son
of Abraham and who is not,

100
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,117
who is good and who is evil.

101
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,795
Fain would I tell thee
Sam sleeps in Jesus,

102
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,553
that thou wilt, that I will.

103
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,553
But I cannot tell thee that.
None can.

104
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,549
Caleb?

105
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,915
Where are these from?

106
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,873
From lndian Tom and old Slater,
when last they past through.

107
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,758
What did you trade?

108
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,712
Thy Mother's silver cup.

109
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,749
Speak none of this to Mother. None.

110
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,274
She's overwrought already.

111
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,159
I'll tell her of the cup
when her grief has passed.

112
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,357
Let's not speak on this again.

113
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,112
Aye.

114
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,029
Fowler!

115
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,156
Fool of an animal.

116
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,912
Fowler!

117
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,394
Fowler, what's this?

118
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,869
Praise be to God.
Make haste, Caleb.

119
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,472
Fie upon't!

120
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,717
- Father, it died.
- The other end.

121
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,270
Father?

122
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,157
Father!

123
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,713
Fowler.

124
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,429
Black Phillip, Black Phillip,
a crown grows on his head

125
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,990
Black Phillip, Black Phillip
to nanny queen is wed

126
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,350
Jump to the fence post...

127
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,433
- Jonas! Mercy! Come hither!
- Black Phillip, Black Phillip

128
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,750
King of all...

129
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,354
Jonas! Mercy!

130
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,470
Black Phillip, Black Phillip,
king of sky and land

131
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,109
Black Phillip, Black Phillip,
king of sea and sand

132
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,795
We are ye servants,
we are ye men

133
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,759
Black Phillip eats the lions
from the lions' den.

134
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,435
Black Phillip, Black Phillip,
a crown grows on his head...

135
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,353
Get back!
You two, stop that!

136
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,396
Phillip, back!

137
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,473
Heavens bless us!

138
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,111
Caleb, hold the gate.

139
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,758
Caleb!

140
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,035
Get in!

141
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,834
Oh.

142
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,635
I'll have thee quiet.

143
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,075
Wither were you
and Caleb this morn?

144
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,388
How could you disappear?

145
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,314
And thee, I told thee to keep
watch of Jonas and Mercy.

146
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,994
I was, and I bade them help me
and they paid me no mind.

147
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,310
- I was a-getting...
- What's the matter with thee, Thomasin?

148
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,391
What is the matter with thee?

149
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,313
Take thy father's rags to
the brook and wash them.

150
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,278
- They would pay me no mind.
- And brush out his woolens.

151
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,634
Help him!

152
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,913
Wee one, it gave me such
a fright to find thee gone.

153
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,877
I will not be left here alone.
Dost hear?

154
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,955
A morning's work
is well behindhand.

155
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,156
Jonas, leave thy sister be.

156
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,953
- She likes it.
- William.

157
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,474
What, can't a father spend
Godly time with his son?

158
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,788
Jonas!

159
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,474
- Father said stop it.
- Thomasin!

160
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,152
- Stop.
- Stop it!

161
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,157
Each of ya, stop it.

162
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,838
Thomasin, take the twins inside.

163
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,592
No!

164
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,315
Get inside, get inside, get inside.

165
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,789
As you like.

166
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,714
We went to find apples!

167
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,159
In the valley.

168
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,999
I thought I seen an apple tree
in the valley.

169
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,072
Father brought the gun,
for if we glanced that wolf...

170
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,435
Why did you not tell me?

171
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,909
Father wanted it a surprise,
to cheer you, and...

172
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,920
but there were none.

173
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,837
I thought I seen em.

174
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,509
I like you not outside
the farm, even to the valley.

175
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,830
Dost hear me?

176
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,435
Caleb, be a good lad
and get some water for thy Mother.

177
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,358
Stray not from the brook.

178
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,112
Why are you dallying?

179
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,033
What then?

180
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,993
What?

181
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,590
Caleb? Caleb!

182
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,548
Stop it.

183
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,591
I meant no harm in it.

184
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,392
What's the matter with thee?

185
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,748
Come hither.

186
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,558
What's the matter with thee, eh?

187
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,234
Shh.

188
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,229
I've seen no apples
since we went from England.

189
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,436
I would thou hadst found them.

190
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,192
I so wish for one.

191
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,068
Hear that?

192
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,479
Aye.

193
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,948
Who's there?

194
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,031
I be the Witch of the Wood!

195
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,553
Mercy, come out.

196
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,312
I be not Mercy,

197
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,439
I be the Witch of the Wood
and I have come to steal ye.

198
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,432
Hear me stick
a-flying through the trees:

199
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,239
Clickety-clackity,
clickety-clackity!

200
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,436
- Mercy!
- Clickety-clackity.

201
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,919
Why is't when thou dost a wrong,

202
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,116
I be a-washin Father's clothes
like a slave,

203
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,839
- and thou art playing idle?
- Because Mother hates you.

204
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,559
Spoilt child. I'll tell Mother
you've left the farm alone.

205
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,790
Black Phillip saith
I can do what I like.

206
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,319
Devil take your Black Phillip.

207
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,470
It's your fault I can't leave the yard.

208
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,870
I could go to the brook
before you let The Witch take Sam.

209
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,030
- Quiet, thee.
- It were a wolf stole Sam.

210
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,351
A witch. I've seen her in her
riding cloak, about the wood.

211
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,153
- Father showed me the tracks.
- It was a witch.

212
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,997
Aye, it was a witch,
Mercy, you speak aright.

213
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,672
- Thomasin!
- It was I.

214
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,079
Liar.

215
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,551
Twas I what stole him,
I be the witch of the wood.

216
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,677
- Liar! Liar!
- I am.

217
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,512
List not to her, Mercy.

218
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,795
I am that very witch.

219
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,350
When I sleep, my spirit slips
away from my body

220
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,193
and dances naked with The Devil.

221
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,874
- That's how I signed his book.
- No.

222
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,110
He bade me bring him an
unbaptized babe,

223
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,352
so I stole Sam
and I gave him to me master.

224
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,716
And I'll make any man
or thing else vanish I like.

225
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,518
- No.
- Aye.

226
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,670
And I'll vanish thee, too,
if thou displeaseth me.

227
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,513
- Be quiet!
- Mercy, she's but telling fantasies.

228
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,717
Perchance I boil and bake thee
since we're lack of food.

229
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,916
- No!
- Stop, Thomasin!

230
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,831
- I'ts not true!
- It is, thou thing!

231
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,840
How I crave to sink my teeth
into thy pink flesh.

232
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,831
If ever thou tellst thy Mother of this,

233
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,115
I'll witch thee and thy Mother!
And Jonas too!

234
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,156
- Caleb!
- Stop thy tears and swear by silence.

235
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,390
- I swear it.
- You'll not tell Mother nor father.

236
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,074
- I swear.
- Thomasin! Let her alone.

237
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,550
Get away from her, Caleb,
or she'll witch thee!

238
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,317
Why tell Mercy
those horrible fantasies?

239
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,077
- Dost thou hate me now too?
- It was a wolf stole Sam.

240
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,437
Leave me be. Go tell Mother
and father of my wickedness.

241
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,308
- Thomasin...
- I hate thy pity. I need it not.

242
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,912
And forgive us the sins we have
this day committed against thee,

243
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,709
free us from the shame and torment
which are due unto us, Father.

244
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,315
We beseech thee, increase our faith
in the promise of the Gospel,

245
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,234
our fear of thy name
and the hatred of all our sins,

246
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,790
that we may be assured that
the Holy Spirit dwells in us.

247
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,111
That we might be thy children
in thy love and mercy,

248
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,839
but as we hunger
for this food of our bodies

249
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,754
so our souls hunger
for the food of eternal life.

250
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,277
Finish soon our days of sin,
and bring us to eternal peace

251
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,960
through the purifying
blood of Thy Son,

252
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,272
our Lord and only Savior
Jesus Christ.

253
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,954
- Amen.
- Amen.

254
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,315
Thomasin, what's thou done
with the silver cup?

255
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,394
Is't not on the shelf?

256
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,311
Nay.

257
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,474
In the six board, then.

258
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,597
T'ain't there neither.

259
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,274
It's been disappeared
for some while.

260
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,594
Didst lose it?

261
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,719
I've not touched it.

262
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,832
Where has it gone then?

263
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,160
I haven't touched it.

264
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,196
I've caught thee
trifling with it before.

265
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,840
She says she haven't touched it,
Katherine.

266
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,397
How thou couldst lose my father's
silver wine cup in this hovel,

267
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,833
- I cannot know.
- I haven't touched it.

268
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,753
Peace, child. It's gone.

269
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,955
Did a wolf vanish that too?

270
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,231
She haven't touched it, Katherine.

271
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,233
What is amiss
on this farm? Hmm?

272
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,588
It is not natural.

273
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,473
Caleb, will thou read out
a chapter of the Word tonight?

274
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,195
We must find some light
in our darkness.

275
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,795
Tomorrow we will have a fast day
but for our sins.

276
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,398
Thomasin, dist not bed them down
before supper?

277
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,199
Baah, baah.

278
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,356
Oh, Holy and blessed Spirit,
be with me and dwell in me heart.

279
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,635
You must sleep tonight, Kate.

280
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,952
This night and evermore, amen.

281
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,075
Thou dost remember I love thee?

282
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,999
I do.

283
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,389
List me, Kate,

284
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,712
I fear thou dost look
too much upon this affliction.

285
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,069
We must turn our thoughts
towards God, not to ourselves.

286
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,590
He hath never taken a child from us.
Never a one, Kate.

287
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,478
Who might earn such grace?

288
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,754
We have been
grateful of God's love.

289
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,197
He hath cursed this family.

290
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,554
No.

291
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,430
He hath taken us
into a very low condition to humble us

292
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,036
and to show us more of His grace.

293
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,117
Was not Christ lead into the wilderness
to be ill met by the Devil?

294
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,150
We should ne'er have left
the plantation.

295
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,559
Kate.

296
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,313
- We should never have left!
- That damned church.

297
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,757
- There's naught hither!
- Well, what need we? Silver chalices?

298
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,750
How dare you chide me on a cup?

299
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,071
Tis not for vanity
that I am grieved of it.

300
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,593
Katherine, I must tell thee...

301
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,194
- We might have sold it.
- What?

302
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,989
What fool would trade for our corn?

303
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:04,038
List me, our daughter hath begat
the sign of her womanhood.

304
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,831
Thomasin? Caleb?

305
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,229
Are you abed?

306
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,276
Mercy?

307
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,508
Jonas?

308
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,559
She's old enough.
She must leave to serve another family.

309
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,632
Twas not her fault.
Kate, I must tell thee...

310
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,757
Aye, it was thine
for taking thy family hither.

311
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,159
This is Godly land.

312
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,673
Godly?

313
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,640
Our children are being fostered up
like savages.

314
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,948
Kate!

315
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,191
How oft I begged and begged
thee to take Samuel for baptism?

316
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,748
They'd not baptize
outside the congregation.

317
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,717
Our Sam is in hell!

318
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,633
Go to.

319
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,510
God save us, Caleb is well.

320
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,511
We must keep him still.
And Thomasin.

321
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,953
Our corn is trash!

322
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,076
We cannot back to that church.

323
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,559
We will starve!

324
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,071
Peace, peace.
You'll wake them, peace.

325
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,475
I'll to the village
with the horse and Thomasin tomorrow.

326
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,994
The Tildens or the Whythings,

327
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,640
they can make use of her.

328
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,632
They're good folk.

329
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,951
Stop, Kate.

330
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,755
We will find food, I know it.

331
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,712
Caleb?

332
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,428
What are you doing?

333
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,078
Go to sleep.

334
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,435
What is this?
Tell me, now.

335
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,193
- Running away then?
- No.

336
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,032
- Lie not to me.
- I don't.

337
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,680
Then what?

338
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,239
Tell me!

339
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,108
If thou went back to sleep
and kept silent of this,

340
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,519
I promise thee,

341
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,230
you'll need not leave to serve
the Tildens nor any family else.

342
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,754
I'll be back by mid-day.

343
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,634
- Well, let me along with ya.
- No.

344
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,314
- Let me along.
- I cannot.

345
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,191
If you don't let me along with ya,

346
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,117
I'll wake Mother
and father this instant.

347
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,879
Well?

348
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,358
Aye, but we did!

349
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,078
- Nay.
- We did!

350
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,957
No.

351
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,439
We had glass windows in England.

352
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,949
We haven't been hither
so long you can forget that.

353
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,632
As you like, Thomasin?

354
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,950
You've gone mad.

355
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,952
Dost not remember Fowler
laying on the floor in the sun?

356
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,793
- You must!
- Nay.

357
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,270
And where the sun would shine,
would he warm himself.

358
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,397
Remember once he lay upon the table,
and father saw him and he saith,

359
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,277
"We will have him for meat!

360
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,999
Kate! Kate!
We will roast this beast."

361
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,640
You must remember that!

362
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,236
I remember that day,
but no glass.

363
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,710
Well... it was pretty.

364
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,992
What is't, boy?

365
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,635
Burt, calm thee!

366
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,439
Fowler! Nay, Fowler!

367
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,713
Stand here with Burt.

368
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,634
- Caleb, no.
- I'll straight back.

369
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,756
He's gone mad!

370
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,311
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

371
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,118
- Thomasin!
- Thomasin!

372
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,552
- Caleb!
- Caleb!

373
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,555
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

374
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,438
Thomasin!

375
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,354
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

376
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,674
Thomasin!

377
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,196
Fowler!

378
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,149
O God, my Lord, I now begin,
o help me and I'll leave my sin.

379
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,716
For I repentant now shall be,
From evil I will turn to Thee.

380
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,355
None ever shall destroy my faith,
nor do I mind what Satan saith.

381
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,149
O God, my Lord, I now begin,
O, help me and I'll leave my sin,

382
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,670
For I repentant now shall be,
from evil I will turn to Thee.

383
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,318
None ever shall destroy my faith,

384
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,356
nor do I mind what Satan saith.

385
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,631
O God, my Lord, I now begin,
O help me and l...

386
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,470
Caleb!

387
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,711
Caleb!

388
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,594
- Caleb!
- Father!

389
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,079
Thomasin.

390
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,518
Oh, my girl, my girl.

391
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,076
Where is thy brother?

392
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,273
What's the matter with thee, Thomasin?
What's the matter with thee?

393
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,989
I'll set off at first light.
I'll not return until I've found him.

394
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,038
T'would be better to go to the village
to raise up help, I cannot...

395
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,509
Tis a day's ride and I have no horse.

396
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,113
There's no time to be lost.

397
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,998
Likely you should have left
this morn, then.

398
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,594
You have no gun, William,
nay, not even a dog.

399
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,671
- Be not a fool!
- I am a fool to go.

400
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,149
There is none will help this family.

401
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,915
Let me be!

402
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,428
The moon is bright,
the rain bothers me not.

403
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,393
I'll be back in a two-day,
if any a man will return with me.

404
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,233
- Don't go, Father!
- Enough!

405
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,308
Tell us why you went to the wood.

406
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,789
- I promised.
- I care not!

407
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,596
Let me find favor in your eyes.

408
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,797
Oh, child, tell me and I will!

409
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,828
I, um...

410
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,590
Speak!

411
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,312
I...

412
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,070
I took thy father's cup.

413
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,152
I sold it.

414
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,871
Forgive me, Kate.
Forgive me, Thomasin.

415
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,828
What is this?

416
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,352
Katherine, I must make confession.

417
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,958
I yestermorn took Caleb
to the wood.

418
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,635
Twas for food,
and the pelts for money, good money.

419
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,711
I knew you were false!
I knew it!

420
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,314
I meant it as a surprise,
that is why I kept secret.

421
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,958
I will trap that wolf, Kate.

422
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,996
You stood by whilst our son lied to me!

423
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,911
Twas for thy sake!
I love thee, Kate.

424
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,560
- You took him to the woods!
- I will find him!

425
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,557
You've broken God's covenant.
You're a liar.

426
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,318
And you've lost another child.

427
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,914
- I will go now.
- You cannot escape the woods.

428
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,513
I will find him!

429
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,115
And kill thyself too?
Will Jonas be the man of the house?

430
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,191
Will you damn all your family to death?!

431
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,714
- Katherine!
- Let go of me!

432
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,951
Picking apples.

433
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,037
Mother, have the goats
been bedded down yet?

434
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,350
- Nay.
- I'll to it.

435
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,275
Let it wait til the morrow.
They dare not escape with this rain.

436
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,237
Nay, I'll to it.

437
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,198
Please you, Mother.

438
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,191
Come hither, child.

439
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,998
Hurry back.

440
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,949
Caleb...

441
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,393
Father!

442
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,959
Caleb, Caleb...

443
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,791
Shh.

444
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,551
Oh, merciful Father,

445
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,313
both the Lord and giver of life.

446
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,188
Thy sole, Jesus Christ,
we beseech thee.

447
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,271
Look down from Heaven upon him

448
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,272
with those eyes
of grace and compassion.

449
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,032
Pity thy wounded servant...

450
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:32,119
Baa, baa. Baa, baa, baa.

451
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,760
What ails Caleb, Black Phillip?
What ails him?

452
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,400
Did Thomasin make 'im sick
in the wood?

453
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,754
What say you?

454
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,796
Black Phillip says you are wicked.

455
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,433
Aye, he told me too.

456
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,794
Damn your Black Phillip.

457
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,232
He says you put the Devil
in Caleb, that's why he's sick.

458
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,989
I'd never hurt Caleb,
nor Sam, nor thee.

459
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,911
- You beat me.
- T'was a jest.

460
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,638
- You said you'd eat of me.
- Mercy!

461
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,199
Mother and Father will find out.

462
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,840
- What?
- That you are a witch!

463
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,479
Thomasin!

464
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,478
Thomasin?

465
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,828
Dost remember John Kempe's son?

466
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,355
That first winter, he was
tormented of lndian magic.

467
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,237
'Tis not the same.

468
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,518
- This is unnatural providence.
- I know not that.

469
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,830
Look at thy son.

470
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,238
- Will.
- What?

471
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,878
- Think!
- Think what?

472
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,958
- Think!
- I have no thoughts.

473
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,190
Does this not look
like witchcraft?

474
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,838
What witch?

475
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,190
Who does this then? Who?

476
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,515
Thy thoughts are as a child.

477
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,713
What are you doing?

478
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,837
We'll back to the plantation
in the morning.

479
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,112
Find a good family for Thomasin,
take Caleb to the doctor's.

480
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,190
He'll tell if this be
some natural ill or not.

481
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,158
Yet we cannot return as beggars.

482
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,711
I'll scour the field. There must be
some fruit yet untouched by this rot.

483
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,712
I beseech thee, Katherine,
what canst thou do for him presently?

484
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,792
How might we all bare it
to the village with no horse?

485
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,553
Well, the little corn and the goat
should fetch a fair price.

486
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,029
We'll... We'll back with Caleb
and sell them,

487
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,111
return with the horse
for the twins and Thomasin.

488
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,629
- You cannot leave them here!
- Thomasin and thee...

489
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,358
Oh, forget the crop, Will!

490
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,476
What?!

491
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,358
What dost thou want, Katherine?

492
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,954
Tell me and I will give it thee.

493
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,513
I want to be home.

494
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,873
Thou shall be home,
by candle-time tomorrow.

495
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,394
In England.

496
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,239
Oh, Will...

497
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,073
I also have a confession to make.

498
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,593
I never meant to be a shrew to thee.

499
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,196
I have become as Job's wife,
I know it.

500
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,518
But since Sam, since...

501
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,433
My heart has turned to stone.

502
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:09,032
I dreamed once,
t'was when I was of Thomasin's years,

503
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,590
that I was with Christ upon Earth.

504
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,630
Oh, I was so very near Him.

505
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,430
And in many tears for the assurance
of the pardon of me sins.

506
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,638
And I was so ravaged
with His love towards me,

507
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,157
I thought it far exceeding
the affection of the kindest husband.

508
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,749
And since Samuel disappeared...

509
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,878
...I have such a sad weakness
of faith, I cannot shake it.

510
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,475
I cannot see Christ's help as near.

511
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,757
I pray and I pray, but I cannot.

512
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,995
I fear I cannot ever feel
that same measure of love again.

513
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,879
Thou shall have of it in Heaven.

514
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,593
I'll be in field.

515
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,513
If you can spare a while, do.

516
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,272
We'll leave at dawn.

517
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,112
I promise thee that.

518
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,308
Jonas, Mercy, come hither!

519
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,357
Speak not a word!

520
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,391
Black Phillip is a merry, merry king

521
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,074
- He rules the land with mirth...
- I cannot abide your songs.

522
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,958
Please you, Mercy.

523
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,632
Black Phillip has
a mighty, mighty sting

524
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,472
He'll knock thee to the Earth

525
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,755
Sing bah, bah,
King Phillip, the black

526
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,512
- Sing bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
- Thomasin: Peace, thou thing!

527
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,352
Mercy. Thomasin.

528
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,351
Sing bah, bah, King Phillip, the black

529
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,158
- He'll knock thee on thy back!
- Enough!

530
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,159
Come.

531
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,959
Get the broadaxe
and cut off her head.

532
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,191
Get the narrow axe
and cut off her head.

533
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,748
Get the broadaxe
and cut off her head.

534
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,115
Get the narrow axe
and cut off her head.

535
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,552
She's upon me!

536
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,073
She kneels!

537
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,713
My bowels!

538
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,030
My stomach!

539
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,513
She pinches!

540
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,593
Sin! Sin! Sin!!

541
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,148
Thomasin, take the children outside.

542
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,953
What does this to thee?
What does this?

543
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,996
His mouth has sealed up.

544
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,875
Oh, God, William!

545
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,110
William! Get him up!

546
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,633
Hold him!

547
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,878
Children, away from this!
Thomasin, help!

548
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,032
You'll break his jaws.

549
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,474
Father!

550
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,557
What is...?

551
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,595
William... He is witched!

552
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,398
- 'Tis she!
- No!

553
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,800
- What horrible fancy is this?
- She told me she stole Sam!

554
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,273
Silence!

555
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,679
She gave him to the Devil
in the wood!

556
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,239
- They lie!
- What say you?

557
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,958
She turned Flora's milk to blood!

558
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,632
She had bade us
keep secret from you!

559
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,757
- It was but a jest to quiet her, I...
- She made bargain with Satan!

560
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,432
- She signed his book!
- Silence!

561
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,909
Don't let her near me!
She'll put a curse on me!

562
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,514
- They conspire against me.
- Thomasin is a witch!

563
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,757
Nay, I'll not hear it.

564
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,638
I'll have proof, or Heaven help thee.

565
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,915
On thy knees!

566
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,429
Look me in the eye, daughter.

567
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,830
- Dost thou love the word of God?
- Yes.

568
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,036
Love you The Bible?
Love you prayer?

569
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,838
Yes. Yes!

570
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,873
We are children of sin all,

571
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,873
yet I tell thee, I have raised up
no witch in this house.

572
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:25,395
Let us pray,
then we need fear nothing.

573
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,392
We shall never lie open
to the wicked one.

574
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,831
Pray for thy brother.

575
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,080
- You must believe us!
- Evil wretches!

576
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,394
Thomasin!

577
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,471
Pray.

578
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:44,112
Our Father, which art in
Heaven, hallowed be thy name...

579
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,758
Jonas, pray.

580
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,759
I... I cannot remember my prayer.

581
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,752
- What?
- Nor l. I cannot.

582
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,432
What nonsense is this?

583
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,670
Speak, children.

584
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,433
Our Father, which
art in Heaven...

585
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,357
...hallowed be thy name

586
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,358
Stop it! Stop it!

587
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,596
Pray, you beasts.

588
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,240
Get on thy knees and pray!

589
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,432
Thomasin!

590
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,956
I don't hear this. This is not so.

591
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,791
It's her!

592
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,757
A cat.

593
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,432
A crow.

594
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,469
A raven. A three-legged dog. A wolf!

595
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,154
She desires of my blood.

596
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,798
She desires of my blood.

597
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,075
- Satan upon me!
- She desires of my blood!

598
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,794
She sends 'em upon me.

599
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,509
My Lord, my Jesus!
Save me!

600
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,672
- Think on Christ!
- She sends her devils!

601
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,117
I am thine enemy, wallowing
in the blood of my sins!

602
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,310
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want

603
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,516
He maketh me to lie
in green pastures,

604
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,919
and leadeth me by the still water...

605
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,553
I am thine enemy...

606
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,148
I am thine enemy,

607
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,356
wallowing on the blood
and filth of my sin!

608
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,438
- ...I will fear no evil
- For thou art with me.

609
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,834
Caleb... Caleb...

610
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,031
Cast a light of countenance
upon me.

611
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,510
Spread over me
the lap of Thy love.

612
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,717
Wash me in the everflowing
fountains of Thy blood.

613
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,351
Holy Thine I am,
my sweet Lord Jesus.

614
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:44,549
My Lord, my love, kiss me
with the kisses of Thy mouth.

615
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,390
How lovely art Thou.

616
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,590
Thy embrace!

617
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,989
My Lord!

618
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,548
My Lord!
My love!

619
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,995
My sole salvation!

620
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,911
Take me to Thy lap!

621
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,278
Caleb...

622
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,112
Caleb?

623
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,276
Caleb?

624
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,957
Caleb.

625
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,634
Caleb...

626
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:47,191
Wake up, please! Wake up!

627
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,838
Wake up, wake up.

628
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,673
Wake up.

629
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,755
He is dead!

630
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:07,197
He is dead!

631
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,589
Jonas, Mercy, get up.

632
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,599
Get up!

633
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,036
Get away from him!
Get thee gone!

634
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,394
Thomasin!

635
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,198
Thomasin. Thomasin...

636
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,508
My girl...

637
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,949
This tree will be
lovely come spring.

638
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,349
Do you remember
when we came hither?

639
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,670
Such a pretty tree.

640
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,114
Next year I'll just own us
a wheat field.

641
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,913
Start it at this tree
and end it thither.

642
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,434
We'd have been a proper farm then.

643
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,429
Brought us a big fat milk cow,
finished us the barn.

644
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,314
You must tell me, Thomasin.

645
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,717
Tomorrow I cannot keep secret of this.

646
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,394
The council will be called
and thy life is...

647
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,869
- Thy life...
- Will you not believe me?

648
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,872
I saw The Serpent in my son.
You stopped their prayer, Thom...

649
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,714
- They lie!
- I saw it.

650
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,837
Caleb disappeared with thee.

651
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,390
- I love Caleb.
- And who then found him,

652
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,078
pale as death,

653
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,277
naked as sin and witch'd?

654
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,630
Thomasin, listen to me.

655
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,870
The bargain that was made
is of no effect.

656
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,110
- I made no bargain.
- Thy soul belongeth to Christ.

657
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,879
- I made no bargain.
- The Devil hath no interest in thee.

658
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,509
- I am no witch, father.
- What did I but see in my house?

659
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,875
- Will you not hear me?
- Prithee, confess.

660
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,831
Why have you turned against me?

661
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,157
Christ can un-witch us
if you will but speak truth to me.

662
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,869
As I love thee, speak truth.

663
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,839
- You ask me to speak truth?
- I beg thee.

664
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,037
You and Mother planned
to rid the farm of me.

665
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,430
Aye, I heard you speak of it.

666
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,511
Is that truth?

667
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,832
You took of Mother's cup
and let her rail at me.

668
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,309
You confessed not
till it was too late.

669
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,391
- Is that truth?
- Peace thee.

670
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,754
- I will not.
- I am thy father.

671
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,991
- You are a hypocrite!
- Hold thy tongue, daughter mine.

672
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,878
You took Caleb to the wood and let me
take the blame of that too.

673
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,678
Is that truth?

674
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,032
You let Mother be as thy master.

675
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,839
You cannot bring the crops to yield!
You cannot hunt!

676
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,638
- Is that truth enough?
- Enough.

677
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,756
Thou canst do nothing
save cut wood!

678
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,068
Bitch!

679
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,469
And you will not hear me!

680
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,318
Must I hear the Devil
wag his tongue in thy mouth?

681
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,117
Ask the twins then!

682
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,992
Go on, ask them!

683
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,514
They spend all day long
babbling to that horned beast.

684
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,828
They know well his voice.

685
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,239
Go to.

686
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,676
The Adversary oft comes
in the shape of a he-goat.

687
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,633
And whispers.
Aye, whispers!

688
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,470
He is Lucifer.
You know it.

689
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,790
- The twins know it too.
- Slander thy brethren no more.

690
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,998
- It is they!
- From my sight!

691
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,071
T'was they and that goat
what bewitched this whole farm.

692
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,388
Lies.

693
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,239
Was't a wolf stole Sam?

694
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:03,039
I never saw no wolf.

695
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,917
Mercy told me herself
by the stream,

696
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,468
"I be the Witch of the Wood."

697
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,232
Get up. Rise!

698
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,076
- What is this?
- Speak.

699
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,991
I am no witch.

700
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,036
Get her from me sight!
I'll not have her in this house!

701
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,872
She is no witch, Katherine.

702
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,599
What is the cause, daughter?
Tell thy Mother!

703
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,033
I cannot know for certain.

704
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,838
Thou toldst me well thou knew.

705
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,399
I cannot look at her.

706
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,109
Aye, but ye shall.
Thomasin. Thomasin!

707
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,996
Jonas and Mercy.

708
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,958
They make covenant with the Devil
in the shape of Black Phillip.

709
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,396
Dost hear that, ye black minions?

710
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,109
Dost hear that, you devils?

711
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,796
Wake! Wake from this!

712
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,832
Did ye makes some
unholy bond with that goat?

713
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,798
Speak, if this be pretense.

714
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:38,556
Dissemblers!
Grave pretenders all.

715
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,471
Hear me this:

716
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,552
I will not play a fool
to children's games!

717
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,710
This is no sport, William.

718
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,156
Yet these lies from our babes' mouths
are but trifles to them.

719
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,152
- I do not lie.
- Silence, creature!

720
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,199
Thy son is dead, damned!

721
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,191
- Caleb did but cry Jesus.
- The Devil!

722
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,508
Thou know it not.

723
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,234
- The Devil will speak scripture too!
- Thou know it not.

724
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,151
- Tis not true!
- We are damned!

725
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,673
Wake!

726
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,957
Fetch the billhook, wife,

727
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,077
and I will smite Jonas as Abraham
would have done his seed.

728
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,434
No, stop it! Stop it!

729
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,512
Fetch the billhook
and I will dash his skull!

730
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,951
- No!
- Do you see?

731
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,679
- Stop it...
- Do you see now?

732
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:28,517
Please, father.
No, it's not safe. Not with them!

733
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,310
Keep me from this goat.

734
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,311
If that old billy be the Devil,
I'd have danced with him myself.

735
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,835
I'll break thee out upon the dawn
and we'll set back to the plantation.

736
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,831
Think on thy sins.

737
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,830
Are you witches?

738
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,350
Does father think I am?

739
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,793
Are you?

740
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,393
No.

741
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,316
Does he really speak to thee?

742
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,555
It is my fault.

743
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,276
I confess it.

744
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,998
I confess it.

745
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,030
Oh, my God.

746
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,353
My own fault.

747
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,759
I am infected with the filth of pride.

748
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,750
I know it.

749
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,432
I am.

750
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:31,794
Dispose of me how Thou will't...

751
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,398
...yet redeem my children.

752
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,959
They cannot tame their natural evils.

753
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:52,037
I lie before Thee a coward...

754
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,750
...and Thine enemy.

755
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:00,673
And I lick the dust of Thine earth.

756
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,116
I beg thee.

757
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,272
Save my children.

758
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:20,630
I beg Thee, my Christ,

759
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,429
I have not damned my family.

760
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:45,515
Me lambs... me angels!

761
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,549
Mother, we have longed to see you so.

762
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,232
As I to thee.

763
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:13,637
I must wake thy father!
He will be so glad.

764
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:17,918
No, let him sleep.

765
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,031
We would see you oft, Mother.

766
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,998
- Would that please you?
- Aye.

767
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,430
I have brought
a book for you, Mother.

768
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,990
- Will you look at it with me?
- Aye.

769
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,311
Oh, one moment now.
Samuel's hungry.

770
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,638
Oh, come, come, little Sam.

771
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,511
Come, come.

772
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,149
Flora? Flora?

773
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,519
Corruption.

774
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,158
Thou art my father.

775
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,154
What hast thou done?!

776
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,635
- Where are they?
- I know not what I saw.

777
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,711
- Where are they?!
- I did nothing!

778
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:27,349
- She came from the sky! She...
- Devil!

779
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,432
You have their blood upon thy hands!

780
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,271
It is you!

781
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,352
- It is you!
- I am your daughter!

782
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,069
The Devil is in thee
and have had thee.

783
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:46,994
You're smeared of his sin.
You reek of Evil!

784
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,719
- You've made a covenant with death!
- Mother!

785
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,679
You bewitched thy brother,
proud slut!

786
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,957
Did you not think I saw
thy sluttish looks to him,

787
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,508
bewitching his eye as any whore?

788
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,830
- What say you to me?
- And thy father next!

789
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,992
No.

790
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,594
You took them from me!

791
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,318
- They are gone.
- No!

792
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,312
- You killed my children!
- No!

793
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,358
You killed thy father!
You witch!

794
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,510
I love you! I love you!

795
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:12,672
Black Phillip,
I conjure thee to speak to me.

796
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:20,278
Speak as thou doth speak
to Jonas and Mercy.

797
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,639
Dost thou understand
my English tongue?

798
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,636
Answer me.

799
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,308
What dost thou want?

800
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,148
What canst thou give?

801
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:04,716
Wouldst thou like
the taste of butter?

802
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,870
A pretty dress?

803
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:13,079
Wouldst thou like
to live deliciously?

804
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:15,952
Yes.

805
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:22,276
Wouldst thou like to see the world?

806
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,317
What will you from me?

807
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:32,188
Dost thou see a book before thee?

808
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,956
Remove thy shift.

809
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,990
I cannot write my name.

810
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:15,031
I will guide thy hand.
