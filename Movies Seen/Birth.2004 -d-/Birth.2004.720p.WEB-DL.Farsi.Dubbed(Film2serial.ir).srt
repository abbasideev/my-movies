1
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:11,637
Okay... let me say this.

2
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:14,765
Let me say this.

3
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,915
If I lost my wife and...

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,002
the next day, a little bird
landed on my windowsill,

5
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:23,608
looked me right in the eye,

6
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:28,154
and in plain English said,
"Sean, it's me, Anna. I'm back,"...

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,722
What could I say?
I guess I'd believe her. Or I'd want to.

8
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:35,453
I'd be stuck with a bird.

9
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:38,060
But other than that, no.

10
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:41,313
I'm a man of science.
I just don't believe that mumbo-jumbo.

11
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,503
Now, that's gonna have
to be the last question.

12
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:45,505
I need to go running before I head home.

13
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,413
Okay.

14
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,345
Excuse me.

15
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,746
I forgot the ribbon.

16
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:51,769
Come on. I don't want to go up alone.

17
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:53,813
I'll be a minute.

18
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:28,535
Hi, I...

19
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,267
I met Anna at a party.

20
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:37,440
And I called her to see if she'd
go out with me, but she said no.

21
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,088
But I kept calling.

22
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:43,529
It took one year
to get her to have dinner with me.

23
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:48,534
A year after that,
I asked her to marry me.

24
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:50,057
She said no.

25
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:53,664
A year later, I asked her again
and she still said no.

26
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,522
Two weeks ago...

27
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:59,128
she said "Maybe."

28
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:04,258
Tonight I stand before you with a "Yes."

29
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,307
Hi.

30
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,852
- How are you?
- Good.

31
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,627
I left... the ribbon in the car.

32
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:20,233
I'll be up in a minute.

33
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:20,394
Hi.

34
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,773
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks.

35
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:29,070
Would you like me to wrap it?

36
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:30,863
Make it look pretty.

37
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:33,783
Anna.

38
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,452
Clifford.

39
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,625
It's been a long time.

40
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,588
This is a good thing. Congratulations.

41
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,613
- Hi.
- Hi.

42
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,031
I'm Joseph.

43
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,637
- This is...
- Clifford.

44
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:58,161
Congratulations. Nice speech.

45
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:00,101
I've heard a lot about you.

46
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:04,459
Clara's here. She forgot a ribbon.

47
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:06,315
For your present.

48
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,172
So I better go and wait for her.

49
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:10,611
Enjoy the festivities.

50
00:10:10,716 --> 00:10:12,363
I will. We will.

51
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:13,739
Thank you.

52
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:18,911
I liked what you said.

53
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,946
Sean!

54
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,763
Sean!

55
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,202
One minute!

56
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,834
I'm coming!

57
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,692
Let's eat this thing.

58
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:35,154
Bob, would you carve?

59
00:11:35,258 --> 00:11:36,572
Sure.

60
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,558
Are the Drummonds here?
Where are the Drummonds?

61
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:45,456
They called.
They said they' re gonna be late.

62
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,625
That they'd be here for the cake.

63
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:49,502
Fine.

64
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:52,171
Anna's made a decision.

65
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,343
You've picked a date?

66
00:11:57,447 --> 00:12:01,201
- The merry month of May.
- Fantastic.

67
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,224
- Joe, congratulations.
- Thank you, Bob.

68
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,188
I wanted to tell her.

69
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,649
It's my wedding.

70
00:12:11,753 --> 00:12:13,380
Can't I be excited?

71
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:15,027
May's a great month.

72
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:16,842
Nice and warm.

73
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:19,365
- Well done, Joseph.
- Thank you.

74
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:46,455
Hi.

75
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,394
Are you coming to Eleanor's party?

76
00:12:48,498 --> 00:12:50,479
No. I want to see Anna.

77
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:57,674
I used to take lessons and then I stopped.
I... I wish I hadn't.

78
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,614
We're gonna do the cake.

79
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:01,845
Sorry we're late.

80
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,367
In the dining room.

81
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:05,578
Thank you.

82
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:52,458
Here we are.

83
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:56,504
Can you get the knife for her?

84
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:57,922
Look at that.

85
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:03,490
No, I don't believe it. Nice work.

86
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,534
Make a wish, Eleanor.

87
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:08,057
Laura and Anna on each side of me.

88
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,977
Happy birthday, Mother.

89
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,770
Happy birthday, Mom.

90
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,325
I'm here to see Anna.

91
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:29,412
Who are you?

92
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,313
Who are you?

93
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:38,087
Let's go into the kitchen.
I'll tell you there.

94
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,549
Are you gonna play a trick on me?

95
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:42,800
No.

96
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:46,345
Okay.

97
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:58,086
He wants to talk to me in private.

98
00:14:58,191 --> 00:14:59,942
Could you believe that?

99
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,161
What do you want?

100
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:13,915
You.

101
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:17,251
You want me? Is that what you're saying?

102
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:18,669
You're my wife.

103
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:25,218
We're married? You're telling me
that we got married at some point in time?

104
00:15:25,322 --> 00:15:26,636
Yes.

105
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,100
Well... I'm getting married to Joseph.
He's a little bit older than you.

106
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:35,645
We have a little bit more in common.

107
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:41,338
But if the timing was
a little bit different, who knows? Maybe.

108
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:44,862
You're a handsome little boy.
But I'm getting married to someone else.

109
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:46,906
It's me...

110
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,658
Sean.

111
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:56,415
You're telling me that you're Sean?

112
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,834
Yes.

113
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,754
Let's go.

114
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:10,012
You'll be making a big mistake
if you marry Joseph.

115
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:21,941
Jimmy, do you know who this is?

116
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:23,192
Sean.

117
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,071
Does he live in the building?

118
00:16:27,175 --> 00:16:28,176
No.

119
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,199
Then put him in a taxi and send him home.

120
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:31,409
Sure.

121
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:41,794
Do you know how to take the subway?

122
00:16:41,898 --> 00:16:44,380
- Yeah.
- You're not supposed to be here tonight.

123
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:48,926
Go home.

124
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,936
So?

125
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:09,822
He says he's Sean.

126
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:13,492
Sean.

127
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:15,223
Right.

128
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:16,996
His name was Sean.

129
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:22,043
No, really. Jimmy said downstairs.

130
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,050
He says he doesn't want me
to marry Joseph.

131
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:57,828
He said I shouldn't marry you.

132
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:34,031
I'll pull the car around.

133
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:35,616
Okay.

134
00:19:08,608 --> 00:19:09,859
Good morning.

135
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:13,091
What's this?

136
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:14,906
It was laying on my desk.

137
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,534
Your man is here.

138
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:25,747
Hey, Anna.

139
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:27,562
Hey, Peter.

140
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:36,258
This is fantastic.

141
00:20:36,362 --> 00:20:37,718
Are you trying to tell me

142
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:40,575
that this little boy is now urging you
not to marry Joseph?

143
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:41,993
What's fantastic about it?

144
00:20:42,097 --> 00:20:44,495
Well, I mean, how often
does someone come along

145
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,539
claiming to be somebody who's dead?

146
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,959
And much less a little boy.

147
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:53,358
Why didn't you tell me?

148
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:56,278
I... I'm telling you now.
I didn't want to upset you.

149
00:20:56,382 --> 00:20:57,592
Well, who the hell is he?

150
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:03,827
Is he claiming to be...
Sean, or is he just called Sean?

151
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:07,518
He said, "It's me, Sean."
What am I supposed to think?

152
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:11,731
I suppose that that tells me
that he's telling me he's Sean.

153
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,692
That he is your dead husband.

154
00:21:14,796 --> 00:21:16,381
That he is...

155
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,863
Oh, that he is what?

156
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:22,387
Could it be true?

157
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:24,577
Oh, please. God help me. Somebody.

158
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:41,344
This is Jimmy.

159
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:46,891
Watch the fort.

160
00:21:49,227 --> 00:21:51,145
Why did you think it would upset me?

161
00:21:54,065 --> 00:21:55,462
Has it?

162
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:58,236
Well, you didn't show it to me
when you first got it, so...

163
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,259
I didn't open it until I got to work.

164
00:22:01,364 --> 00:22:02,865
Weren't you curious?

165
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,785
I didn't know who it was from.

166
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:08,746
Anyway, don't be silly.

167
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,477
Do me up.

168
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:12,041
We're gonna be late.

169
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,838
I can understand why a little boy
would be in love with you.

170
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,757
Let's stop talking about the little boy.

171
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:22,343
I want to go out with my fiancé.

172
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:23,699
Okay.

173
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:25,137
I love you.

174
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:30,852
Don't you think we should call Jimmy
and find out who he is?

175
00:22:30,956 --> 00:22:33,542
Christ. Let's just forget about it.

176
00:22:33,646 --> 00:22:34,981
Aren't you interested?

177
00:22:36,357 --> 00:22:37,525
No.

178
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:44,156
It's probably just some prank.

179
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:59,568
Hey, Jimmy. Joseph, 1001.

180
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:02,842
<i>Listen, a little boy named Sean
left a letter for Anna...</i>

181
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:04,594
Jimmy's outside.

182
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:09,140
Who is this?

183
00:23:09,244 --> 00:23:10,808
Sean.

184
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:20,526
I think your husband's downstairs.

185
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:31,621
Hey.

186
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,732
You're on your own?

187
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:40,213
My dad's upstairs.

188
00:23:40,317 --> 00:23:43,174
Does your father live here?

189
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:44,821
No.

190
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:46,761
Can I talk to your father?

191
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:15,331
202.

192
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:24,882
My father's a tutor.

193
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,486
Yes, hi. I'm Joseph. I live upstairs.

194
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,968
Oh, sure. Hi. Hi, Sean.

195
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:49,344
Everything all right?

196
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,075
I just need to talk to his father.

197
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,326
I'll be right back.

198
00:24:58,416 --> 00:24:59,730
What's wrong?

199
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:01,836
- Everything's fine.
- Who are you?

200
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,380
Joseph from upstairs.

201
00:25:04,484 --> 00:25:06,737
Yeah, sure. What's wrong?

202
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:09,010
- Well...
- What's wrong? What's the problem?

203
00:25:09,114 --> 00:25:11,012
I need to talk to you about your son.

204
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:15,433
I'll be right back.

205
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:22,899
202.

206
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:31,991
I want you to tell her right now that you'll
never see her or bother her again.

207
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:33,138
I can't.

208
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:36,078
Tell her you'll never see her
or bother her again.

209
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:41,396
No.

210
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:42,627
- Do it.
- No.

211
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:44,212
Tell her, Sean.

212
00:25:44,316 --> 00:25:45,776
I can't.

213
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,861
Why did you write this?

214
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,842
Why did you go into her house?

215
00:25:49,946 --> 00:25:51,740
I needed to talk to her.

216
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:56,224
Well, I want you to tell her right now that
you'll never see her or bother her again.

217
00:25:57,517 --> 00:25:58,747
- No.
- Sean, tell her.

218
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,269
- No.
- You're hurting me.

219
00:26:00,374 --> 00:26:03,481
Sean, tell her you'll never see her
or bother her again.

220
00:26:03,585 --> 00:26:04,711
I can't.

221
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:06,651
Do you understand that?

222
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,779
- Say it.
- I can't.

223
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:14,742
I don't want you to bother me again.

224
00:26:17,954 --> 00:26:19,455
We're gonna be late.

225
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:24,085
Thank you.

226
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:45,439
Well done.

227
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:19,156
I don't know.

228
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,679
I just think it's
a little bit funny, that's all.

229
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:25,057
No, it's not funny.
I'm taking it out of context.

230
00:29:25,162 --> 00:29:28,394
He says that he's somebody else,
and he believes that he is.

231
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:31,460
That's ridiculous.

232
00:29:31,564 --> 00:29:33,858
I don't know these people.
I don't know who they are.

233
00:29:33,962 --> 00:29:36,027
These people have money, that's all.

234
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,866
And he wrote this woman a letter. He's...

235
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,493
He wrote her a letter
not to marry this guy.

236
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:51,584
Permission to turn off the light, sir.

237
00:29:54,754 --> 00:29:56,589
Permission to turn off the light.

238
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:04,639
The men are talking below deck, sir.

239
00:30:09,727 --> 00:30:11,437
They're talking mutiny.

240
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:23,282
It's your responsibility
to steer the ship.

241
00:30:26,202 --> 00:30:28,371
It's just seasickness, sir.

242
00:30:28,475 --> 00:30:31,249
I'm not your stupid son anymore.

243
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:41,986
Go to the principal and explain
why you're late for my class!

244
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:15,540
Anna...

245
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:18,022
<i>You're being silly about this.</i>

246
00:32:19,023 --> 00:32:20,691
<i>Meet me at the park.</i>

247
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:22,985
<i>You know where.</i>

248
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:31,202
I thought you and Joseph
were going to talk to him.

249
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:32,891
We did.

250
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:35,498
- So why's he calling the house?
- I don't know.

251
00:32:54,392 --> 00:32:55,852
What was the message?

252
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:02,400
He said he wanted you to go
and meet him in the park.

253
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,361
That you'd know where to go.

254
00:33:05,465 --> 00:33:06,904
That's what he said.

255
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,245
You think this is a game?
You think this is funny?

256
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:20,663
No.

257
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,044
What if Bob comes
to my house and tests me?

258
00:35:30,715 --> 00:35:32,425
How do you know Bob?

259
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:34,802
He was my brother-in-law.

260
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:40,558
If he asks me some questions
and I get them right, will you believe me?

261
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:46,856
Will you believe me?

262
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:50,943
Who told me there wasn't a Santa Claus?

263
00:35:53,696 --> 00:35:55,615
I'll know them when I see them.

264
00:35:56,908 --> 00:35:59,076
You're just a little boy.

265
00:36:13,174 --> 00:36:14,509
It's amazing.

266
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:19,430
It is.

267
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,099
I can't figure it out.

268
00:36:23,476 --> 00:36:24,894
Me neither.

269
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:28,606
He knew where Sean died.

270
00:36:34,904 --> 00:36:36,280
I'm tired.

271
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:40,910
Let's sleep.

272
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:58,219
We'll get him.

273
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:17,488
I'm going to tape this... okay?

274
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:22,326
I'm not a psychiatrist.

275
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:25,538
I'm not a therapist.

276
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:28,875
I'm just a regular doctor.

277
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:36,653
You know... if you were my brother-in-law,

278
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:41,095
you'd say it was impossible for you
to be sitting right here in front of me.

279
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:44,515
You didn't believe in life after death.

280
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:49,207
You believed that only matter survives

281
00:37:49,312 --> 00:37:55,109
and that the mind, soul, spirit...
whatever you want to call it...

282
00:37:55,213 --> 00:37:57,758
disappears forever.

283
00:37:57,862 --> 00:37:59,447
What do you want to know?

284
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:04,493
Okay.

285
00:38:05,912 --> 00:38:07,893
Where did you live?

286
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:10,374
In the apartment where Anna lives now.

287
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:13,794
Didn't you and Anna have your own place?

288
00:38:13,899 --> 00:38:15,275
- No.
- Why not?

289
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:16,714
I wasn't around much.

290
00:38:16,818 --> 00:38:19,217
I was too busy working.

291
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:20,947
Where?

292
00:38:21,052 --> 00:38:22,386
Different places.

293
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:24,430
Give me one.

294
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:29,393
Your hospital. I lectured there.

295
00:38:30,311 --> 00:38:31,562
About what?

296
00:38:32,438 --> 00:38:34,732
Splitting the atom.

297
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,783
Why don't you and Laura
have your own place anymore?

298
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:51,874
- We do.
- Why aren't you living there?

299
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:56,587
- What do you remember about Anna...
- You lost your job.

300
00:38:56,692 --> 00:39:00,487
No. No, I didn't lose my job.

301
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:02,364
We're redecorating.

302
00:39:02,468 --> 00:39:03,845
We're having a baby.

303
00:39:04,804 --> 00:39:05,930
Wow.

304
00:39:07,098 --> 00:39:09,809
I didn't think she could have a baby.

305
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:18,609
<i>Let's just stick to Anna.</i>

306
00:39:21,529 --> 00:39:25,199
<i>How about something... intimate.</i>

307
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:28,452
<i>We got married 30 times.</i>

308
00:39:29,996 --> 00:39:31,643
<i>That's a lot.</i>

309
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:34,584
<i>Thirty churches in 30 days.</i>

310
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,026
<i>Was I ever your best man?</i>

311
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,216
<i>- Clifford was my best man.
- Clifford was your best man.</i>

312
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:48,306
How about something
that you couldn't have overheard,

313
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,641
or looked up.

314
00:39:53,603 --> 00:39:55,688
We did it on your sofa.

315
00:39:58,065 --> 00:39:59,629
Okay.

316
00:39:59,734 --> 00:40:01,319
The green sofa.

317
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:09,911
Look, you can think whatever you want.

318
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:13,602
Everybody can think what they want.

319
00:40:13,706 --> 00:40:16,918
You can talk to whoever you want.
It doesn't matter.

320
00:40:17,022 --> 00:40:21,923
<i>I'm Sean, I love Anna,
and nothing is going to change that.</i>

321
00:40:22,027 --> 00:40:23,341
<i>Nothing.</i>

322
00:40:24,884 --> 00:40:26,469
<i>That's forever.</i>

323
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:31,015
<i>Okay.</i>

324
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:33,434
<i>Thank you.</i>

325
00:41:04,674 --> 00:41:07,510
Can I get... either of you
something to drink?

326
00:41:07,614 --> 00:41:08,699
No.

327
00:41:08,803 --> 00:41:10,534
Yes, please.

328
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:12,244
Want some juice?

329
00:41:12,348 --> 00:41:14,058
- Apple.
- Please.

330
00:41:14,162 --> 00:41:15,831
Please.

331
00:41:15,935 --> 00:41:17,436
Remember me?

332
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:20,502
A little.

333
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:22,567
Well, I'm gonna keep an eye on you...

334
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:26,445
in case you start upsetting this family.

335
00:41:44,881 --> 00:41:46,445
Sean?

336
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:48,718
Would you like to come sit down?

337
00:41:48,822 --> 00:41:50,657
I'm gonna say it now.

338
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:53,431
I'm just gonna say it right now.

339
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:56,267
You are not my sister's husband.

340
00:41:58,102 --> 00:41:59,624
He's not.

341
00:41:59,729 --> 00:42:02,440
So let's just start from there.

342
00:42:03,316 --> 00:42:07,153
And from now on,
we're gonna tell the truth.

343
00:42:07,257 --> 00:42:09,113
No more lying.

344
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:11,699
Thank you, Lee.

345
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,794
There's cake left from my birthday party.
Would you like to have some?

346
00:42:27,465 --> 00:42:30,426
He told me he's not my son anymore.

347
00:42:43,314 --> 00:42:45,483
Let him sleep here tonight.

348
00:42:52,198 --> 00:42:54,659
I'm gonna break this spell.

349
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:04,877
I'll pick him up from school tomorrow
and I'll bring him back to you.

350
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:15,304
Don't touch that.

351
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,778
This is my desk.

352
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:45,793
I used to work here.

353
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,397
Do you know me?

354
00:44:06,501 --> 00:44:07,773
Yes.

355
00:44:08,774 --> 00:44:12,904
But we didn't meet officially
at the birthday party.

356
00:44:15,031 --> 00:44:16,282
No.

357
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:19,827
No. That's right. We didn't.

358
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,247
And do you know my name?

359
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:28,461
Do you know my name?

360
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:30,609
No.

361
00:44:30,713 --> 00:44:32,381
Then how do you know me?

362
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,511
You were the one that told Anna
there wasn't a Santa Claus.

363
00:44:48,439 --> 00:44:50,358
How do you know where Sean died?

364
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,988
Do you know what déjà vu is?

365
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,636
Sure.

366
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,242
It was like that.

367
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:02,870
How did Sean meet Anna?

368
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:05,665
Didn't she tell you?

369
00:45:10,795 --> 00:45:12,797
How did Sean meet Anna?

370
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:14,778
We met at the beach.

371
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:18,386
How's Mr. Reincarnation enjoying his cake?

372
00:45:19,345 --> 00:45:21,222
He likes it.

373
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:23,724
Where's Anna?

374
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,936
The only reason she's
letting you stay in this house

375
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,481
is because she wants to help you.
So don't get the wrong idea.

376
00:45:31,315 --> 00:45:33,150
How do you know what you know?

377
00:45:35,194 --> 00:45:36,654
I'm Sean.

378
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:26,621
You don't have me fooled.

379
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:52,605
I was surprised to see you at the party.

380
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:54,857
I wasn't expecting you to come.

381
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:58,131
I'm sorry. I... It's been so long.

382
00:46:58,236 --> 00:47:01,697
Too many memories, you know? I'm sorry...

383
00:47:01,802 --> 00:47:03,929
What? That's okay.

384
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:05,826
- I apologize.
- It's okay.

385
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,709
I've met...

386
00:47:15,253 --> 00:47:20,967
I've met somebody who...
who seems to be... Sean.

387
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:23,594
What do you mean?

388
00:47:24,804 --> 00:47:25,992
What are you saying?

389
00:47:26,097 --> 00:47:28,599
I understand that this
is gonna sound crazy,

390
00:47:28,704 --> 00:47:32,854
and it's not like I haven't already
laughed about it, believe me, and...

391
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:36,899
You know that I loved Sean. You know.

392
00:47:37,004 --> 00:47:38,276
So much.

393
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,486
Of course.

394
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,490
If anyone understands that,
you understand it.

395
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:47,827
You know I sent you a card.

396
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,872
Christmas.

397
00:47:53,374 --> 00:47:54,959
You got those?

398
00:47:55,063 --> 00:47:56,335
Yeah.

399
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:57,983
Yeah.

400
00:47:58,087 --> 00:48:00,402
It's taken me this long,

401
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:03,301
and I can't get him out
of my system. I can't.

402
00:48:04,093 --> 00:48:09,015
I can't. It's not...
gotten any easier for me.

403
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,266
And...

404
00:48:11,434 --> 00:48:13,040
I met... I met Joseph,

405
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:16,251
and he... he loves me,
he sincerely does love me.

406
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:19,650
And he's... you know,
he's been dealing with me on this.

407
00:48:19,755 --> 00:48:21,882
He's been...

408
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:24,614
he's been acceptant of it and he's not...

409
00:48:25,823 --> 00:48:28,492
He's now grown insecure.

410
00:48:28,597 --> 00:48:30,515
Because of him.

411
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:33,498
I mean, he's ten years old.

412
00:48:33,602 --> 00:48:35,833
What are you saying?

413
00:48:35,937 --> 00:48:38,065
He's a little boy.

414
00:48:38,169 --> 00:48:40,650
He's a little boy, I know, and...

415
00:48:40,755 --> 00:48:43,904
he said... and he told me
his name was Sean, you know...

416
00:48:44,008 --> 00:48:47,512
I really hoped that he was Sean,
I really... I wanted him to be Sean,

417
00:48:47,616 --> 00:48:50,264
but I knew he wasn't Sean. I knew it.

418
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:52,266
This is insane. I mean...

419
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:57,104
It's insane, you know.
But I couldn't help it. I couldn't.

420
00:49:00,024 --> 00:49:03,486
I don't think there's anything strange
about that. I mean, he is...

421
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:07,719
he is coming into... our house.

422
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:11,515
He came into my mother's
birthday party unannounced.

423
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:16,144
He came in, and we thought that he was
with the... the Drummonds, you know.

424
00:49:16,249 --> 00:49:18,751
You remember Mr. and Mrs. Drummond,
don't you?

425
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,942
Yeah.

426
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:23,214
I'm sorry.

427
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:25,132
Well...

428
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:30,534
He came in... with them

429
00:49:30,638 --> 00:49:34,538
and he told me that he loves me

430
00:49:34,642 --> 00:49:37,478
and that he doesn't want me
to marry Joseph.

431
00:49:39,438 --> 00:49:43,192
And I thought,
"This is a joke. It's silly."

432
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:46,988
And I told him to go home,

433
00:49:47,092 --> 00:49:50,324
and then... he sent me a letter
the next day that said...

434
00:49:52,577 --> 00:49:54,161
"Don't marry Joseph."

435
00:49:56,706 --> 00:49:58,875
I mean, normally you'd think this is...

436
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:00,564
<i>Normally...</i>

437
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:02,858
"This kid needs some help."

438
00:50:02,962 --> 00:50:05,256
And I told him I didn't want
to see him again,

439
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,758
and then he...

440
00:50:11,137 --> 00:50:12,951
he collapsed.

441
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:15,224
And it... it hit me.

442
00:50:29,113 --> 00:50:30,281
Anna...

443
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:35,328
I don't know how he knows
so much about me, but he does.

444
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,684
How can I help?

445
00:50:37,788 --> 00:50:40,458
I don't want to fall
in love again with Sean.

446
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:43,252
You understand?

447
00:50:45,254 --> 00:50:47,089
And that's what's happening.

448
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:52,053
And I need you to come and help me,
and I need you to talk to him,

449
00:50:52,157 --> 00:50:54,305
and I need you to tell him to go away.

450
00:50:57,808 --> 00:50:58,851
Sure.

451
00:51:02,313 --> 00:51:03,481
Yeah, sure.

452
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:08,319
Because I can't do it.

453
00:52:00,121 --> 00:52:04,709
A man has to support his wife. He has
to feed her, defend her, take care of her.

454
00:52:07,545 --> 00:52:10,819
How are you gonna feed me,
defend me... take care of me?

455
00:52:10,923 --> 00:52:12,341
How are you gonna do that?

456
00:52:12,446 --> 00:52:13,885
I'll get a job.

457
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:24,937
How are you gonna fulfill my needs?

458
00:52:27,732 --> 00:52:29,567
I know what you're talking about.

459
00:52:34,363 --> 00:52:36,199
You're ready for that?

460
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:45,875
You ever made love to a girl?

461
00:52:51,172 --> 00:52:52,715
You'd be the first.

462
00:52:57,929 --> 00:52:59,305
That's my bus.

463
00:53:39,136 --> 00:53:43,245
Listen, I appreciate
that you like me so much, but you're...

464
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:46,519
you're imagining something that it...
it isn't real.

465
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:50,189
I mean, you're gonna eventually
meet someone your own age

466
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,149
and you'll forget about me.

467
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:21,262
I'm just gonna wait for her here
by this window.

468
00:54:21,366 --> 00:54:24,036
- No answer?
- No.

469
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,517
- I'm gonna let them in.
- Pretend I'm not here.

470
00:54:26,621 --> 00:54:28,936
- They have an appointment too.
- Sure.

471
00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:39,092
This is a four-bedroom apartment.
The kitchen's back here.

472
00:54:39,197 --> 00:54:43,638
And if you come this way, the moldings
and the wall fixtures are original.

473
00:54:43,743 --> 00:54:45,244
This is the first bedroom.

474
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:47,830
Isn't it spacious? I just love the light.

475
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:00,194
<i>I hope you weren't too worried.</i>

476
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,176
No. I'm fine.

477
00:56:03,281 --> 00:56:04,553
<i>If it's okay with you,</i>

478
00:56:04,657 --> 00:56:08,411
I think he should hear the music tonight
and know that we're getting married.

479
00:56:12,748 --> 00:56:14,417
<i>I'll bring him back later.</i>

480
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:15,793
Great.

481
00:56:17,086 --> 00:56:18,754
<i>Tell him I love him.</i>

482
00:56:20,548 --> 00:56:21,716
Bye.

483
00:58:06,445 --> 00:58:07,780
What are you doing?

484
00:58:08,948 --> 00:58:10,908
I'm looking at my wife.

485
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,749
I want you to leave.

486
00:59:59,684 --> 01:00:01,018
I'd like you to stop that.

487
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:25,168
It's not a funny matter.

488
01:00:26,002 --> 01:00:27,879
- It's not a funny matter.
- No!

489
01:00:27,983 --> 01:00:29,609
Anna, stay away!

490
01:00:29,714 --> 01:00:30,965
- Stay away.
- Joe!

491
01:00:34,135 --> 01:00:36,137
Hey, Joe...

492
01:00:38,264 --> 01:00:40,016
Joe. Joe!

493
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,142
Joe!

494
01:00:43,394 --> 01:00:44,416
I'm great.

495
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,273
- Are you okay?
- I'm great. I'm great.

496
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:54,968
He has no clue
how to make something happen.

497
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:58,326
He's living in a land where he's pretending
to be something instead of doing the job.

498
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:00,077
And that's the real problem.

499
01:01:01,078 --> 01:01:03,998
I'm the one who should
be respected, but obviously not.

500
01:01:22,558 --> 01:01:24,143
No, Joseph!

501
01:01:27,897 --> 01:01:29,440
He kicked my chair!

502
01:02:56,027 --> 01:02:57,153
Hello?

503
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:13,669
- Where are you going to stay?
- Bob's place.

504
01:03:17,048 --> 01:03:18,883
I'll talk to her.

505
01:03:31,229 --> 01:03:32,980
Hi.

506
01:03:34,357 --> 01:03:36,025
How are you?

507
01:03:36,129 --> 01:03:37,485
I'm okay.

508
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:50,456
Good night.

509
01:04:03,761 --> 01:04:05,763
I guess we missed the show.

510
01:04:07,515 --> 01:04:09,100
You're a little late.

511
01:04:10,101 --> 01:04:12,770
Clara left a bottle of wine in the car.

512
01:04:12,874 --> 01:04:15,022
She'll be up in a minute.

513
01:04:50,474 --> 01:04:52,643
I need to speak to Clifford.

514
01:05:06,782 --> 01:05:09,785
That's not Sean.

515
01:05:16,334 --> 01:05:17,710
Yes, it is.

516
01:05:19,629 --> 01:05:22,402
No. It's not.

517
01:05:22,507 --> 01:05:23,841
Yes, it is.

518
01:06:26,737 --> 01:06:27,905
Hi.

519
01:06:43,421 --> 01:06:45,423
You see how dirty my hands are?

520
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:52,555
Take me to the bathroom so I can wash up.

521
01:07:16,204 --> 01:07:17,371
Come in.

522
01:07:21,292 --> 01:07:22,627
Shut the door.

523
01:07:38,392 --> 01:07:39,727
Dry them.

524
01:08:09,882 --> 01:08:11,217
I've moved.

525
01:08:13,094 --> 01:08:14,595
My new address.

526
01:08:20,017 --> 01:08:21,853
Don't tell Anna.

527
01:08:23,813 --> 01:08:24,981
Okay.

528
01:08:32,363 --> 01:08:33,698
Let's go.

529
01:09:06,022 --> 01:09:08,608
It is illegal.

530
01:09:17,575 --> 01:09:19,035
Anna, look at me.

531
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:31,672
You're going to go in there right now...

532
01:09:31,777 --> 01:09:33,362
- Move.
- Sit down!

533
01:09:33,466 --> 01:09:35,551
You're going to tell Sean to go home.

534
01:09:35,655 --> 01:09:36,719
No.

535
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:42,767
If you don't, I will call his mother,
and his mother will call the police.

536
01:09:42,871 --> 01:09:44,477
You understand?

537
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:47,459
No.

538
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:48,731
Laura, move.

539
01:11:39,342 --> 01:11:41,177
What are we going to do?

540
01:11:45,056 --> 01:11:47,892
We're gonna tell your mother
that everything is okay.

541
01:11:49,977 --> 01:11:51,312
Then what?

542
01:11:53,356 --> 01:11:56,067
I don't know yet, but I'm thinking.

543
01:13:50,473 --> 01:13:52,350
You're not Sean.

544
01:13:52,454 --> 01:13:53,935
Yes, I am.

545
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:01,776
When you opened the door
for me yesterday...

546
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,778
I knew you weren't Sean.

547
01:14:05,112 --> 01:14:06,593
Who are you?

548
01:14:06,697 --> 01:14:09,742
I thought you said you're Sean.

549
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:16,249
I'm your lover.

550
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:18,855
Anna's my lover.

551
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,378
I'm your lover.

552
01:14:22,922 --> 01:14:24,423
Anna's your wife.

553
01:14:39,605 --> 01:14:41,190
If you had been Sean...

554
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:44,527
and I kind of hoped you had...

555
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:49,365
you would've come to me first.

556
01:14:56,122 --> 01:14:58,124
And I would've explored this.

557
01:15:00,877 --> 01:15:02,253
But you didn't.

558
01:15:08,718 --> 01:15:10,219
Are they in the bag?

559
01:15:23,107 --> 01:15:24,692
Here they are.

560
01:15:25,776 --> 01:15:27,278
Hello.

561
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,908
Anna's little love letters.

562
01:15:43,127 --> 01:15:45,796
You can't go around
saying you're someone you're not.

563
01:16:00,728 --> 01:16:02,501
Wipe your feet.

564
01:16:02,605 --> 01:16:05,212
- Wipe your feet.
- I did too!

565
01:16:05,316 --> 01:16:07,547
- Hi, Clara.
- Hi. How are you?

566
01:16:07,652 --> 01:16:09,508
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Good.

567
01:16:09,612 --> 01:16:11,280
- Have a nice night.
- You, too.

568
01:16:25,336 --> 01:16:27,505
He gave them to me unopened.

569
01:16:28,381 --> 01:16:30,883
To prove that he loved me more.

570
01:16:32,844 --> 01:16:36,097
He couldn't leave her,
and I hated her for that. Hated her.

571
01:16:38,474 --> 01:16:42,478
When I found out she was getting
married again, I got us invited.

572
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:46,315
What a nice present it would be
to give her her letters back.

573
01:16:47,525 --> 01:16:50,945
I wrapped them. And I took them.

574
01:16:52,864 --> 01:16:54,282
But I couldn't do it.

575
01:16:57,076 --> 01:16:58,828
I changed my mind.

576
01:17:01,706 --> 01:17:03,875
Sorry, kid, but you're not him.

577
01:17:25,062 --> 01:17:27,231
Excuse me. Anna.

578
01:17:28,232 --> 01:17:29,338
Your mother just called.

579
01:17:29,442 --> 01:17:32,028
She said your sister just gave birth
to a healthy baby girl.

580
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:35,948
- Wow.
- Congratulations.

581
01:18:44,475 --> 01:18:46,394
Maybe that's Sean.

582
01:18:49,397 --> 01:18:51,712
- I believe him.
- I know you do.

583
01:18:51,816 --> 01:18:54,756
There's no way I'm gonna
leave that boy. No way.

584
01:18:54,861 --> 01:18:57,780
Don't try to make me.
You're wasting your time. Forget it.

585
01:18:59,323 --> 01:19:01,033
So what are you going to do?

586
01:19:04,829 --> 01:19:06,164
I don't know.

587
01:19:07,832 --> 01:19:10,230
The best thing for you to do is this.

588
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:12,837
Go home and write him a goodbye letter.

589
01:19:12,941 --> 01:19:15,798
Then go to see Joseph after work tomorrow.

590
01:19:15,902 --> 01:19:18,155
Don't call. Just show up.

591
01:19:18,259 --> 01:19:20,303
Tell him you're sorry, you made a mistake.

592
01:19:20,407 --> 01:19:21,721
I can't.

593
01:19:22,763 --> 01:19:24,432
When Laura wakes up, I'll call you.

594
01:19:24,536 --> 01:19:25,850
I can't.

595
01:19:27,643 --> 01:19:29,207
What if we open the beach house?

596
01:19:29,312 --> 01:19:31,480
Then you can get married
where I married your father.

597
01:19:31,585 --> 01:19:34,233
You love the water.
It'll be beautiful in May.

598
01:19:35,193 --> 01:19:37,111
Didn't you hear what I said?

599
01:19:38,237 --> 01:19:39,822
What's your name?

600
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,534
Where's your mother?

601
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:48,831
Why don't you tell us where you live?
We'll take you home.

602
01:19:48,935 --> 01:19:50,750
I can't do that.

603
01:19:50,854 --> 01:19:52,210
Why not?

604
01:19:53,211 --> 01:19:56,047
I have to go tell Anna
I'm not her husband.

605
01:19:57,507 --> 01:20:02,386
I thought I was Sean, but I found out
he was in love with another woman.

606
01:20:02,491 --> 01:20:03,930
So I can't be him.

607
01:20:04,034 --> 01:20:06,453
'Cause I'm in love with Anna.

608
01:20:06,557 --> 01:20:08,893
- No kidding.
- <i>Do you have a lost child?</i>

609
01:20:11,312 --> 01:20:15,233
Central, we have a male, white,
approximately nine to ten years of age.

610
01:20:15,337 --> 01:20:18,319
Blue jacket, black shirt, gray pants.

611
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:20,905
Let's take him back to the house.

612
01:20:21,009 --> 01:20:23,157
Hey! Come back here!

613
01:20:41,425 --> 01:20:42,635
He's back.

614
01:20:46,013 --> 01:20:48,850
I called his mother. She'll be here soon.

615
01:20:50,476 --> 01:20:51,978
He's in the bath.

616
01:21:19,213 --> 01:21:20,798
I have a plan.

617
01:21:23,509 --> 01:21:26,804
We're gonna run away together. You and me.

618
01:21:30,308 --> 01:21:31,434
Okay?

619
01:21:33,853 --> 01:21:37,607
And in 11 years, you're gonna turn 21.

620
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:38,983
Okay?

621
01:21:40,484 --> 01:21:41,819
You hear me?

622
01:21:42,778 --> 01:21:43,946
Do you hear me?

623
01:21:45,907 --> 01:21:48,576
And we're gonna get married. Okay?

624
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:58,565
I wonder...

625
01:21:58,669 --> 01:22:01,005
what you're gonna look like.

626
01:22:17,855 --> 01:22:19,482
I love you, Sean.

627
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:38,417
I'm not Sean.

628
01:23:07,071 --> 01:23:08,781
I'm not Sean.

629
01:23:09,907 --> 01:23:11,868
Because I love you.

630
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:21,335
You make no sense.

631
01:23:27,091 --> 01:23:29,427
I can't explain it to you better.

632
01:23:30,678 --> 01:23:32,597
You're gonna have to.

633
01:23:38,519 --> 01:23:40,834
Can I please have a towel, Anna.

634
01:23:40,938 --> 01:23:43,065
I have to get my clothes back on.

635
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:45,484
My mother's going to be here soon.

636
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,619
You're a little liar.

637
01:23:54,723 --> 01:23:56,308
Aren't you?!

638
01:23:56,412 --> 01:23:59,415
You're a little liar!
Is that what you are?

639
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:02,564
Is that what you are?!

640
01:24:02,668 --> 01:24:05,338
- Yes.
- Yes? Is that what you said?

641
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:07,256
Yes.

642
01:24:39,705 --> 01:24:41,040
Wow.

643
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:43,626
I...

644
01:24:45,211 --> 01:24:50,883
You certainly had me fooled.
I... thought you were my dead husband.

645
01:25:00,768 --> 01:25:03,604
I thought you were my dead husband.

646
01:25:06,357 --> 01:25:08,526
But you're just a little boy.

647
01:25:09,694 --> 01:25:11,362
In my bathtub.

648
01:25:56,782 --> 01:25:58,951
I never liked Sean.

649
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:36,385
What happened to me was not my fault.

650
01:26:36,489 --> 01:26:39,784
There's no way I could've behaved
any differently, you know.

651
01:26:46,749 --> 01:26:50,419
What I did... wasn't my fault.

652
01:26:57,009 --> 01:27:00,492
What happened to me wasn't my fault,

653
01:27:00,596 --> 01:27:03,370
and I can't be held accountable for it.

654
01:27:03,474 --> 01:27:06,227
There's no way I could ever
have said to him...

655
01:27:08,563 --> 01:27:09,897
"Go away."

656
01:27:10,982 --> 01:27:12,400
I couldn't do it.

657
01:27:19,991 --> 01:27:21,826
It was a mistake.

658
01:27:22,785 --> 01:27:27,123
And... I'm sorry. I'm...

659
01:27:36,174 --> 01:27:37,884
But I wanna be with you.

660
01:27:41,053 --> 01:27:42,555
I wanna be with you.

661
01:27:44,557 --> 01:27:45,892
Yes, I do.

662
01:27:50,021 --> 01:27:51,981
And I wanna get married.

663
01:27:52,085 --> 01:27:53,357
And...

664
01:27:55,234 --> 01:27:58,654
I wanna have a good life,
and I wanna be happy.

665
01:28:04,535 --> 01:28:05,912
That's all I want.

666
01:28:08,039 --> 01:28:09,165
Peace.

667
01:28:23,054 --> 01:28:24,222
Okay.

668
01:28:34,357 --> 01:28:35,525
Thank you.

669
01:29:20,653 --> 01:29:22,113
Careful with the wire.

670
01:29:23,114 --> 01:29:24,949
And right here would be lovely.

671
01:29:26,951 --> 01:29:28,077
Okay.

672
01:29:30,121 --> 01:29:32,623
Lift up with your left foot. There we are.

673
01:29:32,728 --> 01:29:34,354
Down. Excellent.

674
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:36,878
Okay. I'm gonna meter you.

675
01:29:39,297 --> 01:29:40,464
Okay.

676
01:29:42,383 --> 01:29:43,885
And close your eyes.

677
01:29:44,677 --> 01:29:45,845
Thank you.

678
01:29:47,471 --> 01:29:48,577
Excellent.

679
01:29:48,681 --> 01:29:50,892
Okay, if you could look
right at me, please.

680
01:29:50,996 --> 01:29:52,831
And lift the bouquet.

681
01:29:52,935 --> 01:29:54,770
Just like that is fine.

682
01:29:57,565 --> 01:29:59,567
Lovely. Look straight to me.

683
01:30:00,902 --> 01:30:02,111
Wonderful.

684
01:30:04,947 --> 01:30:06,824
Hold the bouquet up.

685
01:30:09,994 --> 01:30:11,329
Bouquet up, please.

686
01:30:16,501 --> 01:30:18,753
Anna? Bouquet up, please.

687
01:30:21,339 --> 01:30:22,507
Anna?

688
01:30:23,508 --> 01:30:25,968
Looks good. Nice big smile. Excellent.

689
01:30:26,073 --> 01:30:29,055
<i>Dear Anna, thanks for your letter.</i>

690
01:30:29,159 --> 01:30:31,370
<i>Mom says thanks, too.</i>

691
01:30:31,474 --> 01:30:34,101
<i>I'm really happy being back at my school.</i>

692
01:30:34,206 --> 01:30:39,002
<i>And my friends don't know
what happened, so it's okay.</i>

693
01:30:39,106 --> 01:30:41,275
<i>I don't go to your building anymore.</i>

694
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:44,320
<i>And I've been seeing an expert.</i>

695
01:30:44,424 --> 01:30:46,551
<i>They sure talk a lot.</i>

696
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:49,617
<i>They said I've been imagining things.</i>

697
01:30:49,721 --> 01:30:53,266
<i>Mom said maybe it was a spell,</i>

698
01:30:53,371 --> 01:30:56,207
<i>but it's a good thing
that it's gone away now.</i>

699
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:00,503
<i>Tell everyone I'm sorry
I made a problem for them.</i>

700
01:31:01,462 --> 01:31:03,798
<i>And I'm really sorry I made you sad.</i>

701
01:31:04,882 --> 01:31:08,177
<i>They said they still haven't figured out
what was wrong with me.</i>

702
01:31:09,011 --> 01:31:13,850
<i>But they said the good thing is
that nothing really happened.</i>

703
01:31:15,226 --> 01:31:19,230
<i>Well, I guess I'll see you
in another lifetime.</i>

704
01:31:20,523 --> 01:31:21,628
<i>Sean.</i>

705
01:31:21,732 --> 01:31:23,463
Looks good. And a big smile.

706
01:31:23,568 --> 01:31:25,465
That's a great smile. Nicely done.

707
01:31:25,570 --> 01:31:27,572
Who's next, guys? I'll take your card.

708
01:31:28,406 --> 01:31:29,574
Hands on your lap...
