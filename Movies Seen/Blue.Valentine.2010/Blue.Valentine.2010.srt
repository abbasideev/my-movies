1
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,900
Megan!

2
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,840
Megan!

3
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,020
Megan!

4
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,330
Megan!

5
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,890
Megan!

6
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,530
Megan!

7
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,180
Megan!

8
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,340
Megan!

9
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,930
Get up, get up.

10
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,230
We have to go outside.

11
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,530
What's the matter, baby?

12
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,240
OK, sweetheart, go check in the house,
see if she's in there.

13
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,450
Megan!

14
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,160
When is she going to get back?

15
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,500
Oh, buddy, she's going to come back.

16
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,700
You know, we'll put some, uh...

17
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,500
...some water in her bowl,
you know, and some food.

18
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,370
She's going to get hungry. She's going to
have to come back to eat, right?

19
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,370
I'm hungry right now. Are you hungry?

20
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,940
Mm-hmm.

21
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,490
You know, I'm so hungry,
I could just eat your hand.

22
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,490
Yeah. No, no, just let me
have a bite of your hand, OK?

23
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,460
Just one bite.

24
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,830
How come I can't have one bite?

25
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,020
Just one finger.

26
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,120
- No!
- You've got five of them.

27
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,470
OK, we got to be quiet
when we wake up Mommy, OK?

28
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,400
Do you want to get
thrown or do you want to get dropped?

29
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,000
I want to get next to Mommy.

30
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,050
...I'm going to go on to Mommy,
then jump on the pillow,

31
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,640
No, no!

32
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,160
We're tigers!

33
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,990
I'm sleeping! Stop!

34
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,160
- It's too early.
- We're tigers!

35
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,720
- No.
- Yes.

36
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,160
Stop, stop. Stop.
Come on, I get to sleep in more.

37
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,530
No, make pretty music.

38
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,910
I must get my breakfast.

39
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,440
Here comes your oatmeal.
All right, picky.

40
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,600
That's beautiful. You ready to eat?

41
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,740
You got to eat up, OK?
You can't be late today.

42
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,920
Blow on it first.

43
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,450
- I don't like it.
- Why don't you like it?

44
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,430
It just yucky. Aah!

45
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,240
Baby, what did you do?
You just put water in that?

46
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,900
- Yeah, it's instant oatmeal.
- Yeah, but you've got to soak the oats.

47
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,280
- They're fine.
- Yeah, it's delicious, you eat it.

48
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,820
Here, come on, let's eat like leopards.
That will make it better.

49
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,150
Here, just eat the raisins OK?
At least.

50
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,190
Oh, come on. Dean, I don't
need to clean up after two kids.

51
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,020
Frankie, Frankie...

52
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,160
- Use a spoon, honey.
- What do you mean, use a spoon?

53
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,790
Come on, use a spoon.
You know how to use a spoon.

54
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,500
We're eating like leopards.
Hey, that's mine!

55
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,330
Show your daddy how you use a spoon.

56
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,460
You're a big girl now, huh?
You know how to use a spoon.

57
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,800
What do you mean
you're a big girl?

58
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,470
You're a big girl now, sweetheart,
so don't have any fun.

59
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,510
Stick it on your face.

60
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,270
Frankie,
we're leaving in two minutes.

61
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,950
Come on, don't eat like that, come on.

62
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,280
Come on, come on, If that's the way
you're going to eat, breakfast is over.

63
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,980
No! Dad was doing it!

64
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,180
I know your dad was doing it.
Come on, kiddo.

65
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,950
- I was doing it!
- Daddy,

66
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,020
- you made me in trouble!
- I'm sorry.

67
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,150
Let's go, let's go.
We're late, we're late. Come on.

68
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,790
You want to wear this one?

69
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,840
- Yes,
- OK, but you have to be fast.

70
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,890
Ready? One...

71
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,000
...two... three... four...

72
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,530
...five... six...

73
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,200
...seven... We're going to do it.

74
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,680
Eight! You did it in eight!

75
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,650
Whoopsies!

76
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,490
Silly Mommy.

77
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,320
Hey, Frankie, you going to be good
for Ms. Alex today?

78
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,830
You promise?

79
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,230
- OK, I love you like crazy.
- I love you like crazy!

80
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,060
Oh, really?
Because I love you like crazy!

81
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,190
OK, guys, we got to go.
We're going to be late.

82
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,000
See you at the recital, Daddy!

83
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,770
Hey, Cin, put your seat belt on.

84
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,250
- Hey, Cindy, put your seat belt on.
- I got it.

85
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,380
Would you please put your seat belt on?

86
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,110
This road is crazy, all right?

87
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,690
Watch out for this guy.
Watch out for this fucking asshole.

88
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,260
Hey, fuck you! Why don't you
slow down, you fucking jackass!

89
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,530
Motherfucker!

90
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,760
You'll fucking kill somebody, asshole!

91
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,760
See this folder he gave me?
Yeah, I know.

92
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,240
- Hey, there you are.
- Oh, hi.

93
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,540
Sorry, I'm almost done here.

94
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,420
Did you get a... Do you have a second?

95
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,750
- Yeah, sure.
- Did you get a chance to talk it over

96
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:22,820
- with your family yet?
- No, I mean, you know, I will. I will.

97
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,120
That's OK.

98
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,090
No pressure, it's just, you know,
it's just a good opportunity,

99
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,650
I'll know for sure by Monday.

100
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,290
By Monday? All right. I've got to have
my best nurse up there with me.

101
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,630
- Your first baby?
- So exciting,

102
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,800
Yeah, I know, isn't it?
Do you know what you're having yet?

103
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,640
- No.
- No?

104
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,010
Do you want to know or are you
going to wait for a surprise?

105
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,150
- We want to know.
- You want to know, Yeah.

106
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,190
- Having the baby is surprise enough.
- Yes.

107
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,590
Let's see... it's a girl.

108
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,860
Is that good news?

109
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,490
- It's great news.
- Oh, good.

110
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,300
...but it should
clear up by the afternoon.

111
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,670
This not going to interfere
with your July Fourth plans...

112
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,500
...clear skies for the
fireworks tomorrow night.

113
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,510
And remember to dress warm, folks...

114
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,080
Fuck.

115
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,280
Excuse me.

116
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,070
OK, we have one more song left.

117
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,980
My Country, 'Tis of Thee.
It will be a Capella.

118
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,480
What's wrong?

119
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,510
- You ready, ladies and gentlemen?
- Yes.

120
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,580
- I found Megan.
- ...five, six, ready, sing.

121
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,800
How many times did I tell you
to lock the fucking gate? Huh?

122
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,630
Hey, I had an idea...

123
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,390
I thought maybe you should
go visit your grandpa today.

124
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,630
- What do you think?
- Yeah!

125
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,800
Did you ind Megan?

126
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,540
No.

127
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,370
But I was thinking maybe
she moved out to Hollywood,

128
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,670
and she became a movie dog.

129
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,880
You think? You think she moved out
to Hollywood to be a movie dog?

130
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,160
She had the looks, don't you think?
Maybe that's what happened, huh?

131
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,940
- Pa!
- Hi, sweetheart, how are you?

132
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,910
Here, look what I have for you.
Look at this.

133
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,110
Want me to show you a magic trick?

134
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,450
You coming up?

135
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,720
I can't smoke around the oxygen tank.

136
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,450
Oh!

137
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,730
- Honey?
- Hi, Gypsy.

138
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,860
Honey, go say bye-bye to Daddy, OK?

139
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,730
You're not going to
see him until tomorrow.

140
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,960
Watch out for the water. Oh!
OK, go, you're clear!

141
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye, buddy.

142
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,770
Hey, I love you.

143
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,110
- I love you.
- Have fun, OK, buddy?

144
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,540
OK.

145
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,450
You remember what to do
when Pa snores, right?

146
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,750
- Cover his mouth and hold his nose.
- That's my girl,

147
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,590
OK, go have fun.

148
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,650
All right, run to Mama!

149
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,490
Come on, you can do it!
Come on, sweetie pie.

150
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,790
Yay, that was great.

151
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,330
That was great.
All right, you ready to go inside?

152
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,770
So what's with him,
you two fighting again?

153
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,270
We'll talk about it later.

154
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,910
Why isn't Daddy going to come in?

155
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,010
I don't know.

156
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,770
- Mr. Benatti, good to meet you.
- Have a seat.

157
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,010
What kind of job are you applying for?

158
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,550
- Driver? Helper? Packer?
- Whatever, one that pays.

159
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
- Do you have any experience at all?
- Sure.

160
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,820
Where have you worked?

161
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,020
I mean, you know,
I've helped people move before.

162
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,490
You mean, what are my jobs?

163
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,820
But you've never worked
for a moving company?

164
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,020
No.

165
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,190
OK, so that would be "no experience."
Where are you from?

166
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,130
- Florida.
- And how long have you been here?

167
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,360
- Like two years.
- And where are you living?

168
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,370
-I live in Brooklyn.
- Can you get here every day?

169
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,030
- Yeah, I'll get here.
- I need you here by 7:00am.

170
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,370
I'll get here.

171
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,710
- Ready?
- Yeah.

172
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,870
- Hold it. There you go.
- All right, Marshall

173
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,210
- Good job!
- You're a man amongst men. No homo!

174
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,350
Sit up, son! Sit up, sit up!

175
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,720
Don't worry about it. You aren't
a professional yet, that's all.

176
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,690
How do you meet girls?

177
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,730
I just walk up, talk to them.

178
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,860
Whatever comes in my mind
at that moment.

179
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,560
- He honks the horn.
- I gets out of the truck.

180
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,570
I get out the truck and talk to them.

181
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,500
Or he screams out,
like, "chocolate thunder."

182
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,540
See, I don't know. I feel like
men are more romantic than women.

183
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,770
When we get married,
we marry, like, one girl.

184
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,750
Because we're resistant the whole way,
until we meet one girl and we think,

185
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,580
"I'd be an idiot if I didn't marry
this girl, she's so great. "

186
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,590
But it seems like girls get
to a place, they just kind of pick,

187
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,180
pick the best option or something.

188
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,090
I know girls that get married, they're
like, "Oh, he's got a good job."

189
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,430
I mean, they spend their whole life
looking for Prince Charming,

190
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,970
and then they... then they marry,
they marry the guy

191
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,760
that's got a good job
and who's going to stick around.

192
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,130
Take your share and go home,
OK? Let's call it a good night.

193
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,430
Thanks, Jamie.

194
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,300
Let me tell you something. When I
get old, I'm going to look good.

195
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,810
When you get old,
you're going to look like him.

196
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,570
What do you mean "when" you get old?

197
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,980
It's going to be a long time,
another 50 years.

198
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,150
Damn, it look like
World War Ill in this motherfucker.

199
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,320
OK, look, box everything in
the kitchen, bag everything upstairs.

200
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,590
Let's get this truck loaded,
up to Pennsylvania and back by tonight.

201
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,300
- This is a small, small room here.
- Here we go.

202
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,030
How's all the stuff going to it in here?

203
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,040
It's probably not going to,
so strip the furniture.

204
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,570
OK, I'll bring you boxes,
you start unpacking, placing.

205
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,870
Flatten all the cartons,
we'll get them out of here.

206
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,410
- What happens to all the other stuff?
- Not our problem.

207
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,500
Come on, come on,
speed it up, speed it up.

208
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,170
Got to go. We got to go. We got to go.

209
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,340
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

210
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,900
We got to go. We got another
job to do, we got to go.

211
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,460
Dean, you ready?
Let's get out of here, OK?

212
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,690
Job's over, here.
I'll give you your pay.

213
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,390
- One hundred...
- Damn.

214
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,930
One hundred and ten...
and 20 is part of your tip, OK?

215
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,700
Let's go, we've got
a two-hour ride back to the city.

216
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,600
Walter!

217
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,150
OK... Don't be mad.

218
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,580
I hung some of your stuff,
I hope it's OK.

219
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,950
You want to walk in here?
You don't want to get wheeled in here.

220
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,540
This is your new house.

221
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,750
I hung your uniform. I hope that's OK.

222
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,320
It's just so handsome, you know?

223
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,630
I noticed you had a lot of matches,
so I stuck them on the wall.

224
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,570
If you don't like it, you can
just take them down. it's tape.

225
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,400
Do you want to sit down in the chair?

226
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,450
- OK.
- Please.

227
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,310
Here, let me get this out of your way.

228
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,440
You got it?

229
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,080
OK, Walter,
I'm going to get in trouble, I got to go,

230
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,780
but I'm going to show you a few things,
OK? That's your shoes, see?

231
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,520
- Hey, Dean we got to go, all right?
- Yo. OK.

232
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,360
- I'll meet you in the truck.
- OK.

233
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,830
And... He's not the boss of me,
by the way. What else?

234
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,430
All your stuff's in here.
That's your pants, sweaters, shirts.

235
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,500
Hey, Walter, is this your wife?
Is this you and your wife?

236
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,110
She was a beautiful woman.

237
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
OK, nice to meet ya.

238
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,310
- Thank you.
- Good luck here.

239
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,550
OK. I'll see ya down the road.

240
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,520
I'm sorry.

241
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,320
I know.

242
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,660
Don't be sorry, baby.

243
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,870
Oh, fuck.

244
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,830
I'm just tired, you know.

245
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,110
I'm just fucking tired.

246
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,750
Come here, boy!

247
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,420
Maybe it's because we didn't
make it comfy enough in there.

248
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,590
Maybe we made it too girly.

249
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,430
- Too girly?
- Yeah.

250
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,730
Well, I think it...
Maybe we just need to put something...

251
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,930
...like a nice blanket
in there for him to lay on.

252
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,870
- OK.
- You think that's a good idea?

253
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,100
- Yeah, let's get a blanket.
- OK, buddy.

254
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,410
But don't take the one I usually do.

255
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,110
OK you better ask your mom
which blanket's OK to use,

256
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,450
because I don't want to get in trouble.

257
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,280
- OK. Will you open this up?
- Watch your hands.

258
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,720
But close it quickly,
because the dog is in there.

259
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,060
Can you take the trash out?

260
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,500
Yeah. Baby, do you know
where we put that."

261
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,170
I got an idea.

262
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,100
Hello?

263
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,410
I'm calling to see if I can make
a reservation for tonight.

264
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,850
- I have a gift certificate.
- No.

265
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,610
What's our options?

266
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:16,980
They have Cupid's Cove room available.

267
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,990
I'm not going to some cheesy sex motel.
I'm on call tomorrow.

268
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,860
What else? That's it?

269
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,030
Oh, and there's a Future Room.
Can you hold on one second?

270
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,340
- Baby, will you make the decision?
- I'm on call, I can't go.

271
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,500
Baby, please.

272
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,050
- Listen to me for a second.
- What do you want me to say?

273
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,140
Can you hold on one second?
Listen to me for a second.

274
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,480
Would you stop cleaning
for one minute?

275
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,490
- What?
- I'm asking you. Please.

276
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,120
Let's get out of here.
We got to get out of here.

277
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,720
Baby, we have to get
out of this house.

278
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,130
Let's go get drunk and make love.

279
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,370
- Now, do you want the Cupid's Cove...
- Dean, I don't want to...

280
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,570
...or do you want the Future Room?

281
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,400
Make a decision, baby, please.

282
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,210
I don't want to get in the car
at 7:30 and drive for two hours.

283
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,650
OK. I'll make the decision.
The Future Room.

284
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,880
For two.

285
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,090
- Periera.
- You're crazy.

286
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,860
Thanks.

287
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,860
Pack your bags, baby,
we're going to the future.

288
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:45,920
Oh, my God. Is that Cindy Heller?

289
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:53,760
- Bobby Ontario?
- How are you?

290
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:58,300
- I'm good, How are you?
- I'm... you know, I'm hanging in there.

291
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,390
Wow. Wow. it's been a while.

292
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,080
- How about you?
- Yeah, here.

293
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,380
Here. Been here,
stayed here, never left here.

294
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,580
Here's good, here's good.

295
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,120
- Married?
- Married.

296
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,160
- Married.
- That's crazy. Lucky guy.

297
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:26,220
Have you been faithful to him?

298
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,600
That's a strange question to ask
somebody you haven't seen in forever.

299
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,290
Yeah, well, you know...

300
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,100
- Seriously.
- Yes.

301
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,800
Yes you have, or yes you haven't'?

302
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,500
Yes... I have, I mean, I have...
I have been...

303
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,940
Why are you looking at me like that?

304
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,910
I'm not looking at you like anything.

305
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,980
Oh, OK.

306
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,250
- Yeah.
- Uh.

307
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,670
Come on, let's go.

308
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,760
Let's go.

309
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,940
What you thinking?

310
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,110
What's on your mind?

311
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,120
You're never going to guess
who I saw at the liquor man.

312
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,560
- Richard Grieco?
- No, but good guess.

313
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,530
Jon Bon Jovi.

314
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,160
Bobby Ontario.

315
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,420
What the fuck was he doing there?

316
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,390
I don't know...
I mean, buying liquor, I guess.

317
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,490
Jesus.

318
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,860
- How come you're just telling me now?
- Because I'm telling you now.

319
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,330
How come you didn't tell me
when we were there?

320
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,390
I don't know, because I was flustered
and I'm telling you now.

321
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,400
- You talked to him?
- No. I mean like,

322
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,240
- "Hi, bye, how are you..."
- How are you?

323
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:24,840
- Yeah, he asked me how I was.
- And you told him?

324
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,250
I mean, I didn't want to,
but we were stuck there.

325
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,340
We were in the same store, buying
things together at the same time.

326
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,380
I wish you'd seen him. I wish you'd...
You wouldn't feel so bad. He's fat...

327
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,260
- What do I care?
- I don't know.

328
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,090
What do I care if he's fat or not?

329
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,690
What does that mean?
Make me feel better?

330
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,710
I don't know. Because he's a loser.

331
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,780
What does that have to do with me?

332
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,650
Whether he's a loser or he's fat
or not? What the fuck do I care?

333
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,150
I don't... What!?

334
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,960
What are you saying that for? That
would make me feel better, he's fat?

335
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,090
So what? If he was in good shape,
I shouldn't feel good?

336
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,220
I said the wrong thing.
I'm nervous, OK?

337
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,900
- What do you mean you're nervous?
- I feel funny, because you feel funny.

338
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,510
You're nervous because I feel funny?

339
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,070
- What does that mean?
- I feel like I said the wrong thing.

340
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,450
I feel like I shouldn't have
said anything.

341
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,420
Really? That's an option?

342
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,620
You run into Bobby Ontario
and it's an option not to tell me?

343
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,330
I feel like you're upset,
and I upset you and I'm sorry.

344
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,120
And I said the wrong thing.

345
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,990
Baby... you can do whatever you want.

346
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,430
OK.

347
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,370
I'm sorry.

348
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,110
Fuck.

349
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,680
- What are you doing?
- I got to pee,

350
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,230
- Where, in this person's house?
- Fuck you,

351
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,850
Fuck me.

352
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,540
Hi.

353
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,910
- What are you doing?
- Research.

354
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,710
Really, research.

355
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,750
So what, I mean,
you're supposed to be a quadriplegic?

356
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,630
No, quads can't use their arms.
I'm a paraplegic.

357
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,560
Really?

358
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,430
Hi.

359
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,300
Why do you have to act like
such a freak all the time, huh? Huh?

360
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,240
Come over.

361
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,610
- Come on.
- I can't.

362
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,910
- I can't.
- You know you want it.

363
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,080
I got to go get Grandma.

364
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,680
I just came to say hi.

365
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,790
- Call you later.
- Yeah. Whatever!

366
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,330
- Oh! I thought you were Dad.
- Just us.

367
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:35,310
- How was the beauty parlor?
- Oh, lovely, just lovely.

368
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,670
Good.

369
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,010
What did it feel like
when you fell in love?

370
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,940
Ooh...

371
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,350
Oh, dear.

372
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,010
I don't think I found it.

373
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,690
Even with Grandpa?

374
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,820
Maybe a little in the beginning.

375
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,960
Bless us, O Lord, for these, thy gifts
which we are about to receive...

376
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,490
He didn't really have
any regard for me as a person.

377
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,840
You've got to be careful of that.

378
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,810
You've got to be careful that
the person that you fall in love...

379
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,670
...is worth it to you.

380
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,310
I don't ever want
to be like my parents.

381
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,910
I know that they must have loved
each other at one time, right?

382
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,480
Did they just get it all out of
the way before they had me?

383
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,860
We're supposed to eat this garbage?

384
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,200
Huh'?!

385
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,820
I'm sorry.

386
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,010
- Do you want me to make you some eggs?
- No!

387
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,080
I want you to enjoy
your goddamned dinner!

388
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,390
How do you trust your feelings when
they can just disappear like that?

389
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:59,800
I think the only way you can
find out is... to have the feeling.

390
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,400
You're a good person, honey.

391
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,970
I think you have the right to say,
"Yes, I do trust. "

392
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,870
"I trust myself "

393
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,400
What?

394
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,080
What, what?

395
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,910
- Fuck!
- Shit.

396
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,750
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

397
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,790
"Somehow, she didn't want to confess
to him that she was still wary

398
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,530
of all those people who'd
seemed to want to cane about her

399
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,330
He touched her cheek gently,
caressing her.

400
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:47,140
Her heart was beating so loudly
that surely he could hear it."

401
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,700
Arms up.

402
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,210
"He smoothed her hair back,

403
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,800
the touch of his fingers sending
waves of awareness through her

404
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,040
He was going to kiss her
That was what she wanted, wasn't it?

405
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,640
So why did she feel as if she trembled
on the edge of a precipice,

406
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,750
ready to topple over in an instant?

407
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:07,160
Then his lips found hers
and she stopped thinking at all,

408
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,060
only feeling,
feeling the tenderness of his kiss,

409
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,000
the strength of his arms around her...

410
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,070
...the steady beat of his heart under
her hand as she turned into his arms.

411
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,080
There is a precipice,
and she was falling.

412
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,040
Head over heels.
Falling in love with him.

413
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,270
Chapter 11..."

414
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,180
Hi.

415
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,180
- Hi.
- Hi.

416
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:36,420
- I want a cigarette.
- No, Grandma, it's bedtime.

417
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,750
You're in bed.
You can't have a cigarette now, OK?

418
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,020
Do you want me
to keep reading or are you tired?

419
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,530
I need a cigarette!

420
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,560
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second?

421
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,570
Why?

422
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,900
You think I stole that
money, don't you?

423
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,300
- Yeah, you do.
- No.

424
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,970
Look, I've stolen money before, OK?
I know what it's like to get busted.

425
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,340
- That's what it feels like.
- OK.

426
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,470
I didn't steal it. I got a job.

427
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,320
- OK? This is my job.
- All right.

428
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,360
- All right? I make money.
- OK, I got it.

429
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,250
Money I can take girls out
on dates with.

430
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,520
Just so you know.

431
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,120
Good to know. OK.

432
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,700
- What's your name?
- Go away.

433
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,140
- "Go away"?
- Go away.

434
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,800
That's a weird name.

435
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,970
OK, hold on a second.

436
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:10,150
I want to give you something.
Look at that. That's my business card.

437
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,020
I don't have a phone...
or a phone number,

438
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,020
but if you call
this number right here...

439
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,220
...and then you ask for me...

440
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,490
- ...they'll tell me you called.
- Great.

441
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,240
Who should I say is calling?

442
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,220
Whoa!

443
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,660
Where are we, huh?

444
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,030
We're inside a robot's vagina.

445
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,270
Was this the only one that they had?

446
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:06,410
I told you, you know...
they had Cupid's Cove or this.

447
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,280
You want me to see
if we can get Cupid's Cove?

448
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,720
I'm going to make a drink.

449
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,020
There's no windows.

450
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,630
Cool bed, huh? Check this out.

451
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,400
Whoa!

452
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,630
The bed turns. Hey, did you see this?

453
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,640
Hey.

454
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,250
Hey, look at me.

455
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,750
I don't think that there's a fridge.

456
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,660
Hey, that's how they laugh
in the future. Like this...

457
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,420
Oh, God.

458
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:01,170
I thought the whole point of coming
here was to have a night without kids.

459
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,970
Hello? Yeah, hold on.

460
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:11,340
Here, sweetheart, it's your mommy.
She wants to talk to you.

461
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,840
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie!

462
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,790
Yes.

463
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:23,320
OK, honey. Don't forget to go potty
before you get into bed, OK?

464
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,500
Bye. Bye, I love you!

465
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,360
Frankie, this is
how they laugh in the future.

466
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,770
Try it.

467
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,700
Huh?

468
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:44,610
Frankie, are you tooting?
Is that you tooting?

469
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,350
Frankie... I can hear...

470
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,900
I love you like crazy.
I got to go, OK?

471
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,630
Kiss, kiss.

472
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,570
Bye-bye.

473
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,880
What are you doing?

474
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,750
What? What's it look like I'm doing?

475
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,090
Getting all wet and naked.

476
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,600
I'm going to go order some food.
Do you want some?

477
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,230
You know what I like.

478
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,230
Can you close the door?

479
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,840
Oh.

480
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,060
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

481
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,130
All right.

482
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,530
Come up.

483
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,430
Come up.

484
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,800
What are you so grumpy about?

485
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,570
Oh, I don't know, I don't know why.

486
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,980
- Do you want a drink?
- Yes, please.

487
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:11,010
- Hey, how are you?
- Fine, thank you,

488
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,180
You're Grandma.
It's great to meet you.

489
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,020
Cindy, come on.

490
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:18,320
Could you talk to me
for five minutes, please?

491
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,050
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

492
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,030
Grandma, you know you have
an amazing granddaughter?

493
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,560
- Oh, of course I do.
- She's unbelievable.

494
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:27,800
I got these for you.
Would you please take them?

495
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,870
Cindy, come on,
would you give me Eve minutes?

496
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,840
This is ridiculous.
You're not even going to talk to me?

497
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,740
Come on, Cindy.

498
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:41,520
I'm trying to say I'm sorry,
and you're acting like a total bitch!

499
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,710
I don? know, I just
feel like I should just stop...

500
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,320
You know, just stop thinking
about it, but I can't.

501
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:58,260
Maybe I've seen too many movies,
you know, love at Hrs! sight.

502
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:00,830
- Anyone call?
- No.

503
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,070
Thanks.

504
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,730
What do you think
about love at first sight?

505
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,400
You think you can love somebody
just by looking at them?

506
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,200
- By looking at them?
- But the thing is, man,

507
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,040
I felt like I knew her. You know?
You ever get that feeling?

508
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:16,020
Yeah, like, you've seen her
before and you just know her...

509
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,210
- Yeah.
- It's a feeling.

510
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,010
But, actually,
you really don't know her.

511
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:28,620
- Yeah, I probably... I don't, right?
- That's right.

512
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:35,300
- I felt like I did, though.
- If you get a little pussy...

513
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,600
...I think all the mentalness
will go away from you.

514
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,370
You think I'm too much in my head?

515
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,770
Yeah, too much.

516
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,780
You already know
Where she live at, right?

517
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:49,480
No, she was just, like,
visiting her grandmother.

518
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:52,880
So why don't you go back
to that grandmother..

519
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,720
- ...and ask her where she lives?
- I should go back, right?

520
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,660
Yeah, If you like her, yeah.

521
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,290
She just seems different,
you know? I don't know.

522
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,260
Wait. How different?

523
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:09,100
I don't know,
I just got a feeling about her

524
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:14,400
You know when a song comes on
and you just got to dance?

525
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,840
- Hi.
- Hi.

526
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,040
Do you know
what happened to Walter?

527
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:56,050
- Who?
- Walter.

528
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:01,450
He's the gentlemen that just moved in
across the hall about a month ago,

529
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:05,650
I don't know anything
or anybody named Walter.

530
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,320
Oh.

531
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,890
OK.

532
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,630
Hey, can I ask you something else?

533
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,740
What's the story with that girl
that was in here like a month ago?

534
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,210
The blonde, the young blonde?

535
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,370
I gave her my card,
but she never called me.

536
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,710
What's her name?

537
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,880
- Cindy.
- Cindy.

538
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:33,510
- Will you tell her I say hi?
- OK. Why not.

539
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,520
Shit.

540
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:19,530
Do you think I could sit down,
because all these other seats are taken.

541
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,400
- OK.
- Hey, thanks.

542
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,770
You know, I just talked
to your grandmother.

543
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,110
That sounds weird, huh?

544
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,110
- Yeah.
- OK, let me put it into context.

545
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,550
I went out there to see Walter,
who's not there anymore.

546
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,450
That's why I talked to her.

547
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:44,960
Do you know what happened
to that guy, Walter?

548
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:47,620
Yeah, do you know what happened
to that guy, Walter?

549
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:51,400
No, I don't know what happened
to that guy, Walter.

550
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,810
What happened?

551
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,810
You got to do it like that?

552
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,310
- What do you expect?
- What do you mean?

553
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:05,750
They're old.
Would you want to live like that?

554
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,810
- Like what? In that home?
- Yeah.

555
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,990
Well, no but I'm not getting old
and he's a dummy for dying.

556
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,020
- Walter's a dummy for dying?
- Yeah.

557
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,330
What are you going to do, wise guy?

558
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,420
Not do it.

559
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,940
- Are you going to die?
- Definitely.

560
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,100
Hmm?

561
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,540
- What did you say?
- I said definitely.

562
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,640
Well, with that
kind of attitude, you will.

563
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,540
Don't do it. it's for suckers.

564
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,810
Don't do it.

565
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,710
- What are you going to do?
- Just not do it.

566
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,980
I went out there to give him this.

567
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,960
Isn't that nice? I found it.

568
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,360
Look at that.

569
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,460
- Is that him?
- Yeah, and his lady.

570
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,300
- Isn't he handsome?
- Look at her, she's so pretty.

571
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,000
So she's probably nuts, then.

572
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,670
In my experience, the prettier
a girl is, the more nuts she is.

573
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:03,410
Which makes you insane.

574
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,980
You're probably nutty-coo-coo crazy.

575
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,750
It's not your fault.
You know, it's just like...

576
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,590
Everybody treats you different.

577
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,560
Like, you make jokes and they're
not funny, but people laugh anyway.

578
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,150
That's got to make you nuts.

579
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,430
I like how you can compliment
and insult somebody at the same time.

580
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,030
In equal measure.

581
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,830
What's an insult about that?

582
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,680
That I'm crazy and I'm not funny.

583
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:36,540
Well... I don't know if you're
not funny, tell me a joke.

584
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:42,110
So there's a child molester and a
little boy walking into the woods.

585
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,120
The child molester and the little boy
keep walking further and further,

586
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,850
and it's getting darker and darker
and they're going deeper and deeper

587
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,120
into the woods and the child molester...

588
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:56,360
...and the little boy looks up
at the child molester and he says,

589
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,400
"Gee, mister, I'm getting scared!"

590
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,300
And the child molester
looks down at him and says,

591
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,530
"You think you're soared, kid?
I got to walk out of here alone."

592
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:12,750
You don't think that's funny?

593
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:18,390
- No, I'm sorry.
- I do.

594
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,780
You get along with your grandma, huh?

595
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,590
Yeah, she makes me laugh.

596
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:29,720
Nobody else talks in my family.
And when they talk, they just yell.

597
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,070
I'm never getting married.

598
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,910
This is a nice place, you live.
You like it?

599
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,100
- It's all right.
- Where you want to go?

600
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,010
I want to go away to school.

601
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,080
- What are you going to study?
- Medicine.

602
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,020
Really?

603
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,020
- Yeah, really.
- Yeah, right.

604
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:56,620
Yeah, right.

605
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,650
Girls like you.., Girls that look like
you don't go and study medicine.

606
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,260
What do I look like?

607
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,260
Girls like you are supermodels.

608
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,440
- You got any, like, talents?
- Like hidden talents?

609
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,610
Uh...

610
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:23,630
That's all the presidents.

611
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,010
That was rad.

612
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,490
Can you dance?

613
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,890
- You can tap dance?
- Can you?

614
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:02,990
No. Here, I'll play a song
and you dance.

615
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,770
OK?

616
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,440
Come here.

617
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,050
Come here, like this.

618
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,590
Right here, behind the heart.
In front of the heart.

619
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,380
OK.

620
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,910
I can't really sing.

621
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:27,190
I have to sing goofy in order to sing.
Like, I have to sing stupid,

622
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:29,350
- OK?
- OK.

623
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,730
You're actually good.

624
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,730
OK, slow dance.

625
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,300
Slow dance to this part.

626
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,300
Whooo!

627
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,450
You're not going to eat that?

628
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,550
Why don't you do something?

629
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,960
What do you mean?

630
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:12,660
I don't know.

631
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,700
What does that mean?

632
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:20,400
- Why don't I do something?
- Isn't there something you want to do?

633
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,300
There something you want to do?

634
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,880
- Like what?
- I don't know.

635
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:29,040
You're so good at so many things,
you could do anything you wanted to do,

636
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,210
you're good at everything that
you do, isn't there something
else you want to do?

637
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,650
Than what? Than be your
husband? To be Frankie's dad?

638
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,520
What do you want me to do?

639
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,560
What... In your, like, dream scenario,

640
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:42,820
of me, like, doing what I'm good at,
what would that be?

641
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:44,690
I don't know,
you're so good at so many things,

642
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,890
you can do so many things,
you have such capacity.

643
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:49,370
For what?

644
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,530
You can sing, you can draw, you can...

645
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,320
...dance.

646
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:01,020
Listen, I didn't
want to be some body's husband.

647
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,860
OK?

648
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:07,530
And I didn't want to be some body's
dad. That wasn't my goal in life...

649
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,700
Some guys it is.., Wasn't mine.

650
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,740
But somehow, I've...
It was what I wanted.

651
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,210
I didn't know that.

652
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:24,480
And it's all I want to do..,
I don't want to do anything else.

653
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:28,250
That's what I want to do.
I work so I can do that.

654
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:33,150
I'd like to see you have a job where
you didn't have to start drinking

655
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,850
at eight o'clock
in the morning to go to it.

656
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,090
No, I have a job that I can drink
at eight o'clock in the morning.

657
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,600
What a luxury, you know?

658
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,390
I get up for work, I have a beer,I go
to work, I paint some body's house...

659
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:47,030
they're excited about it,
I come home, I get to be with you.

660
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,340
What's... like... This is the dream.

661
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,910
It doesn't ever disappoint you?

662
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,170
Why? Why would it disappoint me?

663
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,240
- Because you have all this potential.
- I could still do whatever I could do.

664
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:00,760
So what? Why do you have to
fucking make money off your potential?

665
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,560
Look, I'm not even saying
you have to make money off it.

666
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,570
- Don't you miss it?
- What does even potential mean?

667
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,700
What does that mean, potential?
Potential for what?

668
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,070
To turn it into what?

669
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:19,940
We rarely sit down and have an adult
conversation, because every time we do

670
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:24,110
you take what I say and you turn it
around into something I didn't mean.

671
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:29,490
You just... twist it.

672
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,730
Start blabbing,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

673
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,800
If you're not interested
in what I have to say,

674
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:40,270
then maybe I just
shouldn't say anything.

675
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:45,730
That's funny, huh?

676
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,140
What's funny about that?

677
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,750
Good luck. I...

678
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:59,320
I'd like to see you think
about what you say...

679
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:03,190
...instead of saying what you think
all the time. Good luck, give it a try!

680
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,260
What do you mean?

681
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,370
- You want to fight me?
- Yeah, I want to fight you.

682
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:26,110
- OK, there you go.
- On your back,

683
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,510
On your back, motherfucker!

684
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:34,220
Ow.

685
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:36,520
Cheers, you're the best.

686
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,360
You drunk? You drunk, drunk?

687
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,200
Don't go to sleep, hey.

688
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:53,570
Don't go to sleep, OK? Stay awake.

689
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:56,810
Hey, look at me, look at me,
look at me. You awake?

690
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,910
You awake? Yeah? OK.

691
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:04,020
I got to pee my diddy, I'll be back.

692
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:19,930
Ah!

693
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,070
- Are you OK?
- Come here!

694
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,280
I may or may not have fallen.

695
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,600
Come here!

696
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:35,050
Come here! Come here!

697
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:38,890
- Fuck.
- Hey, beautiful, come here.

698
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:42,550
Give me a hand.
Help me back into the future.

699
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:44,590
- Come here.
- Give me your hand.

700
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,890
- Get up.
- This is funny.

701
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,520
Come here. Come on down here.

702
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:53,690
- Ow!
- Probably a big mistake.

703
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:57,060
- OW.
- That is a... That is a huge mistake.

704
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,370
Ow!

705
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,740
Come here, you saucy little minx.

706
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,320
You are so beautiful.

707
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:11,420
You are so beautiful.

708
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,990
Do you want to have another baby with me?

709
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,460
Hmm?

710
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:28,170
Will you have another baby with me?

711
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:31,730
Do you want to make a baby with me?

712
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:35,010
I want to have a baby with you.

713
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,470
- Stop.
- Stop what?

714
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,810
- Stop. Stop.
- What? Shh.

715
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,650
Shut your beautiful mouth.

716
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,190
Shut it. Come here.

717
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:00,940
Fuck. Ouch!

718
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,830
What are you doing, huh?

719
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,550
What's the matter with you? Come here.

720
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,980
Baby. Baby, baby, baby, baby...

721
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:38,510
Would you cut it out?
Would you fucking stop it?

722
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:41,750
Come on, stop, stop, stop!
What's going...? What are you doing?

723
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,980
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that?

724
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,930
It hurts!

725
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:52,860
What do you want?

726
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,700
How much rejection
am I supposed to take?

727
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,530
You know, I deserve
a little bit of affection.

728
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:01,540
I'm good to you. I'm good to you
and I'm good to Frankie,

729
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,580
and I love you. I don't deserve this.

730
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:07,670
What are you doing? What do you want?

731
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:13,280
That's how you want it?

732
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:20,520
This is how you want it?

733
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,060
This is how you want it? Come on.

734
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:25,590
OK.

735
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:28,760
OK. OK. Come here.

736
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:49,880
Baby, I can't do it.

737
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:54,050
I can't do it like this, baby.

738
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,060
Baby, baby, baby...

739
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:02,070
I can't fucking do it like this.

740
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,830
Stop it. Stop.

741
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:06,960
Stop, Don't give me this shit,

742
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,570
this fucking, like,
"you can have my body," bullshit.

743
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,470
I don't want that. I want you.

744
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:14,100
I'm not going to do it like this.
What, do you want me to rape you?

745
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,120
- I want you to stop.
- Is that what you want?

746
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,950
- Stop it.
- You want me to hit you?

747
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:20,110
- Stop it.
- What's the matter with you?

748
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:22,090
Fucking stop it!

749
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,320
- You want me to hit you?
- Yeah, hit me.

750
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:25,650
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah, that's what I want.

751
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,820
Would that make it OK
for you to treat me like this?

752
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,830
Yeah, that's what I want, baby. Hit me.

753
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,490
- Come on, hit me.
- Is that what you want?

754
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:34,620
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to fucking do it!

755
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,190
OK?

756
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:41,010
I don't give a shit how much
you want it, I'm not going to do it.

757
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:45,470
OK, I'm not going to do it!

758
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,470
I'm not going to do it.

759
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:53,040
You want me to hit you?
I'm not going to do it! I love you.

760
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:55,150
OK?

761
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:56,850
Let me out.

762
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:00,350
Open the door. Open the door.

763
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,830
Open the door.

764
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,360
Open the door.

765
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:07,900
Hey! Open this door!

766
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:11,840
Hey! Open the door!

767
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:16,300
Open the door!

768
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,380
Hey!

769
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,040
Open the door!

770
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,410
Can you open the door?

771
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,350
Can you open the door?

772
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:30,220
Go.

773
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:42,900
No. No!

774
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:54,510
Ow... ow. Ow.

775
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:59,610
What is going on? What kind
of operation are you running."

776
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,360
- Stop.
- ...around here?

777
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:03,930
OK.

778
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:24,240
Do not touch
the young lady in my taxi!

779
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:28,420
Please, sir!
Don't touch her back there, please?

780
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,330
- Thank you! Thank you very much.
- Come on! Why not?

781
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:36,460
Sir! Please there's
no sex in my taxi!

782
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:39,230
Do not touch the young
lady in my taxi!

783
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:41,670
I'll have you know that she was
putting the moves on me.

784
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,900
That's not true,
Would you believe a face like this?

785
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,470
- That doesn't...
- Look at that face. Look at that face.

786
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:50,640
I will not have you trying
something that's wrong in my car!

787
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:51,840
What's wrong?

788
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:54,010
This is my car,
this is like my home.

789
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:55,980
You're in my home now, OK?

790
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:58,820
It's not my business
what you do with this girl,

791
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:00,980
but you're not going
to do it in my cab.

792
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,750
Oh, God.

793
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:05,720
God. Oh, no, no, no.

794
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:08,050
No, no, no, no, no...

795
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:09,560
No.

796
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:17,930
Oh, my God.

797
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,730
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

798
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:28,840
Good job.

799
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,830
Hi.

800
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:10,310
Hi.

801
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,710
You OK?

802
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:17,280
Yeah, you OK?

803
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:21,350
Yeah, you OK?

804
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:28,620
You going to talk to me or what?

805
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:31,630
You going to tell me what's going on?

806
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:38,670
- You're not going to tell me?
- I don't know what you want me to say.

807
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:40,800
I want you to tell me what's going on.
I want to know.

808
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,740
You got me feeling sick, you know?

809
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,910
I'm very intuitive.

810
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,880
I know there's something up.

811
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,550
- I don't know what to do.
- OK, you're not going to tell me?

812
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:04,230
Stop! Stop, stop! No, no, no, stop!

813
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:07,030
- You going to tell me?
- Stop! Come down!

814
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:09,330
- You going to tell me?
- Just come down! I'm not kidding you!

815
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:12,170
- You're going to tell me what it is?
- Come... Please come down!

816
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:14,110
Come down. Please... Please stop.

817
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,680
- You want me to go over the edge?
- No, I want you to come down!

818
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:18,540
- Tell me what it is.
- Come on, it's dangerous!

819
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,610
- You going to tell me?
- No!

820
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:23,080
No, stop! Please come on!

821
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:26,280
Please! I'm pregnant!
Stop, come back, please!

822
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,690
Please come down. Please come down.

823
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,540
Is it mine?

824
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:51,880
-I don't know. I don't know.
- You don't know?

825
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:53,890
Maybe.

826
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:57,490
- Maybe?
- Probably not.

827
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:08,760
What are you going to do?

828
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:12,740
- What am I going to do?
- What are you going to do?

829
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:16,310
I don't know...

830
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,940
You're going to have it?
You're not going to have it?
What are you going to do?

831
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,750
- You thought about this?
- I don't know.

832
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:26,360
You don't know?

833
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:44,540
You've opted for our
vacuum-aspiration abortion today.

834
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:46,940
I'm just going to ask
you a few questions.

835
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:52,180
They're sensitive in nature, so if
at any time, you're uncomfortable,

836
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:54,120
you just let me know, OK?

837
01:10:57,150 --> 01:11:01,990
At what age were you
when you first had intercourse?

838
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,960
- Thirteen.
- OK.

839
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,040
That's not unusual.

840
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,370
OK, and how many sexual partners

841
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:20,970
would you say you've had
from when you first began?

842
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:28,250
Maybe...

843
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:31,810
... twenty... twenty...

844
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:34,990
- ... twenty five?
- OK.

845
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,900
Do you know
which partner you were with

846
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:40,160
at the time that you became pregnant?

847
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:45,500
OK. And is that partner
supportive to you?

848
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:47,660
Um...

849
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:52,740
No. OK.

850
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:05,680
Good, all right, now I'm going
to put my hand on your belly... 

851
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:09,290
...and then I'm going to
introduce a finger.

852
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:11,590
You're going to feel it.
OK, there you are.

853
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:13,560
All right...

854
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:16,200
That's it, OK, good.

855
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:20,260
Deep breathing. That's it.
All right, I feel the uterus.

856
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:24,310
Indeed, it's probably
11 and a half, 12 weeks.

857
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,610
It's in a safe position
for the procedure.

858
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:32,050
OK, I'm going to insert a speculum.
it's going to cause some pressure.

859
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:34,910
Here it goes, this is it.

860
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:38,990
That's it. I know it's uncomfortable.
I know it's uncomfortable.

861
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:43,620
But as much as you can relax,
the easier it goes, OK,

862
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,990
It's set right where I need to have it.

863
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:49,090
Good work. Keep that breathing.

864
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,430
- You're making me breathe hard.
- You're doing great.

865
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:56,000
The next thing I'm going to do is
I want to give you some local anesthesia.

866
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,630
It's a little uncomfortable,
so what I want you to do...

867
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:01,600
Right now, I'm going to
give you the first injection.

868
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:03,670
Take a giant breath and cough.

869
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:06,950
Go ahead, Breath," Cough.

870
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:11,080
OK, fine, fine, fine.

871
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:16,150
OK. I'm just going to
put that down and let it take effect.

872
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:21,700
Breathe deeply, slowly, deeply...

873
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,160
What I'm going to do
is apply an instrument,

874
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:27,970
so I can hold the cervix still.

875
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:30,600
Shouldn't feel this.
Maybe a little pressure.

876
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:33,840
- I can't.
- Oh, sweetheart, are you OK?

877
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,280
Cindy?

878
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,010
- Stop.
- OK. OK.

879
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:41,050
- Stop.
- OK, I'm sorry and I will stop.

880
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:46,860
All right, you want to sit up?
OK, all right.

881
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:51,620
You want me to just stop
the whole procedure, is that correct?

882
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:54,530
All right, I'm going to step out.

883
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:56,480
- Felicia...
- Yeah.

884
01:13:57,130 --> 01:14:00,310
- Do you want to put your things back on?
- Can I see my...?

885
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:04,250
- Can I see my friend?
- Sure, honey.

886
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:57,370
Let's do it.

887
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,440
Let's be a family.

888
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:19,290
Let's be a family.

889
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,240
You don't have to do this, you know.

890
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,310
It's not your fault.

891
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:40,910
I love you.

892
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:44,410
I love you, too.

893
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:13,440
Hey, it's me Cindy. Hi.

894
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,850
We need you to come in...

895
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:18,890
Who else did you call?

896
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:22,620
- I called Janet, and I called...
- I'm out of town, too.

897
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:26,680
What time is it? What time is it?

898
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:30,060
Six, seven, eight, nine...

899
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:31,500
Nine o'clock.

900
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:35,900
If I'm there at nine?
I'm coming if I'm there at nine.

901
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:39,190
Cindy!

902
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:44,130
Cin!

903
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:47,110
I'm going to fucking kill her.

904
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,200
Yo.

905
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:51,410
This is your 11:00am wake up call.

906
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:53,880
OK. Thank you.

907
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:23,770
Cin?

908
01:18:55,470 --> 01:19:00,710
Yeah, Um. ..

909
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,610
Where's the nearest bus station?

910
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:38,150
Sunday, 11:16 pm...

911
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:43,520
I just want to say to you,
thanks for making all bets off

912
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:46,990
and for freeing me of
my human decency.

913
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:49,260
All your shit is going in the trash.

914
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:51,700
All your books
are going to get fucking ripped up.

915
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,400
You want to go to war? I mean,
we'll go to war, we'll see who wins.

916
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:58,670
I know who the fucker is, OK?
And Pm going to destroy him.

917
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:02,270
Sunday, 11:58pm.

918
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:05,010
You probably don't even know
what you did.

919
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:07,570
I want you to hear something, OK?

920
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:11,350
I have never., I have never
cursed at a girl in my life.

921
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:12,580
Fuck you!

922
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,760
Fuck you, bitch!

923
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,460
Do you understand that?

924
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:22,550
I'm going to find him
and I'm going to fuck his ass up!

925
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:25,260
I hope he looks so beautiful to you...

926
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:29,430
I hope he looks so beautiful
to you when I am done.

927
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:31,030
Do you hear me?

928
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:35,270
End of messages.

929
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:16,080
Hey.

930
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:23,420
Hey, I'm looking for Dean.

931
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,030
For Dean. I'm looking for Dean.
You know where he's at?

932
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,990
- Yeah, I'm Dean.
- Oh, OK,

933
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:37,530
Your little boy's
going to call me Daddy from now on.

934
01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:59,020
Fuck you! Bitch!

935
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,190
- Such a little bitch. Pussy.
- Piece of shit!

936
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:04,330
- Fuck him up.
- Bitch!

937
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,970
You fucking piece of shit!

938
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:08,480
Fucking pussy!

939
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:43,070
Dr. Feinberg's Office. Mm-hmm.
OK, when were you looking to come in?

940
01:22:45,010 --> 01:22:47,080
Oh! Busy! Haven't sat down yet.

941
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:48,920
What do you have?
Can you walk with me?

942
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:52,390
I've got a woman in five, Hispanic...
Excuse me,

943
01:22:52,450 --> 01:22:55,260
Doesn't speak much English, and she's
complaining of pain in her left breast,

944
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:58,890
All right, I'll be in a minute.
Oh, hey, you know what I was thinking?

945
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:02,920
I realize it might be hard for you to
move the whole family up to Riverdale,

946
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,590
because your daughter's
still in school and everything,

947
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:07,100
and I thought maybe
you get an apartment.

948
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:09,940
You know, work during the week,
drive home on the weekends.

949
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:13,640
Wouldn't have to worry about being
lonely. We could hang out together.

950
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:15,540
You know, get dinner sometimes.

951
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,780
Anyway, that was not a proposition.

952
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:21,380
- It was just...
- I'm married.

953
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:24,720
Just trying to... Just trying to help.

954
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:28,430
I thought you wanted me there
because I'm good at my job.

955
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,890
Yeah, I thought...

956
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:34,790
Anyway... I'll see you in a minute.

957
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,990
I can't do that over the phone.
I can't do it over the phone.

958
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,150
Hold on, please.

959
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:03,490
Sir, could you just fill that out and
when you're done bring it back up to me?

960
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,660
I don't need this.

961
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:07,530
Could you hold on just
one second, please?

962
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:09,620
- OK, thank you.
- I was looking for my wife.

963
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:13,770
- I don't need that.
- OK, and who is your wife?

964
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:17,430
- Cynthia.
- Oh, you must be Dean.

965
01:24:18,170 --> 01:24:22,510
OK, yeah, let me get her,
she'll be right with you.

966
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:27,820
Cindy, sweetie,
you have a visitor,

967
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:30,950
- Who?
- It's your husband.

968
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:34,480
I think he's been drinking.

969
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:42,900
- Hi.
- Oh, there you are.

970
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:44,830
What are you doing here?

971
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:48,670
Oh, well, you're awful friendly
right now, aren't ya?

972
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:53,040
- No, I'm just surprised to see you.
- Oh, this is where the smiles happen.

973
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,640
This the smile room? Huh?

974
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,040
You take off, you leave me,
you don't tell me what's going on?

975
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:02,750
I was so goddamn worried, I thought
something might of happened to Frankie!

976
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,320
- I don't know what the hell happened.
- Meems, can you give me a few?

977
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:06,860
- You just take off like that?
- I'll be right here if you need me.

978
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:08,720
Yeah, Meems, can you give her a few?

979
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:10,690
I don't know if there's an emergency...
You're just gone!

980
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:13,600
- Frankie's fine. Come on, lets go.
- Well, good to know.

981
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:15,330
Cindy, I'm here if you need me.

982
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:17,840
- OK, come on, let's go.
- Don't let him brainwash you.

983
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:20,430
- Can you give me a hand with this?
- "Don't let him brainwash you"?

984
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:22,340
Can you give me a hand?

985
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:24,430
Oh, God...

986
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:35,780
Look, OK, I know everything
got fucked up last night.

987
01:25:37,010 --> 01:25:38,050
OK?

988
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:39,250
Can't believe you'd show up here drunk.

989
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:41,420
Hey, I'm talking to you!

990
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:45,250
- Hey. I know that...
- Can you drive?

991
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:47,350
- What?
- I said can you drive?

992
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:49,460
What do you mean?
What kind of question is that?

993
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,260
Of course I can drive.
I know how to drive...

994
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,400
Take the keys, go home.

995
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:55,780
You don't even care
if I fucking can drive.

996
01:25:55,870 --> 01:25:57,820
You'd love it if I got in
a goddamned accident.

997
01:25:57,910 --> 01:26:00,550
Yeah, I'd love it.
I'd just love it, you're so right.

998
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:03,150
That's the point. You don't
have any goddamned time anymore.

999
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,880
It all goes to this fucking place.

1000
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:07,450
And these fucking people
don't give a shit about you.

1001
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:10,460
- Do they? Hey!
- Just go home!

1002
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:12,260
Hey, come here for a second,
I'm going to come in there!

1003
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:16,330
I'm going to come in!
All right, I'm coming.

1004
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,970
Just have a seat and we'll be
with you as soon as we can, OK?

1005
01:26:23,070 --> 01:26:24,570
Thank you.

1006
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:29,110
- Are you OK? Is he gone?
- I fucking hate him.

1007
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,680
Why don't you just give her
a couple of minutes?

1008
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:35,480
No. Dean, you can't come back here.

1009
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,150
- Oh, God.
- Dean...

1010
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:41,520
- You can't be back here.
- it's OK, you're OK.

1011
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:44,830
I can't do this,
I can't take this shit.

1012
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:47,160
- Come outside with me.
- Dean, I cannot take this shit anymore.

1013
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:49,030
- Just come outside.
- I cannot take this shit.

1014
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:52,110
I am not going outside with you.
I've had it!

1015
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,160
- I've had it. I've had it.
- Come and talk to me...

1016
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:57,110
I am up to here!
I'm done, OK? I'm done!

1017
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,870
- Let's go outside...
- I'm done. I'm done.

1018
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:01,450
Look, no... I am done. I am done.

1019
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:04,490
I'm done with this.
I'm done being angry like this.

1020
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:06,680
I'm done having you drunk like this.
I am done!

1021
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:09,190
- Don't close that door!
- I'm closing the door.

1022
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,190
- Don't...
- Don't talk like that.

1023
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,320
- Mimi...
- Hey, don't talk to Mimi.

1024
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:16,160
Hey, Mimi, you know what?
We're going to take a little minute.

1025
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:17,990
We're just going to take a second.

1026
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,370
You know what,
this is why I don't talk to you.

1027
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:22,530
Because you go from here to here
in no time at all,

1028
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:24,870
This is why you talk to me.
Because I'm here.

1029
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,700
This is the only reason
you're talking to me.

1030
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,870
- You fucking asshole.
- I'm a fucking asshole?

1031
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:31,640
I'm so out of love with you.

1032
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,510
I've got nothing left for you,
nothing, nothing!

1033
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:38,650
Nothing! There is nothing here for you!
There is nothing here for you!

1034
01:27:38,710 --> 01:27:42,380
-I don't love you. I don't...
- Don't say stuff you can't take back.

1035
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,360
You fucking asked for it, you
asked me, You asked me. I talk to you.

1036
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,890
I couldn't drive you crazy
unless I love you.

1037
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:49,260
I gave you the goddamn answer
and you don't like it.

1038
01:27:49,350 --> 01:27:50,760
- Are you going to hit me?
- That's why I don't talk to you.

1039
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:51,890
No, I'm not going to hit you.

1040
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:53,870
- You're the bad guy, not me, asshole.
- I'm the bad guy?

1041
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,560
- Yeah, asshole!
- OK.

1042
01:27:56,660 --> 01:27:58,330
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1043
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,400
Yeah, I'm more man than you are,
you fucking cunt.

1044
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,740
- Don't say that shit about being a man.
- I am, I am. I can handle it.

1045
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:04,840
What is it with this shit
and being a man? What is that?

1046
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,010
What does it even mean?

1047
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:07,950
- What is that?
- What does it mean?

1048
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:11,080
- What does it mean to be a man?
- You're scaring us, you're scaring us!

1049
01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:14,090
- It doesn't mean you can come here...
- Don't say that stuff.

1050
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:16,890
- "Be a man!" What is that shit?
-I mean, don't bully..,

1051
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:19,090
I'll be a man.
You want me to be a man? Here you go.

1052
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:21,090
- Is this what men do?
- Oh, just stop it.

1053
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:23,260
- I'm a big man!
- Get out!

1054
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:25,770
- Get out. Stop it!
- Look at me, I'm a big fucking man!

1055
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,430
- I'm being a man!
- No, I'm the man!

1056
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,090
- I'm being a man now.
- Stop it! Stop it, now.

1057
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,580
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Hold on. This is what men do.

1058
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,280
I'm tired of talking.
I'm fucking tired of talking.

1059
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:36,250
- Hey, hey...
- Stop it!

1060
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:38,150
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1061
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:40,950
- What are you doing?!
- He's being an asshole.

1062
01:28:41,050 --> 01:28:42,650
- Hey, stop!
- Who are you, by the way?

1063
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:43,960
- Hey, take it easy.
- Who are you?

1064
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:45,790
Who am I? I'm a doctor.
I'm Dr. Feinberg.

1065
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:49,330
You're fucking Dr. Feinberg?
You've been e-mailing my wife?

1066
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:51,600
- Excuse me?
- You're the guy e-mailing my wife?

1067
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,730
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Stop it!

1068
01:28:53,790 --> 01:28:56,140
Don't! Don't! Don't!

1069
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:58,470
- I'm going to hit you in five seconds.
- No one is hitting anybody.

1070
01:28:58,570 --> 01:28:59,940
I'm going to hit you in five seconds...

1071
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,170
- I'm going to hit you in five seconds!
- Mimi, call the cops.

1072
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:04,310
- Five! Four!
- They're coming!

1073
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,350
- Will you take it easy?
- Get out!

1074
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,680
- Get out!
- Take it outside, my friend!

1075
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:10,980
- Two!
- Think about your wife, will you?

1076
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:15,290
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- You fucking son of a bitch!

1077
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:18,760
- I'm sorry... Look...
- I'm so sorry!

1078
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:21,160
- I'm so sorry.
- Buddy, get up. Just get up.

1079
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:22,290
What the fuck is the matter with you?

1080
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,700
You got a glass jaw or something?
You can't take one hit?

1081
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:26,170
- All right, that's enough!
- It's one hit!

1082
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:27,760
What is wrong with you?

1083
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:29,970
Oh, my God, you fucking son of a bitch!

1084
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:31,810
You fucking asshole!

1085
01:29:31,870 --> 01:29:33,210
I'm going to kill you!

1086
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:34,940
- You son of a bitch!
- That's enough,

1087
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,480
You son of a bitch!

1088
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:38,710
- I fucking hate you!
- You two, break it up.

1089
01:29:38,810 --> 01:29:40,510
- That's enough.
- Stop it! Don't. Don't.

1090
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:41,850
Mimi, please!

1091
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:44,950
Cindy, would you get out
of here? You are done here, get out!

1092
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:46,510
- Get out! You're done!
- I'm trying to take him!

1093
01:29:46,610 --> 01:29:49,360
She's done?!
You're going to fire my wife'?!

1094
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,730
Hey! This is between
you and me, motherfucker.

1095
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:54,530
Don't you fucking
blame her for that shit!

1096
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:57,000
- Yeah, you're going to jail, my friend.
- I'm going to jail?

1097
01:29:57,060 --> 01:30:00,130
- Please, come with me!
- Just get the hell out of here!

1098
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:02,370
- That's it. Keep moving!
- Come on!

1099
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:11,070
Give me the keys.

1100
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:17,320
I fucking want a divorce!

1101
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:49,880
Where are you going'?!

1102
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:53,020
What the fuck are you doing!'?

1103
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:37,060
- Hey.
- Mr. Heller.

1104
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:38,760
- You must be Dean.
- Yeah,

1105
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:42,310
I didn't know if it was pot luck,
so I brought an eggplant.

1106
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:45,970
- Very funny. Come in.
- Thank you.

1107
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:54,480
Let me see. Let me see.

1108
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:55,950
I don't know what you're talking about.
See what?

1109
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:57,490
- Let me see.
- See me through the flowers?

1110
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:59,580
- Do you like them?
- Oh, babe.

1111
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:04,090
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

1112
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:05,600
Like right now, when you're doing that.

1113
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:07,130
- Sorry!
- Yeah.

1114
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:10,530
Cindy doesn't usually bring
her boyfriends home for dinner.

1115
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:14,940
So... I'm thinking
this might be serious.

1116
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,950
- Don't listen to him.
- Well, I hope so.

1117
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:23,680
- You hope so.
- Yes, sir.

1118
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:27,280
- Mmm...
- I mean, I'm pretty serious.

1119
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:31,300
What do your folks do, Dean?

1120
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:33,830
Well... I don't know...

1121
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:38,460
My mother, I don't know,
to be honest, what she does.

1122
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:42,040
But my father is a janitor...

1123
01:32:43,130 --> 01:32:46,080
...and he's a very talented musician.

1124
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:49,370
- What does he play?
- Everything.

1125
01:32:49,470 --> 01:32:52,720
He can kind of play
a little bit of everything.

1126
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:54,720
He's one of those people.

1127
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:58,420
- So you don't see your mother?
- No, I don't.

1128
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,720
Why? Not that it's my business...

1129
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:03,490
No, I understand you asking.

1130
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,830
I don't really talk about it very
often, to be honest.

1131
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:11,560
You know, she just...

1132
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:16,740
When I was ten, she...
my father and her just decided

1133
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:20,910
that it wasn't, you know,
going to work out

1134
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,180
and she...

1135
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:25,910
...she met somebody, and I think...

1136
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,890
...that was that.

1137
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:32,580
You graduate from high school, Dean?

1138
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,130
Well, sir, no, I didn't, I didn't.

1139
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:38,060
But, you know, I didn't feel like...

1140
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:40,690
...there was a place for me there,
to be honest.

1141
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:44,970
I don't think that high school
is all it's cracked up to be.

1142
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:51,210
Cindy's... studying.

1143
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:56,440
- I know. She's...
- It's exciting.

1144
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:59,250
She's about the smartest person
I ever met.

1145
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:01,390
How's it going?

1146
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:04,920
- It's good.
- Yeah?

1147
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:07,620
Mm-hmm. It's really good. Um...

1148
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:13,890
There's one teacher in particular that
I've really enjoyed getting to know.

1149
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:18,730
She says that I have a lot of potential.

1150
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,170
What's her name?

1151
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,830
- Professor Comstock.
- Comstock!

1152
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:27,970
What's so funny about that?

1153
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:30,940
Teachers, they just always
have these names you know?

1154
01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:36,150
It's never like... I don't know".
They always have these names. Comstock.

1155
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:38,320
- Is that funny?
- Yeah.

1156
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:40,920
I don't know why, sorry. So you...

1157
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:45,460
- What course is that?
- It's a biology course,

1158
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:48,500
That's good.

1159
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:50,090
Cindy wants to be a doctor.

1160
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:54,330
I know, that's...

1161
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:57,540
She'd be a great doctor.
I wish She'd be my doctor.

1162
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:00,840
I'd trust her.

1163
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:03,470
A lot of these doctors,
they're just in it for the money.

1164
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:06,490
It would make me relieved to know
that someone like Cindy

1165
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:09,020
was my doctor, or my kid's doctor.

1166
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:13,620
She has got a lot ahead of her.
It's really exciting.

1167
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:20,460
- You know I'm not good enough for you.
- Stop it.

1168
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:21,870
- It's true.
- Stop it.

1169
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,700
- Baby, it's true.
- No, it's not.

1170
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:26,210
- It is true.
- You're hurting my feelings.

1171
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:28,140
- Don't say that.
- No, but nobody is.

1172
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:34,710
You know, so as long as..,
that's the case, I want the job.

1173
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:41,820
Baby...

1174
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,150
- What?
- I got you a present.

1175
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,440
That's it. Hold on... Boom!

1176
01:35:49,330 --> 01:35:52,070
- Oh, baby...
- Mmm?

1177
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:54,280
Did you make it?

1178
01:35:54,370 --> 01:35:57,210
Well, I didn't make it,
but I got us a song.

1179
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:01,220
You know, like our song
that will just be for you and me.

1180
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:07,250
Because every body's got songs, but
they're lame and they all share them.

1181
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:09,190
You know, it's disgusting.

1182
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:12,630
- Not us. We have our own song.
- We have our own song.

1183
01:36:13,620 --> 01:36:16,120
- What is it?
- Do you want to listen to it?

1184
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:26,700
OK, turn it up.

1185
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:33,420
- Stop it.
- Take it easy.

1186
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:36,220
Listen.

1187
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,970
Baby! Hi!

1188
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:10,000
Look at you.

1189
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:19,150
Oh...

1190
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:23,230
Hi.

1191
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:27,260
- Are you OK?
- I don't want to talk to you.

1192
01:38:35,830 --> 01:38:37,570
I can't play right now, OK?

1193
01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:42,210
What's going on, Dean?

1194
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,350
Dean, leave her alone.

1195
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:53,390
Hey! You can't lock me
out of my own house!

1196
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:57,250
I don't have my oxygen out here! Hey!

1197
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,250
You know, it's not just us.

1198
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:33,630
We got a little girl
we got to think about.

1199
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:41,740
I know, I am thinking about her.

1200
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:48,970
I can't do this anymore.

1201
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:57,750
Baby, you're just thinking
about yourself. What about Frankie?

1202
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,430
You want her to grow up
in a broken home?

1203
01:40:03,950 --> 01:40:07,590
- Is that what you want?
- I am thinking about Frankie.

1204
01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:09,590
You're not
thinking about Frankie.

1205
01:40:09,690 --> 01:40:11,860
- I am thinking about...
- No, you're not.

1206
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:18,470
Is this how you want her to grow up?

1207
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:20,680
I don't want her to grow up in a home

1208
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:23,210
where her parents
treat each other like this.

1209
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:26,610
Don't...

1210
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,380
I'm sorry...

1211
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:32,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1212
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:38,050
- Baby, I'm sorry.
- I can't do this anymore!

1213
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:41,330
I know.

1214
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:47,670
Baby, I'm just fighting, you know,
fighting for my family.

1215
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,240
I don't know what to do.

1216
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:54,970
I don't know what else to do.

1217
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:57,040
Tell me what to do.

1218
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:00,550
- Tell me what to do.
- I don't know what to do.

1219
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,640
- Tell me how I should be.
- I don't know.

1220
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:05,480
Just tell me, I'll do it.

1221
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:09,320
I'll do it.

1222
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:13,650
I don't know what to say.

1223
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:16,860
I'm so sorry,
I don't know what else to do.

1224
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:20,030
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.
Just tell me.

1225
01:41:20,090 --> 01:41:22,370
We're not good together,
we're not good anymore.

1226
01:41:22,430 --> 01:41:24,740
- The way that we treat each other!
- Don't say that, baby.

1227
01:41:24,830 --> 01:41:27,900
I can't stop, you can't stop!

1228
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,950
I can't stop!
I don't know what else to do!

1229
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:32,350
- I can stop, and I will stop.
- No!

1230
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:36,550
- No. No.
- Come here, just come here.

1231
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:40,120
- Come here, come here, come here...
- No, no, no...

1232
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,710
Just come here. Just come here.

1233
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:54,710
No...

1234
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:49,430
What are you thinking about?

1235
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:55,970
I just wish they'd hurry up
so you can't change your mind.

1236
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:58,940
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1237
01:43:02,770 --> 01:43:05,150
Baby, you made a promise to me, OK?

1238
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:09,520
You said for better or worse.

1239
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,290
You said that.

1240
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:16,790
You said it. It was a promise.

1241
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:20,160
I'm sorry.

1242
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:22,500
Now, this is my worst.

1243
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:26,060
OK? This is my worst.

1244
01:43:26,630 --> 01:43:27,970
I'm sorry.

1245
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,800
But I'm going to get better.

1246
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:34,310
You just got to give me
a chance to get better.

1247
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:42,490
- Up here, please.
- OK.

1248
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:44,530
- Please face one another.
- OK.

1249
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:50,550
I'm so sorry...

1250
01:43:56,490 --> 01:43:58,490
I love you so much.

1251
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,440
Dean, I give you this ring...

1252
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:01,740
..as a symbol...

1253
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:05,240
- ...as a symbol."
- ...of my solemn vow...

1254
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:08,580
- ...of my solemn vow...
- Hand everlasting love.

1255
01:44:08,670 --> 01:44:10,710
... and everlasting love.

1256
01:44:10,770 --> 01:44:14,520
For as much as you have
consented in holy wedlock before God...

1257
01:44:15,610 --> 01:44:19,180
...I do, by the power vested in me,
by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,

1258
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:21,560
pronounce you husband and wife.

1259
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:23,100
You may kiss the bride.

1260
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:56,220
- Baby, baby, baby, baby...
- You've got to just give me some space.

1261
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:58,890
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1262
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:33,600
Hey, Frankie, come back!

1263
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:39,530
Daddy! Daddy!

1264
01:45:40,330 --> 01:45:41,770
Daddy!

1265
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:45,670
Frankie, you got to go back, OK?

1266
01:45:47,470 --> 01:45:49,380
Daddy!

1267
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:56,650
- Where is she?
- She ran after Dean.

1268
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:10,640
Go back to your mom, please.

1269
01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:13,370
Don't go. Stay here.

1270
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:15,500
- Go back to your mom.
- Just come back!

1271
01:46:16,630 --> 01:46:18,740
- You want to race?
- OK.

1272
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:20,400
One, two, three, go!

1273
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:34,260
Oh, sweetheart, it's OK.

1274
01:46:37,890 --> 01:46:39,390
Who's my big girl?

1275
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:43,360
- I love him.
- I know, baby.

1276
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:47,940
I got you. Don't cry.

1277
01:46:48,530 --> 01:46:49,840
It's OK.

1278
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:57,370
OK.

1279
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:59,460
I can't really sing.

1280
01:48:59,530 --> 01:49:03,370
I have to sing goofy in order to sing.
Like, I have to sing stupid.

1281
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:04,880
- OK?
- OK.

1282
01:49:47,610 --> 01:49:49,350
You're actually good.

1283
01:49:51,850 --> 01:49:54,920
OK slow dance. Slow dance to this pan.

1284
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:29,090
Good job.

1285
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:34,140
You got some pretty sexy moves.

1286
01:50:34,830 --> 01:50:36,310
Hey, shut up.
