which comes out in a few days

My doctor tells me
I have something called "vascular dementia"

finally write the book, I think. I had to.

And why, of course, it's my last novel.

Strangely enough

945
01:48:13,022 --> 01:48:17,359
it would be just as accurate
to call it my first novel.

my time at St. Thomas' Hospital during the war.

I just couldn't ever
find the way to do it.

948
01:48:27,828 --> 01:48:30,331
Because the novel
is autobiographical... Is that right?

949
01:48:30,413 --> 01:48:33,916
Yes, entirely. I haven't
changed any names, including my own.
