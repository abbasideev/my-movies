1
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,467
Help! Someone help me!

2
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,806
Is someone there?

3
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,934
Hey!

4
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,272
Oh, shit, I'm probably dead.

5
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:49,066
<i>You're not dead.
-Who's that?</i>

6
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,152
Who's that?

7
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:53,946
<i>There's no point in yelling,
I already tried that.</i>

8
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:56,282
Turn on the lights!

9
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:58,576
<i>I would if I could.</i>

10
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:01,954
What the fuck is going on?
Where am I?

11
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:05,583
<i>-I don't know yet.
-What is that smell?</i>

12
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:09,837
<i>Shh. Hang on a second.
I think I found something.</i>

13
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,135
Holy shit.

14
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,819
Aaaargh! Help!

15
00:03:18,113 --> 00:03:19,657
Help!

16
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:23,202
<i>Help!</i>

17
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:25,871
Help!

18
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,999
No-one can hear you.

19
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,293
What the fuck is this?

20
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:35,047
Calm down. Just calm down.

21
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,340
Are you hurt?

22
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:39,760
I don't know. Yeah!

23
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:43,472
-What's your name?
-My name is Very Fucking Confused.

24
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:46,183
<i>What's your name?
What's going on here?</i>

25
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:50,229
My name is Lawrence Gordon, I'm a doctor.
I just woke up here, like you.

26
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,407
Aaaargh!

27
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:05,035
<i>Recognize him?</i>

28
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,745
No.

29
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:11,667
Do you have any idea how you got here?

30
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,502
No.

31
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:16,463
-What's the last thing you remember?
-Nothing.

32
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:20,926
I went to bed in my shit-hole apartment,
and woke up in an actual shit-hole.

33
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,348
What about you, huh?

34
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,935
There's... There's not much to tell.

35
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:34,440
<i>I was on my way home from work, and...</i>

36
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,567
I don't remember anything else.

37
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:43,407
First dead body I've ever seen.

38
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,243
<i>They look different in real life.</i>

39
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,414
They don't move.

40
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:58,047
From the looks of these chains,

41
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,883
<i>someone didn't want us
to go very far, either.</i>

42
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,262
-Can you see any scars?
-What?

43
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:07,139
Man, they kidnap you and drug you.

44
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:10,142
Before you know, you're in a bath
and your kidneys are on eBay.

45
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:12,853
No-one has taken your kidneys.

46
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:15,647
How can you tell from way over there?

47
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:19,067
You'd either be in terrible agony,
or you'd be dead by now.

48
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,527
Trust me.

49
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,654
<i>-What are you, a surgeon?
-Yeah.</i>

50
00:05:26,074 --> 00:05:27,075
So...

51
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,205
Are you gonna tell me
your name, or what?

52
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,710
Adam.

53
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:39,922
Well, Adam...

54
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:43,801
What we need to do...

55
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:46,220
is start thinking about why we're here.

56
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:49,848
<i>Whoever brought us here
could have killed us by now.</i>

57
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,225
<i>But they didn't.</i>

58
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:54,186
They must want something from us.

59
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:58,148
The question is, what?

60
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:05,989
<i>-That clock.
-What about it?</i>

61
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:09,034
-It's brand-new.
-So?

62
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:13,038
So... somebody obviously
wanted us to know the time.

63
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,878
<i>Wait, I think I might be
able to reach the door.</i>

64
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:46,780
What is that?

65
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,576
Excuse me.

66
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,620
It's a tape.

67
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,623
-Where did you find it?
-It was in my pocket.

68
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:06,967
<i>It says, "Play me. "</i>

69
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,500
Come on. Come on.

70
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:45,130
<i>Throw it over here.</i>

71
00:07:52,512 --> 00:07:54,264
Fuck.

72
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,943
No?

73
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:36,473
-Use your shirt.
-What?

74
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:38,600
<i>Your shirt.</i>

75
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,449
<i>Come on.</i>

76
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:01,581
-It won't work.
-Look around.

77
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:03,708
There must be something else you can use.

78
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:07,546
-There's nothing.
-Well, there must be something.

79
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,602
<i>Come on. You can do it.</i>

80
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:28,608
Come on. Come on.

81
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:29,985
<i>Again.</i>

82
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:55,051
<i>Rise and shine, Adam.</i>

83
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:57,596
<i>You're probably wondering where you are.</i>

84
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,181
<i>I'll tell you where you might be.</i>

85
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:03,143
<i>You might be in the room that you die in.</i>

86
00:10:03,226 --> 00:10:09,149
<i>Up until now, you've simply sat in the shadows,
watching others live out their lives.</i>

87
00:10:09,232 --> 00:10:13,528
<i>But what do voyeurs see
when they look into the mirror?</i>

88
00:10:13,611 --> 00:10:19,242
<i>Now, I see you as a strange mix
of someone angry yet apathetic.</i>

89
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,328
<i>But mostly just pathetic.</i>

90
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:24,581
<i>So, are you going to watch
yourself die today, Adam,</i>

91
00:10:24,664 --> 00:10:26,708
<i>or do something about it?</i>

92
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:30,211
I don't get it.

93
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:32,339
Throw me the player.

94
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:37,552
No. You throw me your tape.

95
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:42,682
Look, we're gonna have to work together,
if we want to get out of here.

96
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,226
<i>-Throw it to me.
-I'm not gonna risk breaking it.</i>

97
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,354
<i>You throw me your tape.</i>

98
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:06,247
<i>Dr. Gordon...</i>

99
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:08,833
<i>this is your wake-up call.</i>

100
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:12,754
<i>Every day of your working life,
you have given people the news</i>

101
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:15,215
<i>that they're gonna die soon.</i>

102
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:19,135
<i>Now you will be the cause of death.</i>

103
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:23,139
<i>Your aim in this game is to kill Adam.</i>

104
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:25,308
<i>You have until 6 on the clock to do it.</i>

105
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:29,187
<i>There's a man in the room with you.</i>

106
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,856
<i>When there's that much poison in your blood,</i>

107
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,527
<i>the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.</i>

108
00:11:41,574 --> 00:11:45,954
<i>There are ways to win this,
hidden all around you.</i>

109
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:51,376
<i>Just remember,
X marks the spot for the treasure.</i>

110
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:54,337
<i>If you do not kill Adam by six,</i>

111
00:11:55,713 --> 00:11:59,217
<i>then Alison and Diana will die,
Dr. Gordon.</i>

112
00:12:00,301 --> 00:12:03,638
<i>And I'll leave you in
this room to rot.</i>

113
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:06,975
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

114
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:18,444
Give me that.

115
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:19,654
Now.

116
00:12:28,663 --> 00:12:32,083
<i>Then Alison and Diana will die,
Dr. Gordon...</i>

117
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:36,045
<i>...and I'll leave you in
this room to rot.</i>

118
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:41,301
<i>-Any idea who that is?
-Let the game begin.</i>

119
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:45,054
-He knows us.
-Wait a minute.

120
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:48,224
What do you think? Probably a joke, right?

121
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:49,809
Shh!

122
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:53,146
<i>-Let the game begin.
-Listen. Listen.</i>

123
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,232
<i>Follow your heart.</i>

124
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,242
<i>What the hell does "follow your heart" mean?</i>

125
00:13:12,832 --> 00:13:16,044
There, right next to you, on the toilet.

126
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:28,640
Come on. Come on.

127
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,354
Oh, man!

128
00:13:42,236 --> 00:13:44,989
-Anything?
-No solids.

129
00:13:45,073 --> 00:13:46,407
Take off the lid.

130
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:50,578
<i>Come on.</i>

131
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:02,715
I really wish I had've checked in there first.

132
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,967
Huh! What is it?

133
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:35,123
Hey.

134
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:38,209
Mind passing me the other one?

135
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:07,321
Fuck! Fuck!

136
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:53,367
He doesn't want us to cut through our chains.

137
00:15:55,202 --> 00:15:57,246
He wants us to cut through our feet.

138
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,461
I think I may know who's done this to us.

139
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:05,963
What did you say?

140
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:08,090
Well, it's not someone I know personally.

141
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:10,635
It's just someone I know of.

142
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:14,180
<i>Jesus Christ! Tell me. Who is it?</i>

143
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:18,684
Last I heard...

144
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:22,563
.. the police still hadn't caught him.

145
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:24,982
<i>And the only reason I know that...</i>

146
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:27,109
<i>is because I was a suspect.</i>

147
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:31,572
<i>I'll start from the beginning.</i>

148
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:42,833
This one's not fresh any more.
At least three weeks out.

149
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:46,170
<i>Victim's a 46-year-old male.</i>

150
00:16:47,713 --> 00:16:52,385
<i>Died of massive blood loss,
mostly through the femoral artery.</i>

151
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,517
He started at the back and tunneled
through that razor wire so fast,

152
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,644
it's amazing he got as far as he did.

153
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:07,858
<i>Cut himself so deep,
we found traces of stomach acid on the floor.</i>

154
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:14,407
We also found this.

155
00:17:17,827 --> 00:17:23,207
<i>Hello, Paul. You are a
perfectly healthy, sane, middle-class male,</i>

156
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,625
<i>yet last month,</i>

157
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,378
<i>you ran a straight razor across your wrists.</i>

158
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:32,258
<i>Did you cut yourself
because you truly wanted to die,</i>

159
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:34,969
<i>or did you just want some attention?</i>

160
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:37,596
<i>Tonight, you'll show me.</i>

161
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,641
<i>The irony is that if you want to die,</i>

162
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:43,144
<i>you just have to stay where you are.</i>

163
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:45,813
<i>If you want to live,
you'll have to cut yourself again.</i>

164
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:49,066
<i>Find a path through the razor wire to the door.</i>

165
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,484
<i>But hurry.</i>

166
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:54,572
<i>At three o'clock that door will lock.</i>

167
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:57,158
<i>And then this room becomes your tomb.</i>

168
00:17:57,241 --> 00:18:00,578
<i>How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Paul?</i>

169
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:07,585
Door was on a timer.
It was unlocked until three o'clock.

170
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:12,464
Then it slammed shut. He was given two hours.

171
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:17,052
You sick fuck!

172
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,560
<i>A jigsaw piece.</i>

173
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,276
I think we're gonna be here for a while, Sing.

174
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:36,071
<i>The newspapers started
calling him "the jigsaw killer".</i>

175
00:18:36,155 --> 00:18:39,491
Actually, technically speaking,

176
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:43,120
he's... not really a murderer.

177
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:46,707
He never killed anyone.

178
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,835
<i>He finds ways for his victims
to kill themselves.</i>

179
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:55,716
<i>Hello, Mark. If you're so sick,</i>

180
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:59,011
<i>then why do I have so many photos of you
up and about?</i>

181
00:18:59,678 --> 00:19:02,973
<i>Let's put your so-called illness to the test.</i>

182
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:08,187
<i>Right now, there's a slow-acting
poison in your veins.</i>

183
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,273
<i>The antidote is inside the safe.</i>

184
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:12,399
Help!

185
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:17,613
<i>The combination to the safe...
is written on the wall.</i>

186
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:19,782
<i>Hurry up and program it in.</i>

187
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:21,992
<i>But watch your step.</i>

188
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:27,331
<i>By the way, that's a flammable substance
smeared on your body.</i>

189
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:30,626
<i>So, I would be careful
with that candle, if I were you.</i>

190
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:36,465
<i>Or all the people you've burned with your act
just might have their revenge.</i>

191
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:42,179
Aaaargh!

192
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:44,890
I found something else.

193
00:19:46,016 --> 00:19:48,018
Well, two things, actually.

194
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:51,355
There was someone standing outside,
watching through this hole.

195
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:56,276
Our friend Jigsaw likes to book himself
front-row seats to his own sick little games.

196
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,654
<i>He was there at the last one as well.</i>

197
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,117
Only, this time... he left us his penlight.

198
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:08,580
Hm...

199
00:20:09,665 --> 00:20:11,667
Get a rush on the prints.

200
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,128
Copy that.

201
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:18,215
This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe
tumor extending across the midline.

202
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:21,135
It started as colon cancer.

203
00:20:21,218 --> 00:20:24,471
The patient has come in for a standard checkup,

204
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:28,183
by which we can monitor the rate
at which his condition is declining.

205
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:30,686
-The patient had...
-His name is John.

206
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:35,065
Dr. Gordon. He's a very interesting person.

207
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:39,778
Thank you for that information, Zep.

208
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:43,824
<i>As you can see, our orderlies
form very special bonds with the patients.</i>

209
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:47,202
<i>Continuing on, the patient had...</i>

210
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:50,122
<i>Dr. Gordon, please page the operator.</i>

211
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:56,170
Someone doesn't want me to tell you
what the patient had! Excuse me.

212
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:02,217
Dr. Gordon.

213
00:21:03,343 --> 00:21:06,555
I'm Detective Tapp, this is Detective Sing.
City homicide.

214
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:11,351
-Very impressive.
-Oh, thank you.

215
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:13,187
I do my best.

216
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:18,317
<i>-Sorry to interrupt you while you work.
-Fine.</i>

217
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,444
Now, how can I help you gentlemen?

218
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:26,408
Are you able to tell us where you were
between the hours of 11 PM and 1 AM last night?

219
00:21:26,491 --> 00:21:29,369
Why is it that you're interested?

220
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:31,872
We'd like to ask a few questions about it.

221
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:36,627
For your sake, I think it's best
if we do it down at the station.

222
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,340
-Would you like to follow us there?
-I'm afraid that's out of the question.

223
00:21:41,423 --> 00:21:45,719
I can't just leave, I have work to do.
Plus my wife has the car today.

224
00:21:45,802 --> 00:21:48,138
That's OK. You can ride with us.

225
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:49,556
Doc?

226
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,188
I'm sorry.

227
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:59,942
You'll have to tell me again.
What is this all about?

228
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:03,111
Is this yours, Doctor?

229
00:22:15,749 --> 00:22:19,294
<i>So you have no idea how your penlight
showed up at the murder scene?</i>

230
00:22:19,378 --> 00:22:21,421
Of course not, Brett.

231
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:28,095
<i>Well, I have to ask.
What were you doing last night?</i>

232
00:22:31,014 --> 00:22:33,058
I was seeing someone.

233
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:36,061
Who?

234
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:42,109
Look, if you can't be honest with me...

235
00:22:42,192 --> 00:22:44,236
I was visiting someone, It wasn't a patient.

236
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,196
<i>All right?</i>

237
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:50,617
What am I gonna do?

238
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:53,286
Well, as your lawyer and your friend,

239
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:58,667
my advice to you is to bite the bullet
and give them your alibi now,

240
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,919
<i>cos no-one's gonna believe you later.</i>

241
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:08,510
That was five months ago.

242
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:14,182
He tried to set me up for murder.

243
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:19,688
OK.

244
00:23:20,772 --> 00:23:23,150
We checked your alibi, It holds up.

245
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:26,403
Good. Can I go home now?

246
00:23:26,486 --> 00:23:29,781
We have one of the victims
who managed to escape.

247
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:34,244
Want to know if you wouldn't mind sticking
around and listening to her testimony.

248
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:36,329
Maybe it'll trigger something.

249
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:40,500
-I'd like to help, really, but...
-Well, we'd appreciate it.

250
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:43,086
-She's the only one who made it.
-OK.

251
00:23:49,092 --> 00:23:50,719
Amanda...

252
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:54,222
In your own time...

253
00:23:54,306 --> 00:23:56,975
tell me the first thing you remember.

254
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:13,366
<i>I woke up.</i>

255
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,619
<i>All I could taste was blood.</i>

256
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:18,872
<i>And metal.</i>

257
00:24:48,068 --> 00:24:50,111
<i>Hello, Amanda.</i>

258
00:24:50,195 --> 00:24:54,115
<i>You don't know me, but I know you.</i>

259
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:56,534
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

260
00:24:56,618 --> 00:24:59,579
<i>Here's what happens if you lose.</i>

261
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:04,417
<i>The device you're wearing
is hooked into your upper and lower jaws.</i>

262
00:25:04,501 --> 00:25:06,878
<i>When the timer on the back goes off,</i>

263
00:25:06,962 --> 00:25:10,382
<i>your mouth will be permanently ripped open.</i>

264
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:13,218
<i>Think of it like a reverse bear trap.</i>

265
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:16,721
<i>Here, I'll show you.</i>

266
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:31,528
<i>There's only one key to open the device.</i>

267
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:35,156
<i>It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.</i>

268
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:38,576
<i>Look around, Amanda.</i>

269
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,829
<i>Know that I'm not lying.</i>

270
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:43,331
<i>You'd better hurry up.</i>

271
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:45,458
<i>Live or die.</i>

272
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:47,377
<i>Make your choice.</i>

273
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:07,397
No!

274
00:26:25,373 --> 00:26:27,917
And then I saw the body.

275
00:26:50,523 --> 00:26:52,567
There was a knife.

276
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:28,228
<i>He'd been injected with an opiate overdose.</i>

277
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:31,856
<i>Couldn't move or feel much of anything.</i>

278
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:36,986
You mean... he was alive?

279
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,279
Was.

280
00:27:40,031 --> 00:27:41,991
What happened after you took it off?

281
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:47,765
<i>Congratulations. You are still alive.</i>

282
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,395
Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.

283
00:28:52,478 --> 00:28:55,773
But not you. Not any more.

284
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:06,034
You are, in fact, a drug addict.
Isn't that right, Mandy?

285
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:12,331
Do you think that is why he picked you?

286
00:29:18,296 --> 00:29:20,339
<i>Are you grateful, Mandy?</i>

287
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:29,140
He... helped me.

288
00:30:06,677 --> 00:30:08,721
Are you sure it's him?

289
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:13,643
<i>-Yeah, I'm sure.
-How do I know you're telling the truth?</i>

290
00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:16,354
<i>You could be the one who put me in this room!</i>

291
00:30:16,437 --> 00:30:21,275
I'm in exactly the same situation you're in.

292
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,654
Wrong. Wrong! You've got one thing I don't.

293
00:30:24,737 --> 00:30:26,864
Information. You know who did this.

294
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:33,037
Now, you either tell me what is really going on,
or I'll cut you with this!

295
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,164
I'll cu...

296
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:43,297
-What?
-It's a two-way mirror.

297
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,122
I can see you.

298
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:19,792
<i>So, that's what this is. Reality TV.</i>

299
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:22,503
Don't look at me, I can't help you.

300
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:26,340
Can you hear me in there? Huh?
I'm having a blast.

301
00:31:26,424 --> 00:31:29,719
This is the most fun I've had without lubricant.

302
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:32,638
Make sure you're getting everything.

303
00:31:34,765 --> 00:31:37,018
That's not gonna do anything.

304
00:31:39,061 --> 00:31:41,772
<i>-You want to leave it running on us?
-You won't stop it.</i>

305
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:46,152
That's why we can't cut through these chains
or why you won't break that glass.

306
00:31:46,235 --> 00:31:49,488
Every possible angle
has been pre-thought out by him.

307
00:31:49,572 --> 00:31:52,450
You make it sound like you admire this prick.

308
00:31:52,533 --> 00:31:56,287
To overcome something, you have to
understand what a perfect engine it is.

309
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,080
<i>That's how you fight disease.</i>

310
00:31:59,165 --> 00:32:02,585
<i>The tape told us to find an X.</i>

311
00:32:02,668 --> 00:32:06,172
That X has to be somewhere in this room.
Help me find it.

312
00:32:06,255 --> 00:32:09,633
How can you be the calm doctor when
your wife and kid are out there?

313
00:32:09,717 --> 00:32:12,428
<i>He has them too.
He could be doing anything to them now.</i>

314
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:16,724
<i>-Are you thinking about that?
-I am thinking about that.</i>

315
00:32:23,314 --> 00:32:26,484
I've been thinking about
the last thing I said to my daughter.

316
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:12,172
Diana, honey, are you OK?

317
00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:16,510
Diana, honey, can you hear me?

318
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:20,014
-Mommy...
-What is it, sweet pea?

319
00:34:20,097 --> 00:34:22,725
There's a man in my room.

320
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:26,395
Oh, honey, are you sure he's not
just hiding in your imagination?

321
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:28,522
He talked to me.

322
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,901
OK, I'll come and check your room.

323
00:34:32,985 --> 00:34:36,030
I want Daddy. He'll get the scary man.

324
00:34:37,656 --> 00:34:40,743
All right, if you want. Come on.

325
00:34:43,912 --> 00:34:48,042
Larry, sorry to bother you,
but your daughter had a bad dream again.

326
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:49,543
Just a minute.

327
00:34:50,586 --> 00:34:53,005
She wants you to check her room.

328
00:34:53,088 --> 00:34:55,549
Mm-hm. Just got to finish this paragraph.

329
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:02,097
Come on, sweetie, I'll check with you.

330
00:35:04,725 --> 00:35:06,268
Nope, I'm done.

331
00:35:08,228 --> 00:35:11,273
See? There's no-one in your room.

332
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:15,652
There's no such thing as the Bad Man.

333
00:35:15,736 --> 00:35:19,573
<i>-Now can you go to sleep?
-I'm still scared.</i>

334
00:35:19,656 --> 00:35:21,950
You are? Give me your tootsie.

335
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:26,413
Oh, what a big tootsie.

336
00:35:26,497 --> 00:35:28,707
Remember this one?

337
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:31,001
This little piggy went to market.

338
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:33,337
This little piggy stayed home.

339
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,631
This little piggy had roast beef.

340
00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:37,841
This little piggy had none.

341
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:40,052
This little piggy ran...

342
00:35:40,135 --> 00:35:43,055
Whee! All the way home!

343
00:35:46,016 --> 00:35:47,559
I hate that thing.

344
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:51,021
Well, I have to go to work, sweetheart.

345
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:53,857
You know what Daddy's job is like.
Now, come on.

346
00:35:55,234 --> 00:35:56,860
Let's see.

347
00:35:58,195 --> 00:36:00,155
Try and get some sleep, now, OK?

348
00:36:06,537 --> 00:36:09,998
You're not gonna leave us, are you, Daddy?

349
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:13,710
What?

350
00:36:15,003 --> 00:36:16,880
What are you talking about?

351
00:36:17,631 --> 00:36:19,800
You mean, leave you and Mommy?

352
00:36:21,552 --> 00:36:24,263
No. No, sweetheart, I...

353
00:36:24,346 --> 00:36:26,390
I would never do that.

354
00:36:27,516 --> 00:36:30,644
-Who gave you that idea?
-No-one.

355
00:36:31,937 --> 00:36:34,314
Well, it's not true. OK?

356
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:38,610
<i>-OK.
-How much do I love you?</i>

357
00:36:38,694 --> 00:36:41,655
-Love you very much.
-That's right. That's right.

358
00:36:43,115 --> 00:36:45,784
-Good night, sweetie.
-Good night, Daddy.

359
00:36:50,622 --> 00:36:53,750
Tomorrow... I'll read you your favorite story.

360
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:55,294
OK.

361
00:36:55,377 --> 00:36:58,213
<i>I don't know
how much longer I can do this.</i>

362
00:36:58,297 --> 00:37:01,383
-What are you talking about?
-How can you pretend you're happy?

363
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:04,761
-I am happy.
-That is complete bullshit.

364
00:37:04,845 --> 00:37:07,139
<i>I'd rather you just tell me you hate me.</i>

365
00:37:07,222 --> 00:37:09,641
<i>At least there would be some passion in it.</i>

366
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,814
Would you like to see her?

367
00:37:33,248 --> 00:37:35,876
<i>-She's beautiful.
-Thank you.</i>

368
00:37:37,252 --> 00:37:39,254
You gonna have any more kids?

369
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:42,341
Ah, we've... talked about it, but er...

370
00:37:44,051 --> 00:37:46,595
.. with our schedules,

371
00:37:46,678 --> 00:37:49,222
it's difficult enough to concentrate on one.

372
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:53,060
So, where's the lucky wife?

373
00:37:53,143 --> 00:37:56,396
There's another picture
behind the one you're looking at.

374
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,984
<i>It's my favorite one because...
we're all in it together.</i>

375
00:38:01,068 --> 00:38:04,613
Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera,

376
00:38:04,696 --> 00:38:07,741
<i>which means I'm always missing
from the photos.</i>

377
00:38:23,673 --> 00:38:27,052
It's er... It's not here.

378
00:38:27,135 --> 00:38:28,804
What?

379
00:38:28,887 --> 00:38:32,265
This photo you're talking about's not here.

380
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:34,476
Really? Are you sure?

381
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,603
Yeah. Just...

382
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:52,994
Why, he... he must have taken it, I...

383
00:38:53,078 --> 00:38:55,080
<i>How can you pretend you're happy?</i>

384
00:38:55,163 --> 00:38:58,959
-I am happy.
-That is complete bullshit.

385
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:01,044
I'd rather you just tell me you hate me.

386
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:03,171
At least there would be some passion in it.

387
00:39:06,216 --> 00:39:08,260
We'll talk about this later. OK?

388
00:39:12,264 --> 00:39:14,307
Just leave.

389
00:39:47,757 --> 00:39:50,051
<i>Good night, little girl.</i>

390
00:39:56,558 --> 00:39:57,267
Diana?

391
00:39:58,602 --> 00:40:00,645
Diana?

392
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:05,442
Diana!

393
00:40:16,202 --> 00:40:18,246
<i>Mommy!</i>

394
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:23,710
Shh.

395
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:45,607
Don't you dare!

396
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,692
Get away from her!

397
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,911
Mommy!

398
00:41:07,796 --> 00:41:09,005
Mommy!

399
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:12,384
Mommy! Mommy!

400
00:41:12,467 --> 00:41:15,220
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!

401
00:41:15,303 --> 00:41:17,305
Get off of her!

402
00:41:43,998 --> 00:41:48,086
<i>Oh, you little man! I see you.</i>

403
00:41:51,965 --> 00:41:55,009
<i>Does Dr. Gordon know
you're at home with his wife?</i>

404
00:41:57,804 --> 00:41:59,848
<i>I know you know something.</i>

405
00:42:06,146 --> 00:42:08,231
<i>What are you doing in there?</i>

406
00:42:08,314 --> 00:42:12,152
<i>Waiting for the doctor?
I'm waiting for the doctor, too.</i>

407
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:16,072
Huh!

408
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:26,666
I never should have let you go.

409
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,304
<i>There was someone
standing outside here watching.</i>

410
00:42:39,387 --> 00:42:41,222
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

411
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:46,436
<i>Jigsaw piece.
We're gonna be here for a while. Sing.</i>

412
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:48,563
<i>Hello, Amanda.</i>

413
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,694
<i>Dr. Gordon, are you able to tell us
where were you last night?</i>

414
00:42:54,777 --> 00:42:58,781
<i>You have no idea how your penlight
showed up at the murder scene?</i>

415
00:42:58,865 --> 00:43:01,659
-We checked your alibi, it holds up.
-Isn't that right?

416
00:43:01,743 --> 00:43:03,870
<i>I never should have let you go.</i>

417
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:10,919
Here we are.

418
00:43:12,045 --> 00:43:13,963
That was er...

419
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,466
quite an amazing story that poor woman told.

420
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,399
Look, I'm...

421
00:43:34,984 --> 00:43:38,196
I'm sorry I can't be of more help
to your investigation.

422
00:43:39,948 --> 00:43:42,825
You know, we arrested a dentist last week.

423
00:43:42,909 --> 00:43:45,078
He liked to play with kids a bit too much.

424
00:43:46,204 --> 00:43:47,914
He lived two blocks from here.

425
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:53,962
<i>The sewer lines run under this neighborhood,
too... Doctor.</i>

426
00:44:18,569 --> 00:44:21,030
<i>Hello, Amanda.</i>

427
00:44:21,114 --> 00:44:24,867
<i>You don't know me, but I know you.</i>

428
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:29,163
<i>I want to play a game.
Here's what happens if you lose.</i>

429
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:35,378
<i>There's a timer at the back
of the device you're wearing.</i>

430
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:37,547
<i>When the timer goes off...</i>

431
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,846
<i>-I'll catch you guys down there.
-... like a reverse bear trap.</i>

432
00:44:50,643 --> 00:44:52,228
<i>I'll show you.</i>

433
00:44:55,481 --> 00:44:58,901
-Hey, Tapp.
-Hmm?

434
00:44:58,985 --> 00:45:02,196
We're gonna go down to get a beer.
You want to come?

435
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,073
I don't think so. But thanks, anyway.

436
00:45:04,157 --> 00:45:06,951
Well, you know, I always ask.

437
00:45:07,034 --> 00:45:09,579
<i>-There is one key to open the device.
-Have fun.</i>

438
00:45:09,662 --> 00:45:13,166
<i>It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.</i>

439
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:16,669
Hey, Tapp.
I don't mean for this to be disrespectful.

440
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:21,299
Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.

441
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:28,139
<i>It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.
Look around...</i>

442
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:34,103
<i>Look around, Amanda. Know that I'm not lying.</i>

443
00:45:35,229 --> 00:45:37,273
<i>You'd better hurry up.</i>

444
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,444
Wait, wait, wait. Sing.

445
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,823
-Get back here.
-What?

446
00:45:54,207 --> 00:45:55,208
What?

447
00:45:59,253 --> 00:46:01,214
Remember 118th Street?

448
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:08,679
Er... K2K. That gang's territory
was only about four blocks.

449
00:46:08,763 --> 00:46:10,806
Now, listen to this.

450
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:29,116
Check the records for all fire emergencies
in that area within the last two weeks.

451
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,534
<i>Go -right now.</i>

452
00:46:30,618 --> 00:46:31,702
Mmm!

453
00:46:31,786 --> 00:46:37,416
On Tuesday 17th, a fire alarm went off
in the rear wing of 213 Stygian Street.

454
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,504
It's an old listing.
Used to be a mannequin factory.

455
00:46:41,587 --> 00:46:43,631
Think we have enough for a warrant, though?

456
00:46:43,714 --> 00:46:45,758
Who said anything about a warrant?

457
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:47,259
Right now?

458
00:46:47,343 --> 00:46:49,095
Why not?

459
00:46:49,178 --> 00:46:50,846
Yeah, why not?

460
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,859
At least we'll have the cover of darkness.

461
00:47:03,943 --> 00:47:06,278
Yeah, well, so will anybody else.

462
00:47:52,491 --> 00:47:54,535
I got you.

463
00:48:46,253 --> 00:48:48,380
What the hell is this?

464
00:49:05,189 --> 00:49:07,107
Shit.

465
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,911
Oh, fuck!

466
00:49:34,426 --> 00:49:36,887
Wait, Sing. Let's see what he's gonna do.

467
00:49:36,971 --> 00:49:40,015
-Why? We fuckin' got him.
-We don't know what he looks like.

468
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:42,893
-Let's see what he's gonna do.
-No fucking way.

469
00:49:42,977 --> 00:49:44,770
Fuck that, I'm gonna take him.

470
00:49:44,853 --> 00:49:46,939
What the fuck? Shit!

471
00:50:32,401 --> 00:50:36,113
Awake already, Jeff?

472
00:50:37,156 --> 00:50:39,450
I need more-powerful tranquillizers next time.

473
00:50:39,533 --> 00:50:42,494
Don't cry, I've given your life a purpose.

474
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:46,707
You're a test subject
for something greater than yourself.

475
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:47,958
Freeze!

476
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:50,544
-Hold it right there!
-Put your hands in the air!

477
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:03,432
Now you'll make a choice.
In 20 seconds, the life of this man will be ended.

478
00:51:03,515 --> 00:51:05,184
-Get down here!
-Turn it off!

479
00:51:07,102 --> 00:51:09,146
<i>Sing, stop that thing, I'm taking him down.</i>

480
00:51:09,229 --> 00:51:10,272
Fine.

481
00:51:10,355 --> 00:51:11,690
Move!

482
00:51:11,774 --> 00:51:13,859
-How do you turn it off?
-Tell him, asshole!

483
00:51:13,942 --> 00:51:16,445
One key will unlock it.
-Where is it?

484
00:51:16,528 --> 00:51:18,697
-It's in the box.
-Box?

485
00:51:20,908 --> 00:51:22,451
Fuck!

486
00:51:24,286 --> 00:51:27,539
-Which key? Which key?
-Tell him which key it is!

487
00:51:27,623 --> 00:51:29,917
-Time's running out.
-Shut up and get down here!

488
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,251
<i>Now, asshole!</i>

489
00:51:32,753 --> 00:51:37,591
What's more important to you, Officer?
Arresting me or the life of a human being?

490
00:51:37,674 --> 00:51:41,970
Get down on your knees, asshole!
Hands behind your head!

491
00:51:42,054 --> 00:51:44,681
-Tapp!
-Sick bastard!

492
00:51:44,765 --> 00:51:48,644
-Yes, I'm sick, Officer.
-Tapp, there's a hundred keys here!

493
00:51:48,727 --> 00:51:51,355
Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.

494
00:51:51,438 --> 00:51:55,067
Sick of people
who don't appreciate their blessings.

495
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:58,070
Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.

496
00:52:01,657 --> 00:52:03,158
I'm sick of 'em all!

497
00:52:04,284 --> 00:52:05,202
Tapp!

498
00:52:14,336 --> 00:52:16,797
No! No! Tapp! Tapp!

499
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,925
Shit! You're OK. Let me see.

500
00:52:23,345 --> 00:52:26,098
I'll be back, I'm gonna be back, OK? I'll be back.

501
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:00,882
Freeze, or I'll shoot!

502
00:54:31,264 --> 00:54:33,266
I had you.

503
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,769
I had you on your knees.

504
00:54:35,852 --> 00:54:38,814
But you're running. You're running.

505
00:54:40,816 --> 00:54:43,401
You're running scared cos...
cos we had you.

506
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,863
We're gonna close this case.

507
00:54:48,281 --> 00:54:51,034
Gonna close it. Right, Sing? Right?

508
00:54:51,117 --> 00:54:53,161
We're gonna close it, Sing.

509
00:55:01,336 --> 00:55:05,131
<i>"X" marks the spot.
"X" marks the spot.</i>

510
00:55:06,132 --> 00:55:08,134
<i>We need to search this room again.</i>

511
00:55:08,218 --> 00:55:10,220
<i>What are you doing over there?</i>

512
00:55:12,472 --> 00:55:13,848
<i>Excuse me.</i>

513
00:55:13,932 --> 00:55:16,101
Just because I'm stuck in this room with you

514
00:55:16,184 --> 00:55:19,271
<i>doesn't mean I have to report
to you every 10 seconds.</i>

515
00:55:20,355 --> 00:55:23,733
I really don't see the point
in us not helping one another.

516
00:55:24,818 --> 00:55:27,028
<i>What do you want me to do? I'm on a leash.</i>

517
00:55:27,112 --> 00:55:29,364
That's exactly why we need to talk and think.

518
00:55:29,447 --> 00:55:32,659
-I am thinking!
-Then don't keep me in the dark

519
00:55:32,742 --> 00:55:34,786
<i>about what you're thinking!</i>

520
00:55:38,331 --> 00:55:39,958
Turn off the lights.

521
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,376
<i>What?</i>

522
00:55:42,502 --> 00:55:44,379
Turn them off now, please.

523
00:55:44,462 --> 00:55:47,299
-Why?
-Just turn them off for a second.

524
00:56:02,647 --> 00:56:04,274
Jesus. Behind you.

525
00:56:08,611 --> 00:56:10,822
How come we didn't see that before?

526
00:56:10,905 --> 00:56:14,868
The lights in here hadn't charged it.
It's glow-in-the-dark paint or something.

527
00:56:54,866 --> 00:56:57,786
-Open it!
-It's locked.

528
00:56:58,912 --> 00:57:02,040
The key... the one from my envelope.
Where is it?

529
00:57:06,044 --> 00:57:08,546
Where the fuck? Here.

530
00:57:36,908 --> 00:57:38,159
A cellphone.

531
00:57:38,243 --> 00:57:40,537
<i>The most beautiful invention on this planet.</i>

532
00:57:45,834 --> 00:57:48,545
<i>Make that second-most beautiful invention.</i>

533
00:57:48,628 --> 00:57:50,213
Give me that.

534
00:57:50,296 --> 00:57:55,009
<i>Are you joking? You're going to put something
you found in this room in your mouth?</i>

535
00:57:55,093 --> 00:57:57,554
Yes, I'm willing to risk it.

536
00:57:57,637 --> 00:57:59,305
<i>Give me that sweet cancer.</i>

537
00:58:00,557 --> 00:58:03,476
<i>I don't care, I really don't.</i>

538
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,562
<i>Give me one of those.</i>

539
00:58:05,645 --> 00:58:08,189
<i>The cigarettes
are harmless, I promise.</i>

540
00:58:08,273 --> 00:58:14,195
<i>Smoking is only poisonous when it ends
in bloodshed. Think about this.</i>

541
00:58:14,279 --> 00:58:16,281
<i>You don't need a gun to kill Adam.</i>

542
00:58:16,364 --> 00:58:18,950
May I please have a cigarette?

543
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,453
I'm trying the police.

544
00:58:31,754 --> 00:58:33,798
Shit.

545
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,052
This was meant to receive calls, not make them.

546
00:58:40,346 --> 00:58:42,140
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

547
00:58:42,223 --> 00:58:44,267
This has happened before.

548
00:58:48,187 --> 00:58:51,691
<i>Last night, after I finished at the hospital...</i>

549
00:58:54,193 --> 00:58:56,237
<i>...I was walking back to my car.</i>

550
00:58:58,156 --> 00:59:00,199
<i>I thought I was alone, but...</i>

551
00:59:01,284 --> 00:59:03,328
<i>...I'm sure someone else was there.</i>

552
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:47,747
Great.

553
01:00:31,457 --> 01:00:35,878
That... thing... was waiting for me.

554
01:00:45,888 --> 01:00:48,558
How did you know to turn off the lights?

555
01:00:48,641 --> 01:00:51,811
-Who cares? It worked.
-Yeah, but how did you know?

556
01:00:51,894 --> 01:00:53,479
Instinct.

557
01:00:53,563 --> 01:00:54,939
Instinct?

558
01:00:55,022 --> 01:00:56,816
<i>-Yeah.
-You know what?</i>

559
01:00:57,942 --> 01:00:59,610
You're a terrible liar.

560
01:00:59,694 --> 01:01:02,321
You say that like you know me.

561
01:01:03,406 --> 01:01:05,408
What else aren't you telling me?

562
01:01:05,491 --> 01:01:08,119
Well, um, let's see...

563
01:01:09,245 --> 01:01:12,373
On my sixth birthday, my best friend at the time,
Scott Tibbs,

564
01:01:12,456 --> 01:01:14,917
<i>stabbed me with a rusty nail -
I didn't tell you that.</i>

565
01:01:15,001 --> 01:01:17,879
My last girlfriend, a feminist vegan punk,

566
01:01:17,962 --> 01:01:20,423
<i>broke up with me because I was too angry.</i>

567
01:01:20,506 --> 01:01:24,135
-One of my toenails is slightly...
-Just stop it!

568
01:01:25,261 --> 01:01:27,388
You knew to turn off these lights.

569
01:01:27,471 --> 01:01:30,474
-Whatever.
-I'm dealing with a juvenile.

570
01:01:31,601 --> 01:01:34,395
-You wanna know?
-Yeah!

571
01:01:36,063 --> 01:01:37,773
Here it is.

572
01:01:48,784 --> 01:01:50,536
Come.

573
01:01:52,705 --> 01:01:54,749
Oh, God.

574
01:02:00,588 --> 01:02:02,715
W-Where did you get this?

575
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:05,176
It was in your wallet.

576
01:02:05,259 --> 01:02:07,261
<i>Behind the photo of your daughter.</i>

577
01:02:07,345 --> 01:02:11,223
-Why didn't you show me this before?
-I couldn't.

578
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:17,146
I'm sorry.

579
01:02:28,324 --> 01:02:30,534
What are you doing to them, you bastard?

580
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:41,253
OK. OK.

581
01:02:42,338 --> 01:02:44,382
OK, I've got to think now.

582
01:02:47,134 --> 01:02:49,136
<i>Think about this -</i>

583
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:51,680
<i>you don't need a gun to kill Adam.</i>

584
01:02:53,015 --> 01:02:55,559
<i>When there's that much poison in your blood,</i>

585
01:02:55,643 --> 01:02:58,854
<i>the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.</i>

586
01:03:32,805 --> 01:03:34,849
<i>What are you doing?</i>

587
01:03:41,564 --> 01:03:44,900
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

588
01:03:46,026 --> 01:03:49,280
<i>Shh. Adam, listen to me.</i>

589
01:03:49,363 --> 01:03:51,574
<i>I want you to play along with me on this.</i>

590
01:03:59,498 --> 01:04:01,834
<i>You got that?</i>

591
01:04:14,054 --> 01:04:16,932
So, you er... You still want that cigarette?

592
01:04:17,016 --> 01:04:20,102
Um... yeah.

593
01:04:20,185 --> 01:04:22,229
Sure.

594
01:05:30,756 --> 01:05:32,966
There! I've done it!

595
01:05:34,051 --> 01:05:36,345
<i>I've killed him with the poison like you wanted!</i>

596
01:05:36,428 --> 01:05:38,472
Now where's my family?

597
01:05:38,555 --> 01:05:40,015
Where are they?

598
01:05:44,269 --> 01:05:45,437
Aaaargh!

599
01:05:47,147 --> 01:05:51,652
-Aagh! Jesus Christ!
-What are you...?

600
01:05:51,735 --> 01:05:54,780
I-I-I just got electrocuted!

601
01:05:54,863 --> 01:05:56,865
What?

602
01:05:56,949 --> 01:05:59,451
Jesus. That was our way out!

603
01:05:59,535 --> 01:06:02,329
Did you hear what I said? Get this thing off me!

604
01:06:02,413 --> 01:06:04,748
<i>-Get it off!
-Stop acting!</i>

605
01:06:04,832 --> 01:06:09,086
You think I would make that up just to mess up
your stupid fucking charade?

606
01:06:09,169 --> 01:06:10,796
<i>All right, that's it.</i>

607
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:28,355
Damn it!

608
01:06:33,944 --> 01:06:35,988
I remember everything now.

609
01:06:38,198 --> 01:06:40,451
I remember how I got here.

610
01:08:11,959 --> 01:08:14,002
Oh...

611
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:30,769
Great.

612
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,551
Is someone there?

613
01:09:14,104 --> 01:09:16,148
I can hear you.

614
01:09:47,179 --> 01:09:49,222
Huh!

615
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:52,893
What the...?

616
01:09:55,896 --> 01:09:57,939
What the Christ...?

617
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:09,075
What the...?

618
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:15,874
Huh!

619
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,960
Who is that?

620
01:10:19,044 --> 01:10:21,755
Who's in there?

621
01:10:21,838 --> 01:10:23,840
Come out!

622
01:10:23,924 --> 01:10:25,967
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

623
01:10:41,983 --> 01:10:42,734
Aagh!

624
01:11:09,135 --> 01:11:10,887
Who is this?

625
01:11:10,971 --> 01:11:13,348
<i>Daddy?</i>

626
01:11:13,431 --> 01:11:14,683
Diana.

627
01:11:14,766 --> 01:11:16,851
Daddy, is that you?

628
01:11:17,978 --> 01:11:20,647
Yeah, baby, it's me, I'm here.

629
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:23,149
I-I'm scared, Daddy.

630
01:11:23,233 --> 01:11:26,361
Don't worry, honey. Everything's gonna be OK.

631
01:11:26,444 --> 01:11:30,156
<i>-Where's Mommy?
-She's here with me.</i>

632
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,367
Let me talk to her, sweetie.

633
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:34,536
OK? Put Mommy on.

634
01:11:34,619 --> 01:11:37,998
The bad man from my room is here.

635
01:11:38,081 --> 01:11:40,959
<i>He has us tied up...</i>

636
01:11:41,042 --> 01:11:43,294
And he has a gun.

637
01:11:43,378 --> 01:11:46,131
Wh-What man?

638
01:11:46,214 --> 01:11:48,258
<i>Please come home, Daddy.</i>

639
01:11:49,676 --> 01:11:50,677
Hello?

640
01:11:51,803 --> 01:11:52,804
Hello?

641
01:11:53,847 --> 01:11:54,848
Diana?

642
01:11:55,974 --> 01:11:57,142
<i>Diana?</i>

643
01:11:58,351 --> 01:11:59,811
Diana!

644
01:12:03,314 --> 01:12:04,315
Larry.

645
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:07,610
Ali? Is that you?

646
01:12:07,694 --> 01:12:09,738
Is Adam there?

647
01:12:11,614 --> 01:12:13,199
<i>Well, how do you know...</i>

648
01:12:14,325 --> 01:12:15,827
Ali...

649
01:12:16,911 --> 01:12:18,913
What is going on?

650
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:21,958
Don't believe Adam's lies.

651
01:12:23,418 --> 01:12:27,297
<i>He knows you.
He knew all about you before today.</i>

652
01:12:31,509 --> 01:12:33,595
Hello? Ali?

653
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:36,514
Ali?

654
01:12:37,807 --> 01:12:39,267
Hello!

655
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:41,352
Goddamn you!

656
01:12:41,436 --> 01:12:44,814
If you so much as lay a finger on them,
I'll kill you.

657
01:12:44,898 --> 01:12:47,484
You hear me, you son of a bitch? I'll kill you!

658
01:12:54,032 --> 01:12:55,700
Damn!

659
01:12:56,784 --> 01:12:59,204
Are they OK?

660
01:13:02,373 --> 01:13:05,793
My wife, she er... She mentioned your name.

661
01:13:08,213 --> 01:13:10,256
What did she say?

662
01:13:11,966 --> 01:13:14,093
She told me...

663
01:13:14,177 --> 01:13:16,262
not to believe you.

664
01:13:17,388 --> 01:13:19,015
Believe me about what?

665
01:13:21,809 --> 01:13:24,270
She told me you knew me.

666
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,318
Who are you?

667
01:13:31,444 --> 01:13:33,446
You know who I am.

668
01:13:33,529 --> 01:13:37,367
Stop the lies! You're a liar!
I need to know the truth!

669
01:13:39,911 --> 01:13:41,955
I'm a liar?

670
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:45,250
What did you do last night, Lawrence?

671
01:13:46,334 --> 01:13:48,920
<i>Work at a hospital, saving sick children?</i>

672
01:13:49,003 --> 01:13:51,756
You told me
that after you left your house last night,

673
01:13:51,839 --> 01:13:53,841
<i>you went to work at a hospital.</i>

674
01:13:53,925 --> 01:13:57,220
<i>-That's because it's the truth.
-No, it's not.</i>

675
01:13:57,303 --> 01:13:59,514
Your wife is right, Larry.

676
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:04,394
<i>You don't recall getting your picture taken
in that parking lot?</i>

677
01:14:22,036 --> 01:14:25,248
I can prove that you didn't go anywhere near
a hospital last night.

678
01:14:33,131 --> 01:14:35,633
It's not the first time I've done it either, Larry.

679
01:14:35,717 --> 01:14:38,177
<i>I've been taking pictures of you for days now.</i>

680
01:14:44,767 --> 01:14:46,894
<i>-Why?
-You want to know what I do?</i>

681
01:14:46,978 --> 01:14:49,480
I get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you,

682
01:14:49,564 --> 01:14:51,983
who go to seedy motels to fuck their secretaries.

683
01:14:52,066 --> 01:14:54,694
<i>Last night, I went to your house.</i>

684
01:14:54,777 --> 01:14:57,030
<i>and watched you leave.</i>

685
01:14:57,113 --> 01:14:58,531
<i>I followed you...</i>

686
01:15:00,033 --> 01:15:01,784
<i>...all the way to that shit-bag hotel.</i>

687
01:15:05,663 --> 01:15:08,750
You've er... had these with you the whole time?

688
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:11,753
I found them in there with the hacksaws.

689
01:15:12,795 --> 01:15:14,756
<i>I don't know how they got there.</i>

690
01:15:14,839 --> 01:15:20,636
-Right! You're so full of it!
-Face it, Larry, we're both bullshitters!

691
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,514
<i>But my camera isn't. It doesn't know how to lie.</i>

692
01:15:23,598 --> 01:15:26,559
It only shows you what's put right in front of it.

693
01:15:26,642 --> 01:15:29,812
Just out of curiosity,
what did you do in that motel room?

694
01:15:29,896 --> 01:15:32,356
<i>You got out of there pretty fast.</i>

695
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:42,992
Why did you um...

696
01:15:43,075 --> 01:15:46,162
deem it necessary to page me
when you knew I was at home?

697
01:15:47,246 --> 01:15:49,290
I didn't know if you were going to make it.

698
01:15:51,459 --> 01:15:54,170
I gave you a precise time at which to page me.

699
01:15:55,338 --> 01:15:57,089
You can't do that.

700
01:15:57,173 --> 01:15:59,967
It's not like I know the rules for this sort of stuff.

701
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:07,892
-What's wrong, Dr. Gordon?
-Look, um...

702
01:16:09,393 --> 01:16:11,604
It was wrong of me to make you come here.

703
01:16:11,687 --> 01:16:15,358
-But I thought we've...
-No, no. Please.

704
01:16:17,443 --> 01:16:18,653
I'm sorry.

705
01:16:31,832 --> 01:16:33,834
You tell anyone you were here?

706
01:16:33,918 --> 01:16:35,461
No.

707
01:16:46,597 --> 01:16:48,641
Hello.

708
01:16:52,812 --> 01:16:55,273
-It's for you.
-For me?

709
01:17:09,412 --> 01:17:10,413
Hello.

710
01:17:12,415 --> 01:17:16,085
<i>I know what you're doing... Doctor.</i>

711
01:17:18,129 --> 01:17:20,172
I...

712
01:17:30,391 --> 01:17:32,393
I have to go.

713
01:17:32,476 --> 01:17:34,729
-What happened?
-I gotta go.

714
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,582
Who was it?

715
01:17:54,665 --> 01:17:56,292
Who was what?

716
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:59,545
The person who paid you to follow me.
Who was it?

717
01:17:59,628 --> 01:18:03,674
He calls himself Bob and he gives me
the money upfront. 200 bucks a night.

718
01:18:03,758 --> 01:18:06,469
If I'd known I'd end up here,
I'd have asked for a lot more.

719
01:18:06,552 --> 01:18:09,597
What does that mean?
Does that mean you saw what happened to me?

720
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,641
What I saw was you get into your car. That's it.

721
01:18:12,725 --> 01:18:16,228
<i>I didn't ask your name.
I didn't know who you were.</i>

722
01:18:16,312 --> 01:18:19,899
I don't know how I got here.
I don't know how you got here.

723
01:18:19,982 --> 01:18:23,319
<i>I took the shots and went straight home
to develop them.</i>

724
01:18:23,402 --> 01:18:26,280
Next thing I know, I'm chained to a pipe

725
01:18:26,363 --> 01:18:29,992
in some prehistoric bathroom, staring at
the guy I've been taking shots of.

726
01:18:30,076 --> 01:18:34,246
Clearly, whoever paid you to take pictures of me
is the one who put us here.

727
01:18:34,330 --> 01:18:35,331
Maybe.

728
01:18:35,414 --> 01:18:37,458
Of course it is! What did he look like?

729
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:39,710
<i>-Just a guy.
-Was he tall? Skinny? Obese?</i>

730
01:18:39,794 --> 01:18:42,880
-I don't take notes.
-You must remember something about him.

731
01:18:42,963 --> 01:18:45,508
-I can't.
-You don't remember a thing about the guy?

732
01:18:45,591 --> 01:18:48,219
-I told you, I...
-For fuck's sake! I give up!

733
01:18:48,302 --> 01:18:51,555
He's a tall black guy.
He's got a scar around his neck, OK?

734
01:19:02,274 --> 01:19:03,275
Tapp.

735
01:19:06,612 --> 01:19:09,907
<i>-Detective Tapp.
-Whoa.</i>

736
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:13,118
<i>The guy who paid me to take these photos
was not a cop.</i>

737
01:19:13,202 --> 01:19:16,121
No, no. He was discharged from the police force.

738
01:19:16,205 --> 01:19:18,707
He broke down after his partner was killed.

739
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:22,086
<i>But that didn't stop him harassing me.
The guy became obsessed.</i>

740
01:19:22,169 --> 01:19:25,631
He's convinced I must have somehow
been involved with the murders.

741
01:19:25,714 --> 01:19:28,342
He's crazy. And you helped him.

742
01:19:28,425 --> 01:19:32,221
You took money from him to invade my privacy.

743
01:19:32,304 --> 01:19:34,223
How could you do that?

744
01:19:34,306 --> 01:19:36,976
<i>-Call it my need to eat.
-Right.</i>

745
01:19:37,059 --> 01:19:40,896
Right. You know what, Adam,
you're not a victim of this game.

746
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,940
<i>-You're part of it.
-Oh, really?</i>

747
01:19:43,023 --> 01:19:45,526
This cop thinks you're the one behind it all.

748
01:19:45,609 --> 01:19:49,280
I told you, he's not a cop.
He's a bottom feeder, just like you!

749
01:19:49,363 --> 01:19:52,199
What are you pissed off about?
The fact I took shots of you

750
01:19:52,283 --> 01:19:55,661
or the fact that I took shots of you
while you cheated on your wife?

751
01:19:55,744 --> 01:19:59,373
<i>-I did not cheat on her!
-What do you care what I think anyway?</i>

752
01:19:59,456 --> 01:20:04,545
I don't give a crap if you covered yourself in
peanut butter and had a 15-hooker gangbang.

753
01:20:19,184 --> 01:20:21,937
How did I get here? I had...

754
01:20:22,021 --> 01:20:23,856
I had everything in order.

755
01:20:25,983 --> 01:20:28,319
My whole life was in perfect order.

756
01:20:55,929 --> 01:20:58,265
Sweetheart, are you OK?

757
01:21:01,518 --> 01:21:05,856
Mommy just needs you to be
really, really, really, really strong right now.

758
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:09,985
I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.

759
01:21:11,111 --> 01:21:12,905
<i>You got that?</i>

760
01:21:12,988 --> 01:21:15,657
OK. That's my good girl.

761
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,851
<i>Hey, was there someone else
at your house last night.</i>

762
01:21:42,935 --> 01:21:44,937
<i>besides your wife and daughter?</i>

763
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:47,689
<i>-No.
-Well, there's someone here.</i>

764
01:22:04,957 --> 01:22:06,959
I know him.

765
01:22:07,042 --> 01:22:09,628
<i>-Zep.
-Who?</i>

766
01:22:09,711 --> 01:22:13,674
His name is Zep. He's an orderly at my hospital.

767
01:22:13,757 --> 01:22:15,342
Zep.

768
01:22:15,425 --> 01:22:17,511
<i>You perverted little psychopath.</i>

769
01:22:17,594 --> 01:22:22,057
I'm gonna take great pleasure
in seeing you pay for this,

770
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,184
<i>you bastard fuck!</i>

771
01:22:27,437 --> 01:22:28,438
Look.

772
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,240
We're out of time.

773
01:22:57,009 --> 01:23:00,971
Shh, sweetie... sweetie.

774
01:23:01,054 --> 01:23:03,348
-Mommy, help me!
-Ssh...

775
01:23:20,616 --> 01:23:23,201
Dr. Gordon's time is up.

776
01:23:24,745 --> 01:23:27,873
Now I've got to do what I've got to do, and...

777
01:23:28,957 --> 01:23:32,294
.. I'm afraid it has to be you
that tells him he failed.

778
01:23:44,139 --> 01:23:45,849
Is that you, Zep, you bastard?

779
01:23:45,932 --> 01:23:48,310
I know it's you, you son of a bitch!

780
01:23:48,393 --> 01:23:50,395
<i>La... Larry.</i>

781
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:52,022
Ali?

782
01:23:52,105 --> 01:23:53,815
You failed.

783
01:23:56,151 --> 01:23:57,152
Hello?

784
01:23:57,986 --> 01:23:58,862
Hello?

785
01:24:00,864 --> 01:24:03,033
-You!
-Wait.

786
01:24:05,827 --> 01:24:09,164
Don't move! Stay on the ground.

787
01:24:09,247 --> 01:24:11,124
Give me... Give me the phone.

788
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,169
Give it to me!

789
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:26,765
Larry?

790
01:24:26,848 --> 01:24:29,476
Ali! Honey, are you all right?

791
01:24:29,559 --> 01:24:32,687
No... No, we're not. Get down!

792
01:24:33,772 --> 01:24:36,775
-Larry, where are you?
-I don't know.

793
01:24:36,858 --> 01:24:39,361
I'm being held captive in a room somewhere.

794
01:24:39,444 --> 01:24:42,155
Wh-What are you talking about?

795
01:24:43,281 --> 01:24:45,575
<i>-I'm so sorry, Ali.
-Honey, we need you here.</i>

796
01:24:45,659 --> 01:24:47,953
<i>So sorry for everything. It's my fault.</i>

797
01:24:48,036 --> 01:24:50,539
Forgive me, I've always been happy with you.

798
01:24:50,622 --> 01:24:51,331
Mommy!

799
01:24:52,415 --> 01:24:54,626
Aagh!

800
01:24:54,709 --> 01:24:55,544
Jesus!

801
01:24:57,963 --> 01:24:58,964
Ali!

802
01:25:15,772 --> 01:25:17,607
<i>Mommy!</i>

803
01:25:20,318 --> 01:25:22,279
Ali! Ali!

804
01:25:23,613 --> 01:25:24,656
Mommy!

805
01:25:31,204 --> 01:25:33,081
Aargh! Aaargh!

806
01:25:40,171 --> 01:25:41,089
Freeze!

807
01:25:51,683 --> 01:25:53,518
<i>Oh, no!</i>

808
01:25:57,689 --> 01:26:00,108
What the fuck?

809
01:26:01,276 --> 01:26:03,361
-Yaaaa!
-Ya!

810
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:19,336
Argh! Urgh!

811
01:26:26,551 --> 01:26:28,595
Mrs. Gordon?

812
01:26:31,389 --> 01:26:33,433
Diana!

813
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,065
I'm gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon.

814
01:27:09,552 --> 01:27:10,387
Lawrence!

815
01:27:15,725 --> 01:27:17,435
Lawrence, get up!

816
01:27:29,155 --> 01:27:31,157
Lawrence! Get up!

817
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:33,910
<i>I need you!</i>

818
01:27:47,465 --> 01:27:50,969
Oh, thank God, I thought you were dead.

819
01:27:56,307 --> 01:27:58,476
He... He... He electrocuted me.

820
01:27:59,227 --> 01:28:02,856
I told you.
The same thing happened to me. See?

821
01:28:02,939 --> 01:28:05,066
<i>I wasn't lying. See?</i>

822
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:07,068
Fuck this shit!

823
01:29:14,969 --> 01:29:16,804
No!

824
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:20,642
Lawrence, calm down.

825
01:29:20,725 --> 01:29:22,936
-There must be a way out of this.
-Shut up!

826
01:29:23,019 --> 01:29:26,606
Just shut up! My family needs me!

827
01:29:28,024 --> 01:29:30,443
No! God!

828
01:29:30,526 --> 01:29:32,528
God! No!

829
01:29:32,612 --> 01:29:34,030
Argh!

830
01:29:39,077 --> 01:29:41,621
Lawrence! I have a family too.

831
01:29:41,704 --> 01:29:45,625
I don't see them, that's my mistake.
It's a mistake I'd like to fix.

832
01:29:50,254 --> 01:29:52,840
I'm gonna kill you, you sick asshole.

833
01:29:54,801 --> 01:29:55,927
<i>Lawrence!</i>

834
01:29:57,011 --> 01:29:58,304
Stop it.

835
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:04,852
<i>Lawrence, just calm down.</i>

836
01:30:04,936 --> 01:30:07,563
There's a way out of here.
There's a way out!

837
01:30:07,647 --> 01:30:08,523
Lawrence!

838
01:30:10,608 --> 01:30:12,610
No! What are you... No!

839
01:30:12,694 --> 01:30:15,238
Oh, my God! Lawrence!

840
01:30:17,198 --> 01:30:19,617
What are you doing?

841
01:31:31,397 --> 01:31:33,441
What... are you doing?

842
01:31:55,296 --> 01:31:57,590
What are you... What are you...

843
01:31:59,342 --> 01:32:01,427
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

844
01:32:03,971 --> 01:32:05,973
<i>Lawrence, don't! No!</i>

845
01:32:06,057 --> 01:32:08,059
<i>No, Lawrence, please!</i>

846
01:32:08,142 --> 01:32:10,561
<i>I'm begging you!</i>

847
01:32:10,645 --> 01:32:13,272
Lawrence! It's not me who did this to you!

848
01:32:14,532 --> 01:32:16,910
-You have to die.
-No! I want to live!

849
01:32:16,993 --> 01:32:18,995
-I'm sorry.
-I want to live!

850
01:32:19,079 --> 01:32:21,414
-My family...
-Argh!

851
01:32:34,928 --> 01:32:37,722
There! I've done it!

852
01:32:38,848 --> 01:32:40,892
Now show them to me!

853
01:32:44,271 --> 01:32:46,314
Show them to me.

854
01:32:46,398 --> 01:32:48,692
-Thank you very much, Officer.
-Larry?

855
01:32:48,775 --> 01:32:50,777
Did you get through to him?

856
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:53,363
-There's still no answer.
-I've called the police.

857
01:32:53,446 --> 01:32:55,490
Everything is OK.

858
01:33:10,922 --> 01:33:12,507
<i>You bastard!</i>

859
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:15,760
I'll fucking kill you! I'll fucking kill you!

860
01:33:15,844 --> 01:33:17,846
You fucking bastard!

861
01:33:17,929 --> 01:33:21,599
I'll fucking kill you!
You fucking bastard!

862
01:33:21,683 --> 01:33:23,810
I'll fucking kill you!

863
01:33:23,893 --> 01:33:25,437
I'll fucking kill you.

864
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:37,198
<i>You're too late.</i>

865
01:33:37,282 --> 01:33:40,035
-Why?
-It's the rules.

866
01:33:43,997 --> 01:33:45,457
Argh!

867
01:34:24,078 --> 01:34:25,872
You're gonna be all right.

868
01:34:25,955 --> 01:34:28,583
You're just wounded... wounded in the shoulder.

869
01:34:29,709 --> 01:34:32,420
I have to go and get help.

870
01:34:32,638 --> 01:34:35,057
Don't leave me!

871
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:36,433
No!

872
01:34:36,517 --> 01:34:38,560
No! No!

873
01:34:40,521 --> 01:34:42,564
No! Ow!

874
01:34:44,865 --> 01:34:48,565
Lawrence! Lawrence!

875
01:34:52,490 --> 01:34:53,908
D-Don't worry.

876
01:34:53,992 --> 01:34:55,493
<i>I'll bring someone back.</i>

877
01:34:55,577 --> 01:34:57,203
I promise.

878
01:35:17,667 --> 01:35:19,711
Key.

879
01:35:37,937 --> 01:35:39,981
Key. Key!

880
01:36:02,294 --> 01:36:05,214
<i>Hello, Mr. Hindle.</i>

881
01:36:05,297 --> 01:36:07,675
<i>Or as they called you around the hospital...</i>

882
01:36:08,759 --> 01:36:09,802
<i>...Zep.</i>

883
01:36:09,885 --> 01:36:11,929
<i>I want you to make a choice.</i>

884
01:36:16,433 --> 01:36:19,895
<i>There's a slow-acting poison
coursing through your system</i>

885
01:36:19,979 --> 01:36:22,898
<i>which only I have the antidote for.</i>

886
01:36:22,982 --> 01:36:25,484
<i>Will you murder a mother and her child</i>

887
01:36:25,568 --> 01:36:27,945
<i>to save yourself?</i>

888
01:36:28,028 --> 01:36:29,989
Dr. Gordon's time is up.

889
01:36:30,072 --> 01:36:31,323
Mrs. Gordon!

890
01:36:32,199 --> 01:36:35,494
<i>Listen carefully, if you will. There are rules.</i>

891
01:36:35,577 --> 01:36:37,997
-Why?
-It's the rules.

892
01:37:25,252 --> 01:37:29,131
The key to that chain is in the bathtub.

893
01:37:39,892 --> 01:37:42,895
He's a very interesting person.
His name is John.

894
01:37:42,978 --> 01:37:45,397
He has an inoperable frontal-lobe tumor.

895
01:37:45,481 --> 01:37:48,817
<i>-Sick from disease eating away at me inside.
-Sounds like Jigsaw.</i>

896
01:37:48,901 --> 01:37:51,779
<i>I'm sick of people
not appreciating their blessings.</i>

897
01:37:51,862 --> 01:37:55,407
He books himself front-row seats
to his own sicko games.

898
01:37:55,491 --> 01:37:59,369
<i>Hello, Mark, Paul, Amanda,
Zep, Adam, Dr. Gordon.</i>

899
01:37:59,453 --> 01:38:01,163
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

900
01:38:27,397 --> 01:38:30,943
<i>Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.</i>

901
01:38:31,944 --> 01:38:33,487
<i>But not you.</i>

902
01:38:34,613 --> 01:38:36,782
<i>Not any more.</i>

903
01:38:40,327 --> 01:38:43,121
Game over.

904
01:38:43,205 --> 01:38:46,124
Argh! Argh!

905
01:38:46,208 --> 01:38:49,044
Don't! Don't!

906
01:38:49,127 --> 01:38:52,881
Don't! Argh!
