1
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,230
This is the story...

2
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,600
and the tricky life and bitter downfall of Coleman Silk.

3
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,760
You mean to tell me you're
President of the United States

4
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,590
and you're banging some
22 year-old intern in the White House

5
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,970
and you ask her to keep her mouth shut,

6
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,510
and you really think she's gonna do it?
I mean, come on, give me a break!

7
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,640
Clinton. He should count himself lucky
she didn't go straight to Oprah.

8
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,520
Come on, she was overwhelmed by
Starr's team in that hotel room.

9
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,980
No, poor thing.
Eleven guys hitting on her?

10
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,440
- That's a gang-bang.
- Oh, right.

11
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,030
That's why she's talking to Linda Tripp.

12
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,900
She's talking to everybody.

13
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,110
She's part of that whole dopey culture.
Yak yak yak.

14
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,620
Oh, look, if Clinton couldn't
figure Monica Lewinsky,

15
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,780
then he shouldn't
have been president.

16
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,330
That's grounds for
impeachment right there.

17
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,500
- That's true.
- You're right.

18
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,830
I'm telling you,
if he'd just fucked her.

19
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,210
That's the way you
create loyalty.

20
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,420
- Yeah.
- That's the way.

21
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,250
But you know what Kennedy would
have done to her? Or Nixon?

22
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,300
They would have told her,
Not only are you not gonna work,

23
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,180
you're not gonna work ever again.
And your father's gonna be out of work.

24
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,340
And your mother. And your brother

25
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,720
Everybody in your family is
not gonna make one more thin dime

26
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,520
unless you keep your mouth shut.

27
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,520
Well, but Clinton plays it like a lawyer.
That's why he didn't want to come.

28
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,400
Hey, when he came,
he was finished.

29
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,230
Evidence.
Smoking come.

30
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,690
Nineteen ninety-eight was
the summer of sanctimony.

31
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,740
After the fall of Communism and
before the horrors of terrorism,

32
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,210
there was a brief interlude when
the nation was preoccupied by cocksucking.

33
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,380
This is Coleman Silk

34
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,750
once the powerful Dean
of Faculty and professor of Classics

35
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,490
at Athena College in western Massachusetts.

36
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,120
One of the first Jews to teach in a Classics department anywhere in America.

37
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,300
When Coleman had been appointed Dean, he had ruthlessly

38
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,700
hacked away the debt woods, streamlined the curriculum and dragged Athena

39
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,440
kicking and screaming,
from mediocrity to excellence.

40
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,610
Of course, in the process, he made a good many enemies.

41
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,820
Sing, O Gods,
of the wrath of Achilles

42
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,360
And finally, "the persecuting spirit"
caught up with Coleman.

43
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,330
All of European literature springs from a fight,

44
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,790
a barroom brawl, really.

45
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,230
And what was Achilles so angry about?

46
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,370
Well, he and King Agamemnon
were quarrelling over a woman,

47
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,070
a young girl and her body

48
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,040
and the delights of sexual rapacity.

49
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,340
Achilles, the most hypersensitive

50
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,510
fighting machine in the history of warfare.

51
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,880
Achilles, who, because of his rage
at having to give up the girl,

52
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,020
isolates himself defiantly
outside the very society

53
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,700
whose protector he is and
whose need of him is enormous.

54
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:40,050
Achilles, has to give up the girl.
He has to give her back.

55
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,350
And that is how the great imaginative
literature of Europe begins,

56
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,520
and that is why
three thousand years later,

57
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,520
we are going to
begin there today.

58
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:59,360
Miss Cummings, Tracy Cummings,
can you tell us

59
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,870
Still not here. Okay.
Mr. Thomas, William Thomas.

60
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,410
Is he here?

61
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,620
We're five weeks into the semester

62
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,040
and I haven't even laid eyes on these folks.

63
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,920
Can anyone tell me, do these people exist?

64
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,840
Or are they spooks?

65
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,510
Were you aware, Professor Silk,

66
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,720
that Tracy Cummings and William Thomas
are African-Americans?

67
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,100
How could I be?
I've never seen them.

68
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,350
But you are aware of
the connotation of the word "spook."

69
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,810
Ghost Professor Roux. Ghost.

70
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,820
I was referring to
their ectoplasmic character.

71
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:47,370
Here is the, uh, first definition
of the word. I quote

72
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:53,870
Spook, Informal
Ghost, Spectre

73
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,340
But, Dean Silk, let me remind you
of the second definition

74
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,630
Negro.

75
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,840
I'd never laid eyes on them.
How could I know they were black? Hmm?

76
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,800
All I did know was
that they were invisible.

77
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,260
Nevertheless,
they have lodged a complaint.

78
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,890
Miss Cummings was devastated.
Now the issue here

79
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,390
These students have
never attended a single class.

80
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,480
Do they exist or are they spooks?
Consider the context.

81
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,110
- But, Dean Silk
- I've not finished!

82
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,110
The only issue is the nonattendance
of these students,

83
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,740
their inexcusable neglect of work
and their sheer chutzpah.

84
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,620
Oh, Miss Cummings is devastated.
Give me a break, will you?

85
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,250
To charge me with racism
is not only false,

86
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:42,960
it is spectacularly false!
And you know it!

87
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,930
Thanks a lot, Herb.

88
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,350
- Well, I've quit.
- What?

89
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,600
I've resigned from
that half-assed college.

90
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,850
Where's that last year's phone book?

91
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,940
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. What happened?

92
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,360
- I've been accused of a racist epithet.
- What racist epithet?

93
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,490
I used the word "spooks," which
fifty years ago was just a slang

94
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,950
I know what it was slang for.

95
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,990
Where's that phone book?
We'll sue these wimpy bastards.

96
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,120
- I want that lawyer, Alfred or whatever
- Wait, did you remind them

97
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,950
- that when you were dean you...
- Yeah, I reminded them.

98
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,040
No, you hired Herb Keble,
the first black...

99
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,500
- Please, "African-American," please.
- Okay

100
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,130
- African-American, ever on the faculty.
- Where's that book?

101
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,170
Isn't Herb on the same committee?

102
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
- But wait, wait, just tell me
- Yes, he is.

103
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,300
And they're our friends,
for God's sake!

104
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,130
- Did Herb even open his mouth?
- Yes, yes.

105
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,800
I'm sorry, Coleman, I can't be
with you on this. Bullshit.

106
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,970
Fine, fine. They want to fight?

107
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,470
I'll give them a fight
that they'll never forget!

108
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,560
This is absolute lunacy!
After 35 years of your devotion

109
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,440
Now you know what we're going to do?
We're going to organize.

110
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,320
We're going to get them to sign
a petition. That's what we'll do.

111
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,860
No. You know what we're going to do?
We're going to do a two-pronged attack.

112
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,530
We're going to attack
We're going to get lawyers,

113
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,080
because I know some...
Okay. I know. Which is why

114
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,250
- Coly?
- What?

115
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,580
- Something's wrong.
- I know there is. What do you mean?

116
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,590
- Coly
- What's the matter?

117
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,340
- Coly
- Hey, come on, sit down.

118
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,090
What's the matter?
Come on.

119
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,050
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

120
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,100
It's all right.

121
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,190
I'm sorry

122
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,590
Iris Silk died several hours later
in her husband's arms.

123
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,300
Six months after that,
Coleman came into my life.

124
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:57,430
I had been living alone in a small cabin
by a lake not far from Athena.

125
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,640
Including questions
about my private life...

126
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,480
questions no American citizen
would ever want to answer.

127
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,820
Still, I must take
complete responsibility

128
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,070
for all my actions
both public and private.

129
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,990
And that is why I am
speaking to you tonight.

130
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,280
- As you know, in a deposition in January
- Hello?

131
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,910
I was asked questions
about my relationship

132
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,040
- Are you Mr. Zuckerman?
- Yeah.

133
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,420
- Are you Nathan Zuckerman?
- Yeah.

134
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,630
You're the Zuckerman
that's the writer, correct?

135
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,390
- Yeah, but
- We've got to talk. May I come in?

136
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,770
Thanks. Your last book won
some sort of prize, right?

137
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,810
- It was short-listed for the
- That was 5 years ago. What happened?

138
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,610
You're blocked, right?
You're blocked!

139
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,820
You're worried you don't
have another story in you.

140
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,280
Well, I can fix that.
I'm the answer to your prayers.

141
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
- You know who I am?
- Dean Silk?

142
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,280
Dean Coleman Silk.
That's right.

143
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,370
The late, retired and now resigned
and unlamented Dean Silk,

144
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,120
following the murder
you clock that?

145
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,540
Following the murder of my wife.

146
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,130
How's that grab you, Zuckerman?

147
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,920
That good enough to
get your juices flowing?

148
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,210
I'm not sure I understand.

149
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,920
Those sons of bitches
killed my wife, Nathan.

150
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,600
They killed my wife as if they'd taken
a gun and fired it into her heart.

151
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,890
Yeah. Who would've thought
Iris couldn't take it

152
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,690
as strong as she was,
brave as she was? But, uh

153
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:33,320
yeah, their kind of stupidity was too
much even for a juggernaut like my Iris.

154
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,820
Massive embolism.

155
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,530
Pow! I got her to the hospital,
but it was too late.

156
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,910
The point is they meant to kill me
but they got her instead.

157
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,620
All in the name of
political correctness.

158
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,750
There's an oxymoron
if ever I heard one.

159
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,340
So, there's your book, Nathan.

160
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,010
You mind if I call you Nathan?

161
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,420
- Look, Dean...
- Just Coleman.

162
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,220
All my other titles
I have given away.

163
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,260
Coleman. Look, I'm sorry but I write
fiction, and at the moment I'm...

164
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,350
Believe me this thing will read
like The Manchurian Candidate.

165
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,190
They murdered the wrong person,
for Christ's sakes!

166
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,070
For one word! Spooks!

167
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,030
Spooks! It's unbelievable.

168
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,700
Let me tell you something, Nathan.

169
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,460
My father was a
saloonkeeper in New Jersey.

170
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,080
Yeah, he was the only Jewish
saloonkeeper in East Orange.

171
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,250
He only got as far as
the seventh grade.

172
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,010
But he insisted on
the precision of words.

173
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,220
And I have kept faith with him.
I have kept faith with him.

174
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,390
If you don't mind a suggestion

175
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,560
maybe you ought to write
this book yourself.

176
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,730
Yeah.

177
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,110
Maybe I ought to.

178
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,610
Yeah.

179
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,740
I guess I ought to go.
Let me ask you something

180
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,250
Why are you hiding out here,
in the middle of the woods?

181
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,750
- Hiding out?
- Yeah. Isn't that what you're doing?

182
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,840
What's the moment
called in Greek tragedy,

183
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,260
you know, the one where the hero
learns that everything he knows is wrong?

184
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:28,980
It's called peripeteio or peripetia.
Take your choice.

185
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,690
Yeah. That's me.

186
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,150
Hey. You by any chance
play gin rummy?

187
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,160
And this was how my friendship
with Coleman Silk began.

188
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,040
And how I came out from
my reclusive life,

189
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,040
living alone in
a cabin by a lake.

190
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,960
You're divorced, huh?

191
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,840
Does it show?

192
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,380
Yeah, you have the look about
you of a man at loose ends.

193
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,970
Takes one to know one.

194
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,140
Why did your wife leave you?

195
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,850
Which one?

196
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,970
The first or the second?

197
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,310
Several years ago,

198
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,100
I had been diagnosed
with prostate cancer.

199
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,310
Although the treatment
was successful,

200
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,280
I had nevertheless withdrawn
to my cabin in the woods,

201
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,990
away from the expectations and
entanglements of modern life.

202
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,950
In the year that
followed my meeting Coleman,

203
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,580
the time it took him
to write his book,

204
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,580
we had dinner together
several times a week.

205
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,880
Sometimes playing penny
a point gin rummy,

206
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,010
sometimes listening to music that came
from a small FM station in Springfield

207
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,680
that played big band hits from
the forties and fifties.

208
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,640
It was during that time

209
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,020
that Coleman dragged me back to life,
much as he had Athena College.

210
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,610
- What's with the book?
- The book has come and gone.

211
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,280
- Meaning?
- Meaning it's worthless.

212
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,820
Yeah.

213
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,620
You can't make a college
without breaking eggheads,

214
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,330
and, I couldn't write
a book called Spooks

215
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,250
that didn't sound like
the ravings of a lunatic.

216
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,880
So... all this is useless.

217
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:29,430
Unless you count the dubious thrill
of re-reading old love letters.

218
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,690
Who's the girl?

219
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,900
- That's Steena Paulsson.
- Very pretty.

220
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,230
- Yeah.
- This you?

221
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Yeah, that's me.

222
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,110
I met her
when I was at N.Y.U.

223
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:52,370
And, it was in 1948 and I was on
the GI Bill with the Navy behind me.

224
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,160
At that time I used to live
in the Village in those days,

225
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,250
and I used to go into the library.

226
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,670
It was just like fishing. I'd go into
the stacks and come out with a girl.

227
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,970
Steena Paulsson.
Yeah, I almost married her.

228
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,940
Hi.

229
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,940
Hi.

230
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,990
This book will
change your life, I promise.

231
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,570
I can't stay long.

232
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,910
Come on in. Just take me
a minute to find it.

233
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,410
Oh, this is beautiful.
I have two roommates

234
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,290
and we live in this dungeon at the bottom
of an air shaft on West 26th Street.

235
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,630
- Would you like some coffee?
- No. Thank you. I should get back.

236
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,130
It's just one cup.
That's all, I promise.

237
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,800
And the, uh, the library
stays open until ten.

238
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,180
- Sure. Why not?
- Good.

239
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,310
- How do you take it?
- Black is fine, thanks.

240
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,650
- So "Steena Paulsson." That's,
- what is that Swedish?

241
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,980
Close.
It's Danish and Icelandic.

242
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,200
- So you're not from New York?
- How could you tell?

243
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,160
Fergus Falls, Minnesota.

244
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,870
Well Miss Steena Paulsson
from Fergus Falls, Minnesota

245
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,170
this is my gift for you.

246
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,880
Tender is the Night.
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

247
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,040
He's from the Midwest, too.

248
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,920
Thank you.

249
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,340
You're welcome.

250
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,680
The coffee?

251
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,020
Coffee.

252
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,270
What happened?

253
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,520
- To what?
- The cut over your eye.

254
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,280
Oh uh, boxing.
It's just a hobby.

255
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,740
You like that sort of thing?

256
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,160
Yes, I do.

257
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,570
I mean, don't get the wrong idea.
It's not about strength.

258
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,660
It's really all about
how smart you are.

259
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,620
Are you smart. Miss Paulsson?

260
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,420
What do you think, Mr. Silk?

261
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,300
I think you'd make a great boxer.

262
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,300
Good answer.

263
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,890
Well, come on.
Let's see.

264
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,430
- See what?
- Show me.

265
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,230
- Show you what?
- Show me how good you are.

266
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,060
Okay.

267
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,850
- Okay. You're right-handed?
- Yes.

268
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,400
All right. Put your left leg forward,
your right leg back.

269
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,070
Bend at the knees.

270
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,740
Okay?
Two fists.

271
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,570
Bring your right one back by
your chin. Keep it cocked here.

272
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,490
Left one comes out in front of you.
That's what you jab with.

273
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,740
All right. And your thumbs
are on the outside,

274
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,250
yeah? Okay. It's like this

275
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:50,210
- Jab. Jab. Jab.
- Jab. Jab. Jab.

276
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,090
That's pretty good for starters.

277
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,800
Um, your right hand,
throw that in once in a while.

278
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,050
Just to mix the other guy up.

279
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,180
It's a right cross. Like this

280
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:04,100
- Jab. Jab right.
- Jab. Jab right.

281
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,020
- That's good.
- Jab. Jab right.

282
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,440
- All right. The hands.
- Okay. I'm getting hot.

283
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,450
Jab. Jab right.
Jab. Jab right.

284
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,450
Nice. Keep the right
back by your chin.

285
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,990
Okay. Jab. Jab right.
Jab. Jab right.

286
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,620
- Watch the hands.
- Stop moving! Jab. Jab right.

287
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,370
- Jab. Jab right.
- That's good.

288
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,500
Jab. Jab right.
Jab. Jab right!

289
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,550
Did I hurt you?

290
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,130
No.

291
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,140
Your heart's beating fast.

292
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,100
I can't believe this.

293
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,600
Me neither.

294
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,810
I guess we do things
a little differently back home.

295
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,320
Yes, I can imagine.

296
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:41,120
First, first we'd be eyeing each
other in church, on Sundays, right?

297
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,750
And then as fall slipped into winter
and the air turned cold,

298
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:54,050
there'd be sleigh rides
skating on frozen lakes

299
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,880
singing carols around
the yuletide.

300
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,680
You forgot logrolling
and dunking for apples.

301
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,770
Go on, then.
Give me the straight dope.

302
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:21,740
- Tell me about real American courtship.
- You're American. Jews are American.

303
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,210
Now listen.

304
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,220
That's Irving Berlin.

305
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:46,810
I hear that and everything in me
just sort of unclenches, and the

306
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,940
the wish not to die

307
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,360
never to die
becomes almost too great to bear.

308
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Come on, dance with me.

309
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,810
Come on, dance with me!

310
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,850
- I'm not making a pass at you. Come on.
- No-No-No.

311
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,770
Loosen up. Live a little!

312
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,650
Take it easy. Come on,
loosen up, relax!

313
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,110
Just don't sing in my ear,
all right?

314
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,320
- All right, all right.
- Come on.

315
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,580
This is good.
It's good for you.

316
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,750
Turn around. Beautiful.

317
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,430
Good. A little spin.

318
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,440
Away!

319
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,590
Get away!

320
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,720
Really good. You're really good!

321
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,970
I'm having an affair, Nathan.

322
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,730
I'm having an affair with
a thirty-four year-old woman

323
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,730
and I can't tell you
what it's done to me.

324
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,030
I think I have
a pretty good idea.

325
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,070
When this stuff comes back
so late in life

326
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,910
completely unexpected
completely unwanted

327
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,830
it comes back
with such force

328
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,290
there's nothing
you can do about it.

329
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,290
There's nothing
to dilute it.

330
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,300
And when
she's thirty-four?

331
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,220
And ignitable, Nathan.

332
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,010
Ignitable.

333
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,850
Ever hear of something
called Viagra?

334
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,470
Well, without Viagra

335
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,940
I could continue into
my declining years

336
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,810
and still draw profound
philosophical conclusions

337
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,570
and still have a steadying
moral influence on the young.

338
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,650
Without Viagra

339
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,740
I would not be doing something
that makes no sense at all

340
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:53,040
something that
is ill-considered

341
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,790
and potentially disastrous
for all concerned.

342
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,130
Just where exactly did you
find this astounding woman?

343
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,010
- We're closing.
- Two minutes, that's all I need.

344
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,850
- I said we're closing.
- Two minutes, I promise.

345
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,930
It's okay. Thank you.

346
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,890
Couldn't wait until tomorrow, huh?

347
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,110
No, it's my sister's birthday.

348
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,610
Good. Thank you.

349
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,490
Hi, Phil.

350
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,090
Are you telling me, Mr. Starr,

351
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,800
you believe the President of
the United States was lying?

352
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,890
You know as a witness
when you take an oath,

353
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,470
it's a sacred obligation
if you are a believer,

354
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,560
that you're going to tell the truth,
and you say, "So help me, God."

355
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,650
I mean, this is
very serious business.

356
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,530
- You got car trouble?
- Every other day.

357
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,070
Can I give you a lift?

358
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,290
- Where can I drop you?
- Uh, Nickerson's.

359
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:20,210
- That's the dairy farm.
- Yeah.

360
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,830
- You mind if I smoke?
- No. Go ahead.

361
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,420
Yeah, two dykes run it.

362
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,550
They give me a room in exchange
for doing the milking.

363
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,800
So you work at the post office
and the dairy farm?

364
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,010
And the college.

365
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,480
Faunia Farley
custodial staff.

366
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,850
It says so on my name tag.

367
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,150
Like to keep busy, huh?

368
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,940
Action is the enemy of thought.

369
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,900
Who said that?

370
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,250
- Thanks for the lift.
- Okay.

371
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,570
Want to come in?

372
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,370
- You mean now?
- Mm-hm.

373
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,500
I haven't been
this close to a woman for

374
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,460
Since your wife died.
I know.

375
00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:01,180
Listen, um, we should
get something straight.

376
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:11,480
If you're looking for sympathy,
you've come to the wrong place.

377
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,860
I'm...

378
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,820
I don't do sympathy.

379
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,030
Uh-huh.

380
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:26,920
Hey...
Whatever.

381
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:40,050
- Thanks for the ride.
- Okay. Take care.

382
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,110
Oh, God.

383
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:12,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

384
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:20,910
It's nothing personal, but,
uh, you got to go.

385
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,490
I just...

386
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,040
I don't want to wake up
in the morning and have you here, so

387
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,380
- Like I said, it's nothing personal.
- Okay.

388
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,190
Will I see you again?

389
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,320
You can't much miss me.

390
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,330
What's that?

391
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:18,340
The question is
will I see you again?

392
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,070
What are you thinking?

393
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:20,250
- I'm thinking you're going to ruin it.
- No, I'm not.

394
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,500
Yes, you are.
Just leave it alone.

395
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,340
Don't try and get inside my head.

396
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,010
Why do we have to talk?

397
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:37,390
All right. All right,
have it your way.

398
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,440
- I was thinking I'm a crow.
- A crow, why a crow?

399
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,030
- Mm-mm.
- Your turn.

400
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,660
- I was wondering what it's like making love
- Fucking.

401
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,120
All right. What's it like
fucking an old man?

402
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,710
It's perfect.
No surprises.

403
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,630
What's it like
being out of a job?

404
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,970
It's lonely.
Like you, I guess.

405
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,470
My turn, huh?

406
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,730
Aside from that wreck of a car,
you don't seem to have any possessions.

407
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,320
No books, no pictures

408
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,780
Action is the enemy of thought.

409
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,650
All right.

410
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,160
My life story.
Is that what you want?

411
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,630
Fine.

412
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,600
I grew up with a lot of possessions.

413
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:05,100
My father was rich.
Real rich. Lots of servants.

414
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,850
The whole nine yards.

415
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,890
Don't you believe me?

416
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,950
Mm-hm, yeah, I believe you.

417
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:20,450
Then my parents got divorced and my mother remarried.

418
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,170
The thing is, this one
couldn't keep his hands off me.

419
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,570
Bedtime stories were his specialty.
Hey, sweetheart, let me read you a story.

420
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,640
Next thing you know,

421
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,930
fingers in me.

422
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,540
You don't have to tell me this.

423
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,770
Hey, you asked.

424
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,680
Told my mother. She didn't believe me.
Nobody believed me.

425
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,220
When I was fourteen, he tried to fuck me.
That's when I split. I went to Florida.

426
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,020
Did a little of this and that.

427
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,660
I don't know.

428
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,170
You know,
girl like me always get by.

429
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,280
No possessions. Travel light.

430
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,490
Real nice.

431
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,270
Did you hear something?

432
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,550
Hear what? I don't hear anything.

433
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,190
What is it?

434
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,460
It's Les.

435
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,760
Who's Les?

436
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,640
He's my ex-husband.

437
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,880
He...

438
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,180
He follows me around. I can feel him.
He's out there somewhere.

439
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,880
I can handle him.

440
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,780
I used to be a pretty good boxer.

441
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,180
Listen to me. I'm not kidding.

442
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,550
He's out of his fucking mind.
He was in Nam. He did two tours of duty.

443
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,660
He used to beat me up.

444
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,330
One time it was so bad
he put me in a coma for two days.

445
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,010
Hey. There's nobody there.

446
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,310
I can feel him. I think he...

447
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,880
There's nobody there.

448
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,760
Did you ever kill anyone
in Vietnam, Mr. Farley?

449
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,290
Did I kill anyone?

450
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,390
Isn't that what I was supposed to do when I was sent to fucking Vietnam? Fucking kill gooks?

451
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,030
They said, "Everything goes,"

452
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,930
so everything went.

453
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,870
Look, let's get something
straight right from the start.

454
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,840
I never hurt her. Okay?

455
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,340
Never.

456
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,460
And I never hurt the kids.

457
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,950
That was all lies.

458
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,720
She never cared about anybody but herself.

459
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,900
I should have never let her go off with the kids.

460
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,600
She...

461
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,570
You sure it's all right if I smoke?

462
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,770
She waited until I was in rehab.

463
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:03,720
That's why she wanted me in re-hab to start with, so she could take the kids

464
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:08,280
She used the whole thing against me
to get the kids away.

465
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,190
She had no right to steal my kids.

466
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,830
Now she's fucking this old Jew.

467
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,730
I should have killed her back then.

468
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,830
This is nice.

469
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,540
I'm sorry, madam. Smoking is prohibited in the restaurant. Thank you.

470
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,650
I'm sorry about that.
Most restaurants seem to ban smoking.

471
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,150
You okay?

472
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,580
Is this okay for you?

473
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:44,760
Sure.

474
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,590
It's good food. They say.

475
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,920
I don't know if this is such a good idea, you know.

476
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,370
It's fine. It's a fine restaurant.
They specialize in fish and all that stuff.

477
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,330
Sorry I'm late.

478
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,500
Oh, hi. Hi, Nathan. This is, uh, this is Faunia.

479
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,810
Uh, this is my friend Nathan Zuckerman and I asked him to join us.

480
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:10,110
Nathan is a writer, a good writer,

481
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,240
and uh What was that
prize you almost won?

482
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,980
Oh, never mind, never mind.
I've been, uh, I've been teaching Coleman how to play gin rummy.

483
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,450
Teach me? You owe me ten bucks.

484
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,620
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

485
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,960
What do you mean? What's the matter?

486
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,220
Okay? I just wanted
you to meet a friend of mine,

487
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,070
So, Coleman's told me
so much about you.

488
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:35,010
Really? He hasn't
told me shit about you.

489
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:38,070
What did he tell you?
That he's fucking a cleaning lady?

490
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,740
Why are you doing this to me?

491
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,550
You want somebody to talk to?
You have a good time. I'm out of here.

492
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,860
I'm sorry about that.

493
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,020
Well, you've really come down
in the world, haven't you? Huh?

494
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,050
Dean of the college,
professor of Classics

495
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,150
Look what you ended up with.

496
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:35,370
The thing is, you can't handle fucking someone that you can't take to a fancy restaurant.

497
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,770
Let's just end it, you know?

498
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,830
Just end it, end it right now.

499
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,490
You don't get it, do you?

500
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,420
I can't.

501
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,660
I simply can't.

502
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,600
Turn off the fucking light!

503
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:52,480
It's Les.

504
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:56,680
Don't worry, I already called the cops.
They'll be here any minute.

505
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,250
They know how to deal with him, all right?
We just have to wait.

506
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,990
What the fuck are you doing?

507
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,460
You can't go out there.
He's fucking crazy.

508
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,730
Yeah, so am I.

509
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,960
Hey, Farley!

510
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:15,730
What do you want Farley?

511
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,540
Come on out of there, you murdering bitch!

512
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,230
- Did she tell you? Did she?
- What?

513
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,740
Did she tell you she was giving some guy a blowjob while her kids were catching on fire, did she?
Did she tell you that?

514
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,310
Get away from here
or I'll brain you!

515
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,890
- Get away!
- Put that fucking thing down before I ram it through
your fucking skull!

516
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,380
That's my wife you're fucking in there!

517
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,090
I want to talk to her.

518
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:39,950
Hi, baby.

519
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,690
Hi, sweetheart.

520
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,920
Go home. Come on.

521
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,900
It's all right. I can...

522
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,200
Come on, go home.
You hear that?

523
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,510
- I had to call the cops.
- Ah, what'd you do that for?

524
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:59,550
You're always fucking doing that.
I just want to talk to you

525
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,180
you murdering fucking cunt.

526
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,350
Come on, darling,
there's enough time

527
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,190
What are you fucking
this old guy for anyhow?

528
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:09,770
Get away from her.

529
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,560
Come on.
We'll go for a ride.

530
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,320
I'll bring you right back,
I promise.

531
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,190
Fuck 'em.

532
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,570
- Come on.
- No.

533
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,990
They know me.
They're not going to do anything.

534
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:22,120
I'll bring you right back,
I swear to God.

535
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,490
I don't want to talk to you.

536
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,450
Come on
Get your fucking hands off of me!

537
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,420
Fuck!

538
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,330
This is payback
for what I did in Nam.

539
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,750
This is what I fucking get
for saving my fucking country!

540
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,460
All the shit
I went through.

541
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,760
I come home to
some murdering bitch

542
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,260
treats me like garbage!

543
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,430
Please no more of this!

544
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,180
No more!

545
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,200
You wanted to know why
I didn't have any possessions.

546
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,540
I guess you found out.

547
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,970
This is what's left of my kids.

548
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,750
This.

549
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:56,030
It was an accident,

550
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:00,700
and he knows. He knows the truth.

551
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,740
There was a... There was a heater

552
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,110
and it...

553
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:15,110
it tipped over, and the place...

554
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,180
the place caught fire.

555
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:28,690
I don't know, do I keep them? Do I bury them?

556
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:35,600
I don't know. What?

557
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,170
Got any bright ideas? Huh?

558
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,840
Is this all
too trailer trash for you?

559
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,110
Is that it?

560
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,390
Get the fuck out of here. You hear me?

561
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,780
What do I do?

562
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:35,100
Please go.

563
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:42,430
Please go.

564
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:16,090
Everyone knows you're exploiting
an abused woman half your age.

565
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,730
Well, if this doesn't take the cake.

566
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,540
What's more, I know damn well who wrote this.

567
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:21,400
Who?

568
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,670
Delphine Roux.

569
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,910
Professor of Languages and Literature. I hired her, for Christ's sakes. I hired all of them.

570
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,350
Why would she send you something like this?

571
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,880
I've no idea. How the hell should I know?
You're my lawyer. Send her a letter. Warn her off.

572
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,880
She'll just deny that she ever

573
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,760
That's her writing. Any handwriting expert will confirm that.

574
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:42,930
Coleman, Listen, forget about the letter.
What are you going to do about Lester Farley?

575
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,690
I'll get an injunction. A restraining order. I don't know.

576
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,960
Have you any idea what you're getting into here, Coleman?

577
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,710
You want me to fight a legal war for you on two fronts.

578
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:56,400
One of them with a phantom correspondent, and the other with a lunatic.

579
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:00,070
I can get you a handwriting expert. I can get you a bulletproof vest.

580
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:04,550
But what I can't provide is what you're never going to know as long as you're involved with this woman

581
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:08,350
A scandal-free life. Is she HIV-negative, by the way?

582
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,720
Did you have her tested, Coleman?

583
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:15,430
Did you use a condom, Coleman?
And if you don't use protection, does she?

584
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,890
How do you know she doesn't want to use you to make up for all that she's lost?

585
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,090
Do I represent you in a paternity suit, Coleman?

586
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,240
Give up the girl, Achilles.

587
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:29,940
I took your Intro to European Lit
umpteen years ago as an undergrad.

588
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,940
Give her up, and your troubles go away.

589
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,280
Faunia Farley is not in your league
and she's not from your world.

590
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:41,280
Last night, you got
a good look at her world.

591
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,520
The fact is...

592
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,080
she ain't worth it.

593
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:51,290
Achilles on Viagra. How much sense
does that make anyway?

594
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,230
Ah, Nelson.

595
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:58,850
I'm sorry, have you quite finished?

596
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:00,410
Yes.

597
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,440
Nelson, you're a genuine vocal master.

598
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:09,580
And so rich with contempt
for every last human problem you've never had to face.

599
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,610
Listen, I was only

600
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,610
No, you listen.

601
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:16,720
I never again want to hear
that self-admiring voice of yours,

602
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,780
or see your smug, lily-white face.

603
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:22,060
Coleman, use the left!

604
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,940
Good! Good-Good-Good! Yeah.

605
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,700
- Get out of the corner
- Finish it off, finish it off

606
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,950
That's enough. That's enough.

607
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,580
Next week, West Point.

608
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,000
Oh, come on, Doc.
That guy's got five pounds on me.

609
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,250
But he's slow.
You can take him easy.

610
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,710
Besides, the coach of Pitt is
gonna be there. He's a buddy of mine.

611
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,760
I want him to see you fight.

612
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,920
- So?
- So?

613
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,640
Once he sees your stuff, and once
I tell him about your grades,

614
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,390
I'm pretty sure
he'll offer you a scholarship.

615
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,190
I can't go to Pitt!
My father wants me to go to Howard.

616
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:07,980
- He's an optician, your dad?
- Used to be.

617
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,440
He lost his business in the Depression.

618
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:15,110
Well, look, Coleman.
Just box for the guy, that's all.

619
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,660
- Then we'll see what happens.
- Okay

620
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,660
One thing.

621
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,830
When you meet the guy from Pitt,
don't tell him you're colored, okay?

622
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:30,630
- Don't tell him?
- Don't bring it up.

623
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:34,550
You're neither one thing nor the other.
You're Silky Silk, that's all.

624
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:37,590
- He won't know?
- How's he going to know?

625
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,430
Here's the top kid from East Orange
High and he's with Doc Chizner.

626
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,680
He's going to think you're Jewish.

627
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,860
- You're late!
- I know.

628
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:01,160
- Walter's home on leave.
- Hide this for me, will you?

629
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,700
Sorry I'm late.

630
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,160
Hey, Mom.

631
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,540
- Walt.
- Cole.

632
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,540
- How are you?
- Fine.

633
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:14,050
So what's this I hear about
you being class valedictorian?

634
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:14,960
It's all true.

635
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,300
Hey, with the only 4.0 grade average,
who else were they going to choose?

636
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,720
Yes, we're very proud of Coleman.

637
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:25,310
- May I inquire how you did, Cole?
- How I did?

638
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:27,890
Today in the boxing ring.

639
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:31,770
I'm asking whether
you won or lost your bout.

640
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:36,030
- Did you tell him?
- Kindly answer my question.

641
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,950
I won.

642
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,870
How many fights have you won?

643
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,620
Eleven.

644
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:48,410
And how many have you lost?

645
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,420
- None.
- So far.

646
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,050
Just when were you planning on
turning professional?

647
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:03,600
- Dad, I don't think
- This does not concern you, Walter.

648
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,440
I asked you a question, young man.

649
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:15,070
Doc says I could get
an athletic scholarship.

650
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,610
Maybe to Pitt.

651
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:20,660
Like Walter,
you will go to Howard.

652
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,990
And after Howard, should you
choose to become a doctor,

653
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,580
you will not be doing
your hands any good

654
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,000
pummeling them in
a boxing ring, will you?

655
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,840
You know, Coleman, if I were your father,
do you know what I would tell you now?

656
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,880
- You are my father.
- I'm not at all sure.

657
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:42,300
I was thinking Doc Chizner
was your father.

658
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,050
He's my coach. That's all.

659
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,480
He teaches me how to fight.
You're my father.

660
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,770
Well, if I were your father, do you
know what I would tell you now?

661
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,900
I would say, "You won today. Good.

662
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,360
Now you can retire undefeated."

663
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,780
You're retired.

664
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:14,750
If you'll excuse me,
I don't wish to be late for my train.

665
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,320
Boy!

666
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:41,530
Yes, sir?

667
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,360
This fish is overcooked.

668
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:48,950
Very sorry.
I will attend to it right away, sir.

669
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:58,880
Cowards die many times
before their death.

670
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:01,710
The valiant only taste
death but once.

671
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,590
Of all the rumors that
I yet have heard,

672
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,600
it seems to me most strange
that men should fear

673
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,430
seeing that death,
a necessary end,

674
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,060
will come when it will come.

675
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:18,770
Clarence Silk knew well
these words from Julius Caesar.

676
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,480
He was a man of great intellect,

677
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:25,780
unflinching courage,
and an uncompromising honor.

678
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:30,200
But above all else,
he was devoted to his family.

679
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:35,620
His wife, Dorothy,
his sons, Walter and Coleman,

680
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,670
and his pride and joy,
young Ernestine.

681
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,590
Clarence Silk was
the finest man I've ever met.

682
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:45,630
Coleman?

683
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:09,120
You're on duty?
Tonight?

684
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,040
It's better this way.
For me, anyway.

685
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:21,790
I never knew him, Mom.

686
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,050
Not really.

687
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,510
I didn't have any idea
what he went through

688
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,850
day after day after day.

689
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:34,970
I don't believe
he wanted you to know, dear.

690
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,850
He couldn't see the point.

691
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,520
The point is

692
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,650
if you're colored

693
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:47,070
it doesn't matter how much you know.
You work in the dining car.

694
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:50,660
He did that
so you wouldn't have to.

695
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:54,490
Coleman, you don't have to worry.

696
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:58,040
Your father's insurance
and your academic record

697
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,830
will see to it that
you get into Howard.

698
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,590
I heard all about
Howard from Walt.

699
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:07,760
He said they're always talking
about the Negro people

700
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:11,430
about "we, the Negro people."

701
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:16,560
I'm not a political person, Mom.
I don't understand who this "we" is.

702
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:19,100
Who do you think you are?

703
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:24,520
- I know who I am.
- You need to be proud of your race.

704
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,730
What about me?

705
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,490
What about just being
proud of being me?

706
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:34,910
It's my life. Or don't I get
any say in the matter?

707
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,080
Coleman, I'm not clever
enough to argue with you.

708
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,710
Then don't.
Don't let's argue.

709
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:49,670
I love you, Mom.
But don't ask me to go there.

710
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:56,260
Coleman, you're barely
eighteen years old.

711
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,350
What are you going to do?

712
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,730
Have a seat.

713
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,270
You have a registration card?

714
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:08,190
Yes.

715
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,350
Welcome to the Navy, young man.

716
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,810
So what did the lawyer say?

717
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,690
He was more worried
about Lester Farley?

718
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:49,150
Yeah. I don't want to
talk about Lester Farley.

719
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,280
Anyway, I can handle him.

720
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,570
Coleman, you yourself told me
that Lester Farley is a psychotic

721
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,870
who's been locked up in the mental
ward at the VA hospital. Twice!

722
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,410
Let me ask you something.

723
00:58:58,490 --> 00:58:59,790
What do you think would
have happened last night

724
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:01,330
if the police hadn't
shown up when they had?

725
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:04,830
Lester Farley is not going to just
disappear off the face of the earth.

726
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,540
This kind of thing
is going to happen again,

727
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:10,630
and when it does, next time
uh, you might not be so lucky.

728
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,220
So... I just throw her to the wolves.
It's just like that, huh?

729
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,470
I'm not thinking about her.
I'm thinking about you.

730
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:21,020
Nathan. She's waiting for that.
To her, sex and betrayal are synonymous.

731
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:25,310
Coleman, every mistake a man can
make usually has a sexual accelerator.

732
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:28,980
The things that restore you
can also destroy you.

733
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:30,860
Yeah, I know that.

734
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,030
And I'll tell you something.
I don't give a damn.

735
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:34,650
These things don't come without a cost.

736
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,110
Look-Look what's happening here.

737
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,410
People are saying that
you got her pregnant

738
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,620
and she had an abortion
and tried to kill herself.

739
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,870
Uh-huh. And what else
are they saying, Nathan?

740
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:48,880
Hm? What else
are they saying, Nathan?

741
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:50,670
Don't you look at me like that.

742
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:53,420
I know this is bullshit.
I'm your friend, remember?

743
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:55,090
Then act like a friend!

744
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,680
Stop judging me,
and stop judging her!

745
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,510
Jesus Christ!

746
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:17,400
So what do you want me to say?

747
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:19,030
I just want you to acknowledge that

748
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:22,280
something important is taking place
between me and this woman.

749
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:25,740
Something that's worthy of respect.

750
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:29,250
I guess you were right.
This really is about great sex.

751
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:31,080
Oh, fuck you, too.

752
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,920
Coleman! Coleman.

753
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,970
Okay.

754
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:48,390
Granted, she's not my first love.
Granted, she's not my great love.

755
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:52,560
But she sure as hell
is my last love.

756
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,230
Doesn't that count for something?

757
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,190
Enough to risk
getting killed for?

758
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,990
I'm not afraid of dying, Nathan.

759
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:06,740
I'm not the one who ran off to
a cabin in the woods to hide.

760
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:31,480
Dance for me.

761
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,560
One dance, for me.

762
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:37,690
Sure. Why not?

763
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:43,570
Why not?

764
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:54,270
This is more than sex.

765
01:01:55,310 --> 01:02:01,280
No, it's not.
You just forgot what sex is.

766
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:03,250
Did I?

767
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,000
Don't fall in love
with me, Coleman.

768
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,960
We're just a man and a woman, in a room,
alone, right here, right now.

769
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:20,220
Nothing else matters.
Don't fuck it up.

770
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:31,660
Dance for me. Come on.

771
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:51,890
You're way too young for me.

772
01:02:53,060 --> 01:03:00,270
I need a man much older than you.
Someone at least a hundred.

773
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,940
You know anyone
in a wheelchair?

774
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:18,230
I see you, Coleman.

775
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,230
You want to know what I see?

776
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,250
- I see everything.
- Is that a fact?

777
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:29,460
- You imagine you kept secrets from me?
- You never know.

778
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,380
Thank you.

779
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:41,100
- Mr. Wilson, can you watch the register?
- Yeah.

780
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:49,650
Can I help you?

781
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:53,860
Yes. Um...

782
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,400
I was looking for Rachmaninoff's
Third Piano Concerto, the, uh...

783
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:00,490
- The Horowitz recording?
- Yes, that's right.

784
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:02,780
Right this way.

785
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,710
Did you go to
East Orange High School?

786
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,790
Yes. Yes, I did.

787
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,670
I thought you looked familiar.
Charley Hamilton's my cousin.

788
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:16,590
I haven't seen him in a while.
How's he been?

789
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,680
He's good. He's good. Actually,
I think he's getting married.

790
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:24,350
Good for him.
Now the Rachmaninoff please.

791
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:26,680
Is that your girlfriend?

792
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:33,150
Yes. Yes it is.
Look,

793
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:36,360
maybe I should
come back some other time

794
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:40,910
- and then we can talk, okay?
- Fine. Here.

795
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,120
That'll do the trick
a lot better than Rachmaninoff.

796
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:52,630
Dance for me.

797
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:13,660
That has got to be
the single most sexy dance

798
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,870
ever danced by a girl
from Fergus Falls

799
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,750
in the history of the world.

800
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,330
I love you.

801
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:25,090
I love you. I love you.
I love you. I love you.

802
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:28,300
I love you. I love you.

803
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,510
I want to spend my life with you.

804
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,480
What are you doing Sunday?

805
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:45,020
Nothing. Why?

806
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,030
On Sunday

807
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:50,900
we're taking the train
to New Jersey

808
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,530
to have dinner with
my mother.

809
01:07:57,830 --> 01:07:58,830
Okay.

810
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:00,830
Okay?

811
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,040
I'd like that.

812
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,800
Oh, I hope she likes me.

813
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,470
I hope the chocolates are okay.

814
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,180
Chocolates'll be fine.

815
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:18,720
Maybe I should have gotten flowers.

816
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:20,020
There was a place back
at the station I could get

817
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,690
Chocolates will be fine.
And you'll be fine.

818
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:23,730
Okay.

819
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:25,730
You know, this is
my old paper route.

820
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:28,900
That's where I crashed my bike
into Mr. Harris' front porch.

821
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:30,320
Which one?

822
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:34,530
Right over there.
My father made me pay for the damage.

823
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,280
To the bike and the porch.

824
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:44,210
Uh... I'm scared.

825
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,580
I love you.

826
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:49,000
You know that, don't you?

827
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:50,750
I love you, too.

828
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:55,630
Hi.

829
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,390
Sorry we're late.

830
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,890
Mother, this is
Steena Paulsson.

831
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:04,100
Steena, this is my mother.

832
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,560
How lovely. Please come in.

833
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,690
It's quite a beautiful city,
Fergus Falls.

834
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:13,570
It's quite unusual,
because we have the Otter Tail Lake

835
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:16,610
and the Otter Tail River
very close to each other.

836
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:23,000
My father owns a small hardware
supply store, a lumberyard there.

837
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:24,910
He's the disorganized one.

838
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,580
He cuts himself and
doesn't even bother to wash it.

839
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:30,500
They're tough,
those Icelanders.

840
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,380
I actually didn't even know they
were called Icelanders, growing up.

841
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:40,260
My mother, she's a Rasmussen.
She's the opposite.

842
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,970
Sets the table for Saturday dinner
at five the night before.

843
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:49,020
I guess I was sort of caught
between the two extremes and so

844
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:53,980
I decided to get away for
college out of their reach, so to speak.

845
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:56,320
And that's how I came to New York.

846
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:59,820
I've never been to the Midwest,
but I'm sure I'd like it.

847
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:02,830
Coleman, wouldn't you
like to see the Midwest?

848
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:08,670
New York City. Final destination
Penn Station, Neew York City.

849
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,960
Steena?

850
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,140
Honey, we're almost there.

851
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,110
Honey.

852
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,830
I can't do this, Coleman.

853
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,670
I love you.

854
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:02,640
I love you, but I can't.

855
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:26,450
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to the Saint Nicholas Arena.

856
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:31,290
Tonight, in our opening battle,
from East Orange, New Jersey

857
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:36,250
weighing a hundred and sixty-two pounds,
Coleman "Silky" Silk!

858
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:39,470
A record five wins and no losses!

859
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:43,430
From Rochester, New York,
weighing a hundred and seventy pounds,

860
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:45,720
Sugar "Pete" Cunningham!

861
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:48,100
A record six wins, one loss.

862
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,640
Take it easy with the guy, okay?

863
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:51,440
Let's give the people
their money's worth.

864
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:54,480
Dance him around for
three, four rounds, then go to work.

865
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,570
Hey, kid.
Hey!

866
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,240
I asked you nicely to give
folks their money's worth.

867
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,160
You could have stopped
the forth round instead of the first.

868
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,950
I'm a hundred and sixty-two pounds.
He's a hundred and seventy.

869
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:50,290
I'm supposed to let him
hit me in the head

870
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:52,830
five, ten, extra times
to put on a show?

871
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,330
I ain't holding up no nigger.

872
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,360
It's beautiful,
isn't it?

873
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,360
It's beautiful,
isn't it?

874
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,250
I have to go.

875
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:30,040
Stay tonight.

876
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,550
Mm-mm.

877
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:39,550
No. I never stay.

878
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:45,220
Just this once.

879
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:08,140
Hi. Good morning.

880
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:15,580
Would you like some breakfast?
Uh... Eggs Benedict and ham?

881
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:16,880
Sit down. Please.

882
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:22,090
Like some coffee?

883
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:27,920
No milk, huh?

884
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,200
Okay. There you go.

885
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:37,880
Looks like Monica Lewinsky isn't going to get a job in New York for the time being.

886
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:40,370
Can't you avoid the fucking seminar?

887
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:47,250
Does fucking Monica care if my back
hurts from milking those fucking cows?

888
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:53,320
Does she fucking care that I have to clean up other people's shit in the fucking post office?

889
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:01,570
You think losing your job when you're about to retire anyway is a big fucking deal?

890
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,600
I hate to tell you.

891
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,570
It ain't.

892
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:12,830
Having your stepfather put his fingers
in your cunt, that's a big deal.

893
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:21,050
Having your husband come up behind you with an iron pipe and hit you in the fucking head.

894
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,080
That's a big deal.

895
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:33,660
Having your two kids suffocating and fucking dying!

896
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:36,060
That is a big fucking deal!

897
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:40,510
Don't you have anymore to say?

898
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:46,200
I knew I shouldn't have stayed.

899
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:51,840
I knew I shouldn't have stayed.
It was a mistake.

900
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:55,150
Even whores know better.
They know.

901
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:59,120
Men don't pay you to sleep with them.
They pay you to fucking go home.

902
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:26,740
Hey, Prince.

903
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,590
Hey, how you doing?

904
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:39,800
How you doing there, my Prince?

905
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,020
Come here.

906
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,040
Honey, it's Faunia.

907
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:48,670
How you doing?

908
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:54,140
Did you forget me? I wanted to come and see you, but I couldn't.

909
01:17:56,350 --> 01:18:00,120
I haven't seen you in...
it must be three, four, months.

910
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:01,710
Prince missed you.

911
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:06,990
He got out the other day.
I thought he was gonna go looking for you.

912
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:10,490
The other birds attacked him.
They would've killed him.

913
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,560
He doesn't have the right voice.

914
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:14,670
It's because he's hand-raised.

915
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:23,500
He's been hanging around
people like us all his life.

916
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,810
A crow that doesn't know
how to be a crow.

917
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:42,920
The first time I tried,

918
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,400
it was a month after they died.

919
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:56,840
I got all dressed up.
Even my mother would have been proud.

920
01:18:57,510 --> 01:18:59,000
You know I called her?

921
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:01,140
I did.

922
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:04,820
Called her to tell her
my kids were dead.

923
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:09,220
Mom, it's Faunia.

924
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:13,760
Twenty years.
No call for twenty years.

925
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:15,920
She said

926
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:20,460
"Oh, I don't know anybody
by that name" and hung up.

927
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:24,640
Bitch.

928
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:32,310
I remember the Gin, the Valium.

929
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:36,140
And then that rat poison was bitter.

930
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:40,590
So I fold it into the pudding.

931
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:48,660
Felt good.

932
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:55,330
Why did they have to break the door down?

933
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,100
I mean. Come on.

934
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:03,270
Even...even the nurse said-she said later,

935
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:07,940
There wasn't a heartbeat.
Not when they first showed up.

936
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:11,540
Couldn't even get that right, could I?

937
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:16,750
You and I...

938
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,790
were made for each other.

939
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,300
Marry me.

940
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:40,670
I think I made a mistake this morning.

941
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,850
Faunia Farley,
custodial staff, you know?

942
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:20,680
Just, uh... just doing my thing.

943
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,860
So where were you?

944
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,330
I was starting to get worried.

945
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,530
I walked around. Went to a movie.

946
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:41,400
Listen, I'm...

947
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:48,970
I'm sorry.

948
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:52,080
Everything that I said,
and everything that I did, I...

949
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:53,450
You were right.

950
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,280
What happened to me is nothing.

951
01:21:57,690 --> 01:22:01,180
No. You lost everything.
You lost your wife, you lost your job.

952
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:06,200
They took your life away from you
over a stupid, pissy little word. That's not nothing.

953
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,320
Maybe.

954
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:10,030
I don't think you can measure sorrow.

955
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:18,040
I brought you these.
They're doughnuts.

956
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:24,140
They're from the...
from the doughnut store. Jelly.

957
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,520
Listen, if you don't want me...

958
01:22:33,130 --> 01:22:38,150
If you want me to go, you know, then I understand that because...

959
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,890
I understand and I won't blame you.

960
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,040
What are you smiling at?

961
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,900
Just so happy to see you.

962
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:55,940
Same here.

963
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:58,380
I'm happy, too.

964
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:30,510
Listen, there's something I need to tell you.

965
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:57,420
It seemed impossible to me

966
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:02,160
that someone as vital as Coleman could have been killed in
what the police called,

967
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:04,230
a freak accident.

968
01:26:05,370 --> 01:26:08,930
The more I thought I about it,
the more I began to feel that Coleman and Faunia

969
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:12,440
could not have died without the presence, somewhere nearby,

970
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:15,550
of Lester Farley and his pickup truck.

971
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:18,880
At what point did you get in
your truck that morning?

972
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:20,450
Before sunup.

973
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:23,180
Why did you get in your truck?

974
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:23,920
To get him.

975
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:25,450
To get who?

976
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,750
The Jew professor.

977
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:28,760
Why were you going to get him?

978
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:29,890
Because I had to.

979
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,260
You were going to kill him?

980
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,730
Oh, yes. All of us. That was the plan.

981
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,300
There was planning, then.

982
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:39,460
There was no planning.

983
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:43,210
- Uh, but you knew what you were doing.
- Yes.

984
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,240
But you didn't plan it?

985
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:47,110
No.

986
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:51,140
Did you think you were back in Vietnam?

987
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:52,280
No Vietnam.

988
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:55,680
Were you thinking about the kids?
Was this payback?

989
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,090
No payback.

990
01:26:57,790 --> 01:27:00,330
Weren't you trying to get revenge
to take revenge for that?

991
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:01,950
No.
No revenge.

992
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,730
Were you depressed?

993
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,700
No. No depression.

994
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,730
Angry?

995
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,200
No more anger.

996
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:15,970
But you drove your truck into their car.

997
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:17,370
I didn't kill them.

998
01:27:20,410 --> 01:27:21,710
I didn't kill them.

999
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:23,980
They killed themselves.

1000
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:32,450
What do you think?

1001
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:34,720
I checked with the police and

1002
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:39,390
there are no skid marks at
the site of the accident, no sign of a collision.

1003
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:48,330
I think Lester Farley is delusional.

1004
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,430
Completely delusional.

1005
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:54,540
My name is Herbert Keble.

1006
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:57,980
And I am among those who...

1007
01:27:58,350 --> 01:28:01,620
failed to rise to Coleman's defense

1008
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:04,660
when he was accused of racism.

1009
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:10,090
Coleman, I can't be
with you on this.

1010
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:15,960
That is what I said
to my everlasting shame.

1011
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,600
I should have spoken up...

1012
01:28:20,370 --> 01:28:24,210
to say then what I want to say now

1013
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:28,210
in the presence of
his former colleagues

1014
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:34,380
that the alleged misconduct
never took place.

1015
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:38,950
Coleman Silk and his wife, Iris,

1016
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:43,320
were betrayed by
the moral stupidity

1017
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,790
of a censorious
and coercive community.

1018
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,230
And I was a part
of that community.

1019
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:54,840
We all were.

1020
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:30,000
Mrs. Keble.

1021
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:34,840
My name is Nathan Zuckerman.
I was a friend of Coleman's.

1022
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:37,210
I thought your husband's speech was...

1023
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,650
I'm not Mrs. Keble.

1024
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,350
Are you?

1025
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:54,060
I'm Coleman Silk's sister.

1026
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:58,330
Iris. Nice name.

1027
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,210
And when is the happy day?

1028
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:03,170
June 14th.

1029
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,110
Have you told her?

1030
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:13,610
When will you?

1031
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:22,390
You plan on bringing her home for dinner?

1032
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,120
I told her
my parents are dead.

1033
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,030
Dead?

1034
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:38,270
You have no brother?
You have no sister?

1035
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:41,580
There's no Ernestine?
There's no Walter?

1036
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:46,570
I don't want to be Coleman Silk,
the Negro Classics professor.

1037
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:50,760
And that's how it would
always come out, Mom.

1038
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,420
You know it, and I know it.

1039
01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:58,600
Funny, I never thought of you
as black or white.

1040
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:04,960
Gold.
You were my golden child.

1041
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:09,240
Look, Mom...

1042
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:12,540
I haven't...

1043
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:17,550
I haven't figured
the whole thing out yet.

1044
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,640
Will you have children?

1045
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:23,240
Yes, I suppose so.

1046
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:29,590
You aren't going to
let them see me, are you?

1047
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,630
My grandchildren.

1048
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:40,330
Mom, you'll tell me

1049
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:44,780
sit in the waiting room
in Penn Station at 11:15 a.m.

1050
01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:49,580
I'll walk by with my kids
in their Sunday best.

1051
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:55,710
That'll be my birthday present
five years from now.

1052
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:02,990
And you know I'll be there.

1053
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,320
But aren't you...

1054
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,030
taking a risk having children?

1055
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:14,260
The suspense will be unbearable.

1056
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:18,800
Suppose they don't pop out
of her womb as white as you?

1057
01:32:19,710 --> 01:32:21,800
Won't you have some
explaining to do?

1058
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:28,020
Will you accuse her
of adultery with a Negro?

1059
01:32:34,190 --> 01:32:35,680
I have to go now, Mom.

1060
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:37,700
Coleman...

1061
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:41,190
you think like a prisoner.

1062
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:49,770
You're white as snow
and you think like a slave.

1063
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:30,210
Murderer.

1064
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:49,730
Is that the doorbell?

1065
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:51,270
I'll get it.

1066
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:16,620
Don't you ever come near Mom again.

1067
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,860
You don't call, you don't write, you don't nothing.

1068
01:34:22,330 --> 01:34:24,560
I never want to see your lily-white face again.

1069
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:34,440
And your mother obeyed Walter.

1070
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:37,010
All the Silk men...

1071
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:41,080
from my father on down, are very decisive.

1072
01:34:41,650 --> 01:34:44,680
Yes, she did it.
But I didn't.

1073
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:49,890
I was trying to reach him two days ago.
It was his birthday.

1074
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:52,790
The day after he was killed.

1075
01:34:54,770 --> 01:34:58,170
I don't blame Walter.
He was only trying to protect Mother.

1076
01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:01,800
And was he successful?

1077
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,670
Just before she died,
she was delirious.

1078
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:10,080
She kept saying...

1079
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:12,280
Oh, nurse...

1080
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:17,690
get me to the train. I've got a sick baby at home.

1081
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:23,330
Is Walter still alive?

1082
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:24,690
Yes.

1083
01:35:25,530 --> 01:35:28,800
We are all a family of teachers.

1084
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:32,200
Mr. Zuckerman, I wish my parents could have known that...

1085
01:35:32,370 --> 01:35:36,470
Walter was the first colored superintendent of a school in the state of New Jersey.

1086
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:41,510
I guess you can tell what generation I am.
I still say "colored" and "Negro".

1087
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:46,370
Did you know why your brother resigned from the college?

1088
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:49,040
I gather he was accused of racism.

1089
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,520
That beats it all, doesn't it?

1090
01:35:54,730 --> 01:35:56,590
For using the word "spooks."

1091
01:35:58,430 --> 01:36:03,490
Sounds like from what I heard today,
almost anything goes nowadays.

1092
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:09,330
People are just getting dumber but more opinionated.

1093
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,140
You know what's sad, Mr. Zuckerman?

1094
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:15,040
Nowadays, it's hard to imagine

1095
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:19,310
that anyone would do
what Coleman felt he had to do.

1096
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:24,390
Constructing his whole life around a lie.

1097
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:29,620
Coleman could have stopped that
racism charge in its tracks,

1098
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,530
if he'd only told the truth.

1099
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:35,460
But that's the one thing
he couldn't do.

1100
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:38,800
Do you think
he ever told anyone?

1101
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:45,840
Maybe.

1102
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:48,880
Maybe someone.

1103
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:57,850
It was during my conversation with Ernestine that I decided to write this book.

1104
01:36:58,990 --> 01:37:03,950
Not the book that Coleman had asked me to write, but one that he could not write himself.

1105
01:37:04,830 --> 01:37:09,320
The story of his mother and father, of Walter and Ernestine,

1106
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,900
of Steena Paulsson and of Faunia.

1107
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:22,040
Finally, there was one thing I needed to do.

1108
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:29,780
To face the person I was certain was responsible for my friend's death.

1109
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:26,270
I was just driving around and saw your truck.

1110
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:32,410
Beautiful spot.

1111
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,220
Peaceful.

1112
01:38:38,690 --> 01:38:40,420
Long as I can keep it secret.

1113
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:43,520
Only now I know.

1114
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:49,230
You're the writer, aren't you?

1115
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:50,320
That I am.

1116
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:52,170
Any luck?

1117
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:54,070
Not much.

1118
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:02,280
What do you think about out here
when the fish aren't biting?

1119
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:06,680
I was thinking if I had a son,
he'd be out here with me now, fishing.

1120
01:39:08,090 --> 01:39:12,020
That's what I was thinking about
when you walked out here.

1121
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:13,990
Don't you have a son?

1122
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,500
No.

1123
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:18,920
Never married?

1124
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:24,570
Doomed. My marriage was doomed.

1125
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:30,730
When back from Vietnam, I had posttraumatic stress disorder.

1126
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:35,840
I used to get in my truck and drive around for hours.

1127
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:39,580
My buddies were afraid that I was gonna die in a car accident.

1128
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:41,380
Were you ever in a car accident?

1129
01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:43,980
I would have known if I were.

1130
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:47,180
Still have PTSD?

1131
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:52,220
I still tend to isolate, don't I?
What do you think I'm doing out here?

1132
01:39:56,270 --> 01:39:57,740
No more car accidents?

1133
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:00,600
Never were any car accidents. Don't you listen?

1134
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:04,470
What kind of books you write?

1135
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:06,910
I write about people like you.

1136
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:09,640
Their problems.

1137
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:15,940
You live at Mike Dumouchel's place, right?
The cabin on the lake.

1138
01:40:19,090 --> 01:40:20,720
What's the name of one of your books?

1139
01:40:23,230 --> 01:40:24,700
The Human Stain.

1140
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:27,360
Can I get it?

1141
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,230
It's not finished.

1142
01:40:34,170 --> 01:40:36,970
You know, I started ice fishing after my wife left me.

1143
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:44,050
All you need is warm clothes and the right equipment.

1144
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:46,380
Like this auger.

1145
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:51,820
You drill a hole through the ice.
This'll cut through just about anything.

1146
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:55,220
Then you drop your line with your favorite lure right through.

1147
01:40:55,730 --> 01:40:59,060
Any flash down there, fish are attracted, even in the dark.

1148
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:02,370
And it's way dark down there.

1149
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:07,260
And if I had a son...

1150
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:12,740
little Les, a son of my own,

1151
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:17,080
I reckon I'd be telling him
all this stuff instead of you.

1152
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:23,720
It's cold out here.

1153
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:25,310
You better believe it.

1154
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:27,150
I should be going.

1155
01:41:27,330 --> 01:41:31,790
Yeah, well, you know your ice fishing now, don't you?
You can put it in your book.

1156
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:33,430
I will.

1157
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:35,930
And you know my secret place.

1158
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:41,730
You know everything now, don't you, Mr. Zuckerman?

1159
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,200
But you won't tell, will you?

1160
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:52,780
And, hey!

1161
01:41:55,790 --> 01:41:57,760
The book. Send me one.

1162
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,450
It's in the mail.
