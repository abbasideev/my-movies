1
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:19,912
To tell you the truth,
I never was much for the holidays.

2
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,874
It'd been forever
since I'd known a holiday...

3
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,626
since I'd seen my family...

4
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:30,590
since I'd been with a girl,
since I'd driven a car.

5
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,885
You see, cars are what put me here:

6
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,888
Iron Mountain, maximum security.

7
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,932
I was riding a hard five
for grand theft auto.

8
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,685
Meanwhile, my esteemed raping
and murdering colleagues...

9
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,104
were up for parole at three.

10
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,607
World works like that sometimes.

11
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,901
All the time, in my experience.

12
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:54,781
That's me, Rudy Duncan,
menace to society, on the left.

13
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,075
The guy on the right's
Nick Cassidy, my best friend.

14
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,787
Back then, we were both looking
at three days to a new start.

15
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,581
That's what you talk about in prison.

16
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,124
How you're gonna get it right.

17
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,126
How you'll never make the same mistakes.

18
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,429
We walk outta here, we hit that road...

19
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,640
what's the first thing you're gonna do?

20
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,601
Hot chocolate.

21
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,687
- What?
- That's the first thing I'm gonna do.

22
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,440
I'm gonna go out and get myself
a mug of hot chocolate.

23
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,400
And a piece of pecan pie.

24
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,737
That's right. A piece of pecan pie.

25
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,906
Yeah.

26
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,992
She's gonna be out there, man.

27
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:43,454
She's gonna be right there waiting.

28
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:47,124
She got us a motel on Highway 5.

29
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,586
Lock ourselves in the whole week...

30
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,215
drinkin' wine, takin' baths, man.

31
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,429
Yeah.

32
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,643
You know, Nick,
all those pictures she sent?

33
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,187
You sure that's really her
in the pictures?

34
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,982
I did hear sometimes these girls send
pictures that's not really them.

35
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,860
It's like their prettier cousin
or somethin' like that.

36
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,320
Why you gotta say a thing like that, man?

37
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,031
- I'm just sayin'...
- Why you gotta say a thing like that?

38
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:23,369
I'm just sayin',
maybe I should take her out.

39
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,664
Spend a day or two with her.
Make sure she's the right girl.

40
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:31,002
Just a day or two. Maybe a night or two?

41
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,589
Whatever it takes. Just make sure
you're gettin' the right merchandise.

42
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:38,342
- You know?
- You know what?

43
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,845
Enjoy your hot chocolate, Rudy.

44
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,473
I think I'll take my chances with Ashley.

45
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,895
Yeah, I figured. I figured.

46
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:55,192
- Hold it up close.
- Pop gate three.

47
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,322
Oh, shit!

48
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,867
- What's up?
- Alamo's back.

49
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,287
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.

50
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,956
Bro, I'm fucked.

51
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,959
Pincher said he thinks I'm the one
who ratted him out for beating up Creed.

52
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,629
'Cause I was there, he thinks
I'm the reason he ended up in solitary.

53
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,839
Fuck, Rudy.

54
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,925
Move out!

55
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,811
And stop!

56
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,940
Move in!

57
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,567
Listen to this.

58
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,445
"I've made my list
and I've checked it twice.

59
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,157
As long as you're naughty,
it's gonna be nice.

60
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:48,579
All that gets me through the day is to
close my eyes and imagine holding you...

61
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:51,248
kissing you, touching you.

62
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:55,169
Because I know I'll feel
at that moment...

63
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:59,298
I've found the reason
for my whole entire life."

64
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,759
She sounds pretty mature for 25.

65
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,428
Yeah!

66
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,722
You grow up in Detroit,
you get matured real quick.

67
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:11,310
Yeah. Either that
or those pictures are 10 years old.

68
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,359
Sure as hell don't
make me miss Millie Bobeck.

69
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,529
Guess I owe Millie, though.

70
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,198
If I hadn't been rolling her...

71
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,617
I would've never ended up here.

72
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,327
Yeah. You hadn't have cracked
that guy's head open...

73
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,329
you never would've found true love.

74
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,707
Jealous.

75
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:37,378
You know, Nick,
what if she sees you and, you know...

76
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,131
you just don't do it for her,
you know, I mean physically?

77
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:44,260
She just... It's not there.
What are you gonna do?

78
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:49,056
Well, me and her, we got a connection.

79
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,149
Jesus Christ.
Get this fuckin' shit out of my face.

80
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,817
You should've written
to that magazine, Rudy.

81
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,819
I should've, yeah.

82
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,905
I'm gonna walk outta here.
I'm gonna walk right into a relationship.

83
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,201
And you, my friend, will walk out
with your bus fare.

84
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,328
Searching for the drunkest skirt
in the room.

85
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,249
That's right.
"Morning, gorgeous. More eggnog?"

86
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:21,005
Should've written, Rudy.
You'd have got yourself a girl.

87
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,632
Yeah, should've done a lot of things.

88
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:31,182
All I want is just
to make it back to Sidnaw...

89
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,560
sit down for Christmas dinner...

90
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,438
sleep in my old bed...

91
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,816
watch some ball games with my old man...

92
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,985
eat leftovers for about six months.

93
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,945
I thought you hated that place.

94
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,449
Some of my dad's Christmas turkey.

95
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,619
Yeah, what makes you think
your dad'll forgive you?

96
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,789
Well, he said I'd pay for it.

97
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,373
You know?

98
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,293
Me and my easy money.
That's what he called it.

99
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,463
After wasting five years
of my fuckin' life...

100
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,381
I'd have to say the guy had a point.

101
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,848
Five years, man.

102
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,937
I did my time.

103
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,731
I just want to go home.

104
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,348
Keep the line movin'.

105
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,184
- What's this?
- Holiday Jell-O.

106
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,188
- What's this shit in it?
- Swallow it and you'll see.

107
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,984
Just so you know...

108
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,195
this man and I are outta here in two days.

109
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,615
So while we're inhaling London broil
and lobster bisque...

110
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,492
you're still gonna be standing here...

111
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,828
smelling up the mystery cream fuck.

112
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,455
Who's in prison now?

113
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,461
- Alamo, man, it wasn't me.
- Back in line!

114
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,548
- It wasn't me.
- Two days, man. Come on.

115
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,392
Remember how her brother's
a truck driver down there?

116
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,978
I'm thinkin' he might be
able to get me some work.

117
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,563
What work, security?

118
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,650
I'm through with that shit.
Ashley's right.

119
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:51,739
I gotta start doin' something
I got a stake in, get a business going.

120
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,618
I don't know, man.
I been in the business world.

121
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,663
Hot-wiring cars, Rudy,
does not qualify you as a small business.

122
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,459
"Chop-shop consultant"
doesn't work on a resume.

123
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,253
I always wanted to be
the boss of something, you know?

124
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,215
Have people working for me.

125
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,761
Man, what's wrong with you?

126
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,515
Monsters... in the gelatin.

127
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,685
- It's just a roach, Zook.
- Yeah, it's protein. It's good for you.

128
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,439
Monsters... in the gelatin!

129
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,774
Calm down.

130
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,027
There are monsters in the gelatin!

131
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,779
Hey, Zook! Sit the fuck down!

132
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:35,824
Monsters... in the gelatin!

133
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,410
Look at this shit!

134
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,120
Hey! Jesus!

135
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,705
Sit down!

136
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,499
Son of a bitch!

137
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,001
You eat this shit!

138
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,381
Get down! Don't move!

139
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,677
Stay out of it. Stay out of it, Rudy!

140
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,059
- You want some fucking monsters?
- Eat this, cocksucker!

141
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,480
Two days, man.

142
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:10,818
Fuck!

143
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,782
Don't move!

144
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,160
We had nothing to do with it!

145
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,708
Rudy, watch out!

146
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,306
Cassidy's down! Cassidy's stabbed!

147
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,349
Ashley. I gotta be there.

148
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,226
Oh, my God!

149
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,270
- Rudy, Ashley.
- You're gonna be all right.

150
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,272
- Hold on, hold on.
- Ashley's gonna be there.

151
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,232
Guard! Jesus, guards!

152
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,193
Nick, you gotta be-

153
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,696
Guard! Guards!

154
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,032
Jesus Christ.

155
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:04,079
- Nick. Nick! Nick!
- Get him outta here now!

156
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,166
Nick! Nick! Nick!

157
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,210
Nick! Nick!

158
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,598
Well, at least he won't be comin' back.

159
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:30,814
You need some company tonight, Rudy,
you just give me a holler.

160
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,571
Shut the fuck up!

161
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,990
You gonna take that from him, Rudy?

162
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,076
You gonna do something, Rudy?

163
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,078
Yeah, I want some company too!

164
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:41,009
Open outer gate.

165
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:52,146
Your world and welcome to it,
you dumb fucks.

166
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,023
Don't be a stranger now.
We'll keep the lights on for you.

167
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,859
Over here!

168
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,164
Hi!

169
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,051
Over here. Hey, how you doin'?

170
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:51,038
"And all that gets me through the day
is to close my eyes...

171
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:55,083
and imagine holding you, kissing you...

172
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,835
touching you."

173
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,716
Don't do it, Rudy.
Don't you fucking do it!

174
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,229
Jesus Christ.

175
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,472
Are you Ashley?

176
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,021
I'm Nick!

177
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,423
How's your coffee?

178
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,429
It's good.

179
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,142
Geez, it's got to be about
10 degrees out there.

180
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,480
The radio said negative five.

181
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,109
- Negative five?
- Yeah.

182
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,862
I don't think it's negative five.

183
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,366
The radio said.

184
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,039
Well, windchill, you know,
is probably what they meant.

185
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,290
Windchill factor.

186
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,583
Yeah.

187
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,547
Look, Ashley, I'm sorry.

188
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,967
I was scared that
I was gonna walk out there...

189
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:12,763
and you were gonna take one look at me
and just... turn around.

190
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,932
I was scared I was walkin' into heartache.

191
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:19,853
All those letters, those words,
and you have a picture in your mind.

192
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:26,401
I was scared you'd see me,
and I just wouldn't be that...

193
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,779
picture that you had in your mind.

194
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:32,866
I figured you walked outta there
and saw my clothes or something...

195
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,786
and you just walked right the other way.

196
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,121
You know, maybe you saw
my coat or my hair...

197
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,790
Hey, I like your coat!

198
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,875
Maybe you-

199
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,213
Maybe you saw me and I didn't-

200
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:51,051
Ashley, no. That was me.

201
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,059
I thought you said
you had curly hair.

202
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,646
I do. It's very curly.

203
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,233
When it gets long, it's really curly.
But I cut it short.

204
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:10,195
I can grow it back out again, if you want.
I can get it pretty bushy.

205
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,240
No! No, no, no.

206
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,826
I want you to be who you wanna be.

207
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,538
Do that again.

208
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,124
What?

209
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,917
Smile like that.

210
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,339
Come on. One more time.

211
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,433
God, I have been dreaming
about that smile...

212
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:42,185
for so long...

213
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,979
Ashley Mercer.

214
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,029
You're better than the pictures
in my mind, Nick.

215
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,119
You're real.

216
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,739
Can I ask you somethin'?

217
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,116
Is this the first time
you ever done somethin' like this?

218
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,162
Look at you.

219
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,708
You're so pretty, sweet.

220
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,629
Why were you writing to a guy,
some con, you don't even know?

221
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,215
I told you, Nick. Remember?

222
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,092
Tell me again.

223
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:46,434
All the guys I've ever been with...

224
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,645
they never wanted to get to know me.

225
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,151
Who I am... inside.

226
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,573
They just wanted to... get inside.

227
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,287
A guy like you, Nick.

228
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:10,208
God, I mean, six months
before you could even touch my face.

229
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,753
I figure a guy like that...

230
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,840
is gonna have to work
to get to know me some other way.

231
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,648
But when I read what you wrote to me...

232
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,192
I said:

233
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,738
"Here's a guy they say
is a criminal, but he's not.

234
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,616
Just protected his girl.

235
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:47,871
Somebody got killed,
but he's not a killer...

236
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,543
'cause he did what he had to do
to save somebody.

237
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,632
And the world just
didn't see it that way."

238
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,301
State of Michigan, anyway.

239
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,763
You wrote me some wonderful things, Nick.

240
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,141
It wasn't all me, you know.

241
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,810
Yeah, it was all you.

242
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:15,398
The guy I was in with, you know, he helped
me with some of the romantic stuff.

243
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,817
He's a good guy, actually. You'd like him.

244
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:23,990
I'm talkin' about the heart,
not the words.

245
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:26,242
Yeah, well...

246
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,912
some of the heart might've been his too.

247
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,498
Yeah?

248
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,425
He should've signed his name.

249
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,594
Then he'd be here right now.

250
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,911
Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho!

251
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,872
- Merry Christmas, Santa!
- Leave Santa alone!

252
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,791
Provisions, Nick.

253
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,376
- What?
- Provisions!

254
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:23,883
Oh, we are going to be naked,
drinking cold champagne...

255
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:27,303
but we are not leaving that motel room
till after New Year's.

256
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,557
Okay, well, I think we got enough stuff.

257
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,392
Come here. You need a coat.

258
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:36,688
No boyfriend of mine is gonna walk around
in a negative five degree wind chill...

259
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,648
without a good-looking goddamn coat.

260
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:42,736
But you already got me all this stuff.
I didn't get you anything.

261
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,740
Nick, you got out. You're here.

262
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,409
You're my Christmas.

263
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,327
It's $200, Ash.

264
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:55,331
I know! But you forget where I work.

265
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,334
- Beauty and fragrances.
- Yep.

266
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:02,005
Fifty percent off, my friend. Ho, ho, ho.

267
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,934
Just till the holidays, Nick.

268
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,395
We'll let her have her holidays.

269
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,439
Then we'll tell her.

270
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,524
Attention, shoppers...

271
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,193
- Hey, Nick.
- Yeah.

272
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,778
You know what I was thinking?

273
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:25,945
What?

274
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,365
Well, after our little holiday hideaway...

275
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,951
maybe instead of going back to Detroit...

276
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,244
we can go gambling.

277
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,871
Don't you think that'd be fun?

278
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,749
You know, drive up to that Indian place
you used to work at.

279
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,334
I don't know about that.

280
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,878
What are you talking about?
I haven't gambled in forever.

281
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,130
I got some luck, you know?

282
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,716
Blackjack, Nick. Blackjack I'm good at.

283
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,427
And they'd give us some free games,
wouldn't they, since you worked there?

284
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:50,512
I worked security.

285
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,972
I don't think they're gonna be rolling out
the red carpet for me.

286
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:57,060
Yeah, slots... Whoo! Baby,
am I good at slots. You don't even know.

287
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,770
It would be so much fun. Come on.

288
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,022
You can't be good at slots.
You just pull the handle.

289
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,441
No, but we'll walk in there
like high rollers.

290
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:04,818
You know, it'll be fun.

291
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,487
Look, Ash, we're not going anywhere
I used to work. Okay? That's it.

292
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,326
Okay. I'm sorry. I just-

293
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,329
You know, I thought
maybe you had friends there...

294
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,914
and you'd like to see them.

295
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:22,168
It's okay. Look, you know,
I've been in prison for two years.

296
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,754
Those guys really don't want to see me.
Trust me.

297
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,217
Well, they don't know
what the hell they're missing.

298
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:54,868
I'm gonna tell them not to bother us
for the rest of the year.

299
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:58,955
When I get back in that room, you better
be wearing nothing but a candy cane.

300
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,717
I have no gifts to bring

301
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:19,309
A gift to give a King

302
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,770
I've got a girl—

303
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,064
Hi, Nick.

304
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:52,675
Shit!

305
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,014
I owe you a drink!

306
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,773
Welcome home, Nick.

307
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,654
Look, man, you don't know me.

308
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,282
Oh, I know you.

309
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,326
- I know you real well.
- You can't.

310
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,411
The hell I can't.

311
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,288
- Watch out, baby!
- Ashley!

312
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,040
I'm bringin' in the tree!

313
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:42,308
Looks like somebody's
been havin' some fun.

314
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,482
Hey, sis, happy holidays.

315
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,905
You bastard! No!

316
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:00,076
- Take it easy. Don't hurt her.
- Right. Sorry, Monster.

317
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,957
So...

318
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:12,046
this is the guy you've been waitin' for,
the man of your dreams.

319
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,215
Gabriel, what are you doing?

320
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,092
I read a lot about you, Nick.

321
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,177
Gabriel, what are you doing here?

322
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:21,889
I read you're a man of some knowledge.

323
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:22,974
Gabriel.

324
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,767
A man of some travels.

325
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:27,645
Look, man, I'm not him.

326
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,315
Whatever you want from Nick,
you got the wrong guy.

327
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,816
Nick?

328
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,112
No! No!

329
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,699
Who are you now?

330
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:44,412
I'm not him, man!
She just thinks I'm Nick. I'm not him.

331
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,580
Put him in the truck.

332
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,457
Wait a minute!
I was in the joint with him.

333
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,335
That's how I knew about him and her.
I took his place.

334
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,378
You what?

335
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:55,048
Okay. I got out. Nick didn't.

336
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:59,177
I knew about her letters,
and, Jesus Christ, man...

337
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,929
whatever you want from Nick,
I'm not him, okay?

338
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,349
I just wanted to be.

339
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,230
You're not Nick Cassidy?

340
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,317
No, man, I just shared his cell.

341
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,528
But you were saying you were.

342
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,489
Yeah.

343
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,575
So you could get with my sister.

344
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,660
Yeah.

345
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,662
So you could get down her chimney.

346
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,374
Yeah.

347
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,711
And you think tellin' me that's
gonna help your cause.

348
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,507
No!

349
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,052
No! No!

350
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,345
Is this him?

351
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,931
Please don't hurt him, Gabriel. Don't!

352
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,266
Is this the fucker you been writin' all year?

353
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,893
Don't! Please, don't.

354
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,854
- Is this Nick Cassidy?
- Yes!

355
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,857
Yes! Yes!

356
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,362
Well, he better learn
to give you some respect.

357
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:05,243
- Get her outta here.
- No!

358
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,247
No!

359
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,168
Man, they got a shitload of cookies.

360
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Take 'em.

361
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,173
What about the tree?

362
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,092
You want the tree?

363
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,136
Yeah.

364
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,983
I read your letters, convict.

365
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,531
Don't play no reindeer games with me.

366
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,003
He read your letters.

367
00:29:57,087 --> 00:30:00,673
One day I wasn't there, and he came in.

368
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:04,218
Jane tried to stop him,
but he read your letters.

369
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,054
What letters?

370
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,098
He knows you worked at that casino.

371
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:17,023
What?

372
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,609
Oh, my God, you set him up!

373
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,111
No, no, I didn't. I didn't.

374
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:24,739
When did you decide to do it, Ash?

375
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:29,577
After which one of his letters?
What, the 40th? The 50th? The first? What?

376
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,038
- No, Nick, you're not-
- Look, I'm not Nick!

377
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:35,291
Okay? You thought you'd fuck him over?

378
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,044
Shit! Guess what? He fucked you!

379
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:41,797
Because I never worked in any casino,
and I can't help you because I'm not him!

380
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:44,217
No, you don't understand. I love you!

381
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,801
Jesus Christ!

382
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,888
Hey, hey, watch your mouth.
It's Christmas.

383
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:52,099
Listen to me. Listen to me.

384
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,561
My brother has killed people. I know this.

385
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,439
You don't know him. You don't know
what he's capable of. He will kill you.

386
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:01,859
If you keep telling him
that you're not you, he will kill you.

387
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:06,113
Says here the retail industry
does 50 percent of its business...

388
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:10,201
between December 1 and December 25.

389
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,329
That's half a year's business
in one month's time.

390
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:18,459
It seems to me an intelligent country would
legislate a second such gift-giving holiday.

391
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:22,380
Create, say, a Christmas Two,
late May or early June...

392
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,549
to further stimulate growth.

393
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:28,511
Ever since you been goin' to night school,
you been giving me headaches, Jumpy.

394
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,429
Christmas Two.

395
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:53,619
"My sweet, sexy Ashy-lashy.

396
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,123
I have been dreaming of you constantly...

397
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,625
and knowing you are out there
makes these walls...

398
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,838
not seem so close
or so strong or so cold.

399
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,426
Someday I'm gonna take you
up by Lake Superior.

400
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:12,972
Before I went in,
before goddamn Millie...

401
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,308
I used to work up at this casino...

402
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,643
working security.

403
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:23,816
I used to watch for people
stealin' chips, counting cards...

404
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,776
getting piss-drunk, that kind of stuff.

405
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:29,572
I ndian place. Easiest job I ever had."

406
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,200
You're a good writer, Nick.

407
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,581
I give this writing... an A-plus.

408
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,501
You just tell us what we need to know...

409
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:46,922
and you two kids,
you get to go live happily ever after.

410
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,259
You give me little nieces and nephews.

411
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:54,513
Listen to me, man.
I never worked at a casino.

412
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:55,765
No, Nick.

413
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,059
Just shut up.

414
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,436
That guy who wrote that letter?

415
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,688
That's Nick Cassidy.

416
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:04,273
I was in the joint with him.

417
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,108
He rode a two-year manslaughter bit...

418
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:09,612
for killing some guy who was bothering
his girlfriend in a bar.

419
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:14,492
He's dead. He wrote those letters.
He worked at a casino.

420
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,621
Me? My last job was at a Quick Lube.

421
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,040
I did five for lifting cars.

422
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,751
That's it. He was my cell mate.
That's how I know him.

423
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,713
I'm not him. I'm sorry about your sister.

424
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:30,216
I just got out of the joint.

425
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,803
I just wanna—
I don't know anything.

426
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,846
I don't remember anybody.
I just wanna go home.

427
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:46,899
Bury this guy.

428
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,526
- No. Gabriel, no.
- What?

429
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,486
Gabriel, you promised.

430
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,822
I promised that when he helped us,
we'd be gone.

431
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,740
When he helped us.
This guy doesn't wanna play.

432
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,784
No, you promised me!

433
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,954
And you promised me
you'd get your sweetheart to help!

434
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:06,419
He'd rather die... than be with you.

435
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,381
He'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.

436
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,094
Bury this guy all over the place.

437
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,389
No. No! Gabriel, no!

438
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,975
Shut up!

439
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,119
Don't get no blood on my shoes.

440
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,665
All right, all right, all right.
What do you want to know?

441
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,542
About the casino, the Tomahawk?

442
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,962
Jesus Christ, what do you wanna know?

443
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:04,435
Six months writing love letters,
my pen pal fucks me over.

444
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,438
Thanks for the stamps, Ash.

445
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:09,690
All right. What do you wanna know?

446
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,234
Everything.

447
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,695
Nick, I love you, baby.

448
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,406
Nick, I love you.

449
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:18,699
Hey.

450
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,952
She said she loves you. Say something.

451
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,331
I had better sex in prison.

452
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,377
Throw him back in the rig.

453
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,507
Monster, he's not the guy.

454
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,596
Whole time you were drivin',
he was tellin' her he's not the guy.

455
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,348
He's not the guy.

456
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:45,100
I understand why he'd tell us
he's not the guy...

457
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,854
but why would he tell her
that he's not the guy?

458
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:52,399
Maybe he's not the guy.

459
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,007
Look, if I went in the joint with a library card,
I'd come out with a library card.

460
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,266
The man who wrote those letters
loved Ashley, boys.

461
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,353
He lived for her.

462
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,569
Where's she work?

463
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,654
What?

464
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,866
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she?
Where's she work?

465
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,826
Lindstrom's, beauty and fragrances.

466
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,744
What's her middle name?

467
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,914
Samantha.

468
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,256
What'd they call her in high school?

469
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,841
Bam-Bam.

470
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,218
- What'd they call her in college?
- What college?

471
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:04,054
- What's her greatest fear?
- Brother.

472
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,475
Wrong. It's drowning.

473
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,144
Wrong. It's her brother.

474
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,904
That's love.

475
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,619
It's time to start talking...

476
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:27,870
Nick.

477
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:33,584
Time to start telling tales.

478
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,795
Get him up here.

479
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,090
No, no, no! Fuck that!

480
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:43,052
Nick doesn't do anything
till Nick gets something for Nick.

481
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,846
You got it? I want some hot chocolate.

482
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,600
You wanna hear about some job of mine?

483
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:53,270
I wanna see some goddamn hot chocolate...

484
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,689
and some pecan fuckin' pie!

485
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,818
Sure nice pie.

486
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,117
So, when you worked there-

487
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:17,169
You knew the place-

488
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,600
Okay.

489
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,144
You know what?

490
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,897
I could really go for some onion rings.

491
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,109
You said talk. That's all you said.
Gabriel, you said you wanted to talk.

492
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,443
Shut up!

493
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:43,404
You just said you wanted to talk to him.

494
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,657
You can't choose your family, Ash.

495
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,703
Unlike friends and lovers,
that does relieve you...

496
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,914
of the burden of worrying you chose wrong.

497
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,969
- How much money is in that casino?
- Hard to say.

498
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,722
Well, take a guess.

499
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,059
Five million?

500
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,144
Jesus.

501
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:18,105
- You wrote Ash a letter with a story...
- Come here.

502
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,733
About working Christmas Eve.

503
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,235
About how they send
half the security guys home.

504
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,362
Nobody's comin' in and out.

505
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:28,824
And the rest of you are gettin' shit-faced.
That a true story or not?

506
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:31,827
Christmas Eve.

507
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,872
We're taking down that casino, convict.

508
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,960
And you're the guy
that's gonna tell us how.

509
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,758
That's what we can see.

510
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:50,012
Now, you tell us what we can't see.
Where the private doors go...

511
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,515
where the alarms are,
what the upstairs looks like, all of it.

512
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,267
That's not the Tomahawk.

513
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,935
What the hell are you talkin' about?

514
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:01,482
What's this, the cage?
I mean, the cage is over here.

515
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,275
This whole thing's mixed up.

516
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,527
- That's what it looks like, Romeo.
- Since when?

517
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,529
I mean, what's this?

518
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:10,949
That's the prime rib buffet. $5.99.

519
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,786
Buffet? Buffet is over here by the bar.

520
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:18,916
I mean, this map looks like it was made
by a bunch of retards. It's all wrong.

521
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,959
Stop it.

522
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,128
It's my map, you little shit!

523
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,342
Now, we cased the place. We saw it.

524
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:32,012
Yeah, and I worked there, for a year.

525
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,431
The map is kinda messy, Monster.

526
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,852
They must have remodeled the place.

527
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,313
- What?
- Big guy, the boss.

528
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:45,943
- The guy that ran the place, was in charge.
- Jack Bangs.

529
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:49,696
Jack Bangs! Was always talkin' about
giving the place a makeover.

530
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,199
Must've gone ahead and done that
while I was in the Mountain.

531
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,202
I mean, this thing's all changed around.

532
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,996
I can't help you with this.
I don't know where security or anything is.

533
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,248
I have no idea.

534
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:03,335
Look I don't care about
the pancake breakfast.

535
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,337
You wanna know about money, right?

536
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:09,758
Okay. Where you got the buffet down here?
That used to be Bangs's office.

537
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:11,677
And he kept a safe in there.

538
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:17,599
And that safe had all the money
that he was skimming in there.

539
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:21,603
- And it was called the powwow safe.
- Powwow safe?

540
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,815
Yes, powwow safe.

541
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,693
'Cause he was stealing money
from the tribe.

542
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:31,613
The guy had thousands in there.
Millions probably.

543
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:35,242
Millions? In the powwow safe?

544
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,828
Millions.

545
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:42,541
But, I mean, you know...

546
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,794
it's just that now you tell me
his office is moved.

547
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:48,338
God knows what else is different.
You know?

548
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,382
The security.

549
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,677
You want me to show you what goes where.
I have no idea!

550
00:41:55,889 --> 00:42:00,184
Well, I guess we don't need you then.

551
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:10,152
Well, not necessarily.

552
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:16,658
Because, if you get me inside,
then I know where the money moves.

553
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:19,661
I know the security routines.
I know their signals to each other.

554
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,496
I know how they operate.

555
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:24,041
You get me in there...

556
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,877
then I can work with this map,
and I can tell you if anything's changed.

557
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,213
Wrong, convict.

558
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,798
You walk in there, they recognize you.

559
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,592
So what?

560
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:37,137
If they recognize him, they'll remember him
when the job goes down.

561
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,932
- They won't recognize me. Trust me.
- Why not?

562
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:44,519
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.

563
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:49,066
Look, I give you the wrong information,
you shoot me, right?

564
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,567
I mean, it's pretty simple.

565
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,112
Now, you got two choices...
You can either get me in there...

566
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,949
I can take a look around and case
the joint, check out security...

567
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,243
and I can tell you
if I can work with this map...

568
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,078
or you can just shoot me right now.

569
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:24,726
Wait a minute. What's this?
What happened to working together?

570
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:29,147
- You rather be back in the Mountain?
- Might as well be.

571
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:32,401
You don't get 50 channels in the Mountain.

572
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:35,320
Tomorrow you got singin'
for your supper to do.

573
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,825
I've always looked on
Christmas as a good time.

574
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,326
Help yourself.

575
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,288
Sure, take that. I don't need it.

576
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:47,416
It's the only time when people
open their hearts freely...

577
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,876
the only time when men
and women seem to realize...

578
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:53,463
that all human beings
are really members of the same family.

579
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:54,756
Damn it!

580
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,603
Nick. Nick.

581
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,939
Let me help you.

582
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:12,524
Get your own room, Ashley.

583
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,359
- Let me help you.
- Get your own room.

584
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,862
He said when you come out,
he wants to talk to you. That's all!

585
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,531
I thought he meant after New Year's,
back in Detroit.

586
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,199
But you knew what he wanted. Right?

587
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,035
I thought we had more days.

588
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,871
For what? What are you gonna do?
Talk me into helping?

589
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,372
What, did he promise you
some of the money?

590
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:29,791
- No.
- Shit, you should've at least gotten that.

591
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,918
Get your own fucking room.

592
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:36,465
Christ, you know how I hate him.
You know how I feel about my brother.

593
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,842
How fucking stupid are you?

594
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,303
What did you think's going to happen?

595
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,889
This thing's gonna be over,
and he's just gonna let me go?

596
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,850
He's going to shoot me
in the back of the head like this.

597
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,729
Or I'm back in prison for the rest of my life,
and that's it for me.

598
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:54,691
This is my life too, you know.
This is not just about you.

599
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:58,070
You think he's just gonna let me walk?

600
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:01,073
You think he's not gonna
take this out on me?

601
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:04,785
I'm in this too, and I'm really scared.

602
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,536
Please!

603
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,497
Oh, Jesus.

604
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:14,169
Nick. Nick.

605
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:20,592
Do you remember all those letters
you wrote me?

606
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,220
About me and you against the whole world?

607
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,723
We can still have that.

608
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:31,019
We can have it all if you just
give him what he wants.

609
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,939
Why do you have to keep fighting him?

610
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:37,818
Why can't you just give him what he wants?
Why?

611
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,319
Why?

612
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,200
God!

613
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:50,205
You know, it's just my luck.

614
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:55,168
I finally meet a boy that I'm crazy about,
and my brother wants him worse than I do.

615
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,003
What do you want from me? Sympathy?

616
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:00,298
I don't feel bad for you.

617
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,968
Why didn't you tell me
your brother was a criminal?

618
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,180
Gabriel knows some guys
in Miami and New York-

619
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:10,058
Guys that he helps get guns to Detroit.

620
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:11,643
That's it. That's all I know.

621
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,563
- That's who he's working for on this one?
- No.

622
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,231
He doesn't want to work for anyone.

623
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,191
Well, what's the last
place they took down?

624
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,526
What?

625
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,280
Monster and his merry men-
What's the last place they robbed?

626
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,323
Who they ripped off. What did they do?

627
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,579
I don't think they've
robbed anywhere before.

628
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,539
They drive guns.

629
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,001
They've never done a robbery?

630
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,506
Really?

631
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:44,468
Nick.

632
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:50,515
- We can get out of this.
- There's no "we," Ashley, okay?

633
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,142
- Hey!
- We get rid of them and we-

634
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,894
Get your own room!

635
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,604
Go! Leave!

636
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,899
Fine.

637
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,443
But if I told you what he wanted,
you would've been gone.

638
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:05,113
You would've gotten on that bus,
and you would've stayed on it.

639
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:07,449
And if that makes me selfish,
then I am selfish.

640
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,869
If that makes me a liar... God— I am a liar.

641
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:15,332
But I have been dealing
with my fucked-up brother...

642
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,627
and his fucked-up friends
for way too long.

643
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:20,378
And I am stronger than him now.

644
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:24,799
Because he showed up for money...

645
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:27,427
and I showed up for love.

646
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,262
Sing it to somebody who gives a shit.

647
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:33,975
You're so quick to make me your enemy?

648
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,144
Then tell me something, Nick.

649
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:39,481
Tell me—
What did you show up for?

650
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,191
What did you really want?

651
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:44,569
With me?

652
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,670
No. Miss, miss, miss, miss.

653
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:04,005
Oh, man.

654
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,590
Well, well.

655
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:08,635
- You still got the touch, Monster.
- That's right.

656
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:15,267
Look what Santa's dwarves
have brought you.

657
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,896
What do you say to Santa's dwarves?

658
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,148
It's elves, bro.

659
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,068
You say "Thank you."

660
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,787
A cowboy.

661
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:41,543
You're sending me into an I ndian casino
dressed like a cowboy.

662
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,838
- Thought this through entirely?
- It was that or a ballerina.

663
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:50,135
Well, I mean, I'm gonna need some money.
It is a casino.

664
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,350
Ten bucks?
What am I gonna do with 10 bucks?

665
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,935
Don't tip.

666
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,396
Look, if we're gonna
be workin' together...

667
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,941
you shouldn't send me in there like the
Lone Ranger with 10 bucks to throw down.

668
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:06,651
You want me to not get noticed.

669
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:09,321
Not gettin' noticed costs at least
a couple hundred.

670
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,282
Ante up, boys.

671
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,110
Don't lose.

672
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:53,740
Yeah. Do I get, like, a country-western name,
or are we just gonna—

673
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:58,078
You get recognized,
you get a country-western funeral.

674
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,580
Come on. Come on.

675
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:03,375
Get your hands off me!

676
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,796
Are you ready to go gamblin', darlin'?

677
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,965
Here. She is now.

678
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:15,553
All right.
You all keep an eye on my guitar now.

679
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,649
Who's robbing who here, Gabe?

680
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,569
Get in there and watch them.

681
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:32,987
Jumpy.

682
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:43,248
Nick, you're making it
really hard to apologize.

683
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:46,126
Is that what you're tryin' to do?
Say it with car keys.

684
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,795
Nick, a lot of relationships start out like this-
you know, family problems?

685
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,588
Save it, Bam-Bam.

686
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,851
Hey. I think I liked you better
when you were in prison.

687
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:05,311
Yeah? Is that why you keep trying
to put me back in?

688
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:14,529
Well, I just think you were a hell
of a lot more understanding.

689
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,657
Well, I was a different person then.

690
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,628
As I was saying, boys...

691
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:33,965
there's an "S" word I'd like
to throw into the conversation here...

692
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,635
because it's a big part
of what's going on, a big element.

693
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,138
The "S" word.

694
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:43,391
It's a serious matter
with serious effects...

695
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:46,644
so I'd just like to get it out there,
throw it out there...

696
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:50,315
so that we can know about it,
talk about it, hear it...

697
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,567
maybe even do some things about it.

698
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,069
- Mr. Bangs.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

699
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:58,281
Thank you.

700
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,365
Snow.

701
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,494
Are you with me here, boys?

702
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,078
Snow.

703
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:07,332
Now, I'm talking big-time, grade-A...

704
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:12,295
God-quality, S-N-O-fucking-W snow.

705
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:20,011
Now, look, you guys hired me
because you wanted Las Vegas quality.

706
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,596
I brought it to you.

707
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,599
You wanted Las Vegas press.
I gave that to you.

708
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,519
But I cannot give you Las Vegas profits...

709
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:30,021
until you people get together
around a campfire...

710
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,857
smoke a pipe, and do some kind
of fucking spirit dance...

711
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:34,734
about this goddamn snow.

712
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:40,490
We understand the Paiutes' casino
saw a profit of $ 12 million last year.

713
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,283
Don't talk to me about the Paiutes, okay?

714
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:44,702
I have it on very good authority
they're cooking the books.

715
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:47,872
The Wyatolla reservation made 17 million.

716
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,960
All right, look.
Keep this under your feathers, boys...

717
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:55,255
but it just so happens that next week...

718
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:58,132
I'm bringing in a great lounge act.

719
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:02,554
Three Russian broads.
They all look like Meryl Streep.

720
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,806
They can juggle anything— your house,
your car, your mother-in-law.

721
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,724
Mr. Bangs.

722
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,685
We're doing the right thing here-

723
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:11,396
Mr. Bangs, the tribe is concerned...

724
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:16,234
that many of your new ideas
are not bringing in any new revenues.

725
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,152
I'm putting liquor into drinks.

726
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,988
I'm paying 10 times odds on craps...

727
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,699
and I got the girls showing 16% more skin.

728
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,742
And by the way,
you show me another buffet...

729
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,953
that offers both Coke and Pepsi.

730
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,205
Don't even bother looking,
because it doesn't exist.

731
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,083
Okay, so, now,
what else do you people want me to do?

732
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,423
So, does it look remodeled a lot?

733
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,425
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

734
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:43,678
They did a lot of work.
This restaurant here is the main expansion.

735
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:48,099
And they moved the games around.

736
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,519
The big guy's office—
They did a hell of a job with that.

737
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:53,104
Hell of a job.

738
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,194
Do you know that guy?

739
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:03,531
Yeah. That's Mike.

740
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:07,410
Mike. He works here.

741
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:10,204
Spend some of your brother's money.
I'm gonna go look around.

742
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:15,460
I was just thinking maybe you fellas
would like to stick around—

743
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:18,713
You know, try the $5.99 prime rib.

744
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,098
Thank you.

745
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:35,855
Couple of rum and Cokes, please.

746
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,524
You want that rum and Coke
or rum and Pepsi?

747
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,329
Did you keep going?

748
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,664
Bear.

749
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:56,751
Bear, give me a bottle of any goddamn
thing you got. Come on, hurry up.

750
00:54:57,336 --> 00:55:00,421
Cheap low-balling
two-dollar fucking bettors.

751
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,841
I can't go back to Vegas, Bear.
I can't go back. They'll kill me.

752
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:07,136
- What does the tribe want?
- What do they want?

753
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:10,974
They want their roads paved
with gold is what they want.

754
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:15,019
Talking to me about the fucking Paiutes.
The Paiutes are on the interstate, okay?

755
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:17,188
There's nothing I can do about that,
my friend.

756
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,899
And I certainly didn't pick this spot
for your reservation.

757
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,318
- Neither did we.
- Yeah, yeah.

758
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:23,945
Thanks a lot.

759
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,948
Hey, how you doing, cowboy? How are you?

760
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,200
- Good. Great.
- Jack Bangs is the name.

761
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:37,875
Hey, listen. Listen, Hopalong,
you look like an intelligent fellow.

762
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,919
Let me ask you something.

763
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:42,588
Do you think that upstate Michigan...

764
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:48,803
needs another roadside casino, or...

765
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,180
do you think that upstate Michigan...

766
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:54,767
needs an international gaming destination?

767
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:58,062
- What do you think?
- Roadside casino.

768
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,109
How'd you hear about us? Radio, TV, cable?

769
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,071
Prison.

770
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,410
Place your bets, please.

771
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:15,246
I can't go back to Vegas.

772
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,011
We won! We won!

773
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:33,806
Oh, fuck.

774
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,517
What the hell was that all about?

775
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:39,353
Nothing, man. He just wanted to know
how I heard about the place.

776
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:42,607
Just fucking throttle down a little bit,
all right? Ease up off me.

777
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:43,816
You're welcome.

778
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:46,277
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

779
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,904
Jesus Christ.

780
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:50,448
I'm sorry. Here, hold this.

781
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,200
What are you doing?

782
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:55,870
Security's not all that changed.
Let me just go clean this up, all right?

783
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,999
- What was that?
- His face fell off. Take this.

784
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:18,643
Hey, baby.

785
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:21,646
Give me one of those.

786
00:57:25,818 --> 00:57:28,069
- How are you?
- Fucking freezing.

787
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:32,907
How long you work here?

788
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,243
Five years... since it opened.

789
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,078
How long since your makeover?

790
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,663
My what?

791
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:42,416
I'm taking about the place...
The remodeling, moving everything around.

792
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:44,961
Tomahawk's been the same
ever since I started, buddy.

793
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,754
It's the losers that change.

794
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,509
Lying motherfucker!

795
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:57,640
Go, kid, go!

796
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:06,649
Hey.

797
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:13,739
Shit.

798
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:36,470
Come here!

799
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,556
Oh, man, it's yourjacket.
You can have it.

800
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,099
- He gave me a hundred bucks.
- Shit!

801
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:46,856
- What the hell happened, man?
- The man fucked up!

802
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,443
This building is the same from day one!
It hasn't been changed!

803
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,695
Monster, he was talking
to the manager inside there!

804
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,780
There he is!

805
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:02,079
Go, go, go, go!

806
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:04,457
Come on! Get him back!

807
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,689
Keep on running, Romeo! Keep on running!

808
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:31,943
As fast as you go, we'll get there!

809
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:36,405
We're truckers, motherfucker!
We drive for a living!

810
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:03,432
Help! Help! Help!

811
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:04,976
He thinks he's gettin' away.

812
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,939
Shit!

813
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,541
No!

814
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,852
Come on. Come on!

815
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:06,537
We gotta get to those trees.

816
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:20,634
Oh, shit!

817
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,592
Come on! Get 'em outta there! Come on!

818
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,552
Come on!

819
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:06,055
- Is she all right?
- All right, all right!

820
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,473
All right!

821
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:11,102
At the rate you're goin', I'm gonna have
trouble considerin' you family.

822
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:14,772
Hey there! You folks need some help?

823
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:22,613
- I say, you need some help?
- Get outta here, man!

824
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:26,075
- Shut the fuck up!
- Get the fuck outta here!

825
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:29,370
Well, if you need some help-

826
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:35,084
Gabriel, no!

827
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:39,088
Gabriel, he won't hurt us.
He won't remember us. Don't do it.

828
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,132
Shut the fuck up!

829
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,218
No!

830
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,390
Oh, God!

831
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:05,656
Jesus. Please.

832
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:08,075
I'm just a farmer.

833
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,453
I got a wife and family.

834
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,164
I got a hunger...

835
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,458
and a headache.

836
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:42,359
Hey, Monster.

837
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,129
Here they are! Come on!

838
01:04:02,214 --> 01:04:04,590
Get out of here. Get out of here.

839
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,307
Nick the Trick.

840
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:17,228
Master of disguise.

841
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:20,439
I'm surprised you never escaped
from the Mountain.

842
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:23,567
What? Yeah. Never tried.

843
01:04:23,652 --> 01:04:24,902
Well...

844
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:31,242
in the spirit of the season, convict...

845
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:34,245
I'm gonna give you a chance.

846
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:38,582
I understand you're unhappy.
It's been kind of rough.

847
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:41,669
You need a little guidance.
You're like a wanderer...

848
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:45,422
who's just lost his way in the night.

849
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:51,178
So we're gonna have a little contest.

850
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,935
We're each gonna get one of these.

851
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,019
Yeah.

852
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:03,148
Whichever one hits closest
to the bull's-eye gets what he wants.

853
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:07,319
You land closer, you get Ashley.
You kids get to go free.

854
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:10,281
I land closer...

855
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,826
then we start getting your help.

856
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:26,589
May the man who really wants it win.

857
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:27,881
Yeah?

858
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:37,141
Shit.

859
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:43,689
You got something to say to me, Nick?

860
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:47,818
Two out of three?

861
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:55,618
"What's this? What's this?
This isn't the Tomahawk.

862
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:59,622
No, no. I've never seen this before.
They must've given the place a makeover.

863
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:03,500
Yeah. The buffet was over here.
The blackjack was over here.

864
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:05,919
The bar used to be over here.
I don't know. I can't help you.

865
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:09,006
I have no idea. I have no idea."

866
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,759
Something tells me you're not being
totally honest with me.

867
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,386
What'd you tell that casino manager?

868
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,639
Nothing. Nothing.

869
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:19,016
You were talking to him.
What'd you tell him?

870
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,603
Nothing.
He thought I was some gambler. Nothing.

871
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:24,688
Maybe something about a robbery?

872
01:06:24,773 --> 01:06:26,899
No, man. I swear to God.

873
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:34,406
Jesus Christ, man,
He thought I was some gambler!

874
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,867
He didn't know me, man!

875
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:40,829
He didn't recognize me! Jesus Christ!

876
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:44,375
I've been driving rigs
a long time, convict.

877
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:48,587
Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on
unless I was driving 15 hours a day.

878
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:52,091
Tell them I was tired, shit,
they'd just hire someone else.

879
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:56,553
A thousand miles by sundown,
or the gang don't eat come sunrise.

880
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,264
Shit.

881
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,809
And every road...

882
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:05,020
every mile...
it's nothing but moms and pops...

883
01:07:05,105 --> 01:07:08,524
and car-seat kiddies
giving me that look to go to hell...

884
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:11,026
and get off their happy goddamn highway.

885
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:14,279
So...

886
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,824
So I have worked...

887
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:19,493
and I have slaved...

888
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,329
and I have waited...

889
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:25,999
for the highways to split open
and for the rivers to roil...

890
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:31,588
and for God in the heavens to reach down
and show me some sign of my reward—

891
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:34,925
To grant me with my gift...

892
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:38,721
and say to me, "Gabriel, my son...

893
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:41,807
you are done with the road."

894
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,853
Well, convict...

895
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:49,732
that gift was granted.

896
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:52,067
Look, man, I swear to God.

897
01:07:52,152 --> 01:07:54,820
He just wanted to know
how I heard about the place, that's all.

898
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,948
He didn't know it was me, Gabriel.
Gabriel, he didn't know it was me.

899
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,074
Please.

900
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,495
Man, Monster,
just don't start trying to hit me.

901
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:09,710
Nick...

902
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:11,712
I've been trying to hit you.

903
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:25,559
Because I do not deserve
to be in some shit-bag motel...

904
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:28,562
in the middle of bum-fuck Michigan...

905
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,481
throwing darts at a worthless...

906
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:34,651
fucking convict!

907
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,793
You know something?

908
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:53,462
My little sister-

909
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:57,966
She deserves a world better than you.

910
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:03,388
Tonight, we're going to take
one more look at that map.

911
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:05,933
And this time...

912
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:07,935
you better have something worth saying.

913
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:19,863
Oh, my God.

914
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:24,952
Jesus Christ. What happened to you?

915
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:27,079
What did you do to him?

916
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,622
Hey!

917
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,333
What did they do to you, Nick?

918
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,043
Jesus Christ.

919
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:36,213
What the fuck did you do to him?

920
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:41,468
Bastard. Get out! Get out!

921
01:09:41,553 --> 01:09:43,720
Just get out!

922
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:47,641
Oh, my God. Nick, are you all right?

923
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:50,978
Let me see. Let me see.

924
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:54,940
Oh, God.

925
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,483
- Come here.
- Damn.

926
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:58,402
Come here.

927
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:03,031
Had some... points to make.

928
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,741
Okay. Baby.

929
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:08,829
We're going to get you
out of these wet clothes. Okay?

930
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:12,374
Oh, God.

931
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:19,673
Okay.

932
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:22,509
Okay. Come here.

933
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:24,386
- Come here.
- Jesus.

934
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,263
There you go. Okay.

935
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:31,101
All I wanted to do was
to make it back to Sidnaw...

936
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:32,936
just have some of Mama's gravy,
you know...

937
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:36,023
and some of Aunt Lisbeth's
cranberry cakes.

938
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:39,693
She makes them
with real cranberries.

939
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,111
It's really good.

940
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:44,072
We'll get there, baby.

941
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:46,074
- Jesus.
- We'll get there.

942
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:50,704
Just rest. Okay?

943
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:58,211
You saved my life, Nick.

944
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:04,885
You could've run, but you didn't.
You saved me.

945
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:06,136
You saved me.

946
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:09,306
I saved you 'cause I love you, Nick.

947
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:12,851
Why did you save me?

948
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:17,522
The guy I was in with...

949
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,900
Rudy, the car thief?

950
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:24,488
Sometimes I read him your letters.

951
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:26,573
I mean, I know they were private, but...

952
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:29,242
you know.

953
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:34,081
I'd read them to him, and he'd...

954
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:35,666
get this look on his face.

955
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:41,088
I swear, I think he imagined
you were writing to him.

956
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:44,675
And I know sometimes, I think...

957
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:47,928
he fell in love with you too.

958
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:52,599
You gave a couple of guys hope, Ashley.

959
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:56,186
Oh, it was a good thing.

960
01:11:57,438 --> 01:12:02,275
We're gonna get out of this together,
I promise you.

961
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,860
I promise you.

962
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:41,440
Ash?

963
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:44,067
We're gonna need one.

964
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,652
What?

965
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:48,155
A gun.

966
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:52,576
We got to find a way to get me a gun.

967
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:53,744
What?

968
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:57,414
And I'll need to be
inside the casino when it happens.

969
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:59,416
I can't just be outside drawing some map.

970
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:03,003
Nick, what are you talking about?

971
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,299
We need to find a way
to make me a part of this.

972
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:09,885
A part of what? A part of them?

973
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:13,972
Look, Ash,
if we're helping them with the robbery...

974
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:16,266
we got to be doing more than walking away.

975
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,311
Like that's winning, like that's some kind
of Christmas fucking bonus.

976
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:23,023
You mean take the money?

977
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:25,192
Yeah. Take the money.

978
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,820
Look, you want him out
of your life for good?

979
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,448
You want a real New Year
to look forward to?

980
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:34,367
If we're gonna do this,
then we ought to do it.

981
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,871
It's Christmas, Ash.

982
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,248
I think we deserve a present.

983
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:09,152
Start singing, Nick.

984
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:12,280
I have no gifts to bring

985
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,618
A gift to give

986
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,079
You want to keep fooling around?

987
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:22,040
Yeah. You want to keep playing?
Come on, let's get it on!

988
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:23,583
- Let me go!
- Calm down.

989
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:27,254
You want to keep playing?
I got a toy for you.

990
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:29,089
Let me get my toy.

991
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,258
Yes. Let's play!

992
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:32,467
- Hey, man. Hey.
- Shut up!

993
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:36,304
Now you get your pussy ass over here
and do what the fuck you're told!

994
01:14:38,266 --> 01:14:40,684
Now when you're spoke to,
you listen and answer.

995
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,535
It was a joke, anyways.

996
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:03,957
All right.

997
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:07,294
What you want to do...

998
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,464
is get to the top level up here.

999
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:15,510
Okay? And you do that
through this door on the western wall.

1000
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,893
You want to get to the security,
and then from the security...

1001
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:25,937
you get down into the cashier cage
and then you go into the count room.

1002
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,148
Now, there'll be a guard in there,
but he doesn't have a gun.

1003
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:31,610
The door's accessed by a keypad.

1004
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:33,945
The cashier will know the code.

1005
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,488
What about the powwow safe?

1006
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:38,366
That's upstairs.
You'll want to get to that.

1007
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:42,162
We're gonna get to the powwow safe.
That's good. We're gonna get there.

1008
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:45,081
What you want to do is,
you got to get a guy in the cage...

1009
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:48,084
and a guy on the floor
and somebody up top.

1010
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:50,545
Then you need a sweeper on the side...

1011
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:52,714
a lookout out front...

1012
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,925
and somebody watching the back.

1013
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:57,093
So, that's... How many is that? Six.

1014
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:00,764
We got five. Keeping Ashley outside.

1015
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:04,351
But you need six.

1016
01:16:05,645 --> 01:16:06,811
No.

1017
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:11,524
Look, man, I'm not making this shit up,
you know?

1018
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:13,235
You go in there with five guys...

1019
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,362
you're gonna either leave
an exit or an alarm unguarded.

1020
01:16:15,446 --> 01:16:18,448
- No.
- I know what I'm talking about.

1021
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:20,992
Raise your hand if you've
ever done a robbery before.

1022
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:25,789
Anyone? Anyone? Who's done a robbery?
Raise your hand.

1023
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:26,957
Okay.

1024
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:29,793
I have.

1025
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:35,840
You need six, Gabriel.

1026
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:39,261
You do. What are you gonna do about it?

1027
01:16:44,976 --> 01:16:50,730
All right. I want a drawing
of that security level.

1028
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,942
Every door, every guard, every ashtray.

1029
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:57,070
Yeah. All right.

1030
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:59,197
So, six guys, that's six guns.

1031
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:02,701
No way.

1032
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:05,537
Well, what am I gonna do?
I'm no threat without a gun.

1033
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:09,749
- No, you're not.
- What's the matter, Gabriel?

1034
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:15,380
Isn't this what you wanted him for?

1035
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,966
Areas of expertise?

1036
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,217
No guns.

1037
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:21,177
Well, you know, fine. It's up to you.

1038
01:17:21,262 --> 01:17:24,848
What you've got to figure out is how you're
gonna get up to that security level...

1039
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:26,808
without anybody knowing anything's wrong.

1040
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:29,853
I can tell you right now,
going in there with A.K.s and ski masks...

1041
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:31,438
ain't gonna do that.

1042
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:36,526
Well, that part, Nick...

1043
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,279
was planned out the day
I read your letters.

1044
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:42,824
Oh, yeah. What?
We're all gonna dress up like cowboys?

1045
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,535
No, no, not cowboys, Nick.

1046
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:47,787
Not on Christmas Eve.

1047
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,591
You gotta be kidding me.

1048
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:03,053
'Tis the season, convict.

1049
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:06,014
Ho, ho, ho.

1050
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:09,642
Coming up at 11:00
on the Channel 5 news, these top stories.

1051
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:12,145
The search intensifies for a Michigan man—

1052
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:13,188
Here's your Picasso.

1053
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:15,398
Reported missing this morning
on the Tallahassee Lake.

1054
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:18,401
- Investigators suspect foul play.
- It better be.

1055
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:20,403
Also, lottery fever—

1056
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:04,280
How long have you guys been going out?

1057
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:11,037
- Set us up with free drinks.
- Oh, yeah.

1058
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:53,538
Shit!

1059
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:57,000
Only guy in the gun club
who doesn't keep a gun in his truck.

1060
01:20:04,175 --> 01:20:05,467
Shit!

1061
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:07,802
Fucker decided to build him
a silicone tongue...

1062
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:09,804
so that the boy could talk.

1063
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:13,099
Now, you ever see a motherfucker
with a breast-implanted tongue?

1064
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:17,187
This guy I'm talking about— black-ass lung
is the least of his problems, man.

1065
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:20,523
He had so much smoke
comin' out of his skin, people would say...

1066
01:20:20,608 --> 01:20:22,442
- "Hey, where's the barbecue?"
- Yeah.

1067
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:34,454
No! No!

1068
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:37,207
No. Get away from me, goddamn it.

1069
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:41,878
Get off me! Just get off me.
You heard what I said.

1070
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,173
Stay away from me!

1071
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:48,551
No. You stay away from me.

1072
01:20:48,636 --> 01:20:50,345
Stay the hell away from me.

1073
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,805
You want me to scream?
I'll fucking scream. I swear to God.

1074
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:55,391
Listen. I was trying to stop him.

1075
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:57,477
You just about killed me.

1076
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:01,898
I wasn't shooting at you.
I was just trying to stop him...

1077
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,483
put him down,
shoot him in the fucking knees.

1078
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,151
I'm a good shot. I wasn't gonna kill him.

1079
01:21:05,236 --> 01:21:06,569
Yeah. You're such a goddamn good shot...

1080
01:21:06,654 --> 01:21:08,404
that who went through
the goddamn ice?

1081
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:10,657
Hey, I didn't put you on that ice.

1082
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:13,576
- You would never have been there-
- I just about goddamned died, Gabriel.

1083
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:16,538
Baby, I know that.

1084
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:19,999
When I saw you fall,
I could've put the gun in my mouth...

1085
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:21,584
and pulled the trigger then.

1086
01:21:22,336 --> 01:21:24,921
I know you have to be with him...

1087
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:28,174
but it is killing me.

1088
01:21:28,259 --> 01:21:30,969
Gabriel, we just have
to keep doing this and-

1089
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:33,221
I'm gonna cut out his heart.

1090
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:36,224
Is he ready for that?

1091
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:40,103
He's helped us do the map.
He's done what we need.

1092
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:42,855
We don't need him anymore.

1093
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:45,608
I don't trust the little fucker.
We can do this without him.

1094
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:47,819
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker tonight.

1095
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,612
No.

1096
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:51,614
Jesus.

1097
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:57,829
You drive me crazy, you know that?

1098
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,832
- Hey—
- No. You listen to me...

1099
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,126
because we have to be smart about this.

1100
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:08,256
The more he wants me,
the more his help's for real.

1101
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:11,676
He's manpower. That's all he is.

1102
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,929
He's just more manpower.

1103
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:20,059
Gabriel, he wants to help now.

1104
01:22:20,144 --> 01:22:22,854
He wants to rob it. He wants to rob you.

1105
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,647
He wants the money?

1106
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:27,317
No, baby.

1107
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:33,615
He wants me.

1108
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:37,410
Your little sister.

1109
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:43,875
If only Ma and Pop-

1110
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:46,044
Could see us now.

1111
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:52,842
- Hey.
- What?

1112
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:55,303
You told me this guy would play
the game by the numbers.

1113
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:59,557
Well, from where I stand, the only thing
he's been doing right so far...

1114
01:22:59,642 --> 01:23:01,225
is fucking my girlfriend.

1115
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:07,440
I don't want you with him.

1116
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:11,402
When I'm with him, I'm wanting you.

1117
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:14,697
All those letters
to all those goddamn cons...

1118
01:23:14,782 --> 01:23:17,200
are finally gonna pay off.

1119
01:23:17,284 --> 01:23:21,704
So don't get crazy, okay?
'Cause it's working.

1120
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,542
He's our money man.

1121
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:29,045
- We finally found one, didn't we?
- Yeah.

1122
01:23:30,798 --> 01:23:31,964
Oh, baby.

1123
01:23:32,049 --> 01:23:33,800
- See you later, assholes.
- Who's Jumpy calling?

1124
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:36,260
- Ex-wife, probably.
- Which one? All the ex-wives he's got...

1125
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:38,221
he's probably gonna have
to take down three casinos.

1126
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:39,806
You track down Gabriel?

1127
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:42,809
Nah. He's with his girlfriend,
making up for lost Nicky time.

1128
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:45,228
Come on. Hey, let's go get a drink.

1129
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:47,689
I should go and check on Romeo.

1130
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:50,566
Go smile on the motherfucker in love.

1131
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:52,860
Shit.

1132
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,908
You know what? I'll meet you in the bar.

1133
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:30,898
Fuck.

1134
01:25:03,474 --> 01:25:05,391
Come on, give me something.

1135
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:08,519
If I can fucking hot-wire cars,
I should fucking hot-wire a hotel door.

1136
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:10,855
Yeah, there we go.

1137
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,648
Damn.

1138
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:21,657
Who's slamming doors?

1139
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:44,514
How you doing?

1140
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:04,408
Shit.

1141
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:30,518
Damn.

1142
01:26:37,985 --> 01:26:39,402
Hey.

1143
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:42,363
Nick.

1144
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,619
Where should we go?

1145
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:50,788
Huh, baby?

1146
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:53,541
When we're gone from here...

1147
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,585
when we can do anything...

1148
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,379
where should we go?

1149
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,632
I don't know about you. I'm going home.

1150
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,637
We go together, remember?

1151
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:09,265
Wherever.

1152
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:14,186
Well, I'm going home.

1153
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:26,574
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, my love.

1154
01:27:28,035 --> 01:27:31,454
My love.

1155
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:36,167
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve.

1156
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:45,551
And your charges, sir.

1157
01:27:45,636 --> 01:27:47,345
Happy holidays.

1158
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:00,858
That's for the hundred bucks
worth of pay-per-view.

1159
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:05,821
That's for the 200
you took out of the minibar.

1160
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:08,282
- That's enough.
- It was on my credit card!

1161
01:28:08,367 --> 01:28:10,826
I figured since you guys
were paying for the room-

1162
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:14,664
So...

1163
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:16,916
you wanted a weapon, convict?

1164
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:20,836
No! Don't!

1165
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:31,514
Well, now, look at what Santa's dwarves
have brought you.

1166
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:34,517
What do you say to Santa's dwarves?

1167
01:28:34,601 --> 01:28:36,894
It's elves... Santa's elves.

1168
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:40,147
You say, "Thank you," motherfucker.

1169
01:28:46,113 --> 01:28:49,448
You hang around with criminals,
you end up making a lot of plans.

1170
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:54,787
But all the jobs I ever pulled,
all the cars I ever stole...

1171
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:58,040
no plan ever went down
the way it had been drawn up.

1172
01:28:58,125 --> 01:29:02,545
My plans to escape never worked,
and being on parole...

1173
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:05,006
going to the police wasn't an option.

1174
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:07,591
What's the matter? You nervous?

1175
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:12,763
Right now, you're just a truck driver.

1176
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,641
You haven't done anything wrong yet.

1177
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:19,186
If you do this, you're gonna spend
the rest of your life wishing you hadn't.

1178
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:20,896
Thanks for the reminder, Nick.

1179
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:23,816
Relax.

1180
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,568
Have a drink.

1181
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:31,699
Ain't that your thing?

1182
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:52,845
Hey, hey! Thirsty!

1183
01:29:55,766 --> 01:29:57,600
This diversion you're doing-

1184
01:29:57,684 --> 01:30:00,686
You'd better do it just the way
Monster planned...

1185
01:30:00,771 --> 01:30:03,355
or there ain't gonna be
no more rest of your life.

1186
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:22,041
And all through the house,
not a creature was stirring.

1187
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:29,965
Why don't you send
most of your boys home, Ed?

1188
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:32,718
Tom, why don't you go spend
Christmas with your family?

1189
01:30:32,803 --> 01:30:35,471
Don, you can shove off.
Merry Christmas, Jack.

1190
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:38,057
- Good to see you again.
- Nice to see you.

1191
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:40,768
Nobody even comes here to cheat.

1192
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,354
Ho, ho, ho!

1193
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:44,897
Hello!

1194
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:47,483
Eggnog for everyone. Santa's here.

1195
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:50,653
Good to see you.
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

1196
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:54,406
And we'd like some money, please.

1197
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:57,409
We're here to win money.
Do you have any money?

1198
01:30:57,494 --> 01:30:59,036
How you gentlemen doing tonight?

1199
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:01,455
Very good, Captain,
except that we're out of work.

1200
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:03,541
Seasons greetings.

1201
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:05,709
He's from Lindstrom's. I'm from Save-Away.

1202
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:06,752
How you doing?

1203
01:31:06,837 --> 01:31:10,297
No more toys for the kiddies,
but we do have charitable donations.

1204
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,596
All right, fellas, in?

1205
01:31:19,558 --> 01:31:21,058
Hey, sweetheart, how you doing?

1206
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:22,768
- Eleven.
- I'm fucking freezing. What can I get you?

1207
01:31:22,853 --> 01:31:25,771
- Twenty-one.
- Oh, Jesus. You just hit from my card.

1208
01:31:25,856 --> 01:31:27,189
I'm sorry, mister.

1209
01:31:28,275 --> 01:31:30,484
- Dealer has 18.
- And look at that, Grandpa.

1210
01:31:30,569 --> 01:31:32,736
Yeah. I'm gonna win your sled.

1211
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:34,613
Save-Away.

1212
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:37,283
Over here.
I saved you a seat. Play my hand.

1213
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:40,202
- Lindstrom's. How you doing?
- Aren't you gonna take those beards off?

1214
01:31:40,287 --> 01:31:43,873
No, I'm not gonna take these beards off.
This is my lucky beard. Mind my beard.

1215
01:31:43,957 --> 01:31:45,791
Watch out for this guy.
He's a fucking jinx.

1216
01:31:45,876 --> 01:31:48,919
Okay, Santa number three,
what can I get you?

1217
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:51,881
Could Fat Man With Flying Horse
get quarters, please?

1218
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,676
- Watch my bank.
- All right.

1219
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:58,470
Five. Nine.

1220
01:31:58,555 --> 01:32:02,016
No way. Pop, goddamn it,
you're hitting from my card. No.

1221
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,101
- You don't even know what it is.
- He doesn't hit.

1222
01:32:04,186 --> 01:32:06,729
Why don't you go find a chimney
somewhere and fall in, huh?

1223
01:32:06,813 --> 01:32:10,441
Son of a bitch! You are killing me here.

1224
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,234
That's the way it goes.

1225
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:15,529
- There's two more coming.
- There you go.

1226
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:18,407
That's what I like to see.
Now, that's the spirit.

1227
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:20,993
Jack, is there a union
for department store Santas?

1228
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:22,578
Hey, who the fuck knows?

1229
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:28,083
Then go get another table! For old people!
You're old! You're taking Santa's money!

1230
01:32:28,168 --> 01:32:30,753
- There is no other table.
- Then I'll open another table!

1231
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:33,923
What kind of a people cheat Santa Claus?

1232
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:35,883
- What the hell are you doing?
- For God's sake!

1233
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:39,011
- Security!
- That was Santa's money! You took it!

1234
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:41,472
- You're cheating me!
- Hey, pal! Come here, buddy!

1235
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:43,015
Lay down, pop. It's all right.

1236
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:44,350
- Come on!
- Stay down.

1237
01:32:44,434 --> 01:32:47,895
Santa Claus is kicking the shit
out of your guards.

1238
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:55,361
The security room-

1239
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:59,156
Right at the top of the stairs. Right, right.
Take a right. Security room.

1240
01:33:02,661 --> 01:33:03,661
Fuck.

1241
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:09,917
That fucking convict. Geez!

1242
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:12,962
Turn off the fucking alarm!

1243
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:16,632
What the heck?

1244
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:19,802
Get away from the desk!

1245
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:21,512
Drop 'em!

1246
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:23,347
Put the guns down!

1247
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:25,140
Drop 'em!

1248
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:31,939
Get down!

1249
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:36,485
Put the guns down! Put 'em down!

1250
01:33:39,406 --> 01:33:40,781
Christ!

1251
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:55,379
Here it is, motherfucker.

1252
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:12,187
I don't like you!

1253
01:34:14,441 --> 01:34:16,942
Your piss is all you need, Romeo.

1254
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:21,697
Get up! Get the fuck up! Everybody!

1255
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:23,490
It's the only time-

1256
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:26,618
Cuff 'em. Cuff 'em! Come on!

1257
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:28,412
Oh, no.

1258
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:30,956
Oh, no, listen, no.
No. Please don't do this here, okay?

1259
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:33,959
Please don't do this to me,
all right? Listen.

1260
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:36,670
Look, let me tell you something.

1261
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:40,716
This is just not
another card club, all right?

1262
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,718
This is the Tomahawk Casino.

1263
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:47,931
We're an international gaming destination.
We're in guidebooks.

1264
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:49,558
Show's over.

1265
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:56,857
Move, Goddamn you!

1266
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:58,442
These guys aren't fucking around.
Let's move.

1267
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:00,152
Get in there.

1268
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:05,908
Go ahead. Just do what my friends say.
They're a little bit...

1269
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:08,202
disturbed.

1270
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:24,510
What's the security code
for the count room!

1271
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:26,387
Code? What code? Just use the key!

1272
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:29,056
- Nick said code!
- Who the fuck is Nick? Who's Nick?

1273
01:35:44,948 --> 01:35:47,783
- Drop your guns!
- Throw your guns down! Show your hands!

1274
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:50,369
Drop that gun!

1275
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:52,746
- All right, all right, all right!
- Drop it now!

1276
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:56,417
You motherfucker!
No guns in the count room!

1277
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:58,919
- Fuck you!
- Put 'em up in the air!

1278
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:00,295
Fuck you!

1279
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:03,340
Shit!

1280
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:06,135
No guns in the count room!

1281
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:08,220
Forget about him and get the money!

1282
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:10,806
Forget about him
and get the fucking money!

1283
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:16,311
Forget about him.

1284
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:19,982
There's no future for people
like you and me, Nick.

1285
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:26,071
The places we come from—
bland towns, mill towns, small lives.

1286
01:36:26,156 --> 01:36:29,283
No future, just more of the same.

1287
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:31,785
You want a future,
you got to stand up and steal it.

1288
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:51,054
Oh, my God.

1289
01:36:52,724 --> 01:36:56,518
The powwow safe!
I want the powwow safe! Where is it?

1290
01:36:56,603 --> 01:36:59,188
I can't move back to Las Vegas.

1291
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:08,155
I do not give a shit about Vegas!

1292
01:37:08,865 --> 01:37:11,533
The money is in the car.
Let's get out of here right now.

1293
01:37:11,618 --> 01:37:13,118
- He won't tell us where it is.
- What?

1294
01:37:13,203 --> 01:37:14,536
The powwow safe.

1295
01:37:15,455 --> 01:37:18,999
Remember Nick Cassidy?
Security guard named Nick Cassidy?

1296
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:22,377
Yeah, Nick Cassidy. Where is he?

1297
01:37:22,462 --> 01:37:25,380
Gabriel, we have enough money.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1298
01:37:25,465 --> 01:37:26,965
Where is he?

1299
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:33,055
Not Nick Cassidy.

1300
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:37,893
Nick Cassidy worked for me two years ago.

1301
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:44,441
Cowboy.

1302
01:37:44,526 --> 01:37:45,526
Hopalong.

1303
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:53,909
That's the story of your life, Ash.
You fucked the wrong guy.

1304
01:37:58,206 --> 01:38:01,500
Rudy Duncan, honey.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?

1305
01:38:01,584 --> 01:38:04,211
- You fucking bastard!
- Hey, hey, hey.

1306
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:06,296
No! Goddamn it!

1307
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:08,382
You are lucky, convict.

1308
01:38:11,344 --> 01:38:14,471
You're gonna be spending Christmas
with the birthday boy himself.

1309
01:38:14,556 --> 01:38:16,890
Wait a minute.
There is a powwow safe, all right?

1310
01:38:16,975 --> 01:38:19,434
There is a powwow safe.
I did time with Nick Cassidy, right?

1311
01:38:19,519 --> 01:38:21,436
Some shit he told me.
Some shit I remember.

1312
01:38:21,521 --> 01:38:25,274
He told me the manager keeps a secret stash
in his office... a powwow safe.

1313
01:38:25,358 --> 01:38:27,776
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- No! There is no safe!

1314
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,987
- He's stalling us! There's no safe!
- He said it one time!

1315
01:38:30,071 --> 01:38:32,155
I overheard it. There is a powwow safe.

1316
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,116
He's been stalling us from day one.
There's no safe.

1317
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,202
- There's a powwow safe. I heard it.
- Then where the fuck is it?

1318
01:38:37,287 --> 01:38:38,829
Behind the liquor cabinet.

1319
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:46,795
Oh, Jesus.

1320
01:39:10,236 --> 01:39:11,820
Hey, hey.

1321
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:13,822
- Get up.
- Oh, please. Please.

1322
01:39:13,906 --> 01:39:15,991
- Get up. Open it.
- I can't go back to Vegas.

1323
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:19,536
I don't give a fuck about that!
Get up! Open it!

1324
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:21,330
Hurry up!

1325
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:25,417
Oh, God. I can't go back.

1326
01:39:32,759 --> 01:39:35,052
Pow... wow.

1327
01:39:35,136 --> 01:39:36,511
Powwow.

1328
01:39:56,074 --> 01:39:59,660
Hey, Santa Claus! Welcome to the Tomahawk!

1329
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:10,837
Oh, shit.

1330
01:40:20,139 --> 01:40:21,056
Yes!

1331
01:40:30,983 --> 01:40:32,526
Get up.

1332
01:40:44,122 --> 01:40:46,873
Yeah. Yeah.

1333
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:48,875
God is good.

1334
01:40:50,294 --> 01:40:51,294
Now...

1335
01:40:52,255 --> 01:40:53,839
what do you say...

1336
01:40:55,133 --> 01:40:56,383
to Santa's dwarves?

1337
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:01,930
You say, "Thank you."

1338
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:19,090
Never make the same mistake twice.

1339
01:42:20,885 --> 01:42:22,427
You just did.

1340
01:42:44,408 --> 01:42:46,201
The wrong guy.

1341
01:42:46,285 --> 01:42:50,622
We took the place down with the wrong guy.
Is this Christmas, huh?

1342
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:53,708
Is this Christmas?

1343
01:42:56,462 --> 01:42:58,380
God bless us, every one.

1344
01:43:38,129 --> 01:43:39,588
Come on.

1345
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:43,341
Smart, aren't you?

1346
01:43:43,426 --> 01:43:46,553
So smart. You're smarter
than everybody, huh?

1347
01:43:46,637 --> 01:43:48,179
Powwow safe.

1348
01:43:48,264 --> 01:43:51,641
A little gift for us in the powwow safe.
Well, I got a gift for you.

1349
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:55,103
From Pug and Merlin and Jumpy,
you son of a bitch.

1350
01:43:55,187 --> 01:43:56,980
You're going where they went.

1351
01:43:57,064 --> 01:44:00,692
And they're gonna find you there,
and they're gonna kick your fucking ass!

1352
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:03,028
You feel smart?
You think you're lucky?

1353
01:44:03,112 --> 01:44:05,363
Well, let's see how lucky you are!
Come on!

1354
01:44:05,448 --> 01:44:07,282
Here's how lucky you are.

1355
01:44:08,868 --> 01:44:11,870
You got out of the Tomahawk,
into your car...

1356
01:44:11,954 --> 01:44:15,373
made it halfway to Canada
until you caught some ice on the road.

1357
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:23,757
Get down there!

1358
01:44:23,841 --> 01:44:25,008
Take a look.

1359
01:44:26,469 --> 01:44:28,261
By the time you hit
the bottom down there...

1360
01:44:28,346 --> 01:44:30,472
the whole car was burning like a comet.

1361
01:44:30,556 --> 01:44:32,849
Must've burned up all that money too.

1362
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:37,312
Was it your idea, Monster, or was it hers?

1363
01:44:38,147 --> 01:44:42,734
Well, she told me about
the convict magazines.

1364
01:44:42,818 --> 01:44:45,820
Had to figure there'd be some guys
in the pen with some useful knowledge...

1365
01:44:45,905 --> 01:44:50,283
with nobody to talk to
and nobody to listen...

1366
01:44:50,368 --> 01:44:52,410
so...

1367
01:44:52,495 --> 01:44:54,496
we just stocked up on stationery.

1368
01:44:56,415 --> 01:44:59,000
It's a hard life being a trucker's girl.

1369
01:45:01,253 --> 01:45:03,922
Baby. Come here.

1370
01:45:11,555 --> 01:45:14,140
- I saved your life.
- You shouldn't have.

1371
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:16,309
He really loved you, you know that?

1372
01:45:16,394 --> 01:45:19,312
Nick. He really loved you.

1373
01:45:24,485 --> 01:45:26,194
Who wouldn't?

1374
01:45:29,365 --> 01:45:32,617
Maybe this is where
you wanted him, Ashley...

1375
01:45:32,702 --> 01:45:35,870
Some stranger at the bottom of a ravine
with a burned-up heart.

1376
01:45:35,955 --> 01:45:36,955
Maybe.

1377
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:39,082
But it didn't happen...

1378
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:40,834
because what you did for him...

1379
01:45:40,918 --> 01:45:43,003
- you made him the happiest he'd ever been.
- Shut up.

1380
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:45,046
Get up. Come on.

1381
01:45:45,131 --> 01:45:47,132
Get in the car.

1382
01:45:48,259 --> 01:45:49,843
Hey. Hey!

1383
01:45:49,927 --> 01:45:50,969
Gabriel.

1384
01:45:55,725 --> 01:45:58,059
Don't go getting all noble with me, Rudy.

1385
01:45:59,645 --> 01:46:02,355
Guy takes a shiv for you,
you go chasing his girlfriend?

1386
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:04,274
Don't talk to me about greed.

1387
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:06,234
What? What did you say?

1388
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:09,446
I said don't talk to me about greed.

1389
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:13,074
No, not about that—
about you said a guy takes a shiv for you.

1390
01:46:13,159 --> 01:46:16,244
I never said anything about a shiv.
How'd you know there was a shiv?

1391
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:18,747
You said it.
You said the real Nick died saving you.

1392
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:21,708
No, I didn't. I said he died.

1393
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:24,210
- I never said how.
- Yes, you did.

1394
01:46:24,295 --> 01:46:27,505
No. I never said how. I said he died.

1395
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:29,215
You said he was stabbed.

1396
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:32,510
I said he died. I never said how.

1397
01:46:32,595 --> 01:46:35,305
You said he was stabbed,
that he took a shiv—

1398
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:37,640
A knife, a shank, whatever.

1399
01:46:40,936 --> 01:46:41,936
Ash?

1400
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:43,897
How'd she know there was a shiv?

1401
01:46:46,692 --> 01:46:47,776
Ash?

1402
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:50,737
How'd she know?

1403
01:46:58,704 --> 01:47:00,705
Jesus Christ.

1404
01:47:01,457 --> 01:47:03,291
Men.

1405
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:06,062
Merry Christmas, Rudy.

1406
01:48:22,788 --> 01:48:24,289
We made it, baby.

1407
01:48:24,373 --> 01:48:27,375
Oh, yes, we did.

1408
01:48:27,459 --> 01:48:29,711
We made it.

1409
01:48:29,795 --> 01:48:32,338
Got a little messy, but...

1410
01:48:32,423 --> 01:48:35,300
I'll tell you all about that
once we're on the road.

1411
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:45,268
For your information...

1412
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,229
I never fuck the wrong guy.

1413
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:53,860
So, Rudy...

1414
01:48:53,944 --> 01:48:56,988
I want you to meet Millie Bobeck.

1415
01:48:57,072 --> 01:48:58,781
Remember Millie Bobeck, don't you?

1416
01:48:59,825 --> 01:49:01,576
My girlfriend before I went in.

1417
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:05,830
Worked at that bar in Motor City
where I manslaughtered what's-his-name.

1418
01:49:05,915 --> 01:49:07,624
See...

1419
01:49:08,709 --> 01:49:10,835
Millie here...

1420
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:14,047
she used to serve drinks
to these gun-running truckers.

1421
01:49:14,131 --> 01:49:16,758
Real big talkers...

1422
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:19,677
scheming about a real score one day.

1423
01:49:19,762 --> 01:49:22,555
Two years in the Mountain,
man, what the hell?

1424
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:25,183
Why not let her get friendly with 'em?

1425
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:27,769
Tell 'em her real name was Ashley.

1426
01:49:27,853 --> 01:49:29,979
Tell 'em about this idea she had...

1427
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:31,731
about writing guys in prison.

1428
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:34,525
Find a sucker who could
show them a sure thing.

1429
01:49:36,153 --> 01:49:37,654
You know...

1430
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:41,282
they would've never done it
without you, Nick.

1431
01:49:43,369 --> 01:49:45,453
I mean, Rudy.

1432
01:49:45,537 --> 01:49:49,040
I always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy.

1433
01:49:49,124 --> 01:49:51,417
Way back when I worked there.

1434
01:49:51,502 --> 01:49:54,337
What better way than to get
some guys to rob it for me?

1435
01:49:55,339 --> 01:49:57,590
Paid the Alamo a hundred
to put the shiv in me.

1436
01:49:57,675 --> 01:50:00,635
He's a lifer, man. What does he care?

1437
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:03,846
He was supposed to stab me
in the yard later that day...

1438
01:50:03,931 --> 01:50:06,474
but when that food fight started, man...

1439
01:50:06,558 --> 01:50:09,227
I couldn't believe it.

1440
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:13,314
The slash across the ribs,
the homemade blood capsule...

1441
01:50:14,316 --> 01:50:17,277
gets you a nice, warm hospital bed.

1442
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,738
Paid a guard to spread
the word I bought it.

1443
01:50:21,573 --> 01:50:24,909
And once the wound healed up...

1444
01:50:24,994 --> 01:50:27,412
got out of the Mountain this morning.

1445
01:50:27,496 --> 01:50:31,958
Tonight, I am a rich man.

1446
01:50:33,544 --> 01:50:35,461
Get in the car.

1447
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:43,678
Keep your gun on him, honey.

1448
01:50:45,806 --> 01:50:47,598
How'd you know I'd do it?

1449
01:50:47,683 --> 01:50:52,520
Because every time
I read her letters, Rudy...

1450
01:50:52,604 --> 01:50:54,564
you listened.

1451
01:50:55,691 --> 01:50:57,358
Besides, man...

1452
01:50:57,443 --> 01:50:59,485
even if you hadn't taken the bait...

1453
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:01,571
we'd have still had a shot.

1454
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:04,782
She'd have just had to convince them
they could do it alone.

1455
01:51:05,451 --> 01:51:08,286
What do you know?
Good old Rudy came through.

1456
01:51:08,954 --> 01:51:10,913
Good old predictable Rudy.

1457
01:51:10,998 --> 01:51:15,251
Goes for the easy money, every time.

1458
01:51:15,336 --> 01:51:18,296
Five Santas walked
into that Tomahawk, Rudy.

1459
01:51:19,214 --> 01:51:21,674
That's what the witnesses will say.

1460
01:51:21,759 --> 01:51:24,969
So, we gotta have five Santas
not walk out.

1461
01:51:26,638 --> 01:51:28,014
Gotta have five.

1462
01:51:29,308 --> 01:51:31,934
How many things could have gone wrong?
A thousand?

1463
01:51:32,019 --> 01:51:35,313
You think we don't know
what a long shot is?

1464
01:51:36,482 --> 01:51:39,108
My girl Millie was steering you, man.

1465
01:51:39,902 --> 01:51:42,153
You fucked it up,
she would've cut and run.

1466
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,656
They'd be looking for Ashley Mercer.

1467
01:51:46,492 --> 01:51:48,242
Whoever she is.

1468
01:51:51,914 --> 01:51:57,001
Six months of telling you
Tomahawk stories.

1469
01:51:57,086 --> 01:51:58,795
Guess now you know why.

1470
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:07,011
You gave them the confidence
to walk in there, Nick Cassidy.

1471
01:52:08,097 --> 01:52:10,139
That's all we needed you to do.

1472
01:52:10,224 --> 01:52:12,934
You said some nice things about me, man.

1473
01:52:13,018 --> 01:52:15,353
Appreciate it.

1474
01:52:15,437 --> 01:52:17,772
You know what? You're right.

1475
01:52:18,565 --> 01:52:20,066
I do love her.

1476
01:52:21,527 --> 01:52:22,860
And she-

1477
01:52:25,155 --> 01:52:27,156
she loves me.

1478
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:30,493
You had that part right all along.

1479
01:52:36,708 --> 01:52:38,626
It's Christmas, sugarplum.

1480
01:52:41,130 --> 01:52:43,172
Let's light up the tree.

1481
01:52:56,979 --> 01:53:00,481
Shit.

1482
01:53:03,193 --> 01:53:04,694
Write me.

1483
01:53:05,946 --> 01:53:09,532
Shit. It's like ridin' a bike.
Like ridin' a bike.

1484
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:13,494
Good-bye, Rudy, my man.

1485
01:53:13,579 --> 01:53:17,290
Nice spending... time with you!

1486
01:53:22,045 --> 01:53:25,006
Rule one- never put a car thief
behind the wheel!

1487
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:40,813
No!

1488
01:54:04,463 --> 01:54:07,715
Five Santas walked
into that Tomahawk, Rudy.

1489
01:54:08,592 --> 01:54:10,384
That's what the witnesses will say.

1490
01:54:10,469 --> 01:54:14,388
So, we gotta have five Santas
not walk out.

1491
01:54:15,974 --> 01:54:17,725
Gotta have five.

1492
01:54:36,578 --> 01:54:37,995
Rudy.

1493
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:41,582
Rudy, you and me, man. You and me.

1494
01:54:44,211 --> 01:54:46,587
We can split the money, huh?

1495
01:54:47,422 --> 01:54:49,257
Rudy, that whore, Millie Bobeck?

1496
01:54:49,341 --> 01:54:51,342
You think I was serious about her, man?

1497
01:54:51,426 --> 01:54:53,594
I was gonna kill her!

1498
01:54:55,055 --> 01:54:57,014
You gotta believe me.

1499
01:54:57,099 --> 01:54:58,975
You gotta believe me, I swear it.

1500
01:54:59,059 --> 01:55:01,060
- Believe me!
- Believe this.

1501
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:05,273
Rudy! Rudy, help me!

1502
01:55:05,357 --> 01:55:06,941
Rudy!

1503
01:57:25,038 --> 01:57:28,749
All I wanna do
is make it back to Sidnaw...

1504
01:57:28,834 --> 01:57:31,335
sit down for Christmas dinner...

1505
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:33,879
watch some ball with my old man...

1506
01:57:33,964 --> 01:57:36,006
sleep in my old bed...

1507
01:57:36,091 --> 01:57:39,635
have leftovers for about six months...

1508
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:42,012
eat some of that Christmas turkey.

1509
01:57:57,404 --> 01:58:02,074
Like I said, I never was
much for the holidays...

1510
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:03,826
until now.
