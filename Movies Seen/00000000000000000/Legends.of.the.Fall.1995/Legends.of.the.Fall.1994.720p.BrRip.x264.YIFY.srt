1
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,869
Some people hear their own
inner voices

2
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,677
with great clearness

3
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,981
and they live
by what they hear

4
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,147
Such people become crazy

5
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,487
or they become legend

6
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:10,630
Tristan Ludlow was born
in the Moon of the Falling Leaves

7
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,229
It was a terrible winter

8
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:18,301
His mother almost died
bringing him into this world

9
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:26,017
His father, the Colonel,
brought him to me

10
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:31,251
I wrapped him in a bearskin
and held him all that night

11
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,695
As he grew into a man

12
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:39,199
I taught him the great joy
of the kill

13
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,030
when the hunter
cuts out its warm heart

14
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,094
and holds it in his hands

15
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,164
setting its spirit free

16
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,701
Colonel Ludlow had three sons

17
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,341
but Tristan was his favorite

18
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:58,442
I had had sons too

19
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:02,255
But they were gone now

20
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,756
forever

21
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,220
It was a very bad time

22
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:08,495
The Colonel had tried
to help the People

23
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,658
The Colonel had tried
to help the People

24
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,368
but it was no use

25
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:21,101
So he decided
to go his own way

26
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:27,708
He wanted to lose the madness
over the mountains, he said

27
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,874
and begin again

28
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,459
"Lose the madness, '"he said

29
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,325
And so we lived for many years

30
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,262
and the boys grew strong

31
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:58,273
Alfred was the older brother

32
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,404
old even for his years

33
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,918
Samuel was the youngest

34
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:08,318
There was nothing these brothers
would not do for him

35
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,823
They watched over him
like a treasure

36
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,026
One year...

37
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:17,757
I am an old man
and cannot remember the year

38
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,823
But it was the Moon
of the Red Grass

39
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,597
when Isabel Ludlow,
their mother

40
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,831
went away for the winter

41
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:29,865
She said the winters
were too cruel for her

42
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,776
She said she was afraid
of the bears

43
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,279
She was a strange woman anyway

44
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,931
That spring, though,
she did not return

45
00:03:55,536 --> 00:04:00,132
And, after that,
she did not come much to see us

46
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,310
Alfred wrote her many letters

47
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:07,814
but Tristan refused
to speak of her

48
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:11,214
His world was here with me

49
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:18,716
Every warrior hopes a good death
will find him

50
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,817
but Tristan couldn't wait

51
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,155
He went looking for his

52
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,269
Tristan!

53
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,778
Here

54
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,552
- Was it a bear?
- Yes, sir

55
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:52,610
- Was it a bear?
- Yes, sir

56
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,176
- Can you breathe?
- Yes

57
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:56,347
Take your hand away
Take it away

58
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,120
You're a stupid,
half-brained jackass

59
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,755
- Yes, sir
- One Stab put you up to this?

60
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,730
You deserve to be dead

61
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,895
God knows how you've
lived so long

62
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,905
It'll be all right, son

63
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,785
I have these letters

64
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,853
many letters

65
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,331
Read them

66
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,334
They are from all of them

67
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,134
Ludlow

68
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,934
Isabel

69
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,872
Samuel

70
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,603
the whole family

71
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,441
the whole story

72
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,607
It is all written here

73
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,012
April 13, 1913

74
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,885
Dear Isabel:

75
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,915
I am not fool enough to try
to reorder a life already lived

76
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:11,431
but I fear I have not done well raising
our sons alone in this wild place

77
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,968
What did I know of children?

78
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,629
I was trained to lead men

79
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,934
This is infinitely harder

80
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,441
Dear William:

81
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,240
You take too much responsibility
on yourself, as always

82
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,941
Our sons are finding their own paths

83
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:32,281
They are willful, certainly,
but then

84
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:35,515
who are you and I
to complain of willfulness?

85
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,023
As for Samuel,
I have big news

86
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,025
At a Harvard tea
for Amy Lowell

87
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:43,995
he met and instantly loved
Miss Susannah Finncannon

88
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,862
I know it will
surprise you greatly

89
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,697
but they are engaged

90
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,433
He will bring her to Montana
this summer to meet his brothers

91
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:54,940
and you

92
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,772
So, William,
please behave yourself

93
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,905
and be as charming
as only you can be

94
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,585
There he is

95
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,117
- How the hell are you?
- Good And you?

96
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,487
- Samuel Good to see you, boy
- Father, how are you?

97
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,089
- Good to see you
- Hello

98
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,763
This is my fiancée, Susannah

99
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,139
- Hello
- Miss Finncannon

100
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,611
- Nice to meet you
- It's an honor

101
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,276
- This is Alfred
- How do you do?

102
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,321
- Here's your dog, miss
- Thank you

103
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,257
- It's a horse
- That's a strange-looking animal

104
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,295
This is Finn
He's a champion

105
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,456
You like exotic-looking dogs then,
Miss Finncannon?

106
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,432
Very much, Mr. Ludlow

107
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,432
- Please call me Susannah
- All right

108
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,996
- He's just plain old Alfred
- Shut up

109
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:06,368
- Where's Tristan?
- He's off somewhere You know him

110
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,973
He'll welcome you home tonight
or I'll know the reason why

111
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,515
Miss Finncannon, please
Did you have a good journey?

112
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,991
She is such a lovely creature

113
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,963
But I fear the loss
of her parents

114
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,831
has given her
a certain fragility

115
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,837
I think she feels very alone
in the world

116
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:36,340
But she has found a new family now,
hasn't she?

117
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,276
The German military is ready
to use chaos in Croatia

118
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:43,510
as a justification for actions that could
plunge the entire civilized world into...

119
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,451
The word "civilized" has no place
in discussing the affairs of this world

120
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:52,692
Mother told us of your sympathy
for the social reformers

121
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,554
You make it sound like a disease

122
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,359
No, I'm in agreement

123
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,958
You mother told me all about One Stab
She says he was a great warrior

124
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,502
Yes

125
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,061
He has a bag of scalps
to prove it

126
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,265
But don't worry

127
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,276
He's devoted to Father now

128
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,073
Rather, they're devoted
to each other

129
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,841
Can he speak English?

130
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,383
Stab, speak English?

131
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,886
He wouldn't lower himself
to speak English

132
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,725
But watch out because
he understands it perfectly well

133
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,495
There's Tristan

134
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,577
- Don't they feed you?
- Not much

135
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,421
- You smell
- Miss me, did you?

136
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,428
- Still hung over?
- Still drunk

137
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,225
Isn't she amazing?

138
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,168
So this is Tristan

139
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,433
And does he speak English?

140
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,113
For God's sake

141
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,118
Miss Finncannon,
it's a pleasure to meet you

142
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,961
I hope you and Ugly here

143
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,830
find every happiness together

144
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,942
Don't mind my brother Your dog
has more breeding than he has

145
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,665
This is Mother's room

146
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,169
It's lovely

147
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,070
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Pet
- And you, miss

148
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:25,577
Thank you

149
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,652
- Which one?
- It's this one

150
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,563
Angelica Susannah

151
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,593
Hello

152
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,362
You must be Isabel Two

153
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,302
I've already met your mother
and father

154
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,805
- How old are you?
- Thirteen

155
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:38,143
When I was 13,
I was sent away

156
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,243
to boarding school

157
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,620
I hated it

158
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,120
May I help you?

159
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,620
You're going to marry Samuel

160
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,325
That's right, I am

161
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,391
I'm going to marry Tristan

162
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,804
We'll be sisters

163
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,674
I see you two have met

164
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:06,473
Isabel Two is letting me help

165
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,449
Would you like a rest?
You must be exhausted

166
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,985
No, not at all
This is so refreshing

167
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:16,989
all this grandeur,
this unexpected

168
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,321
gift from God

169
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:23,692
It doesn't seem like much of a gift
in a hard winter, I assure you

170
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,189
Where's Samuel?

171
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:29,599
Inside I could tell your father
wanted him all to himself

172
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:34,604
- You're very generous
- No, just happy

173
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,771
Stop mooning over her
and come in here

174
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:44,544
Samuel wants to know
about those calves from Cheyenne

175
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,107
Get in here

176
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,484
Please excuse my father

177
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:55,187
It makes him feel young and powerful
to treat us like we're idiot children

178
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:04,900
For all His countless blessings,
may God's holy name be praised Amen

179
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:11,475
Tell Father what you were saying
about Vienna

180
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,705
- What's that?
- It's the Kaiser

181
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,473
He won't stop them
from annihilating Serbia

182
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,575
Let's not talk about war, please

183
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,818
Susannah hears
that England's mobilizing

184
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,586
We're stuck out here
while all this is going on

185
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:30,390
- Thank God
- You wouldn't want us to evade a duty

186
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:33,432
- Wouldn't I?
- Father, with respect...

187
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,896
Please excuse me
for being late

188
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,030
I packed so carefully,
I couldn't find anything

189
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,208
Thank you

190
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,949
Would you like some...

191
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:04,085
As evening fell
a maiden stood

192
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:07,725
At the edge of a wood

193
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,167
In her hands lay the reins

194
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:14,468
Of a stallion

195
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,133
And n'er I'd seen

196
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,109
A girl as fair

197
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:21,409
Heard a gentler voice anywhere

198
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,210
Whispered, alas

199
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,841
She belonged

200
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:27,478
Belonged to another

201
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:31,081
Another, forever

202
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,289
Yes, she belonged to

203
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,727
The twilight and mist

204
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,692
Dear Isabel:

205
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,637
How strange to have a cultivated woman
in the house again

206
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,867
and how intoxicating

207
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:52,400
To have all three of my sons
under my roof again

208
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,811
fills me with such a deep,
quiet satisfaction

209
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,180
that I thank God

210
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,103
There's a friend of yours

211
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,948
A dollar says
he brings her back

212
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,227
Whoa

213
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,528
Easy

214
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,322
You got it

215
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:33,837
Nice work

216
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,904
You guys look
like ice cream cones

217
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,504
I know you would have

218
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,482
Ready Here we go

219
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,957
Go easy on him, Susannah

220
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,792
Alfred, you take over

221
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,127
I must talk to Tristan

222
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,963
You've disgraced the Colonel's name

223
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,996
- Nice shiner
- I hit her back

224
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:16,416
She's got me spinning

225
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,348
She's got me spinning

226
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,078
I'll bet

227
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:23,020
She's got these ideas
and theories, and she's so...

228
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,625
What?

229
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,493
Nothing
How'd you break the mare?

230
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,532
She's what?

231
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,966
She's sort of passionate

232
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,200
- She a virgin?
- Good Lord, Tristan

233
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,334
- You brought it up
- Of course she is

234
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,037
Are you?

235
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,782
- Yes, I am
- Going to wait till you're married?

236
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,988
See, she says...

237
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,082
Susannah thinks that...

238
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,486
We're not gonna wait

239
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:08,261
And you're afraid
you won't meet her expectations?

240
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,464
I guess I am

241
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:15,337
Sort of I don't know
Should I be?

242
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:17,569
Samuel, God bless you

243
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,578
You are good
at everything you try

244
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,341
I'm sure it will be the same
with fucking

245
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,280
Tristan, really

246
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,183
- She's my future wife
- You're not going to fuck her?

247
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,781
I'm planning to be with her

248
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,554
I recommend fucking

249
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,755
- You're impossible
- You brought it up

250
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,206
My point!

251
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,265
Good morning,
Colonel Ludlow

252
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,927
Tristan's hunting
He didn't do it

253
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,665
You don't have to worry
about Tristan

254
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:23,573
Meet John T and James O'Banion
They own the mercantile store

255
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:28,137
- Morning, James, John T, Sheriff
- Morning, Alfred

256
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:32,913
We're looking for a man we heard
might be in this part of the country

257
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:35,783
Name is Tom Cullen
Here's a likeness

258
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,624
What did this fella do?

259
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,285
Do you recognize him?

260
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,756
- Yeah, I recognize him
- We got him

261
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,925
This fellow passed by here

262
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,094
maybe four or five years ago

263
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:55,004
Did some work here
on his way to San Francisco

264
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:57,269
He was hoping to book passage
to Australia

265
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,874
Or Hong Kong
I can't remember

266
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,381
- Can you remember?
- Hong Kong

267
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,682
- What is he wanted for?
- He...

268
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,849
That would be
of a private nature

269
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:16,622
"Private nature"?
It's a public office you hold, Sheriff

270
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,627
Gentlemen

271
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:35,203
"There came a low hiss,
a horrid sound

272
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:38,011
that made Rikki Tikki Tavi
jump back two clear feet

273
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,018
And then out of the grass

274
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,021
rose up the head
and spread hood of Nag

275
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,080
the big black cobra"

276
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,749
I can read another story

277
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:49,727
The Germans broke through
at Armentieres

278
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:53,356
The British are trapped
in the Belgian lowlands

279
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,333
- This paper is a week old!
- Calm down

280
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:58,370
With my fluent German,
I could become an officer

281
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,031
And lead other boys to the slaughter
and be slaughtered yourself

282
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,166
The men who served under you
worshipped you

283
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,005
They were all damn fools

284
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,409
This is a turning point
in history

285
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,913
- How can we...
- What?

286
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,846
You can't expect us not to
be part of this

287
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,714
- You taught us...
- To think for yourselves

288
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,584
- And to defend what's ours
- Yes, what is ours!

289
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:19,124
We've already lost two cousins

290
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,718
Who we've never met! Don't talk at me
as though I've never seen a war!

291
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:27,965
Not a war like this

292
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:32,630
They said that about the War
of Secession and the Indian wars

293
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,902
They say it to sell newspapers

294
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:39,240
These are not the Indian wars
We're fighting against naked aggression!

295
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,075
There will be no more talk of wars
in this house! Damn it!

296
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,750
I'm sorry, Susannah

297
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:52,457
I'm going to Canada to enlist

298
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,654
I'm going with him

299
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,102
I'm sorry, my love

300
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,204
I meant to speak to you tonight

301
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:18,614
I know you'll understand
It's the only honorable thing to do

302
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:32,096
What's that?

303
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,598
It's a book my father wrote

304
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:40,361
to try to convince the government
to alter their policies

305
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,669
towards the Indians
in the Dakotas

306
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,173
Samuel won't change his mind

307
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,680
Change it for him

308
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,059
What happened between them?

309
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,829
Father says
she never liked it here

310
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:10,561
I think they loved mostly the idea
of each other

311
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,214
Don't let him go

312
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:29,210
I'll take care of him

313
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:32,849
October 14, 1914

314
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,681
My dear Isabel:

315
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,221
Today our sons are leaving home

316
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:40,918
to defend an England
they have never seen

317
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,757
I am unable to stop them

318
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:54,503
I have tried to shelter our sons
from all the madness

319
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:57,633
and now they go to seek it

320
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,729
Be careful

321
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,812
You don't have to go

322
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:07,170
Good-bye

323
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,101
Don't worry, Father

324
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,609
Take care

325
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:22,744
I'll bring you
the Kaiser's helmet

326
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,790
Bring yourself back
That would please me more

327
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,825
Yes, sir

328
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:49,706
- Take care of Samuel
- I will

329
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,904
Colonel Ludlow told me:

330
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:51,875
"Ride with them to Calgary

331
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:54,674
Bring back the horses '"

332
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,408
"Damn fools, '"he called them

333
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:03,251
The Colonel
would not have his sons

334
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:06,450
ride off to war
on old nags

335
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:09,085
damn fools or not

336
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,844
Let's join them

337
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,847
Bring your plate

338
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,353
He'll be back

339
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,686
May we join you?
Sit down

340
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,023
Feeling lonely in there

341
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,528
Sit here

342
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:48,733
What's her name, Two?

343
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,860
Lady Tristan's Lady

344
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:54,804
In the story,
Tristan's lady was Isolde

345
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:57,637
- Do you know who Isolde was?
- No

346
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,580
Your daughter needs an education

347
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:07,711
She can read and write, Colonel
School might be awkward for her

348
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:11,415
- I'll teach her myself
- May I help?

349
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,893
Yeah I'll teach her
history and mathematics

350
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:20,660
With your permission, Decker,
and yours, Pet

351
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:21,960
What do you think?

352
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,771
What will she do
with all this education?

353
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,970
She'll live a richer,
fuller life, of course

354
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,239
She's a half-breed

355
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:39,079
Not in this house

356
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:42,484
- Tristan calls me a half-breed
- Tristan calls you a half-breed?

357
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:44,988
He says I'm half gopher
and half hawk

358
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:55,363
- After her chores
- Yeah

359
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:57,368
- To us all
- To you, sir

360
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:00,428
- And miss
- And to the boys

361
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:03,869
And the boys

362
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:31,127
Get back to your unit

363
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:33,296
Those boys are boring

364
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:35,602
I'd rather have you
watching my back

365
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,978
Now, mate

366
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:05,836
February 3, 1915

367
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,497
Dear Susannah:

368
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,337
The horror of this place
is indescribable

369
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:16,108
Nothing is
as I thought it would be

370
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:19,173
Keep your distance!
Keep your spacing!

371
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:22,414
Tonight, as I prayed for the souls
of those who've died so terribly

372
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,182
yet so bravely

373
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:27,248
I admit that I also prayed
for personal glory

374
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:30,921
Is that wrong to want
to distinguish myself gloriously

375
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,226
in combat as my father did?

376
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:36,290
Tristan and Alfred
watch over me so carefully

377
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:38,097
I may never get the opportunity

378
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:48,339
Charge!

379
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,575
Alfred! Are you all right?

380
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,122
Goddamn it!

381
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:08,132
- Are you hit?
- It's just a scratch

382
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,170
Susannah, I see now

383
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,732
not that my father was right,
but that I was naive

384
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,779
- Let me up, damn it!
- Stay down!

385
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,475
Fall back!

386
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,710
Still, we place our bodies
in God's keeping

387
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,253
We go into battle honorably

388
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:30,811
full of confidence

389
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,720
with His name on our lips

390
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:35,282
- We're pinned here
- We'll wait

391
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,103
- Give him a hand
- Help him down

392
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:25,799
Goddamn

393
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:35,649
Susannah:
I try to guard against despair

394
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,589
but there are moments when it seems
that all human decency is broken down

395
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,820
Alfred will recover
from his wounds

396
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:46,489
but he and Tristan seem
to have drifted apart, or worse

397
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:49,159
I cannot understand it

398
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:51,498
I miss you more
than you can imagine

399
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:56,264
You are all that is clean
and cool and pure

400
00:37:57,576 --> 00:38:00,170
I close my eyes
and fix my thoughts on you

401
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:05,012
I now regret that we listened
to everyone and agreed to wait to marry

402
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:08,018
Even more, I regret that I left
before we could be together

403
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,213
as we planned, my beloved

404
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:15,522
Please stay on at the ranch
and wait for me

405
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:17,858
Don't let Father worry

406
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:21,531
I know God's mercy
will protect me

407
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,158
aided considerably
by Tristan

408
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:25,533
who seems to be in France
less to fight the Germans

409
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,697
than to act
as a nursemaid to me

410
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:32,270
Be well, my love

411
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:34,369
Your own, Samuel

412
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,878
Captain needs me to translate
this before tonight's reconnaissance

413
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,817
- Alfred will want to see you
- I'll be there

414
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:43,980
- Yeah?
- Go on

415
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,604
Where's Samuel?

416
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,773
He's translating
He'll be here

417
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,113
Boy, that's a good one

418
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,652
- Vino?
- Put that away

419
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,790
- They said you'll get a medal
- Yes

420
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:27,457
- They're sending me home
- I'm glad for you

421
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,762
I'm an officer
I belong with my men

422
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,165
Horseshit

423
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:33,966
What's left of them

424
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,974
MacKenzie was just brought in
His leg's turned bad

425
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,744
- He said...
- What?

426
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:40,267
- He said...
- What?

427
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,036
What is it?

428
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:46,777
He said your brother volunteered
to take his place

429
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,819
on the reconnaissance
with the Capitan

430
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:52,050
Goddamn it!
I told you to stay with him!

431
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:46,291
- I'm here!
- Where? I can't see

432
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,960
I can't move!

433
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,833
I'm coming!

434
00:43:20,732 --> 00:43:23,599
I got you now

435
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:27,862
I got you
You're doing good

436
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,707
We're going home

437
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:06,074
God, no!

438
00:44:49,087 --> 00:44:52,284
Goddamn you, God!

439
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:02,077
Tristan, it's me

440
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:11,086
March 20, 1915

441
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,596
Dear Father and Susannah:

442
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:18,260
I am being discharged from the Army,
but I cannot come home yet

443
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,930
I will write to Grandfather Ludlow
in Cornwall

444
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,235
and ask him to let me join him
and go to sea

445
00:47:24,742 --> 00:47:27,438
As for our beloved Samuel

446
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,980
all I can send home
is his heart

447
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:31,982
Alfred will bring it back

448
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:37,283
He should be buried
up in the box canyon

449
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,619
where he used
to draw the birds

450
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,592
Your son, Tristan

451
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,080
He certainly was the best
of all of us, wasn't he?

452
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,310
He certainly was the best
of all of us, wasn't he?

453
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:11,954
Good night

454
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,229
What you saw
before Samuel left...

455
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,169
Please, don't...

456
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,179
No, I want to

457
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,380
It is Samuel I loved

458
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,816
All right

459
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:56,829
Tristan will be back someday

460
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,261
Your father will be pleased

461
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:13,042
Susannah was to return to Boston
on the morning train

462
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:15,551
but a norther blew
for three days

463
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,713
and drifted over the tracks

464
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:23,226
The Colonel insisted
she stay on until spring

465
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:27,958
The house was too empty,
he said

466
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:31,559
This was still her home,
he told her

467
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:37,073
He should have let her go

468
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:40,941
But how could he have known
what would happen?

469
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,478
She was not to blame

470
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:52,421
She was like the water
that freezes in the rock

471
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,754
and splits it apart

472
00:49:56,494 --> 00:50:00,897
It was no more her fault
than it is the fault of the water

473
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:03,593
when the rock shatters

474
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,446
You know how much l...

475
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,782
You know how much
I loved Samuel

476
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:24,480
And I think you know...

477
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:36,128
Out of respect for him,
I wanted to say it in this place

478
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,964
I think you know that

479
00:50:41,906 --> 00:50:43,339
I'm in love with you

480
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,979
From the first moment
I saw you

481
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,139
like in a novel

482
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:02,883
That's my mother's overblown
romantic imagination coming out in me

483
00:51:10,635 --> 00:51:13,661
You're not making this
very easy for me

484
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,566
Sorry

485
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,901
Is there any hope
that you could learn to love me?

486
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:26,681
Not the way you love Samuel,
of course

487
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:30,687
but enough to...

488
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,688
We could make a life together

489
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,361
A happy life

490
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,762
I don't think so

491
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:54,005
Sounds like you're not sure, though
Maybe there's a chance?

492
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:05,214
- What?
- I can only cause you pain, Alfred

493
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,185
Why don't you let me
be the judge of that?

494
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:22,905
I didn't break it,
but I can fix it

495
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,409
I can put the damn wheel back on
and take it off myself

496
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,411
Go take a nap

497
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,118
- What?
- Look!

498
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,638
I'm going into town if...

499
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,586
Welcome home, son

500
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,421
I couldn't save him

501
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,931
Of course you couldn't

502
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,777
It's all right

503
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,309
Have a nice ride today?

504
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,323
Excuse me, Father

505
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:57,004
Tristan, please

506
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:06,407
When are you planning
to be married?

507
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,246
Good morning

508
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,215
Damn you

509
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:17,726
You will marry her

510
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:21,756
- Make an honest woman of her?
- Yes!

511
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:26,094
God damn you to hell

512
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,397
Yes, I will marry her,
if she'll have me

513
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:32,465
If she'll have you?

514
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,447
Do you love her?

515
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:43,847
Or did you seduce her
just to spite me?

516
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:45,582
That's not what I did

517
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,023
- What about Samuel?
- What?

518
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:51,823
You tell me about Samuel

519
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,955
We all loved Samuel
Samuel is dead What?

520
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,659
How convenient for you

521
00:58:58,335 --> 00:59:01,327
Because you love her,
I will forgive you for that

522
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:04,602
Once You say that again,
and we're not brothers

523
00:59:08,078 --> 00:59:10,103
Once!

524
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:16,611
You know you can't make her happy

525
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:18,552
I'm gonna try

526
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,650
You will fail

527
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,008
I'll be leaving today

528
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:52,051
I wish you both all the best

529
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:02,729
- Good-bye, son
- Wish me luck

530
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,233
Good luck

531
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,723
September 7, 1915

532
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:37,733
Dearest Mother:

533
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:42,397
I think I may have found
my place in this world

534
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:46,909
Helena is a city
turned modern overnight

535
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:50,037
bursting with all the energy
and vitality

536
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:52,081
of our times

537
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,549
I feel alive here

538
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,726
There is much opportunity
for anyone

539
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:07,764
willing to dedicate himself
to his labors

540
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:12,097
Already, I have acquired a reputation
for honesty and fair dealing

541
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:17,573
and I am pleased to call some of
Helena's most influential citizens

542
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:19,609
my friends

543
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:23,772
They are determined to see
this city grow, as am I

544
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,315
We're proud of you

545
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:31,788
Mother, thank you
for your kind letter

546
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,447
You knew my hopes

547
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:38,119
That you understand my disappointment
is a great comfort to me

548
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:43,462
Every night I pray for the grace
to forgive Tristan

549
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,468
I know you understand

550
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,970
Your loving son, Alfred

551
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:46,964
Quit it!

552
01:02:46,964 --> 01:02:48,022
Quit it!

553
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:05,714
Goddamn it!

554
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:46,748
If we have a boy,
I'd like to call him Samuel

555
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,755
And if it's a girl, Isabel

556
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,594
I'll still love you

557
01:03:56,666 --> 01:04:00,261
You'll tolerate me
because of how much I love you

558
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,784
Nothing

559
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:32,130
I heard from your mother

560
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:36,366
She says Alfred has hooked up
with those damn O'Banion brothers

561
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:42,276
- He's doing well
- Alfred's gonna do well wherever he is

562
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:45,872
- Except here with us
- That's my fault

563
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:49,680
- I didn't say that
- Couldn't save Samuel either, could I?

564
01:04:49,753 --> 01:04:52,847
Don't you dare say that
That was in God's hands

565
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,483
Was it?

566
01:04:58,562 --> 01:05:02,328
Colonel! Lost a couple calves
near Camas Canyon

567
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:04,833
- Might be a grizzly
- My grizzly?

568
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:23,511
- You take him, Tristan
- Damn right I will

569
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:47,899
I don't know why Tristan
did not kill that damn old bear

570
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,268
The Old Ones say:

571
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:52,406
"When a man and an animal

572
01:05:52,482 --> 01:05:54,575
have spilled each other's blood

573
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:56,881
they become one '"

574
01:05:58,455 --> 01:05:58,655
I said four beers,
Mr. Sachtleben

575
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:01,249
I said four beers,
Mr. Sachtleben

576
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:03,224
And I said no Indians

577
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:10,122
- He's quite civilized, I assure you
- Yeah?

578
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,065
- Give him a beer
- Stay out of it

579
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,797
- My father said four
- He heard me

580
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:16,862
We're about to reach an understanding

581
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:19,067
Just give him a goddamn beer!

582
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:21,906
Stay out of it!

583
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,913
Damn you
You're a damn fool

584
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,779
You're spoiling for a fight
with a man who outweighs you

585
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:31,150
As we speak, he's searching
for some kind of a weapon

586
01:06:31,221 --> 01:06:32,745
Isn't that right?

587
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:36,087
To split your stupid skull
and kill you and good riddance

588
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,592
Leave it!

589
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:42,223
- Yes, sir?
- I want four beers, now

590
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:48,335
The lousy owner says
he doesn't want to serve Indians

591
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:54,339
Get back

592
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:57,606
Do you see this man?

593
01:06:57,681 --> 01:07:01,947
Do you?
His name is One Stab

594
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:06,148
He's a venerated elder of the Cree and has
counted coup on hundreds of his enemies

595
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:09,249
He is our friend
He's thirsty

596
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:41,490
I think it was the bear's voice
he heard deep inside him

597
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:45,551
growling low
of dark, secret places

598
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,435
Were you going to say good-bye?

599
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:46,611
How long will you be gone?

600
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,744
Not long
A few months

601
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:59,120
I can make it better for you

602
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,363
If we'd had a child

603
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,108
or if I were pregnant,
would you still go?

604
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,479
Yes

605
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,484
Just give me a chance

606
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:24,986
Don't do that

607
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:33,695
Look at me

608
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,832
Please, look at me

609
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,684
I'll wait for you

610
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,411
However long it takes

611
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:07,225
I'll wait for you forever

612
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,050
Will he come back?

613
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,916
I don't know I don't know

614
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,860
Stab says yes

615
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,467
April 20, 1918

616
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:24,598
Dear Tristan:

617
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:27,768
It has been months now,
and still no word

618
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,442
The only sign
that you are alive

619
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:36,281
is a tattered parcel that arrived today
from New Guinea

620
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,944
covered with strange writing

621
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:41,616
and containing what appears to be
a native bracelet

622
01:12:43,059 --> 01:12:45,459
Meant for me, I presume

623
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:47,519
But perhaps not

624
01:12:48,932 --> 01:12:52,459
Do you still care to know
what is happening here?

625
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:55,299
Cattle prices continue to fall

626
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,635
and winter seems never ending

627
01:13:01,277 --> 01:13:03,211
Why don't you write?

628
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:07,977
Are you never coming back
and afraid to tell me?

629
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:14,780
Alfred continues to do well

630
01:13:16,626 --> 01:13:20,528
His business has expanded to include
financial concerns in Chicago

631
01:13:20,597 --> 01:13:21,962
and Washington

632
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:23,965
I don't pretend to understand

633
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:27,196
He wants us to send Isabel Two
to boarding school in Chicago

634
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:29,830
but she adamantly refuses
to leave the ranch

635
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:32,807
I think she, too,
is waiting for you

636
01:13:34,043 --> 01:13:37,069
I have nowhere
to send this letter

637
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:41,175
and no reason to believe
you wish to receive it

638
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:50,684
I write it only for myself

639
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:57,191
I will hide it away with all the things
left unsaid and undone

640
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,097
between us

641
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:09,840
December 12, 1919

642
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:11,777
Dear Susannah:

643
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:15,747
I have become a hunter

644
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:25,053
Tell Stab there are creatures here
that cannot even be found in books

645
01:14:28,698 --> 01:14:31,292
I have killed them all

646
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,082
All we had is dead

647
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:56,750
As I am dead

648
01:14:58,194 --> 01:14:59,821
Marry another

649
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:17,775
Colonel, it looks like
we've got company

650
01:15:38,601 --> 01:15:41,866
- I have come to ask for your blessing
- My blessing?

651
01:15:41,938 --> 01:15:44,304
You see, these gentlemen and...

652
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:47,137
And a great many others,
I might add

653
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:50,304
They're urging me
to run for office

654
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:53,007
- What office?
- The United States Congress

655
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:55,482
That's how highly
we think of your son

656
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:06,353
And what do you gentlemen
hope to get out of this?

657
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:11,063
I beg your pardon?

658
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:14,626
I've spoken plain English, sir
What do you want for yourselves?

659
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,369
Father, I don't think
that these gentlemen...

660
01:16:18,441 --> 01:16:21,467
Didn't you ask that question
or do you believe these gentlemen

661
01:16:21,544 --> 01:16:24,741
back you out of patriotic duty
and your inestimable worth?

662
01:16:24,814 --> 01:16:27,874
You forget yourself, Father
I am no longer a child

663
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:30,043
Colonel, the Congress...

664
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:33,316
Congress is government, sir
I worked for the government once

665
01:16:33,389 --> 01:16:34,822
The issues that we...

666
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:39,191
Indians! Indians were
the issue in those days

667
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,689
There is nothing so grotesque

668
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:45,359
as the meeting of a child
with a bullet

669
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,369
or an entire village slaughtered
while sleeping

670
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:51,565
That was the government's resolution
of that particular issue

671
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:55,008
I've seen nothing since then
to persuade me it's gained

672
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:57,545
in wisdom, common sense
or humanity

673
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:05,550
Gentlemen, my father, for whom
I have the deepest respect

674
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:10,718
says that the government
has neither wisdom nor humanity

675
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:15,253
I will then consider it
my absolute duty as my father's son

676
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:20,564
to bring both wisdom and humanity
to the United States Congress

677
01:17:22,538 --> 01:17:26,235
I thank you for your blessing
Gentlemen

678
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:43,925
- Gentlemen, wait for me in the cars
- Yes Certainly

679
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:00,976
Are you all right?
What's wrong?

680
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:24,027
I don't know what to say
Tristan's always been wild

681
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:29,471
- You love him for that
- Do I?

682
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:34,934
I suppose I do

683
01:18:36,746 --> 01:18:38,441
He does love you

684
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,154
She's to be your brother's wife

685
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:54,052
Yes, though you better
remind him of that fact

686
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:55,722
He's not here
to defend himself

687
01:18:55,798 --> 01:19:00,167
No, but I see you are here
to defend him and what is his

688
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:04,502
even though
he's abandoned her and you

689
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:07,508
I won't even speak
of who else he abandoned

690
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,168
Damn you, boy

691
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:12,510
Don't you blame my son
for Samuel's death!

692
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,550
Samuel chose to be a soldier,
and soldiers die

693
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:17,677
sent to their slaughter
by men in government

694
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,516
Parasites like you!

695
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,488
Damn and blast you!

696
01:19:21,557 --> 01:19:24,355
Damn you
And damn you too!

697
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:27,089
Shut your mouth
Leave her out of this!

698
01:19:27,163 --> 01:19:29,324
Get out of my house
and get off my land

699
01:19:29,398 --> 01:19:33,027
Why? Because I want
to serve my country as you did?

700
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:36,265
Or because, like you,
I love a woman who doesn't love me?

701
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:41,175
He used her and deserted her,
your darling Tristan

702
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:42,904
Alfred, don't Please

703
01:19:42,979 --> 01:19:44,708
I loved her!

704
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,742
I love her still

705
01:19:51,988 --> 01:19:55,185
He stole her from me
If you want to know the truth

706
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:58,590
he stole her from Samuel
before the war

707
01:19:58,661 --> 01:20:00,754
God help me, I'll kill you

708
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:07,034
Here
Read your darling Tristan's letter

709
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:15,743
You deserve to be happy

710
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:48,769
Late that night we found
the Colonel on the floor

711
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,779
beside a cold fire

712
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,610
He could not move

713
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,945
His hair turned white overnight

714
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,454
and he became an old man

715
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:05,953
And after that,
Tristan sent no more letters

716
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:09,794
As the years passed by

717
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:12,959
we would hear that someone
had seen him on a ship

718
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:16,971
going up some river
no white man had gone up before

719
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:21,032
Stories came to us

720
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:23,635
Strange stories

721
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,145
And then, for years,
there was nothing

722
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:35,486
He was lost to us

723
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:38,152
That was all we knew

724
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:39,595
But every year,
in the Moon of the Falling Leaves

725
01:21:39,595 --> 01:21:41,995
But every year,
in the Moon of the Falling Leaves

726
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:47,661
I would dream that the bear's voice
inside him had grown silent

727
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:51,502
and that Tristan might again
come to live in the world

728
01:21:52,475 --> 01:21:54,500
But then the winter would come

729
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:57,512
And then another spring

730
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:01,675
And still he stayed away

731
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:33,548
What the hell is he doing?

732
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,604
She's a mean old bitch,
but she's yours

733
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,448
Welcome home

734
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:52,119
Old man!
Where's Father?

735
01:24:17,686 --> 01:24:20,154
He had a stroke some years ago

736
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:22,315
He can't talk now

737
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:29,155
Oh, Father

738
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,541
He wants to celebrate

739
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:09,995
I'm happy too

740
01:25:40,803 --> 01:25:42,930
Father, this is for you

741
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:51,576
"Colonel William Ludlow,
from his son Tristan"

742
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,616
I didn't know

743
01:25:57,453 --> 01:26:01,253
These are boars' tusks,
made by a Javanese warrior

744
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:03,416
He, too, was a great man

745
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:26,110
I have other things for Mother
and Little Izzy and Susannah

746
01:26:31,453 --> 01:26:32,977
What is it?

747
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:44,961
Alfred and Miss Susannah

748
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,627
were married several years ago

749
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:53,137
Your brother's a congressman now

750
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:57,311
They have a big, new place
in Helena

751
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:04,978
It's as it should be

752
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:08,318
Cattle prices dropped
after the war ended

753
01:27:09,892 --> 01:27:12,861
The Colonel ain't seem to care

754
01:27:12,928 --> 01:27:14,953
He lost just about everything he had

755
01:27:16,932 --> 01:27:18,365
We'll make it back

756
01:27:18,434 --> 01:27:22,063
on horses or something else
if we have to

757
01:27:22,137 --> 01:27:23,627
We'll make it back

758
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,901
He's saying that your brother
voted for the Volstead Act

759
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:34,471
Did he? You suggesting
I become a bootlegger?

760
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:38,179
Good money in bootlegging,
if you know what you're doing

761
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,982
Screw the government

762
01:27:40,055 --> 01:27:41,989
Screw them

763
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:47,054
Screw them!
Screw the government

764
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:46,379
Forever turned out
to be too long

765
01:28:48,357 --> 01:28:49,790
I know

766
01:29:00,736 --> 01:29:02,601
Here

767
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:05,071
I don't want it

768
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:16,014
They told me
that this was magic

769
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:19,952
that whoever wore it
would be protected

770
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:29,153
Keep it

771
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:51,345
Don't you want to see Alfred?

772
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:55,618
It's probably better
that I don't

773
01:30:00,262 --> 01:30:02,492
Tell him hello

774
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:05,328
and congratulations

775
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,564
He likes you

776
01:30:50,212 --> 01:30:51,736
Welcome home

777
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:55,048
Isabel?

778
01:30:58,620 --> 01:30:58,654
I want you to have him

779
01:30:58,654 --> 01:31:00,417
I want you to have him

780
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:04,224
I have something for you too

781
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:06,226
I brought it back

782
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,729
It's from lerapetra

783
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:11,766
- That's in...
- Crete

784
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,960
- Yeah
- I know where it is

785
01:31:14,036 --> 01:31:16,903
Your father taught me
European history

786
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:22,372
A little girl
That's me, right?

787
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,243
Thank you

788
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:56,144
Okay, we'll see you
in a few days

789
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:00,948
Don't wait on me
I'll be fine

790
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:06,681
It was then that Tristan came
into the quiet heart

791
01:32:06,755 --> 01:32:08,780
of his life

792
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:12,452
The bear inside him was sleeping

793
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:17,631
It is hard to tell
of happiness

794
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:21,294
Time goes by

795
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:24,133
and we feel safe too soon

796
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:25,741
- I heard the oddest news
- Yes?

797
01:32:25,741 --> 01:32:28,471
- I heard the oddest news
- Yes?

798
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:29,976
Yes

799
01:32:31,046 --> 01:32:33,640
Tristan

800
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:35,148
is back

801
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:39,319
Yes, I know

802
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:42,489
You know?

803
01:32:43,725 --> 01:32:45,659
How do you know?

804
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:51,188
I saw him

805
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:57,637
He had the audacity
to come here just to see you?

806
01:32:57,706 --> 01:33:00,470
He wanted to see you,
but thought you'd get upset

807
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:04,010
He might be right

808
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,354
What did he...

809
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,185
What did he say?

810
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:17,816
He said to say hello

811
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:20,895
and congratulations

812
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:26,764
Silly me

813
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:30,996
He told you the news?

814
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:34,541
What do you think?

815
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:40,047
Come on
It's perfectly absurd

816
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,349
Marrying Isabel Two

817
01:33:43,418 --> 01:33:47,548
God, she's practically our sister

818
01:33:49,291 --> 01:33:52,226
She can't be more than,
what, 19?

819
01:33:53,295 --> 01:33:54,853
Twenty

820
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:58,263
I can't imagine what the hell
Decker is thinking of

821
01:33:58,333 --> 01:34:00,733
to allow this

822
01:34:00,802 --> 01:34:04,238
Perhaps he's thinking
of his daughter's happiness

823
01:34:07,342 --> 01:34:11,176
Happiness?
With Tristan?

824
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:16,583
You, of all people,
should know how impossible that is

825
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:19,085
I'm not Isabel Two

826
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:31,257
June 2, 1921

827
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:32,823
Dear Tristan:

828
01:34:32,901 --> 01:34:36,428
I was so pleased to hear
of your coming marriage

829
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,171
Your father must be very happy

830
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:43,440
Isabel Two is like
a daughter to him

831
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:48,115
as she was named
after your own mother

832
01:34:48,183 --> 01:34:52,119
It seems as though it was always
meant to be, doesn't it?

833
01:34:58,026 --> 01:34:59,653
Damnation

834
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:31,885
Samuel Decker Ludlow

835
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:42,062
Dearest Tristan:

836
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:47,564
Alfred and I were delighted
to hear of your son's birth

837
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:51,571
We hoped for a child of our own,
but of that I despair

838
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,904
I know Alfred thinks of you often

839
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:58,412
I look forward to the day when we
all might see one another again

840
01:37:02,484 --> 01:37:05,248
Your son bears a proud
and noble name

841
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:07,083
I know he will live up to it

842
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:14,257
Please give my love
to Isabel Two

843
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:16,923
and to your father
and everyone else

844
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:19,762
Yours always, Susannah

845
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:33,507
Evening, gentlemen

846
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:36,379
Been meaning to talk to you
about one or two things

847
01:37:36,451 --> 01:37:37,941
By all means

848
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:40,487
As you know perfectly well

849
01:37:40,555 --> 01:37:42,489
we handle the liquor around here

850
01:37:42,557 --> 01:37:46,618
Now, you've been
a small-time operator

851
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:48,685
An amateur, frankly

852
01:37:48,763 --> 01:37:52,631
Lately, your shipments
have been getting a little fat

853
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:55,191
and my patience
has been getting a little thin

854
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:59,138
So the next time
you get in our way

855
01:37:59,207 --> 01:38:00,697
will be the last time

856
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:04,845
Excuse me
I appreciate it

857
01:38:04,913 --> 01:38:07,677
Perhaps you're wondering
why you're not dead already

858
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:11,480
Because your brother
is Congressman Ludlow

859
01:38:11,553 --> 01:38:13,817
And that's it
That's all

860
01:38:20,395 --> 01:38:22,056
Kenneth Thomas

861
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:50,417
Can't you just say hello?

862
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:08,231
- Hello, Alfred
- Hello, Tristan

863
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,385
- Who's this young man?
- This is Samuel

864
01:39:26,427 --> 01:39:28,395
She's beautiful

865
01:39:34,402 --> 01:39:35,926
Let me see

866
01:39:44,179 --> 01:39:48,707
- Who is this lady?
- I'm your Aunt Susannah

867
01:39:51,653 --> 01:39:55,487
I used to know your Uncle Samuel
who died in the war

868
01:39:59,627 --> 01:40:02,892
- You look like him
- That's what Grandpa says

869
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,231
He was very brave and very good

870
01:40:09,304 --> 01:40:10,999
Grandpa says that too

871
01:40:11,072 --> 01:40:14,769
Grandpa says I can have
Uncle Samuel's gun when I'm bigger

872
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:16,707
Would you come and see it?

873
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:25,144
I'd love to

874
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:27,154
Sometime

875
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:33,422
- He's a fine boy
- He is

876
01:40:35,196 --> 01:40:40,031
- How is Father? Well?
- As well as can be expected

877
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:47,667
- I wish...
- Pardon the intrusion

878
01:40:49,444 --> 01:40:52,880
Excuse me
We're ready for your speech now

879
01:40:52,947 --> 01:40:54,778
I'll be there in a minute

880
01:40:54,849 --> 01:40:56,180
Thank you

881
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:14,398
- We'll meet again soon?
- I'd like that

882
01:41:46,067 --> 01:41:47,591
Watch this

883
01:41:54,976 --> 01:41:56,807
Go and get Tynert

884
01:42:01,449 --> 01:42:03,713
I think you missed a bump, Stab

885
01:42:22,537 --> 01:42:23,799
Jesus!

886
01:42:23,871 --> 01:42:26,567
Sir, we have information
that you're transporting goods

887
01:42:26,641 --> 01:42:28,632
in violation
of the Volstead Act

888
01:42:28,710 --> 01:42:31,611
If you mean a case of Irish whiskey
for my father, I am

889
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:33,271
Give it up

890
01:42:34,248 --> 01:42:35,806
He'll be disappointed

891
01:43:07,915 --> 01:43:09,906
Hold him down

892
01:43:11,352 --> 01:43:13,149
Let's get out of here

893
01:43:13,221 --> 01:43:16,588
- There's an envelope in his pocket
- Now

894
01:43:22,130 --> 01:43:27,295
My brother told you
to stay out of our way

895
01:43:32,407 --> 01:43:34,136
Put him in the car

896
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:15,904
- I don't want to see him
- Father...

897
01:45:15,977 --> 01:45:17,410
I don't want to see him

898
01:45:37,999 --> 01:45:39,557
I'm so very sorry

899
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:49,438
Father won't see me, even now?

900
01:45:51,012 --> 01:45:54,812
He blames the government
for Isabel's...

901
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:04,623
There's something
we have to talk about

902
01:46:06,527 --> 01:46:10,258
The officer you beat
almost died

903
01:46:11,532 --> 01:46:13,397
Now, everyone understands

904
01:46:15,536 --> 01:46:18,471
but you'll have to plead guilty

905
01:46:18,539 --> 01:46:20,029
serve 30 days

906
01:46:20,107 --> 01:46:22,837
And the one who shot his gun?

907
01:46:25,212 --> 01:46:27,146
He was

908
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:29,940
reprimanded

909
01:46:30,918 --> 01:46:34,854
- The O'Banions?
- Nothing

910
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:37,653
You have to let it go

911
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:41,821
It was a terrible, tragic accident

912
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:44,490
Listen to me

913
01:46:44,565 --> 01:46:47,329
You let this go now

914
01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:49,835
You got in over your head

915
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:56,308
I'll need a minute

916
01:47:37,985 --> 01:47:39,919
I'm so sorry

917
01:47:42,123 --> 01:47:44,216
We all loved her

918
01:47:47,395 --> 01:47:48,919
How are you?

919
01:47:50,598 --> 01:47:52,031
I'm fine

920
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:01,908
We never get to see you

921
01:48:07,648 --> 01:48:10,583
I gave a speech the other day

922
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:12,915
- You did?
- Yes

923
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:15,581
My first public engagement

924
01:48:23,998 --> 01:48:28,435
It was on the responsibilities
of women in...

925
01:48:35,009 --> 01:48:36,943
It's good to see you

926
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:05,201
I'm sorry

927
01:49:14,048 --> 01:49:16,846
I still sometimes dream

928
01:49:16,917 --> 01:49:19,283
that I'm the mother
of your children

929
01:49:29,897 --> 01:49:31,489
I wanted her to die

930
01:49:34,568 --> 01:49:37,628
Maybe I even wanted Samuel to die

931
01:49:44,245 --> 01:49:47,510
You had nothing to do
with Samuel's death

932
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:50,049
And you had nothing to do
with Isabel's death

933
01:49:52,253 --> 01:49:53,686
Didn't I?

934
01:49:55,923 --> 01:49:57,413
Go home

935
01:50:00,594 --> 01:50:02,926
Go home to Alfred

936
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:31,056
Where were you?

937
01:50:32,793 --> 01:50:35,057
I just went out for a walk

938
01:50:35,129 --> 01:50:39,065
I needed a walk
What are you doing home?

939
01:50:39,133 --> 01:50:41,897
Your doctor rang,
said you missed your appointment

940
01:50:41,969 --> 01:50:44,563
I called home
You weren't here l...

941
01:50:45,539 --> 01:50:47,564
I feel very tired

942
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:50,739
I'm going to bed

943
01:56:59,346 --> 01:57:03,442
You have won her
I am bringing her home

944
01:57:03,517 --> 01:57:05,508
Alfred

945
01:57:41,722 --> 01:57:43,815
I followed all the rules:

946
01:57:46,059 --> 01:57:48,323
Man's and God's

947
01:57:50,230 --> 01:57:51,822
And you...

948
01:57:53,734 --> 01:57:55,167
You followed none of them

949
01:58:01,241 --> 01:58:03,675
And they all loved you more

950
01:58:07,748 --> 01:58:10,512
Samuel, Father

951
01:58:14,755 --> 01:58:18,350
and even my own wife

952
01:58:29,936 --> 01:58:33,428
I'd like a moment
alone with her

953
01:59:17,484 --> 01:59:19,076
When Samuel died...

954
01:59:24,324 --> 01:59:27,088
When Samuel died, I cursed God

955
01:59:37,404 --> 01:59:40,840
And I damn everybody around me
as well as myself

956
01:59:44,344 --> 01:59:49,441
You are not damned

957
01:59:49,516 --> 01:59:52,280
I won't allow that

958
01:59:53,353 --> 01:59:56,186
You're not damned!

959
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:42,164
Samuel,
this is a gentleman's gun

960
02:00:42,235 --> 02:00:44,703
It's smaller,
but it's just as powerful

961
02:00:44,771 --> 02:00:48,138
That's what you want
when you grow up, isn't it? A gun

962
02:00:50,610 --> 02:00:52,373
Samuel, come here!

963
02:00:58,618 --> 02:01:03,612
Run along now Go with Pet
Get him in the house

964
02:01:07,494 --> 02:01:09,587
He's a fine boy

965
02:01:15,101 --> 02:01:17,569
You know we're not here
to arrest you

966
02:01:34,521 --> 02:01:36,955
You take me to the woods
I don't want my boy to see

967
02:01:38,258 --> 02:01:39,589
I don't want my boy to see

968
02:01:41,795 --> 02:01:43,558
Let's get on with it

969
02:01:46,366 --> 02:01:48,596
- Father
- Colonel Ludlow, sir

970
02:01:49,636 --> 02:01:51,536
What's going on here?

971
02:01:53,139 --> 02:01:54,800
What's going on here?

972
02:04:13,747 --> 02:04:18,013
You don't have to be a genius to know
they'll come after you for this

973
02:04:18,952 --> 02:04:20,385
Yeah

974
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:28,287
Yeah?

975
02:04:31,631 --> 02:04:35,226
I want to ask you
to watch over my children

976
02:04:38,304 --> 02:04:40,431
Watch over Samuel

977
02:04:49,082 --> 02:04:51,312
Brother, it would be an honor

978
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:18,106
How much I wanted
to take scalps

979
02:05:18,178 --> 02:05:20,442
but it was not my kill

980
02:05:36,362 --> 02:05:39,456
That night,
we buried the bodies

981
02:05:39,532 --> 02:05:44,469
and dumped the car in a deep pool
in the upper Missouri

982
02:05:44,537 --> 02:05:47,631
I remember when he was a boy

983
02:05:47,707 --> 02:05:52,303
I thought Tristan would never live
to be an old man

984
02:05:52,378 --> 02:05:55,313
I was wrong about that

985
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:59,147
I was wrong about many things

986
02:05:59,219 --> 02:06:03,315
It was those who loved him most
who died young

987
02:06:04,557 --> 02:06:08,493
He was a rock
they broke themselves against

988
02:06:08,561 --> 02:06:11,496
however much
he tried to protect them

989
02:06:12,966 --> 02:06:15,662
But he had his honor

990
02:06:15,735 --> 02:06:17,999
and a long life

991
02:06:18,071 --> 02:06:20,835
and he saw his children grow

992
02:06:20,907 --> 02:06:23,501
and raise their own families

993
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:30,516
Tristan died in 1963

994
02:06:30,583 --> 02:06:34,019
in the Moon of the Popping Trees

995
02:06:34,087 --> 02:06:37,352
He was last seen
up in the north country

996
02:06:37,423 --> 02:06:40,688
where the hunting was still good

997
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:43,354
His grave is unmarked

998
02:06:43,429 --> 02:06:46,364
but it does not matter

999
02:06:46,432 --> 02:06:50,027
He had always lived
in the borderland anyway:

1000
02:06:50,103 --> 02:06:53,869
Somewhere between this world
and the other

1001
02:07:32,979 --> 02:07:35,072
It was a good death

1002
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:49,072
{{{the end}}}
