2
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:39,934
<i>A job at the end of the world.</i>

3
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:47,275
<i>A salaried killer for
a big petroleum company.</i>

4
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:52,530
<i>I don't know why I did
half the things I've done,</i>

5
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:56,159
<i>but I know this
is where I belong,</i>

6
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:59,746
<i>surrounded by my own.</i>

7
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,959
<i>Ex-cons, fugitives,
drifters,</i>

8
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,211
<i>assholes.</i>

9
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,590
<i>Men unfit for mankind.</i>

10
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,558
<i>There's not a second
that goes by</i>

11
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:04,894
<i>when I'm not thinking
of you in some way.</i>

12
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,943
<i>I want to see your face,</i>

13
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,321
<i>feel your hands in mine,</i>

14
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:18,282
<i>feel you against me.</i>

15
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,624
<i>But I know that will never be.</i>

16
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:29,794
<i>You left me,</i>

17
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,298
<i>and I can't get you back.</i>

18
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,430
<i>I move like
I imagine the damned do,</i>

19
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,307
<i>cursed.</i>

20
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:51,190
<i>And I feel like
it's only a matter of time.</i>

21
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,247
<i>I don't know why
I'm writing this.</i>

22
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,667
<i>I don't know
what can come of it.</i>

23
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,138
<i>I know I can't get you back.</i>

24
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,223
<i>I don't know why
this has happened to us.</i>

25
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:09,268
<i>I feel like it's me.</i>

26
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,395
<i>Bad luck.</i>

27
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,231
<i>Poison.</i>

28
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,783
<i>And I've stopped doing
this world any real good.</i>

29
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:13,165
<i>"Once more into the fray"</i>

30
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,675
<i>"Into the last good fight
I'll ever know"</i>

31
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:59,170
<i>"Live and die on this day"</i>

32
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:15,519
<i>"Live and die on this day"</i>

33
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,492
Let's go. I need your
boarding passes, please.

34
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,202
Please have them out.

35
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,330
There's a storm coming in. We gotta
get this plane off the tarmac.

36
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:39,251
You guys are fucking
this up. Let's go.

37
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,995
Shit. Sorry, bro.

38
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,457
Shit. Sorry, man. Sorry.

39
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:37,560
It is as cold as this
motherfucker's ever been, huh?

40
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:38,894
I ain't shittin' either, man.

41
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:40,354
I stripped down
for the showers,

42
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:42,273
and icicles are
forming on my nuts.

43
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:45,317
I didn't even think
that shit was possible.

44
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:47,403
You got a girl
back in Anchorage?

45
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,988
No.

46
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,740
Oh.

47
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,577
I got me a few.
One had to get the scrape.

48
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:56,954
At least that's
what she told me.

49
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:59,832
She's been hitting me up
for the money ever since.

50
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,543
I'm like, "Bitch,
we both fucked."

51
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,712
"I'll split it
with you, whatever."

52
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,964
I'm Flannery,
by the way. Todd.

53
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,507
You're Ottman, right?

54
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:09,842
Ottway.

55
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,802
Oops, sorry, bro.
Ottway, yeah.

56
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,721
So, you blast critters
for a living, huh,

57
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,264
and do some of
that sniper shit?

58
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,975
What's the biggest piece of game you've taken down?
Like, a Kodiak, huh?

59
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,019
You know, I saw that
documentary that asshole did.

60
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,312
You know, the fag
who loves bears...

61
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,106
Listen, listen, pal. I don't want to talk.
I need some quiet.

62
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,026
So, I'm just going to
put my head back, okay?

63
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,488
Yeah, it's cool.
It's cool.

64
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,377
Sir. Sir, I
need you to sit down, please.

65
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:47,546
Yeah, I'm sitting.

66
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,856
You like that shit, don't you?

67
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,066
No, I don't.

68
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,902
I would never eat a sea urchin.

69
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,154
They say if you eat it, not
only does it make you impotent,

70
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:16,450
but it poisons you, and it
causes extreme skin reactions.

71
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:18,410
No, it's the opposite.

72
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:24,583
Plus it tastes like shit. You ever taste that?
You ever seen one?

73
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,460
It makes you through
with this, seriously.

74
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,087
What's the other thing?

75
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,964
Spicy tuna roll.
Not impotent.

76
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,465
Oh, incontinent.

77
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,635
That's why you were
pissing on yourself

78
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,345
like you did
last Saturday night.

79
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,930
That reminds me
of my childhood.

80
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,559
No, it's a true story.
I'm a true story.

81
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:42,810
I'm playing with you, man.

82
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:43,936
Really.

83
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,730
And then they wash
the ammonia off the fish.

84
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,276
A Swedish massage.

85
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,780
I'm gonna be sick.

86
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,824
- Fuck me.
- Fuck.

87
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,325
What was that?

88
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,577
Shit.

89
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,624
Hey, guys, do yourself a favor,

90
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,586
don't do that head-between-your-knees
crash position shit

91
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,337
- if this fucker goes down.
- Shut the fuck up.

92
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:11,755
Why you saying that, man?
Shut up!

93
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,007
- Shut the fuck up.
- Shut up.

94
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,258
Suck my dick, Flannery.

95
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,426
Why would you even say that?

96
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,512
I'm just saying, I seen it on the
Discovery Channel, this plane crashes,

97
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:20,681
these people's spines went
through the tops of their skulls

98
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,892
'cause they were all bent
over like fucking retards.

99
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,019
Flannery, I'm going
to knock you the fuck out.

100
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,520
Shut up! Who's
friends with this guy?

101
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:28,564
I'm just saying!
Stop fucking saying.

102
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,733
Whoever's closest,
just fucking hit him.

103
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:32,484
All right.

104
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:33,611
Fucking guy, man.

105
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:36,238
Is he planning on flying out of
this shit at any time or what?

106
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,451
Ooh, you boys are sensitive.

107
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,161
Great, just...

108
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,375
Everybody stop talking.

109
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,032
Hey, there's ice on
this side of the window.

110
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,285
Please remain in your seats.

111
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,869
- What's going on?
- Hey, sweetheart?

112
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,788
Why is it so fucking cold in here?
Where you going?

113
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,873
There's ice on my window.

114
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,084
Miss, what's happening?

115
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,877
Everyone, please remain calm.

116
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,671
Make sure you have
your seatbelts on.

117
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,047
Jesus Christ!

118
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,556
No, remain seated, sir.

119
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:28,809
It's too fucking cold.

120
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,937
Tell the pilot to get on
and tell us what's going on here.

121
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:34,148
I know that's not
supposed to happen.

122
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,819
Sir, you have to sit
back down in your seat!

123
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,070
Fucking crazy!

124
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,406
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die!

125
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,762
Somebody help me!

126
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:12,973
Help me!

127
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,560
Help me, somebody!

128
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:18,395
Help!

129
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:20,397
Somebody help me! Fuck.

130
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,149
I got you. I got you.

131
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,734
I got you.

132
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,445
I got you.

133
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:27,905
We fucking went down!

134
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,323
Oh, my God.

135
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,241
Oh, my God.
That guy's cut in half.

136
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,910
What the fuck!
Don't look! Don't look at it.

137
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:36,038
Don't look! Look at me. Look at me!
We went down.

138
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,123
My hand's fucked,
my leg's fucked.

139
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:39,833
Ah! Fuck!

140
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,793
It's good.
It's good that it hurts.

141
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,003
Is it good?
It's good, yeah.

142
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,379
Then I'm fucking fabulous.

143
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:45,797
Yeah. Are you
bleeding anywhere else?

144
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:46,882
I don't know, man.
I can't tell.

145
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,842
Let me get you some cover.
Don't go. Don't leave me.

146
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,260
No, no! I'll be straight back.
Where are you going?

147
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:51,678
It's okay.
I'll be straight back.

148
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,388
Fuck. Shit.

149
00:16:58,477 --> 00:16:59,728
Ottway!

150
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,325
I gotta get out of here.

151
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,078
It's gonna be okay.

152
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,538
There's some Vicodin in my bag.

153
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:18,872
Hernandez.

154
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,165
Hernandez, you okay?

155
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:23,377
I just gotta make a call to Vanessa.
I gotta make a quick call.

156
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,420
Quick, to Vanessa.
Just one call.

157
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:26,880
You're in shock, Hernandez.

158
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,549
But I need you to
stand up and help me.

159
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:29,675
What happened?

160
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,301
The plane went down, man.

161
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,386
What?
We crashed.

162
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,388
No, no, no way.
That's bullshit.

163
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,515
That's fucking bullshit.
I'm just asleep.

164
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,641
We crashed.
I was just sleeping.

165
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,518
Like, there's no way
that could've happened.

166
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:40,811
What about the pilots?

167
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,521
The pilots?
What are you talking about?

168
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,482
The plane's gone, man.
It's in pieces.

169
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:46,817
Look.

170
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:48,777
Fuck.

171
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,780
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

172
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,118
This is so fucked up.

173
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,495
I can't fucking believe it.

174
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,706
Is there a bunch
of people dead?

175
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:01,832
Yes.

176
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,334
Now I need you to help me
find the ones that aren't.

177
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,920
Come on. Can you walk?

178
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,171
Yeah.

179
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,092
Come on...
Told me to come out...

180
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,343
It's fucking freezing.

181
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:19,975
You know what, homes?

182
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,268
Fuck!

183
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,519
I can't feel my fingers.

184
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,357
Help me.

185
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,109
I got you, Flannery.
I got you.

186
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,278
Diaz. Diaz. Diaz.

187
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,529
Excuse me for a second?

188
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,038
Watch your head.

189
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,414
No.

190
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,084
No. This is too much.

191
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,961
- It's just too much coming out of it.
- Come on, fuck!

192
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:51,256
I wish one of these fucking
phones would work!

193
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,886
I got you some help.

194
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,805
It's just... I'm
losing too much blood.

195
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,474
I can't lose all this blood.

196
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:01,725
Help him.

197
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,060
Ottway, help him.

198
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,440
This can't be
all coming outside.

199
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,526
Too much blood.
This is way too much blood.

200
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,694
Fuck.

201
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:17,032
Ottway, help me, okay?

202
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,827
Something's wrong. Something's
really, really wrong here.

203
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:23,413
Okay? I don't feel right.
I just don't...

204
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,707
Ottway, okay, this doesn't...

205
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,876
Look. I know. Okay.

206
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,214
It don't feel right.

207
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,882
Something feels
really fucking wrong.

208
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,592
Listen, listen.

209
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,223
You're gonna die.
That's what's happening.

210
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,313
- It's okay.
- No.

211
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,649
No. No.

212
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,945
No, no, no. Wait,
wait, wait. Hold on.

213
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,947
- Hold on!
- It's okay.

214
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,991
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
It's okay.

215
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,912
Hold on.
It's okay. It's okay.

216
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,290
Look at me.
Keep looking at me.

217
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,710
It's all right.
It's all right.

218
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,586
Look at me.
Keep looking at me.

219
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,921
It's all right.

220
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,008
It'll slide over you.

221
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,928
It'll start to feel warm.
Nice and warm.

222
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:21,722
Let it move over you.

223
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,474
It's all right.
What?

224
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,563
Let your thoughts go.

225
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,190
All the good things.

226
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,736
All the good
things. Yeah?

227
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,447
Who do you love?

228
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,493
Who do you love, Luke?

229
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,250
My girl Rosie.

230
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,336
Is she your daughter?

231
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,506
She's six.

232
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,680
Let her take you, then.

233
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,808
Let her take you.

234
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,605
It's okay. It's okay.

235
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,214
Wait for me.

236
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,192
Did he just fucking die?

237
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,904
He just fucking died,
didn't he?

238
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,740
Come on.

239
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,784
- Did you...
- Yeah.

240
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:09,079
- Did you feel him go?
- Yeah.

241
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:10,664
I felt him go.

242
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:28,390
Is this everyone?

243
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,310
Is this everyone
who's still alive?

244
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,646
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

245
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:37,065
One, two, three...

246
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:42,529
Seven. Seven of us
that we know of. Yeah?

247
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,823
Okay. Okay.

248
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:47,492
You happy, fuckhead?

249
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,453
You had to open up your fat fucking mouth.
You had to keep talking.

250
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,580
You had to put
the whammy on us.

251
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:55,125
I didn't do shit. Did I
fucking crash us? Huh?

252
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,835
We need a fire.

253
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,879
Did I...
I didn't do shit.

254
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,964
We should gather up
anything that'll burn,

255
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,592
seats, luggage,
any wood we can find.

256
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:05,802
What are you doing?

257
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,137
I said we need a fire.

258
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,973
It's about 10 below
and dropping.

259
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,064
So we don't die.

260
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:21,109
We build up a fire,
then we find food.

261
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,945
And at daybreak, we figure
out what way is south,

262
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:25,447
and we start walking.

263
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,949
Nobody's gonna find us.
Not here.

264
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,994
Somebody will find us. I mean,
somebody'll be fucking searching.

265
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,704
They gotta know that plane
went off the radar.

266
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,749
Right. If they send 50 planes,
maybe they'll find us.

267
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,667
But they won't send 50 planes
because it won't matter.

268
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,419
Because we won't
have time to wait

269
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:40,962
for the one or two
that they will send.

270
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:43,048
Corporate doesn't give a fuck.
Corporate doesn't give a fuck.

271
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,925
Nobody gives a shit about us.

272
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:47,844
You know how much payroll they
just pocketed in this crash?

273
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,143
If we don't move and work
now, we're all fucked.

274
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,937
Unless you want
to freeze to death,

275
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,688
'cause that's the one thing
that will come for you.

276
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:12,619
Hey, asshole! That's jet
fuel, get away from there.

277
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:20,794
Water, wood, something to wear.

278
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,382
Hey, you can't burn that.
That shit'll kill us.

279
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,052
Fuck.

280
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,179
Ohh.

281
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,975
We gotta do
something with the bodies.

282
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,184
Fuck the bodies.

283
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,769
Fuck the bodies.
The bodies...

284
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:41,189
Grab what burns.
Or you're gonna be a body.

285
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:42,315
Relax, Rambo. Relax.

286
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,400
You fucking relax.

287
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,068
Tell me to relax.

288
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,070
They're everywhere.

289
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:48,571
I got a book.

290
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:52,617
It's called <i>We're All Fucked!</i>
It's a bestseller.

291
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,000
Here you go.

292
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,168
Fuck.

293
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,880
Hey, man. Take it easy with that.
Why?

294
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,758
'Cause I don't wanna
fucking catch fire.

295
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:24,607
Hello?

296
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,654
I see you! I'm coming.

297
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,953
Jesus Christ.

298
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:41,833
Get off her, you motherfucker.

299
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,861
Where are they?

300
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,739
- You okay?
- You see them?

301
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,035
You Okay?

302
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,289
I swear, these motherfuckers...
ls there any more?

303
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:22,874
Hey, man. We gotta get
the fuck out of here.

304
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:23,917
Don't stand around.

305
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,126
Let's get the fuck out.

306
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:28,338
Fuck this! Do not stand
the fuck in one place.

307
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:30,548
You fucking kidding me?

308
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:31,841
Ottway, what the hell was that?

309
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:33,218
What the hell was that?

310
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,137
I didn't see it.
I heard it.

311
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,597
I didn't see shit!

312
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,141
They're fucking big.
They're big.

313
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:29,899
Maybe I'll turn into
a wolf man now, huh?

314
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,986
Wait, that shit's
not real, right?

315
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,112
You mean, he can't...

316
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:36,656
Asswipe, what do
you think? Really?

317
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,158
I don't know, man. I meant,
like, rabies or whatever.

318
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,492
I didn't think
the motherfucker was

319
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,369
gonna grow claws
and teeth and shit.

320
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,371
Fuck.

321
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,498
So, you think
there's more of them?

322
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:47,083
Wolves? Maybe.

323
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,711
Yeah. Most likely.

324
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,338
But we shouldn't be worrying
about them right now.

325
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:56,009
We should be worrying
about finding food.

326
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:58,386
They're probably
only passing through.

327
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:01,389
Wait a minute. Passing
through as opposed to what?

328
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,851
Living here. Hunting here.

329
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,855
Wolves have a territorial
range of about 300 miles,

330
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,523
and a kill range of 30.

331
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:18,656
If we're close to their den, and
if we're within that radius,

332
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,909
then they'll come after us.

333
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,789
Well, how can we
tell if we're close?

334
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:29,918
We can't.

335
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,878
They might've
just been feeding.

336
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:34,881
There's bodies everywhere. I
threatened them, they attacked.

337
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,299
What about the radius?

338
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,969
I mean, if we're in that, what?
They're gonna fight us?

339
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,096
I thought wolves
were scared of people.

340
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,349
Not if we're near their den.

341
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,851
They're not scared
of anything then.

342
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:48,603
What kind of wolves are they?

343
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:50,980
I mean, what do they call the ones
that just eat plants and shit?

344
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:53,149
They don't call them wolves.

345
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,817
Herbivores,
that's what you mean.

346
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:56,819
That's wishful thinking.

347
00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:00,657
When did you become king shit fucking
animal expert all of a sudden?

348
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:05,495
They paid me to kill those things,
to keep them from killing you.

349
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:08,039
So it makes sense for me
to know they're man-eaters

350
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:11,584
and they don't give a shit
about berries and shrubs.

351
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:14,671
There's blood in the air.
And there's death.

352
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,385
They know we're wounded.

353
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,178
They can smell it.

354
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:27,767
Hopefully they
won't fuck with us.

355
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,314
We need to move
these bodies out of here.

356
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:36,025
And then we've gotta find food.

357
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:48,955
Check this fucking thing out.

358
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,623
Jesus, Diaz, don't do that.

359
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,333
No, man.

360
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:56,296
I saw one of these once.
It's got a beacon, you know?

361
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:58,298
Like a GPS.

362
00:29:58,381 --> 00:29:59,674
Yeah.

363
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,636
Holy shit!

364
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:09,642
Holy shit, man.
It works. It's beeping!

365
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:12,061
This thing will reach up,
like, 40,000 feet!

366
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:14,981
Yes, I think that's
great that that gives you hope.

367
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,482
It's fucking heartwarming.

368
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,067
Very funny, bro.

369
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:23,364
That's nice, my friend. That's calfskin.
It's very nice. Not cheap.

370
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:29,162
Since you cocksuckers didn't
give us a holiday bonus,

371
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,538
I'm gonna accept this
on behalf of my homies.

372
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,123
Put that back.

373
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:35,543
Put it back!

374
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:38,546
We're not looting
dead bodies for swag.

375
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:39,881
You got lucky today, Ottway.

376
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:41,632
You should be lying there with them.
Don't push it.

377
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:42,759
I'm not gonna say it again.

378
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,427
Motherfucker,
take a big step back!

379
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,764
I'm gonna start beating the shit out
of you in the next five seconds,

380
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:52,101
and you're gonna swallow a lot
of blood for a fucking billfold.

381
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:06,783
I can't fucking
stand guys like that.

382
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,701
Hey, you're gonna just
turn that into charcoal, bro.

383
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:09,786
No, I got it.

384
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,788
By my account, I'd say we
have about enough booze

385
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,539
for you guys to get
drunk two more times.

386
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:14,665
Don't get weird.

387
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:15,875
After that,
then we'll all be sober.

388
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,710
Jack makes me fight.
Oh, yeah.

389
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,170
Ladies, ladies!

390
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:20,421
You like the white
or the brown?

391
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:21,672
How about some brown stuff?

392
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:24,050
No tequila.
Sorry about that.

393
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,385
It's all good.
Thanks, papa.

394
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:26,844
Where the fuck
did you get that?

395
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:29,931
In that thing, that
serving thing with wheels on it.

396
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:31,474
Bunch of dead
bodies all over, man.

397
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,185
You wanna make sure you know
where that meat came from.

398
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:35,937
It's like that movie
where they start

399
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,564
taking chunks of frozen
ass out of that guy.

400
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:39,857
The plane crash.

401
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,359
That dude
from <i>Training Day?</i> Right.

402
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:43,569
That'd be fucking
funny as fuck.

403
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,738
That was like
dead ass on a stick.

404
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,990
Or you thought like a severed
dick was a hotdog, right?

405
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:49,158
That's too fucking funny.

406
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,662
I wish some of the other
dudes would have lived.

407
00:31:58,543 --> 00:31:59,919
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

408
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,587
HERNANDEZ; You hear that?

409
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:03,256
Get up! Get up!

410
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:06,342
What is that?
Go, go, go!

411
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:08,428
What the fuck is that?

412
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:11,514
What is it?
What the fuck...

413
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,814
Everybody be cool.

414
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,191
Don't move.

415
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:28,948
Jesus Christ!

416
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,075
Stare right back at them.

417
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:39,125
Wait, wait, wait.
Why are they coming closer?

418
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,751
Fuck this shit. I'm
getting back in the plane.

419
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:43,838
Flannery, God damn
it, don't move.

420
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:46,674
Look at the size of
that fucking thing.

421
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,736
We'll take...
We'll take two-hour shifts.

422
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,071
I'll start.
You guys get some sleep.

423
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:12,575
Yeah, like that
shit's gonna happen.

424
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:03,000
Don't be afraid.

425
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:16,889
Hey.

426
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,311
Don't drift off on us, Burke.

427
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:24,981
I'll be all right.

428
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:28,234
I'm not going to sleep.

429
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:37,326
Oh, you motherfucker.

430
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:45,710
Where is my goddamn kid
when I need him?

431
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,173
Fuck it.

432
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:03,769
Fuck.

433
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:42,159
Oh, Jesus, God.

434
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,121
Hey. Hey!

435
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:51,836
Oh, Jesus, God.

436
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:56,882
No, no, no, no.

437
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:58,592
Fuck!

438
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,344
Hernandez!

439
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:02,304
Shit!

440
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:09,687
They ate him.

441
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:14,066
Jesus Christ.
They ate him.

442
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:21,115
They weren't eating him.

443
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,160
They were killing him.

444
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,330
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

445
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,499
How did we not hear him?

446
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:31,917
How many did it
take to do that?

447
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:39,341
We could dig in, make some kind of a stand.
Not much cover, though.

448
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,010
Whoa, whoa,
what do you mean "stand"?

449
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:44,388
Like, fight those motherfucking giant things?
You out of your mind?

450
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,974
They'll get bold. And
start to come in for us.

451
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:50,227
Why would they? I mean, we're not harming them.
It's not for food.

452
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:53,481
We're a threat. We don't belong here.
That's it.

453
00:37:57,777 --> 00:38:00,279
There's trees out there.

454
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,115
If we could get to that tree
line, they might back off.

455
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:05,034
If they see that we're
leaving, they might.

456
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:08,287
Fuck that! What they
might do, bullshit.

457
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,248
What they might do? Are
you fucking kidding me?

458
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:13,584
Hey. They pissed
all over this place.

459
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,754
They mean to tag it. We can't
wait them out, we'll starve.

460
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:19,215
There's a lot of bad space
between us and that forest,

461
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:22,551
but if we get there, then...

462
00:38:22,635 --> 00:38:25,471
We can better defend ourselves.

463
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:26,889
Less exposed, I don't know.

464
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:29,517
Yeah, you don't know.

465
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,561
And nobody nominated
you shit, by the way.

466
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,189
It's getting to that
point in the evening, girls.

467
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:36,690
Fucking to each his own.

468
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:38,484
What the fuck you talking about.
Diaz? Come on, man.

469
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,194
You wouldn't last five
fucking minutes out here.

470
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:43,489
I survived that.
This ain't shit.

471
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,574
I'd find a way through,
with or without you.

472
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:49,995
Fuck it. I'm gonna take whatever I
can carry and head into those trees.

473
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,289
If you guys wanna join me,
I'd strip everything.

474
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:02,049
Fuck. All right,
let's fucking do this.

475
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:17,166
Hey.

476
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,670
We should collect
all the wallets

477
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:24,089
for the families.

478
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:31,764
Wallets? Did I hear wallets?
I'll carry the wallets.

479
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:37,561
Henrick?

480
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:38,979
Do you mind carrying them?

481
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:40,522
Yeah, let's waste
a little more time.

482
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:43,567
Even though the weather's
about to kick our ass.

483
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:46,820
You grab them wallets.

484
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:49,949
Fucking idiots.

485
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:53,410
To Hernandez.

486
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:59,124
Grab as many as you can.

487
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,585
Grab as many as you can.

488
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,796
Waste as much
fucking time as you can.

489
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:06,799
I'm gonna sit here with
my friend, Jack Daniel's,

490
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:09,259
and waste some time of my own.

491
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:13,889
Why don't you just
fucking help us, man?

492
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:16,433
I'm helping you. I'm helping you.
I'm warming up, man.

493
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:18,936
You guys find any rubbers,
save them.

494
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,938
I don't know how long I'm gonna
be out here with you fairies.

495
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,648
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

496
00:41:27,945 --> 00:41:31,407
Key to survival, fellas,
getting them wallets.

497
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,409
Getting them wallets.

498
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,906
Henrick.

499
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:35,262
Wait.

500
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:43,729
I feel like we
should say something.

501
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:45,773
I mean, all these bodies,
all these...

502
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:50,819
All these people that died, it doesn't
seem right to just walk away.

503
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:04,750
I don't know any
official prayers, so, I guess...

504
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:12,341
God bless these men.
They were,

505
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:19,681
some of them, our friends, and we
could be lying here with them.

506
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:28,023
So thank you for sparing
us and helping us.

507
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:34,696
Oh, and keep that up
if you can.

508
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:05,162
Fuck!

509
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:07,789
Fuck!

510
00:45:13,212 --> 00:45:15,339
Don't worry about me,
motherfuckers!

511
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:19,051
You know, you wanna run off into
the trees, that's cool, too!

512
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:23,639
No, no, no, no. Ottway!

513
00:45:24,765 --> 00:45:27,142
Help me! Help me!

514
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:29,478
Help me!

515
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:32,731
Fuck! Flannery!

516
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:34,483
Get Off him!

517
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:36,151
Flannery!

518
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:41,156
Flannery!

519
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,574
Get away from him!

520
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:45,244
Jesus.

521
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:47,329
Flannery! Flannery!

522
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:51,583
Get Off him!

523
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,493
No.

524
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:07,409
Do you wanna say anything?

525
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:18,211
Come on, let's keep moving. There's
nothing else we can do for him.

526
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:34,811
Those trees aren't
getting any fucking closer.

527
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:37,314
We're gonna be out here
in the dark with those things.

528
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:39,024
We have no idea
if we're going toward

529
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:40,692
the den or away from it, do we?

530
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:43,028
Why didn't we just
stay with the plane?

531
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:45,197
Come on. They
would have surrounded us.

532
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,408
How the fuck do we know
they're not doing that right now?

533
00:47:48,784 --> 00:47:50,410
Fucking genius.

534
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:53,288
We're still
better off in the trees.

535
00:47:53,372 --> 00:47:57,501
Yeah, we're better off.
Go tell that kid, you fuck.

536
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:18,814
Hey, what is that?

537
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:24,403
Run!

538
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:25,612
Go! Go!
Get into the trees!

539
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:26,738
Mother of Christ!

540
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:31,910
Go, go, go!

541
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:33,328
Jesus, they're right on us!

542
00:48:33,412 --> 00:48:35,080
Don't stop moving!

543
00:48:36,248 --> 00:48:38,291
Wait, wait,
wait! Wait!

544
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:44,548
Don't look back!
Run! Run!

545
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,175
They're flanking us!

546
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,636
Don't stop!

547
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,605
You see them?
You see them?

548
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:03,275
They're all around us.

549
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:05,777
We need a fire to
keep them off us. Hurry!

550
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:10,031
The Wood's wet.
Whole thing's wet.

551
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,491
Hurry, hurry!

552
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:16,705
Get that fucking thing lit.

553
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:22,794
Come on, baby, come on.

554
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:24,921
Tell me that thing's not broke.

555
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:26,965
Damn this thing.

556
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,216
Just get it going, Ottway.

557
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,634
Light! Light!

558
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:32,721
That's it, that's it.

559
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:37,142
- It's going out.
- Fuck!

560
00:49:43,732 --> 00:49:44,983
Jesus, come on!

561
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:46,359
Smother...
Don't smother it.

562
00:50:06,755 --> 00:50:08,089
It worked.

563
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:10,592
We should start
perimeter fires.

564
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,552
Let's see these bastards
before they come for us.

565
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:39,871
What the fuck was that?

566
00:50:40,497 --> 00:50:42,832
The alpha. They went at him.

567
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:46,294
He put it down.

568
00:50:47,337 --> 00:50:51,258
Whatever that challenge was,
the alpha put it down.

569
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:55,554
How are we gonna
deal with this?

570
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:58,181
We kill them,

571
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:00,684
one at a time.

572
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:04,646
Tip the numbers. That's
what they're doing to us.

573
00:51:22,372 --> 00:51:23,915
What the hell are these for?

574
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:25,292
I'll explain.

575
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:27,252
Friction tape, electrical tape.

576
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:28,753
Talget, you had some, yeah?

577
00:51:28,837 --> 00:51:29,921
It's in there somewhere.

578
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,548
Shotgun shell.

579
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:34,759
Spear tip.

580
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:38,972
The tip has to drive into the
primer to set off the shell.

581
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:41,600
Secure them with these sticks,

582
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:43,268
a little bit of tape, simple.

583
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:47,772
You jab with it when
the wolf gets close.

584
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:51,526
Hit them hard.
Let it get real close.

585
00:51:53,403 --> 00:51:54,779
It'll work.

586
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:57,449
It's like a bang stick.

587
00:51:57,532 --> 00:52:00,410
The round discharges,
you pull it loose,

588
00:52:01,411 --> 00:52:04,664
you still got something
sharp to create distance.

589
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:07,292
Unless you wanna
fist fight them.

590
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:09,502
There you go.

591
00:52:10,462 --> 00:52:13,715
One shot a piece, guys.
Make them count. Burke.

592
00:52:17,052 --> 00:52:18,720
Blacken the tips
in the fire, guys.

593
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:20,722
It makes them harder, stronger.

594
00:52:23,058 --> 00:52:24,726
Really, boys?

595
00:52:25,644 --> 00:52:27,729
This is what it's
come down to, huh?

596
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,648
This MacGyver bullshit?

597
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:34,235
Okay.

598
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,571
Good.

599
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,452
I appreciate a good laugh
as much as the next guy.

600
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:56,049
These things,
they see well at night?

601
00:52:56,132 --> 00:52:59,260
Jesus, can we talk about
something else, please?

602
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:02,931
Talget, you're carrying all that booze.
Let's break it out.

603
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:04,891
I recommend
rationing what we have.

604
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:07,185
I recommend you kissing my ass.

605
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:09,646
What are you,
the booze police now?

606
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:12,607
You fucking guys with your rules
and your orders and bullshit.

607
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:15,402
Where are we?

608
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:17,445
Look around.

609
00:53:18,113 --> 00:53:22,450
This is Fucked City,
population five and dwindling.

610
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:31,209
Two days, three maybe, if we
really pull our shit together.

611
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:35,755
And who's in charge of that right now?
This fucking guy?

612
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:38,800
The Great White hunter?

613
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:44,973
And his jerry-rigged
fucking wolf sticks?

614
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,811
Why are you constantly breaking balls
and bitching about everything?

615
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:52,939
'Cause I wanna live, motherfucker.
You understand that?

616
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:55,734
I don't want some timber wolf
shitting me out on this mountain.

617
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:58,027
You're scared.

618
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:01,156
What?

619
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:05,243
You don't need all that nonsense,
all that chest-puff bullshit.

620
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:06,536
What's wrong with being scared?

621
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:09,414
I'm not scared.

622
00:54:09,998 --> 00:54:11,666
You're not?
No.

623
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:14,252
I'm terrified.

624
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:15,587
I can tell.

625
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,589
And not an ounce of
shame in saying it.

626
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:19,924
I'm scared shitless.

627
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:22,343
That's because you're a punk.

628
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:26,806
I don't walk through this
world with fear in my heart.

629
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:29,225
You picked that up in the pen?

630
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:32,187
Somebody scribble that
on the day room wall?

631
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:35,523
You better take it easy,
motherfucker.

632
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:40,361
Talking tough means jack shit now.
You're not scared?

633
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:44,282
You're a fool.
Worse, you're a fucking liar.

634
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:46,659
I should have checked your
chin at the fucking plane.

635
00:54:46,743 --> 00:54:48,995
Get up, come on,
get up, you big Irish fuck.

636
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,122
You wanna knuckle up... Hey, Diaz,
put the fucking knife away.

637
00:54:51,206 --> 00:54:52,540
We don't have time for this.
Get the fuck off me!

638
00:54:52,624 --> 00:54:54,042
Hey, Diaz, put the knife away.
Shut up!

639
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:55,543
Shut up, you chickenshits
make me sick.

640
00:54:56,795 --> 00:54:58,004
Son of a bitch!

641
00:54:58,087 --> 00:54:59,297
You got that kid
Flannery killed

642
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,673
and you're not
gonna get me killed.

643
00:55:00,757 --> 00:55:02,675
Put your fucking hands up. Let
me show you how this is done.

644
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:04,219
Put your fucking hands up.

645
00:55:05,637 --> 00:55:08,473
Fuck! You motherfucker!

646
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:12,477
You cut this shit out.
Do you hear me?

647
00:55:39,963 --> 00:55:42,173
Get up, get up, get up.

648
00:56:30,597 --> 00:56:32,223
What the fuck?

649
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:34,475
What did it want?

650
00:56:35,143 --> 00:56:36,436
You.

651
00:56:56,873 --> 00:56:59,334
Diaz, please don't do
that shit to me again.

652
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:02,170
All right?

653
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:15,808
No mas.

654
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,324
It was bullshit.

655
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:34,702
I'm sorry.

656
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:37,747
I'm so...

657
00:57:38,665 --> 00:57:40,208
Get it off! Get it off!

658
00:58:01,104 --> 00:58:02,855
Fuck!

659
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:05,483
Bite me, you fuck!
Come here, you fuck!

660
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,946
Fuck!

661
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:11,781
Fuck!

662
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:15,702
Hey, Diaz, I think you got him.

663
00:58:16,828 --> 00:58:17,912
Yeah!

664
00:58:20,248 --> 00:58:22,583
You fuck! Fuck!

665
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:26,421
I think I lost a nail.

666
00:58:30,758 --> 00:58:33,261
Is that the big one?
That big fucker?

667
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:35,430
It's not the alpha.

668
00:58:35,972 --> 00:58:38,599
It's an omega, an outcast.

669
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:42,270
They sent it in to test you, Diaz.

670
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:46,107
Did I pass, bitch?
Did I fucking pass?

671
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:49,110
You fucking dog.

672
00:59:09,005 --> 00:59:12,467
Let's get a large branch,
sharpen the end of it,

673
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:15,053
shove it up this thing's ass.

674
00:59:15,136 --> 00:59:16,763
We're gonna cook
this son of a bitch.

675
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:22,310
And then we're gonna eat it.

676
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:27,982
Hey, wolf,

677
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,360
not so tough now, huh, wolf?

678
00:59:33,488 --> 00:59:34,655
- You want it?
- No.

679
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:36,783
Come on. I got it, I got it.
I don't...

680
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:39,952
Is this the white
meat or the dark meat?

681
00:59:40,036 --> 00:59:42,080
Make it as black as possible.
Put it there.

682
00:59:42,163 --> 00:59:44,332
Yeah? I know it tastes
like shit but, guys,

683
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:46,959
it might be the last meat
we'll get for a while.

684
00:59:47,043 --> 00:59:48,920
It's gristly, too.

685
00:59:49,796 --> 00:59:51,881
It tastes like shit, I know, but
Yeah.

686
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:54,133
It tastes like dog shit.

687
00:59:55,676 --> 00:59:57,303
And I'm much more of
a cat person, really.

688
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:06,479
Burke?

689
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:08,356
Yeah?
You all right?

690
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:10,441
My head's a
little off. I'm...

691
01:00:10,525 --> 01:00:11,901
Sit down, sit down.

692
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:13,361
...feeling a little dizzy.

693
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:15,863
That's it.

694
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:29,293
You think they're watching us?

695
01:00:29,377 --> 01:00:31,337
Yeah, they're watching us.

696
01:00:32,505 --> 01:00:36,467
You fuck with us
and we'll fuck with you.

697
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:38,636
You hear that?

698
01:00:41,139 --> 01:00:43,057
You're not the animals!

699
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:46,144
We're the animals!

700
01:00:52,275 --> 01:00:55,778
Come here, you fucker.
Come here, you puppy.

701
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:01,534
Oh, yeah.

702
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:05,538
You're a twisted fuck. You're wrong for that.
That is wrong.

703
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:09,876
Nothing's fucking... I'm not crazy.
I'm not fucking crazy.

704
01:01:09,959 --> 01:01:11,961
You fuck.

705
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:14,130
That's fucked up.

706
01:01:14,213 --> 01:01:15,506
I mean, that's fucked up.

707
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:18,593
Ah, you try to steal
my fucking life.

708
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:23,431
Come on, you fuck.

709
01:01:27,435 --> 01:01:29,437
You hear the bones cracking, Diaz.
Come on, that's enough.

710
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,189
Fucking mutt. Come on.

711
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:32,356
Let him have this.

712
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,276
Little Fido here
wants to go home.

713
01:01:36,194 --> 01:01:37,570
Wants to see his brothers.

714
01:01:37,653 --> 01:01:39,906
Jesus Christ. Stop.

715
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:43,784
That's what I'm gonna do. I'm
gonna help him get there.

716
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:55,087
Say goodbye, boys.

717
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:13,981
Take him back, motherfucker!

718
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:18,004
We should keep moving.

719
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:32,059
Those goddamn things
are calling us out.

720
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:34,729
What the hell are
you talking about, Talget?

721
01:03:34,812 --> 01:03:38,691
Wolves are the only animal
that will seek revenge.

722
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:41,569
Hey, I don't want to hear
any more about the fucking wolves,

723
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:43,571
or you're gonna start
seeing them everywhere.

724
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:47,992
Burke, how are you doing?

725
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:51,412
I can't breathe.
I can't keep going.

726
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:53,414
Ottway, we can't keep going.

727
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:54,582
We can't stop.

728
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:57,418
Those things will be all over us.
We gotta keep going.

729
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:02,590
Ottway,
Burke is hurting here, man.

730
01:04:08,346 --> 01:04:10,056
This will work.

731
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,852
It's a dead end.

732
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:16,896
They can't get in behind us.

733
01:04:17,355 --> 01:04:20,024
They'll have to hit us
from out front.

734
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:22,360
Let's build a fire.

735
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:32,411
That thing still working?

736
01:04:32,495 --> 01:04:34,288
Up to 40,000 feet.

737
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:38,042
This shit had to save somebody
at some point, right?

738
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:40,419
I keep sitting here thinking.

739
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:42,546
Even with all
this stuff going on,

740
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:45,716
we hit the ground
at 400 miles an hour,

741
01:04:47,218 --> 01:04:48,844
and we made it.

742
01:04:50,221 --> 01:04:52,723
Why would we go through something
like that, that crash,

743
01:04:52,807 --> 01:04:54,809
if it wasn't meant to be,

744
01:04:55,643 --> 01:04:57,728
or ordained?

745
01:04:57,812 --> 01:04:58,938
BY Who?

746
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:01,607
The Almighty?

747
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:03,734
That fucking fairy tale?

748
01:05:03,818 --> 01:05:06,445
How about good
old-fashioned blind luck?

749
01:05:06,821 --> 01:05:09,532
Flannery survived that
crash, so did Hernandez.

750
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:10,741
It don't matter.

751
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:14,328
Fate doesn't give a fuck.

752
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:17,915
Dead is dead.

753
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,627
Where do you think
those boys are now?

754
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:24,755
Up in heaven?
Being fitted for wings?

755
01:05:26,841 --> 01:05:29,301
No, I'll tell you
where they are.

756
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:33,347
They're not. That's where.

757
01:05:35,433 --> 01:05:38,436
They're nowhere.
They're gone.

758
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,772
No, I don't believe it.

759
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:44,900
I do.

760
01:05:46,527 --> 01:05:48,154
I Wish I didn't.

761
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:52,533
I really wish I could
believe in that stuff.

762
01:05:54,118 --> 01:05:56,579
This is real, the cold.

763
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:01,709
That's real.
The air in my lungs.

764
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:05,880
Those bastards out there
in the dark stalking us.

765
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:10,885
It's this world that I'm worried
about, Talget, not the next.

766
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:12,928
What about your faith?

767
01:06:13,596 --> 01:06:15,181
What about it?

768
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:17,892
It's important.

769
01:06:21,896 --> 01:06:23,898
Emma?
Is she with you guys?

770
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:25,065
It's okay, big guy.

771
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:27,026
She's was at the back.
I was speaking with her.

772
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:29,028
She's...
She's not here.

773
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:30,154
She's...

774
01:06:30,237 --> 01:06:31,489
Yeah, she's not here yet.
Why don't you...

775
01:06:31,572 --> 01:06:33,324
You tell her that I'm here.

776
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:36,994
Of course, yeah. Just
lie down, she's coming.

777
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:39,747
Emma's coming. Yeah.

778
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,085
He's seeing things?

779
01:06:45,169 --> 01:06:47,505
He's hallucinating.
It's hypoxia.

780
01:06:47,588 --> 01:06:49,924
Not enough oxygen's
getting to his brain.

781
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:51,300
Hypoxia.

782
01:06:52,593 --> 01:06:54,094
Why don't the rest
of us have it?

783
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:59,141
It depends on the person. Some
people can't handle the altitude.

784
01:07:02,436 --> 01:07:03,687
Who's Emma?

785
01:07:03,771 --> 01:07:05,773
She was his sister.

786
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:09,944
She died when he was a kid.

787
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:17,952
My daughter, Mary.

788
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,707
She's got really long hair
almost down to her waist.

789
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:26,710
In fact, it's the one rule
my fucking ex respects,

790
01:07:26,794 --> 01:07:30,548
which is that I'm the only
one who cuts her hair.

791
01:07:30,631 --> 01:07:34,218
She does this thing. She'll
come and hover over me.

792
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:37,054
I'll just be dead asleep,

793
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:39,390
and she'll start swinging
her head back and forth,

794
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:42,726
tickling me with
her hair all in my face,

795
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:46,480
and she'll be
laughing like crazy.

796
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:50,818
It's a certain type
of laugh, you know,

797
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:53,320
when the kid goes past laughing
to laughing, like a...

798
01:07:54,655 --> 01:07:57,074
You know, like you
can't really breathe,

799
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:59,994
sounding more like
an old man than a kid.

800
01:08:06,584 --> 01:08:09,086
I miss the hell
out of that kid.

801
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:10,838
Yeah.

802
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:13,549
You should.
You know that?

803
01:08:15,384 --> 01:08:19,013
Those things from your life,
whatever they might be,

804
01:08:21,265 --> 01:08:24,685
make you want that next
minute more than the last.

805
01:08:25,603 --> 01:08:27,354
Make you fight for it.

806
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:34,028
I just wanna
fuck one more time.

807
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:38,782
See, you ruined
my story, motherfucker.

808
01:08:38,866 --> 01:08:40,200
No. No, man.

809
01:08:40,284 --> 01:08:42,703
I'm telling a nice little sweet
story about my daughter...

810
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:44,121
I don't mean to
wreck your shit.

811
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:45,331
I know, I know.

812
01:08:45,414 --> 01:08:48,125
I just can't go out on that last
piece of horrible ass that I had.

813
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:51,128
You know what I'm saying? A
53-year-old hooker, half-Eskimo.

814
01:08:51,253 --> 01:08:52,838
We shouldn't talk about that.

815
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,215
She was 250, 260.

816
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:57,217
No shit.

817
01:08:57,885 --> 01:08:59,803
The bitch gave me the clap
like it was gift wrapped.

818
01:08:59,887 --> 01:09:01,847
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

819
01:09:09,104 --> 01:09:10,314
Anyway...

820
01:09:10,731 --> 01:09:13,233
No, I just think
that I would punch out

821
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:16,320
and that would be my
fucking swan song, right?

822
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:21,533
That alone is worth the fight.

823
01:09:22,284 --> 01:09:24,411
That's worth the fight.

824
01:09:24,495 --> 01:09:25,913
My...

825
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:30,584
My dad was not without love...

826
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,672
Why didn't we catch...

827
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:37,091
Not ready to.

828
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:43,889
...but a clichéd Irish
motherfucker when he wanted to be.

829
01:09:44,973 --> 01:09:47,518
<i>Drinker, brawler,
all that stuff.</i>

830
01:09:49,103 --> 01:09:50,854
<i>Never shed a tear.</i>

831
01:09:51,355 --> 01:09:53,357
Saw weakness everywhere.

832
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:04,702
But he had this thing
for poems, poetry,

833
01:10:04,785 --> 01:10:06,954
reading them, quoting them.

834
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:10,708
Probably thought it rounded
him off, you know.

835
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,921
His way of apologizing,
I guess.

836
01:10:18,632 --> 01:10:22,136
<i>And there was one that hung
over the desk in his den.</i>

837
01:10:22,553 --> 01:10:27,057
<i>It was only when I was a lot older,
I realized he had written it.</i>

838
01:10:28,851 --> 01:10:32,312
It was untitled, four lines.

839
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:36,191
I read it at his funeral.

840
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:42,990
"Once more into the fray"

841
01:10:44,575 --> 01:10:47,453
"Into the last good fight
I'll ever know"

842
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:51,749
"Live and die on this day"

843
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:56,253
"Live and die on this day"

844
01:11:26,784 --> 01:11:27,993
Storm clouds.

845
01:11:28,827 --> 01:11:29,870
Blizzard?

846
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:31,705
A good bet.

847
01:11:32,164 --> 01:11:33,832
Based on our luck,

848
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:36,668
it's a fucking lock.

849
01:11:36,752 --> 01:11:40,088
Let's bundle Burke up
and dig in against these trees.

850
01:11:40,589 --> 01:11:42,966
The snow's deep enough.

851
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:46,929
I'm worried if we lose this
fire, we'll all freeze.

852
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:03,987
Burke, wake up!
Come on. Move your arms!

853
01:12:04,071 --> 01:12:07,074
Let me see you move your arms!
Come on, move!

854
01:12:08,116 --> 01:12:11,537
Burke, wake up! Burke, you big bastard!
Wake up!

855
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:14,331
Don't sleep, you hear me?
Don't sleep! Wake up!

856
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:15,541
Come on, Burke!

857
01:12:15,624 --> 01:12:18,627
Burke, come on,
wake up! Burke!

858
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:25,843
Burke! Burke! Wake up!

859
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:28,178
Wake up! Wake up!

860
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:32,933
Wake up, bugger! Wake up.

861
01:14:10,989 --> 01:14:12,574
Don't be afraid.

862
01:14:39,768 --> 01:14:41,144
What is it?

863
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:45,023
Guys, get up. Up.

864
01:14:45,107 --> 01:14:48,110
What is it?
Is it them?

865
01:14:58,078 --> 01:14:59,371
Saw marks.

866
01:15:01,415 --> 01:15:03,583
These trees have been logged.

867
01:15:05,711 --> 01:15:07,170
That's water.

868
01:15:08,422 --> 01:15:10,424
That sounds like a river.

869
01:15:28,942 --> 01:15:31,111
You gotta be shitting me.

870
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:34,531
The river must be a good size
if we can hear it all the way up here.

871
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:36,158
At least if
we're following a river,

872
01:15:36,241 --> 01:15:37,784
we got a better chance
of finding shelter.

873
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:41,455
Who's climbing down that?

874
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:43,957
I can't.
There's no way I can do that.

875
01:15:44,041 --> 01:15:46,043
Well, we can't go back.

876
01:15:46,126 --> 01:15:48,962
There's no way we can go back.

877
01:15:49,046 --> 01:15:51,173
Those trees, though.

878
01:15:51,256 --> 01:15:53,050
What trees?

879
01:15:53,133 --> 01:15:54,968
Right over there.

880
01:15:55,052 --> 01:15:56,928
Get a tether of some kind,

881
01:15:57,012 --> 01:16:00,307
secure it between here and
there, we can climb down.

882
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:03,643
Guys, it's simple.

883
01:16:03,727 --> 01:16:06,146
It's the wolves or those trees.

884
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:09,524
You're not talking
about jumping off the cliff?

885
01:16:09,608 --> 01:16:12,611
It's an idea. I
didn't say it was a good one.

886
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:16,823
He's talking about
jumping off the cliff.

887
01:16:32,422 --> 01:16:35,675
This will wind up being one of
those wild stories you tell at a party,

888
01:16:35,759 --> 01:16:37,844
pretty girl on your lap.

889
01:16:39,012 --> 01:16:40,889
All right.
Are you ready?

890
01:16:40,972 --> 01:16:42,599
Yeah, why not?

891
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:45,685
Don't get a good running
start, get a great one.

892
01:16:45,769 --> 01:16:47,354
Now you'll freefall
about 30 feet,

893
01:16:47,437 --> 01:16:49,231
but it's gonna
feel like 30,000.

894
01:16:49,314 --> 01:16:52,150
Is this supposed to
pass for a pep talk?

895
01:16:52,234 --> 01:16:54,569
When we feel this go taut,
we'll take up the slack

896
01:16:54,653 --> 01:16:56,988
to stop you from
hitting too hard.

897
01:16:57,072 --> 01:16:58,865
You get in there.

898
01:16:58,949 --> 01:17:00,408
I'll figure it out.

899
01:17:00,492 --> 01:17:02,702
If you gotta go, this is a
pretty cool way to go, bro.

900
01:17:02,786 --> 01:17:05,914
Better a flying leap
than those fucking wolves.

901
01:17:16,967 --> 01:17:18,969
I hope there's
something down there.

902
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:25,976
Fuck.

903
01:17:26,059 --> 01:17:28,228
Go! Go, go! Go! Go!

904
01:17:38,363 --> 01:17:39,614
Fuck!

905
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,161
Which one of you fuckers...

906
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:48,373
Grab him! Grab him!

907
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:52,586
Pull me up!

908
01:17:54,588 --> 01:17:56,381
Fuck, pull me back!

909
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:03,722
Henrick?

910
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:10,770
Henrick, you in there?

911
01:18:12,189 --> 01:18:14,274
Yeah!
I'm all right!

912
01:18:26,453 --> 01:18:29,331
Anyone with
an urge to go first?

913
01:18:29,414 --> 01:18:31,374
Talget? Diaz?

914
01:18:33,126 --> 01:18:34,377
I'll go.

915
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,346
Don't stay out there too long.

916
01:18:44,429 --> 01:18:45,722
Henrick!

917
01:18:46,473 --> 01:18:48,350
Make sure that thing is secure!

918
01:18:49,476 --> 01:18:52,646
It's secure, but I don't
know how long it's gonna last!

919
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:54,856
Don't spend a lot
of time out there!

920
01:18:58,235 --> 01:18:59,569
You all right?

921
01:18:59,653 --> 01:19:00,779
You go.

922
01:19:00,862 --> 01:19:03,698
What about your hand?
I'm all right.

923
01:19:03,782 --> 01:19:06,159
Go ahead, just haul me in
if anything goes wrong.

924
01:19:06,243 --> 01:19:07,327
Yeah.

925
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:13,166
I just fucking hate heights, man.
It flips me out.

926
01:19:14,084 --> 01:19:15,210
Well, then you go,
I'll stay and make sure...

927
01:19:15,293 --> 01:19:17,796
No, no. I'm good.
You cross.

928
01:19:17,879 --> 01:19:21,174
Seriously, give me a minute,
get my head around it.

929
01:19:21,758 --> 01:19:25,220
All right,
I'm through! I'm across!

930
01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:26,763
I'm coming!

931
01:19:34,104 --> 01:19:37,190
All right,
I'm coming across now.

932
01:19:50,495 --> 01:19:51,997
Okay.

933
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,500
Come on, you can do this.

934
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:58,128
You can do this.
You can do this.

935
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:02,799
Come on.

936
01:20:06,303 --> 01:20:09,097
Talget, are you ready?

937
01:21:30,595 --> 01:21:32,889
Talget, stop fucking around!

938
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:34,516
Move your ass!

939
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:58,873
Talget!

940
01:22:31,448 --> 01:22:33,408
Hey, baby girl.

941
01:22:38,788 --> 01:22:41,291
Hey, baby girl.

942
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,837
I love you, Daddy.

943
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:53,386
No, God, no!

944
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:54,471
They're fucking killing him!

945
01:22:54,554 --> 01:22:55,722
- Get to him!
- Go! Go!

946
01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:57,724
Go... Get down there!

947
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,393
They're taking him!

948
01:23:00,977 --> 01:23:02,145
Talget!

949
01:23:09,819 --> 01:23:11,237
They fucking took him.

950
01:23:11,321 --> 01:23:12,405
No, no!

951
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:14,741
OW! Fuck! Ah!

952
01:23:17,911 --> 01:23:19,287
Talget!

953
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:21,122
They took him.
Talget!

954
01:23:21,206 --> 01:23:24,042
They fucking took him.
They took him.

955
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:33,051
My knee.
My fucking knee.

956
01:23:53,488 --> 01:23:56,407
They're just picking
us off one by one.

957
01:23:59,994 --> 01:24:03,206
I'm fucked.
I'm fucked. My knee!

958
01:24:04,165 --> 01:24:05,500
Let's get you up.
I can't...

959
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:06,584
Let's get you up.
I can%.Fuck!

960
01:24:06,668 --> 01:24:07,794
Get up.

961
01:24:08,795 --> 01:24:10,713
Fucking things.

962
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:21,558
They're not gonna
let us go, are they?

963
01:24:30,358 --> 01:24:32,026
What do you do?

964
01:26:08,373 --> 01:26:09,707
Fuck!

965
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:38,903
Fuck, fuck.

966
01:27:03,553 --> 01:27:04,679
Forget it.

967
01:27:12,061 --> 01:27:15,148
Whatever I had in the tank,
I used back there.

968
01:27:17,066 --> 01:27:18,317
I'm beat.

969
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:22,488
I just wanna sit.

970
01:27:23,156 --> 01:27:24,699
I just wanna

971
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:29,162
stop this bullshit.

972
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:33,708
Fucking leg.

973
01:27:37,628 --> 01:27:40,381
My ankle's fucked.

974
01:27:40,465 --> 01:27:42,467
Diaz, don't sit down.

975
01:27:43,426 --> 01:27:44,510
Don't sit down.

976
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:46,721
I know. I know.

977
01:27:48,765 --> 01:27:50,641
I don't wanna argue.

978
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:53,978
I just wanna rest.

979
01:28:07,158 --> 01:28:09,494
I just had
the clearest thought.

980
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:16,542
I'm done.

981
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:20,254
I'm done.

982
01:28:22,924 --> 01:28:24,550
Come on, man. Up.

983
01:28:27,553 --> 01:28:30,556
There could be a cabin
downriver right there.

984
01:28:31,682 --> 01:28:34,644
That's a mile up,
at least, brother.

985
01:28:34,727 --> 01:28:36,604
I can't walk that, man.

986
01:28:38,898 --> 01:28:40,691
I can't walk 50 feet.

987
01:28:46,113 --> 01:28:47,365
Fuck it.

988
01:28:50,243 --> 01:28:51,452
Fuck it.

989
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:58,584
I gave it a shot.

990
01:29:05,091 --> 01:29:07,593
What the fuck, man?
Are you serious?

991
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:10,930
I really thought this
fucking watch would work.

992
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:22,817
Does it slide over you?

993
01:29:25,862 --> 01:29:30,199
You told Lewenden back in the
plane that it slides over you.

994
01:29:32,827 --> 01:29:33,995
Death.

995
01:29:38,374 --> 01:29:40,001
That it was warm.

996
01:29:41,794 --> 01:29:43,546
Is that true?
Yeah.

997
01:29:46,799 --> 01:29:48,426
We carry him.

998
01:29:48,509 --> 01:29:51,304
We put a litter together and
slide him down the banks.

999
01:29:57,935 --> 01:30:00,271
I'm not going
anywhere, Henrick.

1000
01:30:02,148 --> 01:30:03,774
I don't want to.

1001
01:30:06,903 --> 01:30:08,529
I don't need to.

1002
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:15,411
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

1003
01:30:16,412 --> 01:30:20,082
Is that it? You're just gonna sit there?
Is that what you want?

1004
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:22,376
Yeah.
After what we survived?

1005
01:30:24,378 --> 01:30:26,130
That's exactly why.

1006
01:30:29,467 --> 01:30:32,053
What I got waiting
for me back there?

1007
01:30:34,722 --> 01:30:37,141
I'm gonna sit on
a drill all day.

1008
01:30:38,935 --> 01:30:42,563
Get drunk all night.
That's my life?

1009
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:48,361
Turn around and look at that.

1010
01:30:50,363 --> 01:30:52,615
I feel like that's all for me.

1011
01:30:55,159 --> 01:30:56,869
How do I beat that?

1012
01:30:58,621 --> 01:31:00,623
When would it ever be better?

1013
01:31:04,085 --> 01:31:05,836
I can't explain it.

1014
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:11,425
I don't have
the words, brother.

1015
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:32,905
My first name is John.

1016
01:31:43,082 --> 01:31:44,917
My first name is Pete.

1017
01:31:46,335 --> 01:31:47,545
Pete.

1018
01:31:49,046 --> 01:31:50,840
You look like a Pete.

1019
01:32:04,895 --> 01:32:06,439
John Ottway.

1020
01:32:09,483 --> 01:32:11,610
Of course that's your name.

1021
01:32:14,572 --> 01:32:16,157
Thank you, John.

1022
01:32:18,075 --> 01:32:20,911
Thank you.

1023
01:32:29,086 --> 01:32:30,463
Luck.

1024
01:33:48,374 --> 01:33:49,917
I'm not afraid.

1025
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:22,491
Can I ask you something?

1026
01:34:24,785 --> 01:34:25,911
Yeah.

1027
01:34:26,912 --> 01:34:28,414
Where were you
going that night?

1028
01:34:30,207 --> 01:34:31,417
<i>That last night in camp.</i>

1029
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:33,586
Get the fuck out of here!

1030
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:35,754
<i>At the bar.</i>

1031
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:45,181
<i>You had your rifle,</i>

1032
01:34:45,264 --> 01:34:46,432
<i>you went out...</i>

1033
01:34:48,142 --> 01:34:49,351
<i>My shift.</i>

1034
01:34:49,476 --> 01:34:50,728
<i>No.</i>

1035
01:34:52,271 --> 01:34:54,523
<i>You worked that morning,
I remember.</i>

1036
01:34:56,317 --> 01:34:57,943
I went out, yeah.

1037
01:35:00,779 --> 01:35:02,364
With your rifle.

1038
01:35:10,456 --> 01:35:11,540
Did you follow me?

1039
01:35:15,044 --> 01:35:16,086
No.

1040
01:35:19,215 --> 01:35:21,800
<i>But I never thought
I'd see you alive again.</i>

1041
01:35:24,929 --> 01:35:27,431
Back there with Diaz.

1042
01:35:27,514 --> 01:35:29,141
That look he had.

1043
01:35:30,017 --> 01:35:32,186
I've only seen
it one other time.

1044
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,648
On you.

1045
01:35:35,731 --> 01:35:37,691
That last night in camp.

1046
01:35:50,162 --> 01:35:52,790
It really doesn't
matter now, does it?

1047
01:35:55,668 --> 01:35:57,836
No, I don't suppose it does.

1048
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:19,692
Henrick, run. Run!

1049
01:36:45,426 --> 01:36:46,677
Henrick!

1050
01:37:04,153 --> 01:37:05,571
Henrick!

1051
01:37:12,786 --> 01:37:14,038
Henrick!

1052
01:37:24,381 --> 01:37:25,591
Henrick!

1053
01:37:35,934 --> 01:37:37,144
Henrick.

1054
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:45,944
Henrick, move on.

1055
01:37:50,574 --> 01:37:51,575
Come on.

1056
01:37:52,785 --> 01:37:54,036
What the fuck are you doing?

1057
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:58,624
Hold your breath.

1058
01:38:04,797 --> 01:38:05,798
Hold your breath.

1059
01:38:06,673 --> 01:38:08,300
Hold your breath.

1060
01:38:11,095 --> 01:38:12,471
God damn it, hold your breath.

1061
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:37,996
Jesus. Please,
don't do this.

1062
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:03,499
Do something.

1063
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:09,129
Do something.

1064
01:40:12,341 --> 01:40:15,177
You phony, prick,

1065
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:17,804
fraudulent motherfucker.

1066
01:40:19,264 --> 01:40:20,933
Do something!

1067
01:40:21,475 --> 01:40:23,143
Come on! Prove it!

1068
01:40:24,394 --> 01:40:26,480
Fuck faith, earn it!

1069
01:40:28,065 --> 01:40:29,942
Show me something real.

1070
01:40:32,486 --> 01:40:35,906
I need it now. Not later, now.

1071
01:40:38,450 --> 01:40:41,745
Show me, and I'll believe
in you till the day I die.

1072
01:40:42,371 --> 01:40:45,082
I swear. I'm calling on you.

1073
01:40:47,084 --> 01:40:48,585
I'm calling on you!

1074
01:41:15,529 --> 01:41:18,031
Fuck it. I'll do it myself.

1075
01:41:24,788 --> 01:41:26,456
I'll do it myself.

1076
01:46:47,986 --> 01:46:49,237
A den.

1077
01:46:52,115 --> 01:46:54,075
It's their fucking den.

1078
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:38,745
Don't be afraid.

1079
01:48:54,988 --> 01:48:56,948
"Once more into the fray"

1080
01:48:58,491 --> 01:49:01,244
"Into the last good
fight I'll ever know"

1081
01:49:02,871 --> 01:49:06,750
"Live and die on this day"

1082
01:49:08,168 --> 01:49:11,796
"Live and die"

1083
01:49:14,299 --> 01:49:16,051
<i>"on this day"</i>
