1
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,502
Are you here to kill me?

2
00:02:20,177 --> 00:02:22,678
I know what this is.

3
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:28,893
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

4
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:34,398
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

5
00:02:37,402 --> 00:02:42,532
A man possessed
of some radical notions.

6
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,247
What is the most resilient parasite?

7
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,875
A bacteria? A virus?

8
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,710
An intestinal worm?

9
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:56,295
Uh...

10
00:02:56,463 --> 00:02:58,089
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say...

11
00:02:58,257 --> 00:02:59,465
An idea.

12
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,261
Resilient.
Highly contagious.

13
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:07,423
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

14
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:12,144
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood, that sticks.

15
00:03:12,312 --> 00:03:13,563
Right in there somewhere.

16
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,273
For someone like you to steal?

17
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,401
Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered...

18
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,987
and that makes your thoughts
vulnerable to theft.

19
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:22,405
It's called extraction.

20
00:03:22,573 --> 00:03:26,117
Mr. Saito, we can train
your subconscious to defend itself...

21
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:28,786
from even the most skilled extractor.

22
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:30,121
How can you do that?

23
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:33,124
Because I am the most skilled extractor.

24
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:37,003
I know how to search your mind
and find your secrets. I know the tricks.

25
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,089
And I can teach them to you,
so that even when you're asleep...

26
00:03:40,257 --> 00:03:42,592
your defense is never down.

27
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,430
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.

28
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,933
I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife...

29
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:53,436
better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

30
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:56,522
If this is a dream,
and you have a safe full of secrets...

31
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,025
I need to know what's in that safe.

32
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:02,653
In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

33
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:10,161
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen,
as I consider your proposal.

34
00:04:12,623 --> 00:04:13,664
He knows.

35
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,169
What's going on up there?

36
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:15,017
Saito knows.
He's playing with us.

37
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:17,770
Doesn't matter. I can get it here.
Trust me.

38
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:19,438
The information is in the safe.

39
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:21,774
He looked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.

40
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:24,194
What's she doing here?

41
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:29,992
Just head back to the room.
All right? I'll take care of this.

42
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:32,202
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.

43
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:45,298
If I jumped, would I survive?

44
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:50,053
With a clean dive, perhaps.

45
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,888
Mal, what are you doing here?

46
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:54,266
I thought you might be missing me.

47
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,726
You know that I am.

48
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,730
But I can't trust you anymore.

49
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:01,857
So what?

50
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:05,610
Looks like Arthur's taste.

51
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:09,406
Actually, the subject is partial
to postwar British painters.

52
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:12,826
Please, have a seat.

53
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:22,002
Tell me...

54
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,962
do the children miss me?

55
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:30,010
You can't imagine.

56
00:06:34,182 --> 00:06:35,265
What are you doing?

57
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:36,975
Just getting some fresh air.

58
00:06:37,393 --> 00:06:39,144
Stay where you are, Mal.

59
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,701
Goddamn it.

60
00:07:56,556 --> 00:07:58,140
Turn around.

61
00:07:58,307 --> 00:07:59,349
The gun, Dom.

62
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:09,734
Please.

63
00:08:21,873 --> 00:08:24,207
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

64
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:28,044
Did she tell you?
Or have you known all along?

65
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:33,425
That you're here to steal from me,
or that we are actually asleep?

66
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:39,932
I want to know the name
of your employer.

67
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:45,813
Ah, there's no use threatening him
in a dream, right, Mal?

68
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:48,441
That depends on what
you're threatening.

69
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,527
Killing him would just wake him up.

70
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,446
But pain...

71
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,285
Pain is in the mind.

72
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:04,207
And judging by the decor,
we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

73
00:09:15,594 --> 00:09:18,721
- What are you doing? It's too soon.
- But the dream's collapsing.

74
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:22,308
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under
a little bit longer. We're almost there.

75
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:40,493
He was close. Very close.

76
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,384
Stop him!

77
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:24,370
This isn't gonna work.
Wake him up.

78
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:47,143
He won't wake.

79
00:10:51,606 --> 00:10:52,898
- Give him the kick.
- What?

80
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:54,483
Dunk him.

81
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,404
He's out.

82
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:47,745
You came prepared, hmm?

83
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:51,750
Not even my head of security knows
this apartment. How did you find it?

84
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:56,129
It's difficult for a man of your position
to keep a love nest like this secret...

85
00:11:56,297 --> 00:11:58,840
particularly where there's
a married woman involved.

86
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:00,967
- She would never...
- Yet here we are.

87
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:04,137
- With a dilemma.
- They're getting closer.

88
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:07,099
- You got what you came for.
- Well, that's not true.

89
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:09,935
You left out a key piece of information,
didn't you?

90
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:13,271
You held something back
because you knew what we were up to.

91
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,316
- Question is, why'd you let us in at all?
- An audition.

92
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:20,445
- An audition for what?
- Doesn't matter. You failed.

93
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:23,323
We extracted every bit of information
you had in there.

94
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:26,034
But your deception was obvious.

95
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:11,329
- So leave me and go.
- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.

96
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:15,750
That corporation that hired us,
they won't accept failure.

97
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:18,044
We won't last two days.

98
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,173
Cobb?

99
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,509
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this
a little more simply.

100
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:28,430
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!

101
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:34,686
I've always hated this carpet.

102
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:39,191
It's stained and frayed
in such distinctive ways.

103
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:44,029
But very definitely made of wool.

104
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:46,573
Right now...

105
00:13:47,617 --> 00:13:50,035
I'm lying on polyester.

106
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:58,752
Which means I'm not lying
on my carpet, in my apartment.

107
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:02,881
You have lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb.

108
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:05,383
I'm still dreaming.

109
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:13,892
- How'd it go?
- Not good.

110
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:23,401
Dream within a dream, huh?
I'm impressed.

111
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:28,156
But in my dream,
you play by my rules.

112
00:14:28,324 --> 00:14:30,575
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito...

113
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:32,160
We're not in your dream.

114
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:33,912
We're in mine.

115
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,924
Asshole.
How do you mess up the carpet?

116
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:48,426
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.

117
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:50,720
I didn't know he was
gonna rub his cheek on it!

118
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:51,972
That's enough.

119
00:14:53,099 --> 00:14:54,599
You. What the hell was all that?

120
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:57,978
- I have it under control.
- I'd hate to see you out of control.

121
00:14:58,145 --> 00:15:01,940
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.

122
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,943
He's not gonna check every compartment.

123
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,736
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.

124
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,656
Listen. Every man for himself.

125
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,023
Yes, hello?

126
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:26,859
- <i>Hi, Daddy.</i>
- <i>Hi, Dad.</i>

127
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,988
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?
How you doing, huh?

128
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,366
- <i>Good.</i>
- <i>Okay, I guess.</i>

129
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:37,286
Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you, James?

130
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:41,374
<i>Yeah.
When are you coming home, Dad?</i>

131
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:47,004
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.
Not for a while, remember?

132
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,506
<i>Why?</i>

133
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,387
Look, I told you, I'm away
because I'm working, right?

134
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:57,556
<i>Grandma says you're never coming back.</i>

135
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,101
<i>Phillipa, is that you?</i>

136
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,396
Put Grandma on the phone for me,
will you?

137
00:17:03,563 --> 00:17:05,272
<i>She's shaking her head.</i>

138
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,902
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.

139
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,987
<i>Daddy?</i>

140
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:13,739
Yeah, James?

141
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,574
<i>Is Mommy with you?</i>

142
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,413
James, we talked about this.

143
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:24,041
Mommy's not here anymore.

144
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,335
<i>Where?</i>

145
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,714
<i>That's enough, kids.
Say bye-bye.</i>

146
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:33,926
Listen, I'm gonna send some presents
with Grandpa, all right?

147
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,094
And you be good, you be...

148
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:47,815
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Right.

149
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,157
Hey, are you okay?

150
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:58,200
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

151
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,786
Well, down in the dream,
Mal showing up.

152
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:04,206
Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg.
Won't happen again.

153
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,960
- It's getting worse, isn't it?
- One apology's all you're getting, all right?

154
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,629
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

155
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,257
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...

156
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,176
to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.

157
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:18,597
By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.

158
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,641
- Where you gonna go?
- Buenos Aires.

159
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:26,062
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out
a job when things quiet down. You?

160
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,439
Stateside.

161
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,149
Send my regards.

162
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,034
He sold you out. Thought to come to me
and bargain for his life.

163
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,996
So I offer you the satisfaction.

164
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,503
It's not the way I deal with things.

165
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,643
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.

166
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,521
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.

167
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,038
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.

168
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,042
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.

169
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,419
If you can steal an idea
from someone's mind...

170
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,463
why can't you plant one there instead?

171
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,715
Okay, here's me planting
an idea in your head.

172
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,219
I say, "Don't think about elephants."
What are you thinking about?

173
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,387
Elephants.

174
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:43,723
Right. But it's not your idea,
because you know I gave it to you.

175
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,893
The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea.

176
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:50,272
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- That's not true.

177
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,902
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?

178
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,738
Because I can find my own way
to square things with Cobol.

179
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,949
Then you do have a choice.

180
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,909
Then I choose to leave, sir.

181
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,499
Tell the crew where you want to go.

182
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,839
Hey, Mr. Cobb.

183
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,094
How would you like to go home?

184
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,181
To America.
To your children.

185
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,935
You can't fix that.
No one can.

186
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:32,355
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.

187
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,987
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.

188
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,699
No idea is simple when you need
to plant it in somebody else's mind.

189
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:46,620
My main competitor is
an old man in poor health.

190
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,540
His son will soon inherit control
of the corporation.

191
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:55,003
I need him to decide to break up
his father's empire.

192
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,381
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.

193
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:03,720
If I were to do this,
if I even could do it...

194
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,805
I'd need a guarantee.

195
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,225
- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.

196
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,311
But I can.

197
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:16,483
So... do you want
to take a leap of faith...

198
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,737
or become an old man,
filled with regret...

199
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,490
waiting to die alone?

200
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:30,873
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.

201
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,841
Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.

202
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,346
This can't be done.

203
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:48,808
Yes, it can.
Just have to go deep enough.

204
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,518
You don't know that.

205
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,688
I've done it before.

206
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,065
Who'd you do it to?

207
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,322
Why are we going to Paris?

208
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,617
We're gonna need a new architect.

209
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,594
You never did like your office,
did you?

210
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:30,433
No space to think
in that broom cupboard.

211
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,562
Is it safe for you to be here?

212
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,190
Extradition between France
and the United States...

213
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,568
is a bureaucratic nightmare,
you know that.

214
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:43,487
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

215
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:48,159
Look, I, uh, brought these for you
to give to the kids when you have a chance.

216
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,911
It'll take more than
the occasional stuffed animal...

217
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:54,081
to convince those children
they still have a father.

218
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:57,084
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.

219
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,753
I never taught you to be a thief.

220
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,130
No, you taught me to navigate
people's minds.

221
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:02,590
But after what happened...

222
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:06,343
there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways
for me to use that skill.

223
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:12,975
What are you doing here, Dom?

224
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,480
I think I found a way home.

225
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:21,233
It's a job for some very,
very powerful people.

226
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:25,863
People who I believe can fix
my charges permanently.

227
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:27,948
But I need your help.

228
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:31,952
You're here to corrupt
one of my brightest and best.

229
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,997
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.

230
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,624
- Money.
- Not just money.

231
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,125
You remember.

232
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:41,545
It's the chance to build cathedrals,
entire cities...

233
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,464
things that never existed...

234
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:46,842
things that couldn't exist
in the real world.

235
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:52,181
So you want me to let someone else
follow you into your fantasy?

236
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:54,308
They don't actually come into the dream.

237
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:57,770
They just design the levels
and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

238
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,146
Design it yourself.

239
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:03,317
Mal won't let me.

240
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,659
Come back to reality, Dom.

241
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:15,579
- Please.
- Reality.

242
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:18,499
Those kids, your grandchildren...

243
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:22,670
they're waiting for their father
to come back home. That's their reality.

244
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:26,006
And this job, this last job,
that's how I get there.

245
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,177
I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

246
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:36,267
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

247
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,482
I've got somebody better.

248
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,692
<i>Ariadne?</i>

249
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,822
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

250
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:50,323
Pleased to meet you.

251
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:55,161
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has
a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.

252
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:56,371
A work placement?

253
00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:58,039
Not exactly.

254
00:24:58,207 --> 00:24:59,541
I have a test for you.

255
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:02,377
You're not gonna tell me anything first?

256
00:25:02,545 --> 00:25:05,171
Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.

257
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:08,550
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

258
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:16,308
You have two minutes to design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.

259
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:19,394
Stop.

260
00:25:21,814 --> 00:25:23,023
Again.

261
00:25:25,151 --> 00:25:26,484
Stop.

262
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:31,740
You're gonna have to do better than that.

263
00:25:44,754 --> 00:25:46,004
That's more like it.

264
00:26:06,192 --> 00:26:09,110
<i>They say we only use a fraction
of our brain's true potential.</i>

265
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:10,946
<i>Now, that's when we're awake.</i>

266
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:14,115
When we're asleep,
our mind can do almost anything.

267
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:15,283
Such as?

268
00:26:15,451 --> 00:26:19,454
Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.

269
00:26:19,622 --> 00:26:23,458
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself, if you know what I mean.

270
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:25,627
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.

271
00:26:25,795 --> 00:26:28,046
Genuine inspiration, right?

272
00:26:28,214 --> 00:26:31,549
Now, in a dream,
our mind continuously does this.

273
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:36,346
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

274
00:26:36,514 --> 00:26:39,933
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.

275
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:42,811
That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.

276
00:26:42,979 --> 00:26:45,355
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.

277
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:47,148
Now, this is where I need you.

278
00:26:47,316 --> 00:26:49,693
You create the world of the dream.

279
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:55,240
We bring the subject into that dream,
and they fill it with their subconscious.

280
00:26:55,408 --> 00:27:00,078
How could I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?

281
00:27:00,246 --> 00:27:03,707
Well, dreams, they feel real
while we're in them, right?

282
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:07,585
It's only when we wake up that we realize
something was actually strange.

283
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:10,463
Let me ask you a question.

284
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:14,009
You never really remember
the beginning of a dream, do you?

285
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:17,220
You always wind up
right in the middle of what's going on.

286
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:18,430
I guess, yeah.

287
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:20,181
So how did we end up here?

288
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:22,642
Well, we just came from the, uh...

289
00:27:22,852 --> 00:27:26,271
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?

290
00:27:26,856 --> 00:27:28,773
Where are you right now?

291
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,236
We're dreaming?

292
00:27:33,404 --> 00:27:35,864
You're in the middle
of the workshop, sleeping.

293
00:27:36,032 --> 00:27:38,992
This is your first lesson
in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

294
00:28:16,323 --> 00:28:18,449
If it's just a dream,
then why are you...?

295
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:21,827
Because it's never
just a dream, is it?

296
00:28:21,995 --> 00:28:25,289
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.

297
00:28:25,457 --> 00:28:27,666
That's why the military
developed dream sharing.

298
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:31,545
It was a training program for soldiers
to shoot, stab and strangle each other...

299
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:32,838
and then wake up.

300
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:34,924
How did architects become involved?

301
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:37,843
Well, someone had to design
the dreams, right?

302
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,462
Why don't you give us
another five minutes?

303
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:42,279
Five minutes?

304
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:46,268
What...? We were talking for,
like, at least an hour.

305
00:28:46,436 --> 00:28:48,687
In a dream, your mind
functions more quickly...

306
00:28:48,855 --> 00:28:51,690
therefore time seems
to feel more slow.

307
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:55,236
Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.

308
00:28:55,946 --> 00:28:59,031
Why don't you see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

309
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:07,873
You've got the basic layout.
Bookstore, café.

310
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:09,708
Almost everything else is here too.

311
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:12,795
- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.

312
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:14,130
- Yours?
- Yes.

313
00:29:14,297 --> 00:29:16,841
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.

314
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:19,677
I am the subject.
My mind populates it.

315
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,762
You can literally talk
to my subconscious.

316
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,807
That's one of the ways we extract
information from the subject.

317
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:26,267
How else do you do it?

318
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:30,437
By creating something secure,
like a bank vault or a jail.

319
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:34,316
The mind automatically fills it
with information it's trying to protect.

320
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:37,278
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?

321
00:29:37,445 --> 00:29:38,487
Well...

322
00:29:38,655 --> 00:29:43,159
I guess I thought that the dream space
would be all about the visual...

323
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:45,161
but it's more about the feel of it.

324
00:29:45,662 --> 00:29:49,790
My question is what happens when you start
messing with the physics of it all?

325
00:30:31,124 --> 00:30:32,708
It's something, isn't it?

326
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:35,085
Yes, it is.

327
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:00,569
Why are they all looking at me?

328
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:04,240
Because my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.

329
00:31:04,407 --> 00:31:08,702
The more you change things, the quicker
the projections start to converge on you.

330
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,913
Converge?

331
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:12,165
They sense the foreign nature
of the dreamer.

332
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:15,001
They attack, like white blood cells
fighting an infection.

333
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:18,004
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.

334
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:20,090
Just you.

335
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:28,306
This is great, but I'm telling you,
if you keep changing things like this...

336
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:34,771
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious
to take it easy?

337
00:31:34,939 --> 00:31:37,607
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.

338
00:32:31,287 --> 00:32:32,662
Very impressive.

339
00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:47,927
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?

340
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:50,430
Yeah, I cross it every day
to get to the college.

341
00:32:50,598 --> 00:32:54,017
Never re-create places from your memory.
Always imagine new places.

342
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:56,019
You draw from stuff you know, right?

343
00:32:56,187 --> 00:33:00,398
Only use details. A streetlamp
or a phone booth. Never entire areas.

344
00:33:00,566 --> 00:33:02,692
- Why not?
- Building a dream from your memory...

345
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,363
is the easiest way to lose your grasp
on what's real and what is a dream.

346
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,615
- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.

347
00:33:08,783 --> 00:33:10,784
This has nothing to do with me,
understand?

348
00:33:10,951 --> 00:33:12,911
That why you need me
to build your dreams?

349
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:15,622
Hey, get off of her.
Back up. Back up.

350
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,415
- Cobb! Cobb!
- Get off of her!

351
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:19,542
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Mal!

352
00:33:20,044 --> 00:33:22,128
- Mal!
- Cobb! Wake me up!

353
00:33:22,296 --> 00:33:24,089
- Wake me up! Wake me up!
- No!

354
00:33:24,256 --> 00:33:25,757
- Mal, no! No!
- Wake me up!

355
00:33:27,385 --> 00:33:31,388
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

356
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:34,766
- Hey.
- Why wouldn't I wake up?

357
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:36,684
There was still time on the clock.

358
00:33:36,852 --> 00:33:39,396
You can't wake up
from within the dream unless you die.

359
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:41,147
- She'll need a totem.
- What?

360
00:33:41,315 --> 00:33:42,774
A totem, it's a small personal...

361
00:33:42,942 --> 00:33:45,485
That's some subconscious
you've got on you, Cobb!

362
00:33:45,653 --> 00:33:47,487
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh.

363
00:33:47,655 --> 00:33:50,281
- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
- She's his wife?

364
00:33:50,449 --> 00:33:54,202
Yeah. So a totem. You need
a small object, potentially heavy.

365
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,830
Something you can have on you
that no one else knows.

366
00:33:56,997 --> 00:33:58,248
- Like a coin?
- No.

367
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:03,086
It needs to be more unique than that.
Like, this is a loaded die.

368
00:34:04,171 --> 00:34:07,090
No, I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

369
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:11,428
See, only I know the balance and
the weight of this particular loaded die.

370
00:34:11,595 --> 00:34:13,430
That way, when you look
at your totem...

371
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:16,724
you know beyond a doubt that
you're not in someone else's dream.

372
00:34:20,146 --> 00:34:24,442
I don't know if you can't see what's going on,
or if you just don't want to...

373
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:28,154
but Cobb has some serious problems
that he's tried to bury down there.

374
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:32,283
And I'm not about to just open my mind
to someone like that.

375
00:34:38,415 --> 00:34:41,792
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone
pick it up that quickly before.

376
00:34:42,294 --> 00:34:46,464
Reality's not gonna be enough for her now,
and when she comes back...

377
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:49,800
When she comes back,
you're gonna have her building mazes.

378
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:52,261
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.

379
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:55,556
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's back yard.

380
00:34:55,765 --> 00:34:57,308
It's a necessary risk.

381
00:34:57,726 --> 00:35:00,978
- Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
- We don't just need a thief.

382
00:35:02,105 --> 00:35:03,147
We need a forger.

383
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:14,408
Rub them together all you want,
they're not gonna breed.

384
00:35:14,993 --> 00:35:15,993
You never know.

385
00:35:16,953 --> 00:35:18,996
I'm gonna get you a drink.

386
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,500
You're buying.

387
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:31,300
- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Piss off.

388
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:33,427
How's your handwriting?

389
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:35,429
- It's versatile.
- Good.

390
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:36,847
Thank you very much.

391
00:35:37,516 --> 00:35:38,849
Inception.

392
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,936
Now, before you bother telling me
it's impossible, let me...

393
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:45,397
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.

394
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:48,859
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps
telling me it can't be done.

395
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:52,238
Hmm. Arthur. You still working
with that stick in the mud?

396
00:35:52,405 --> 00:35:54,114
He is good at what he does, right?

397
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:56,367
Oh, he's the best,
but he has no imagination.

398
00:35:56,535 --> 00:35:57,535
Not like you.

399
00:35:57,702 --> 00:36:00,704
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception,
you need imagination.

400
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:04,416
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

401
00:36:04,584 --> 00:36:08,212
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place,
but it didn't take.

402
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,715
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.

403
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:13,884
You need the simplest version
of the idea...

404
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:17,721
in order for it to grow naturally
in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.

405
00:36:17,889 --> 00:36:20,432
So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?

406
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,812
We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

407
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,398
Right there you have
various political motivations...

408
00:36:27,566 --> 00:36:29,567
and anti-monopolistic sentiments
and so forth.

409
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:31,569
But all of that stuff, it's, um...

410
00:36:31,736 --> 00:36:34,613
It's really at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice, you see?

411
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:37,283
What you have to do is start
at the absolute basic.

412
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,034
Which is what?

413
00:36:39,536 --> 00:36:41,412
The relationship with the father.

414
00:36:43,623 --> 00:36:45,291
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.

415
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:48,544
Right. Okay, well,
there's a man here, Yusuf.

416
00:36:48,712 --> 00:36:52,131
He, uh, formulates his own versions
of the compounds.

417
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:53,591
Why don't you take me there?

418
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:56,844
Once you've lost your tail.
The man at the bar.

419
00:36:57,012 --> 00:36:58,470
Cobol Engineering.

420
00:36:58,638 --> 00:37:00,973
That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?

421
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:03,684
Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.

422
00:37:03,852 --> 00:37:07,479
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs
in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?

423
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:09,648
- Back here?
- This is the last place they'd suspect.

424
00:37:12,193 --> 00:37:13,527
All right.

425
00:37:14,696 --> 00:37:16,530
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.

426
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:18,157
My God, it's you, isn't it?

427
00:37:21,703 --> 00:37:22,786
No, it isn't you.

428
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:24,371
Not dreaming now, are you?

429
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:28,167
Get him!

430
00:37:43,684 --> 00:37:44,809
There!

431
00:38:05,331 --> 00:38:07,082
One <i>café.</i>

432
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,587
Shh.

433
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:19,678
One <i>café.</i>

434
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:22,180
One <i>café.</i>

435
00:39:16,777 --> 00:39:18,236
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

436
00:39:19,864 --> 00:39:23,950
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I'm here to protect my investment.

437
00:39:26,454 --> 00:39:29,414
Ah. So this is your idea
of losing a tail, huh?

438
00:39:29,582 --> 00:39:30,582
Different tail.

439
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,050
Cobb said you'd be back.

440
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:45,722
- I tried not to come, but...
- But there's nothing quite like it.

441
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,557
It's just...

442
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:50,393
pure creation.

443
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:53,062
Shall we take a look
at some paradoxical architecture?

444
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,231
You're gonna have to master
a few tricks...

445
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:58,943
if you're gonna build three complete
dream levels. Excuse me.

446
00:39:59,111 --> 00:40:00,528
What kind of tricks?

447
00:40:00,696 --> 00:40:04,199
In a dream, you can cheat architecture
into impossible shapes.

448
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:08,286
That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps.

449
00:40:08,454 --> 00:40:09,621
The infinite staircase.

450
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:15,293
See?

451
00:40:19,465 --> 00:40:20,507
Paradox.

452
00:40:20,674 --> 00:40:22,091
So a closed loop like that...

453
00:40:22,259 --> 00:40:25,345
will help you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.

454
00:40:25,513 --> 00:40:27,472
But how big do these levels have to be?

455
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,808
It could be anything from
the floor of a building to an entire city.

456
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,395
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

457
00:40:34,563 --> 00:40:35,980
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.

458
00:40:36,148 --> 00:40:37,482
And the better the maze...

459
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,318
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

460
00:40:40,486 --> 00:40:41,778
Exactly.

461
00:40:42,446 --> 00:40:45,657
- My subconscious seems polite enough.
- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.

462
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:49,161
No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.

463
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:51,413
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

464
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,084
I don't know if he can't,
but he won't.

465
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,670
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the layouts.

466
00:40:57,837 --> 00:40:58,921
Why?

467
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,340
He won't tell me.
But I think it's Mal.

468
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:04,051
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.

469
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:07,388
- They're still together?
- No.

470
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,140
No, she's dead.

471
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,853
What you see in there
is just his projection of her.

472
00:41:18,358 --> 00:41:19,858
What was she like in real life?

473
00:41:20,527 --> 00:41:21,902
She was lovely.

474
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,117
- <i>You are seeking a chemist?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

475
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:30,411
To formulate compounds for a job?

476
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,955
And to go into the field with us.

477
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,374
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

478
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:39,253
Well, we'd need you there to tailor
compounds specific to our needs.

479
00:41:39,421 --> 00:41:41,547
- Which are?
- Great depth.

480
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:44,967
A dream within a dream?
Two levels?

481
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:48,762
Three.

482
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:52,516
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

483
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:56,645
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.

484
00:41:56,813 --> 00:41:59,481
A powerful sedative.

485
00:42:01,276 --> 00:42:03,527
- How many team members?
- Five.

486
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:05,404
Six.

487
00:42:06,281 --> 00:42:10,326
The only way to know you've done the job
is if I go in with you.

488
00:42:10,493 --> 00:42:13,579
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

489
00:42:13,747 --> 00:42:16,123
This time, it seems there is.

490
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:20,794
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it every day.

491
00:42:20,962 --> 00:42:23,088
- What for?
- Here, I'll show you.

492
00:42:27,427 --> 00:42:29,136
Perhaps you will not want to see.

493
00:42:32,098 --> 00:42:33,682
After you.

494
00:42:42,984 --> 00:42:45,986
Ten. Twelve. All connected.
Bloody hell.

495
00:42:46,154 --> 00:42:47,946
They come every day to share the dream.

496
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:53,535
You see? Very stable.

497
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:03,295
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.

498
00:43:03,588 --> 00:43:04,630
In dream time?

499
00:43:04,798 --> 00:43:08,467
With this compound? About 40 hours,
each and every day.

500
00:43:08,635 --> 00:43:11,929
- Why do they do it?
- Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

501
00:43:13,473 --> 00:43:15,891
After a while, it becomes
the only way you can dream.

502
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:17,976
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

503
00:43:18,645 --> 00:43:22,022
- They come here every day to sleep?
- No.

504
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,485
They come to be woken up.

505
00:43:27,487 --> 00:43:30,781
The dream has become their reality.

506
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,076
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?

507
00:43:36,371 --> 00:43:37,996
Let's see what you can do.

508
00:43:49,008 --> 00:43:50,592
You know how to find me.

509
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:55,180
You know what you have to do.

510
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:01,520
Sharp, no?

511
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:19,914
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?

512
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:24,210
Yeah, yeah.
Everything's just fine.

513
00:44:32,678 --> 00:44:36,389
Robert Fischer, heir to the
Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate.

514
00:44:36,557 --> 00:44:38,433
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?

515
00:44:38,601 --> 00:44:40,226
That's not your concern.

516
00:44:40,603 --> 00:44:44,981
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.

517
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,733
You asked me for inception.

518
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:50,278
I do hope you understand
the gravity of that request.

519
00:44:50,446 --> 00:44:54,407
Now, the seed that we plant
in this man's mind will grow into an idea.

520
00:44:54,575 --> 00:44:56,451
This idea will define him.

521
00:44:56,619 --> 00:44:58,453
It may come to change...

522
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:00,914
Well, it may come to change
everything about him.

523
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:05,418
We're the last company standing
between them and total energy dominance.

524
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:07,670
And we can no longer compete.

525
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,299
Soon, they'll control the energy supply
of half the world.

526
00:45:11,467 --> 00:45:13,843
In effect, they become a new superpower.

527
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:18,598
The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

528
00:45:18,766 --> 00:45:20,308
That's where we come in.

529
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:23,770
How is Robert Fischer's relationship
with his father?

530
00:45:23,938 --> 00:45:26,648
Rumor is the relationship
is quite complicated.

531
00:45:26,816 --> 00:45:29,317
Well, we can't work based
solely on rumor, can we?

532
00:45:29,485 --> 00:45:32,695
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.

533
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:37,033
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.

534
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:40,453
It should be possible,
if you can get the right references.

535
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:45,124
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

536
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:48,670
I'm not smelling settlement here.
Take them down.

537
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:49,963
Mr. Browning...

538
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:53,967
Maurice Fischer's policy
is always one of avoiding litigation.

539
00:45:56,512 --> 00:46:00,974
Well, shall we voice your concerns
with Maurice directly?

540
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:02,559
Not sure that's necessary.

541
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:05,395
No, no, no.
I think we should.

542
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:28,251
How is he?

543
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,838
I don't want to bother him
unnecessarily, but...

544
00:46:32,006 --> 00:46:37,510
Robert, I told you keep out the damn...
Wait. So do it. Get...

545
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:40,847
- Mr. Fischer.
- Put it through.

546
00:46:41,223 --> 00:46:44,851
Never, never.
Never do the same as I asked.

547
00:46:46,145 --> 00:46:47,812
Leave that.

548
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:52,859
Here.

549
00:46:55,154 --> 00:46:57,530
Must be a cherished memory of his.

550
00:46:58,657 --> 00:47:03,202
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

551
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,038
Robert...

552
00:47:07,374 --> 00:47:09,792
we need to talk about
a power of attorney.

553
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,254
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative...
- Not now, Uncle Peter.

554
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,053
<i>The vultures are circling.</i>

555
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,641
<i>And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.</i>

556
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:26,226
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

557
00:47:26,853 --> 00:47:31,231
<i>and adopt his physical presence, study
his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.</i>

558
00:47:31,399 --> 00:47:35,235
So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.

559
00:47:35,403 --> 00:47:38,656
<i>And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.</i>

560
00:47:38,823 --> 00:47:40,658
Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

561
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:44,328
his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.

562
00:47:44,496 --> 00:47:46,413
So he gives himself the idea.

563
00:47:46,581 --> 00:47:50,834
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.
It has to seem self-generated.

564
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:54,421
Eames, I am impressed.

565
00:47:54,589 --> 00:47:58,133
Your condescension, as always,
is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

566
00:48:19,489 --> 00:48:21,490
Were you going under on your own?

567
00:48:21,658 --> 00:48:25,160
No, no, I was just, uh,
running some experiments.

568
00:48:25,328 --> 00:48:27,287
I didn't realize anyone was here, so...

569
00:48:27,455 --> 00:48:30,124
Yeah, I was just...
I was working on my totem, actually.

570
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:31,458
Here, let me take a look.

571
00:48:33,628 --> 00:48:34,962
So you're learning, huh?

572
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,632
An elegant solution
for keeping track of reality.

573
00:48:39,259 --> 00:48:41,635
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was, uh...

574
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:43,971
It was Mal's, actually. This...

575
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:48,434
This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.

576
00:48:48,643 --> 00:48:51,520
Just spin and spin.

577
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:54,982
Arthur told me she passed away.

578
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:58,986
How are the mazes coming along?

579
00:48:59,154 --> 00:49:02,031
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

580
00:49:02,198 --> 00:49:03,657
that we are trying to access.

581
00:49:03,825 --> 00:49:09,288
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital,
so Fischer will bring his father.

582
00:49:09,664 --> 00:49:12,416
You know, I... Actually, I have
a question about this layout.

583
00:49:12,584 --> 00:49:17,337
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

584
00:49:17,505 --> 00:49:18,672
Why is that so important?

585
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,841
In case one of us
brings in our projections.

586
00:49:21,009 --> 00:49:23,343
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

587
00:49:24,721 --> 00:49:27,181
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

588
00:49:27,348 --> 00:49:29,767
You can't keep her out, can you?

589
00:49:30,685 --> 00:49:32,186
- Right.
- You can't build...

590
00:49:32,353 --> 00:49:35,689
because if you know the maze,
then she knows it.

591
00:49:35,857 --> 00:49:38,025
Well, she'd sabotage the whole operation.

592
00:49:38,193 --> 00:49:41,028
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

593
00:49:41,196 --> 00:49:43,405
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

594
00:49:43,573 --> 00:49:45,532
No one said it's getting worse.

595
00:49:46,701 --> 00:49:50,037
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.

596
00:49:50,872 --> 00:49:52,956
Why can't you go home?

597
00:49:56,044 --> 00:49:58,087
Because they think I killed her.

598
00:50:01,341 --> 00:50:03,592
- Thank you.
- For what?

599
00:50:03,802 --> 00:50:06,053
For not asking whether I did.

600
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:08,388
"I will split up my father's empire."

601
00:50:08,556 --> 00:50:12,768
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

602
00:50:12,936 --> 00:50:15,729
which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

603
00:50:15,897 --> 00:50:19,441
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

604
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:23,403
We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.

605
00:50:23,571 --> 00:50:25,989
How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?

606
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:29,744
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...

607
00:50:29,912 --> 00:50:32,664
- is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?

608
00:50:32,832 --> 00:50:36,417
We suggest breaking up his father's company
as a "screw you" to the old man.

609
00:50:36,585 --> 00:50:40,088
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

610
00:50:40,464 --> 00:50:44,175
We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

611
00:50:44,343 --> 00:50:48,096
We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this.

612
00:50:48,264 --> 00:50:50,098
All right, well, try this. Um...

613
00:50:50,266 --> 00:50:55,019
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps."

614
00:50:55,437 --> 00:50:56,479
That might work.

615
00:50:56,647 --> 00:50:59,816
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might."

616
00:50:59,984 --> 00:51:01,943
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

617
00:51:02,111 --> 00:51:05,071
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.

618
00:51:05,281 --> 00:51:06,364
Specificity?

619
00:51:06,532 --> 00:51:08,366
Inception's not about being specific.

620
00:51:08,534 --> 00:51:12,495
When we get inside his mind,
we're gonna have to work with what we find.

621
00:51:13,789 --> 00:51:16,791
On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father...

622
00:51:16,959 --> 00:51:20,044
and say, "I will not follow
in my father's footsteps."

623
00:51:20,212 --> 00:51:24,883
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."

624
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:28,386
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

625
00:51:28,554 --> 00:51:30,972
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
- Exactly.

626
00:51:32,308 --> 00:51:36,311
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna
collapse with the slightest disturbance.

627
00:51:36,478 --> 00:51:37,645
Sedation.

628
00:51:37,813 --> 00:51:40,648
For sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming...

629
00:51:40,816 --> 00:51:44,736
we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.

630
00:51:56,165 --> 00:51:57,248
Good night.

631
00:51:57,833 --> 00:52:00,043
<i>The compound we'll be using
to share the dream...</i>

632
00:52:00,211 --> 00:52:02,170
<i>creates a clear connection
between dreamers...</i>

633
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:06,549
- whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.

634
00:52:06,717 --> 00:52:09,844
Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.

635
00:52:10,054 --> 00:52:13,556
And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.

636
00:52:13,724 --> 00:52:15,850
It's three dreams,
that's 10 hours times 20...

637
00:52:16,018 --> 00:52:18,895
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?

638
00:52:19,063 --> 00:52:21,731
It's a week, the first level down.

639
00:52:22,441 --> 00:52:25,276
Six months the second level down,
and the third level...

640
00:52:25,444 --> 00:52:26,861
That's 10 years.

641
00:52:29,531 --> 00:52:31,699
Who'd wanna be stuck in a dream
for 10 years?

642
00:52:32,076 --> 00:52:33,243
Depends on the dream.

643
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:35,703
So once we've made the plant,
how do we get out?

644
00:52:35,871 --> 00:52:39,207
I'm hoping you have something more elegant
than shooting me in the head.

645
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:42,168
- A kick.
- What's a kick?

646
00:52:42,336 --> 00:52:45,046
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

647
00:52:47,174 --> 00:52:49,884
It's that feeling of falling you get
that jolts you awake.

648
00:52:50,052 --> 00:52:53,263
- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?

649
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:54,639
That's the clever part.

650
00:52:54,807 --> 00:52:58,059
I customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

651
00:52:58,227 --> 00:53:03,064
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

652
00:53:03,232 --> 00:53:05,566
<i>Or tipping.</i>

653
00:53:06,235 --> 00:53:10,405
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.

654
00:53:10,906 --> 00:53:14,450
We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

655
00:53:22,334 --> 00:53:25,837
<i>He hasn't got any surgery scheduled,
no dental, nothing.</i>

656
00:53:26,005 --> 00:53:28,006
<i>Wasn't he supposed to have
a knee operation?</i>

657
00:53:28,173 --> 00:53:31,426
Nothing. Nothing that they'll
put him under for, anyway. And we need...

658
00:53:31,593 --> 00:53:33,511
We need at least a good 10 hours.

659
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:35,013
Sydney to Los Angeles.

660
00:53:36,348 --> 00:53:40,601
One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.

661
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:42,938
He must be flying private, then.

662
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,608
Not if there were unexpected maintenance
with his plane.

663
00:53:46,776 --> 00:53:49,028
- It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?

664
00:53:49,195 --> 00:53:50,654
On a 747, the pilot's up top...

665
00:53:50,822 --> 00:53:54,033
the first-class cabin's in the nose,
so no one would walk through.

666
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,703
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first-class flight attendant.

667
00:53:57,871 --> 00:53:59,455
I bought the airline.

668
00:54:00,999 --> 00:54:02,791
It seemed neater.

669
00:54:04,419 --> 00:54:07,212
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.

670
00:54:07,881 --> 00:54:11,008
Ariadne?
Terrific work, by the way.

671
00:54:59,015 --> 00:55:01,183
You know how to find me.

672
00:55:02,685 --> 00:55:04,103
You know what you have to do.

673
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:11,402
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

674
00:55:12,278 --> 00:55:14,321
Of course I do.

675
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:17,908
You said you had a dream.

676
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:23,622
That we'd grow old together.

677
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:26,750
And we can.

678
00:55:33,425 --> 00:55:35,384
You shouldn't be here.

679
00:55:39,139 --> 00:55:42,599
Just wanted to see what kind of tests
you're doing on your own every night.

680
00:55:42,767 --> 00:55:45,978
- This has nothing to do with you.
- This has everything to do with me.

681
00:55:46,146 --> 00:55:51,942
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.

682
00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:05,247
Why do you do this to yourself?

683
00:56:05,415 --> 00:56:08,333
It's the only way I can still dream.

684
00:56:10,086 --> 00:56:12,296
Why is it so important to dream?

685
00:56:13,214 --> 00:56:15,466
In my dreams, we're still together.

686
00:56:29,814 --> 00:56:31,565
These aren't just dreams.

687
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,403
These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.

688
00:56:36,571 --> 00:56:37,613
I know I did.

689
00:56:38,281 --> 00:56:42,784
You're trying to keep her alive.
You can't let her go.

690
00:56:42,952 --> 00:56:45,954
You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.

691
00:56:46,122 --> 00:56:48,707
They're memories that I have to change.

692
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:52,419
Well, what's down there that you regret?

693
00:56:52,795 --> 00:56:55,965
Listen, there's only one thing
you need to understand about me.

694
00:57:04,433 --> 00:57:06,017
This is your house?

695
00:57:06,685 --> 00:57:09,145
Mine and Mal's, yes.

696
00:57:09,313 --> 00:57:11,022
Where is she?

697
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:13,691
She's already gone.

698
00:57:18,447 --> 00:57:19,989
That's my son, James.

699
00:57:20,157 --> 00:57:23,243
He's digging for something,
maybe a worm.

700
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,745
That's Phillipa.

701
00:57:26,288 --> 00:57:28,164
I thought about calling out to them...

702
00:57:28,332 --> 00:57:31,084
so they'd turn and smile
and I could see...

703
00:57:31,794 --> 00:57:36,923
those beautiful faces of theirs,
but it's all too late.

704
00:57:37,091 --> 00:57:39,926
Right now or never, Cobb.

705
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:46,182
Then I start to panic.

706
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:49,060
I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...

707
00:57:49,895 --> 00:57:52,230
that I need to see their faces
one last time.

708
00:57:52,398 --> 00:57:54,899
James! Phillipa!
Come on in!

709
00:57:55,067 --> 00:57:57,110
But the moment's past.

710
00:57:59,321 --> 00:58:02,699
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.

711
00:58:03,576 --> 00:58:05,743
As I'm about to call out to them...

712
00:58:06,787 --> 00:58:07,870
they run away.

713
00:58:10,624 --> 00:58:13,876
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,
I've gotta get back home.

714
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,421
The real world.

715
00:58:58,005 --> 00:58:59,464
What are you doing here?

716
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:01,424
My name is...

717
00:59:01,592 --> 00:59:04,886
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

718
00:59:13,062 --> 00:59:15,480
I'm just trying to understand.

719
00:59:15,648 --> 00:59:17,774
How could you understand?

720
00:59:18,984 --> 00:59:21,110
Do you know what it is
to be a lover?

721
00:59:23,113 --> 00:59:25,281
To be half of a whole?

722
00:59:26,492 --> 00:59:28,076
No.

723
00:59:29,536 --> 00:59:31,537
I'll tell you a riddle.

724
00:59:32,998 --> 00:59:35,291
You're waiting for a train.

725
00:59:36,335 --> 00:59:39,504
A train that will take you far away.

726
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:43,841
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

727
00:59:44,885 --> 00:59:47,136
but you don't know for sure.

728
00:59:47,304 --> 00:59:49,222
But it doesn't matter.

729
00:59:50,182 --> 00:59:53,601
How can it not matter to you
where that train will take you?

730
00:59:53,769 --> 00:59:55,520
Because you'll be together.

731
00:59:56,563 --> 00:59:59,649
- How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?

732
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:03,236
This is a hotel suite where we
used to spend our anniversary.

733
01:00:03,404 --> 01:00:04,737
What happened here?

734
01:00:06,657 --> 01:00:09,493
You promised!
You promised we'd be together!

735
01:00:09,911 --> 01:00:11,995
Please, I need you to stay here
just for now!

736
01:00:12,163 --> 01:00:15,374
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow old together!

737
01:00:15,542 --> 01:00:18,001
I'll come back for you.
I promise.

738
01:00:36,229 --> 01:00:41,608
Do you think you can just build
a prison of memories to lock her in?

739
01:00:42,235 --> 01:00:44,611
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

740
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,780
It's time.

741
01:00:48,032 --> 01:00:50,367
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

742
01:00:50,535 --> 01:00:52,703
- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.

743
01:00:52,871 --> 01:00:56,123
Robert should accompany the body
no later than Tuesday. We should move.

744
01:00:56,291 --> 01:00:57,750
All right.

745
01:00:58,376 --> 01:01:01,378
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.

746
01:01:01,546 --> 01:01:04,715
The team needs someone who understands
what you're struggling with.

747
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,428
And it doesn't have to be me...

748
01:01:09,596 --> 01:01:12,890
but then you have to show Arthur
what I just saw.

749
01:01:18,688 --> 01:01:20,397
Get us another seat on the plane.

750
01:01:24,444 --> 01:01:27,488
If I get on this plane
and you don't honor our agreement...

751
01:01:27,655 --> 01:01:31,325
when we land,
I go to jail for the rest of my life.

752
01:01:31,993 --> 01:01:34,203
Complete the job en route...

753
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:36,830
I make one phone call from the plane...

754
01:01:36,998 --> 01:01:39,917
you have no trouble
getting through Immigration.

755
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,141
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

756
01:01:56,309 --> 01:01:57,893
Thank you.

757
01:02:31,469 --> 01:02:34,805
Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.

758
01:02:34,973 --> 01:02:36,849
Would you care for a drink?

759
01:02:37,016 --> 01:02:38,308
Oh. Water, please.

760
01:02:38,476 --> 01:02:40,811
Oh, um, same, please.

761
01:02:41,771 --> 01:02:43,063
Um...

762
01:02:43,815 --> 01:02:44,898
Thank you.

763
01:02:45,066 --> 01:02:46,942
You know, I couldn't help but notice...

764
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:50,696
but you wouldn't happen to be related
to the Maurice Fischer, would you?

765
01:02:50,864 --> 01:02:52,364
Yes, he, um...

766
01:02:53,324 --> 01:02:55,325
He was my father.

767
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:59,788
Well, he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your loss.

768
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,418
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

769
01:03:04,586 --> 01:03:05,919
Hey.

770
01:03:06,337 --> 01:03:07,963
To your father.

771
01:03:08,548 --> 01:03:10,799
May he rest in peace, huh?

772
01:04:19,244 --> 01:04:21,579
- Couldn't have peed before you went under?
- Sorry.

773
01:04:21,747 --> 01:04:23,790
Bit too much free champagne
before takeoff?

774
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:25,083
Ha, ha, bloody ha.

775
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:28,211
We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi
in this weather.

776
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:43,935
- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try...?
- Walk away.

777
01:04:59,785 --> 01:05:01,202
Just have him ca... I gotta go.

778
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:03,496
All right. Taxi.
Thank you.

779
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:09,293
All right, Third and Market.
Snappy.

780
01:05:09,878 --> 01:05:12,213
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I thought it was free.

781
01:05:12,381 --> 01:05:13,881
- It's not.
- Maybe we could share.

782
01:05:14,049 --> 01:05:16,884
Maybe not.
Can you pull over and get this...?

783
01:05:19,847 --> 01:05:21,180
Great.

784
01:05:26,145 --> 01:05:27,603
Come on.

785
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:41,325
There's $500 in there.
The wallet's worth more than that.

786
01:05:41,493 --> 01:05:43,202
You might at least
drop me at my stop.

787
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:44,495
I'm afraid that it doesn't...

788
01:05:54,173 --> 01:05:56,007
- Cover him!
- Down! Down now!

789
01:05:56,175 --> 01:05:57,800
What the hell is going on?

790
01:06:01,513 --> 01:06:03,765
This wasn't in the design.

791
01:06:04,683 --> 01:06:06,059
Cobb?

792
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:07,351
Cobb?

793
01:06:58,238 --> 01:06:59,446
Get him!

794
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,579
Are you all right?

795
01:07:07,747 --> 01:07:09,915
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

796
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:12,000
Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.

797
01:07:12,168 --> 01:07:13,418
Saito?

798
01:07:32,313 --> 01:07:34,439
Get Fischer in the back room now.

799
01:07:34,774 --> 01:07:37,442
- Get him in the back room. Move.
- What the hell happened?

800
01:07:37,902 --> 01:07:39,361
Has he been shot?
Is he dying?

801
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:41,280
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.

802
01:07:41,447 --> 01:07:43,866
- What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.

803
01:07:44,033 --> 01:07:45,993
Why put a train
in a downtown intersection?

804
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,786
- I didn't.
- Where'd it come from?

805
01:07:47,954 --> 01:07:49,621
Why the hell were we ambushed?

806
01:07:49,789 --> 01:07:53,319
Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.

807
01:07:53,476 --> 01:07:55,919
- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...

808
01:07:56,087 --> 01:08:00,299
teach his subconscious to defend itself,
so his subconscious is militarized.

809
01:08:00,466 --> 01:08:02,092
It should've shown in the research.

810
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:04,052
- Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.

811
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,554
Don't tell me to calm down!

812
01:08:05,722 --> 01:08:08,640
This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!

813
01:08:08,808 --> 01:08:10,893
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!

814
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:14,396
- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!

815
01:08:14,564 --> 01:08:16,648
We'll be more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

816
01:08:16,816 --> 01:08:18,650
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.

817
01:08:18,818 --> 01:08:19,860
Put him out his misery.

818
01:08:20,028 --> 01:08:22,863
- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.

819
01:08:23,031 --> 01:08:25,157
He's in agony.
I'm waking him up.

820
01:08:25,325 --> 01:08:27,200
No. It won't wake him up.

821
01:08:27,368 --> 01:08:30,996
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.

822
01:08:31,164 --> 01:08:32,414
Not from this.

823
01:08:32,582 --> 01:08:35,125
We're too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.

824
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:37,419
Right. So, what happens when we die?

825
01:08:37,587 --> 01:08:39,421
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?

826
01:08:39,589 --> 01:08:42,132
- Limbo?
- Unconstructed dream space.

827
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:45,552
- What the hell is down there?
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.

828
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,931
Nothing is down there, except for
what might have been left behind...

829
01:08:49,098 --> 01:08:52,017
by anyone sharing the dream
who's been trapped there before.

830
01:08:52,185 --> 01:08:54,061
Which, in our case, is just you.

831
01:08:54,228 --> 01:08:56,939
- How long could we be stuck?
- Can't even think about...

832
01:08:57,106 --> 01:08:59,524
- trying to escape until the sedation...
- How long?

833
01:08:59,692 --> 01:09:02,903
Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.

834
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:04,279
Let's get him upstairs.

835
01:09:05,907 --> 01:09:07,366
Great.

836
01:09:08,368 --> 01:09:09,868
Thank you.

837
01:09:10,536 --> 01:09:13,789
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind,
battling his own private army.

838
01:09:13,957 --> 01:09:15,415
And if we get killed...

839
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:18,835
we'll be lost in limbo till our brains
turn to scrambled egg, hmm?

840
01:09:25,718 --> 01:09:27,552
Someone got first aid?

841
01:09:29,806 --> 01:09:33,266
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.

842
01:09:33,434 --> 01:09:36,395
- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
- You had no right.

843
01:09:36,562 --> 01:09:38,897
This was the only way
to go three layers deep.

844
01:09:39,065 --> 01:09:41,066
You knew about this
and went along with it?

845
01:09:41,234 --> 01:09:42,275
I trusted him.

846
01:09:42,443 --> 01:09:44,361
When? When he promised you
half his share?

847
01:09:44,529 --> 01:09:47,781
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.

848
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:50,034
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?

849
01:09:50,202 --> 01:09:53,621
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my children.

850
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,707
You led us into a war zone
with no way out?

851
01:09:55,874 --> 01:09:59,919
There is a way out. We continue on with
the job, and we do it as fast as possible...

852
01:10:00,087 --> 01:10:02,422
and we get out using the kick,
just like before.

853
01:10:02,589 --> 01:10:05,049
Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the stakes.

854
01:10:05,217 --> 01:10:07,093
I am sitting this one out on this level.

855
01:10:07,261 --> 01:10:09,679
Fischer's security
is surrounding this place.

856
01:10:09,847 --> 01:10:12,098
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

857
01:10:12,266 --> 01:10:16,019
That means each and every one of us
will be killed. That I can guarantee you.

858
01:10:16,603 --> 01:10:20,398
We have no other choice but to continue on
and do it as fast as possible.

859
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:24,444
Downwards is the only way forwards.

860
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:27,113
Get ready.

861
01:10:27,281 --> 01:10:29,449
You, come on.
Let's go shake him up.

862
01:10:34,329 --> 01:10:37,373
I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to 10 million.

863
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:40,460
- This should be very simple.
- Shut up! It won't be.

864
01:10:40,627 --> 01:10:42,920
In your father's office,
below the bookshelves...

865
01:10:43,088 --> 01:10:45,131
is his personal safe.
We need the combination.

866
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:47,925
I don't know any safe.

867
01:10:48,135 --> 01:10:50,970
That doesn't mean
you don't know the combination.

868
01:10:52,639 --> 01:10:53,973
Tell us what it is.

869
01:10:54,808 --> 01:10:56,559
I don't know.

870
01:11:01,482 --> 01:11:03,649
We have it on good authority
you do know.

871
01:11:03,817 --> 01:11:06,152
Yeah? Whose authority?

872
01:11:07,654 --> 01:11:11,157
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
- What's inside it?

873
01:11:11,408 --> 01:11:15,161
Cash, cards, ID.
And this.

874
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:21,709
Useful?

875
01:11:22,461 --> 01:11:23,503
Maybe.

876
01:11:23,962 --> 01:11:25,755
You're on.
You've got an hour.

877
01:11:26,173 --> 01:11:27,173
An hour?

878
01:11:28,509 --> 01:11:30,760
I was supposed to have all night
to crack this.

879
01:11:30,928 --> 01:11:33,513
And Saito wasn't supposed
to be shot in the chest.

880
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,849
You've got one hour,
now get us something useful, please.

881
01:11:39,394 --> 01:11:41,854
- What's that?
- Good authority.

882
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:47,777
Uncle Peter.

883
01:11:48,487 --> 01:11:50,613
Just make them stop.

884
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:53,241
- The combination.
- I don't know it.

885
01:11:53,408 --> 01:11:56,077
- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.

886
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:58,704
Just let me talk to him
and I'll find out.

887
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,793
You have one hour.
Start talking.

888
01:12:05,796 --> 01:12:07,004
You all right?

889
01:12:08,882 --> 01:12:10,216
You okay?

890
01:12:13,887 --> 01:12:17,557
Those bastards have had at me
for two days.

891
01:12:18,225 --> 01:12:20,726
They have someone with access
to your father's office.

892
01:12:20,894 --> 01:12:22,728
- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.

893
01:12:22,896 --> 01:12:25,648
They thought I'd know the combination,
but I don't know it.

894
01:12:25,816 --> 01:12:28,568
- Yeah, well, neither do I, so...
- What?

895
01:12:29,319 --> 01:12:32,572
Maurice told me that when he passed,
you were the only one able to open it.

896
01:12:32,739 --> 01:12:35,241
No, he never gave me any combination.

897
01:12:35,993 --> 01:12:40,121
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.

898
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:41,497
Well, what, then?

899
01:12:41,665 --> 01:12:44,208
I don't know,
some meaningful combination of numbers...

900
01:12:44,376 --> 01:12:48,296
based on your experiences
with Maurice.

901
01:12:50,007 --> 01:12:53,926
We didn't have very many, uh,
meaningful experiences together.

902
01:12:54,678 --> 01:12:56,137
Perhaps after your mother died.

903
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:01,518
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

904
01:13:03,188 --> 01:13:08,150
"Robert, there's really nothing
to be said."

905
01:13:08,318 --> 01:13:10,652
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

906
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,530
I was 11, Uncle Peter.

907
01:13:14,282 --> 01:13:17,534
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

908
01:13:17,702 --> 01:13:21,288
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

909
01:13:21,456 --> 01:13:22,706
And if he dies?

910
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:25,334
Worst-case scenario?

911
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:28,212
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

912
01:13:28,379 --> 01:13:32,466
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.

913
01:13:32,634 --> 01:13:34,301
I appreciate that, Saito.

914
01:13:34,469 --> 01:13:38,555
But when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

915
01:13:38,723 --> 01:13:40,766
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

916
01:13:40,934 --> 01:13:44,686
You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.

917
01:13:45,146 --> 01:13:46,480
Filled with regret?

918
01:13:47,941 --> 01:13:49,024
Waiting to die alone.

919
01:13:49,692 --> 01:13:50,817
No.

920
01:13:51,361 --> 01:13:52,986
I'll come back.

921
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:56,490
And we'll be young men together again.

922
01:14:02,455 --> 01:14:03,497
Breathe.

923
01:14:03,665 --> 01:14:06,708
These people are gonna kill us
if we don't give them the combination.

924
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:08,794
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.

925
01:14:08,962 --> 01:14:12,839
They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

926
01:14:13,007 --> 01:14:14,508
All right.
What is in the safe?

927
01:14:15,593 --> 01:14:16,760
Something for you.

928
01:14:17,387 --> 01:14:21,515
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

929
01:14:22,267 --> 01:14:25,352
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

930
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,728
That's an alternate.

931
01:14:26,896 --> 01:14:29,273
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

932
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,067
It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

933
01:14:32,235 --> 01:14:35,946
It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

934
01:14:36,114 --> 01:14:38,573
Destroying my whole inheritance?

935
01:14:40,243 --> 01:14:43,412
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.

936
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:48,250
He loved you, Robert.

937
01:14:48,835 --> 01:14:50,460
In his own way.

938
01:14:50,628 --> 01:14:52,421
In his own way.

939
01:14:53,715 --> 01:14:55,257
At the end...

940
01:14:56,384 --> 01:14:58,719
he called me in to his deathbed.

941
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,054
He could barely speak.

942
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:06,393
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

943
01:15:08,896 --> 01:15:10,522
He pulled me close.

944
01:15:13,192 --> 01:15:15,277
And I could only make out...

945
01:15:16,154 --> 01:15:17,571
one word.

946
01:15:21,284 --> 01:15:23,243
"Disappointed."

947
01:15:28,916 --> 01:15:30,083
When were you in limbo?

948
01:15:31,669 --> 01:15:35,172
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

949
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:37,716
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?

950
01:15:37,925 --> 01:15:42,054
The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

951
01:15:42,221 --> 01:15:46,266
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

952
01:15:46,434 --> 01:15:48,852
And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...

953
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,812
we're also going deeper into you.

954
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:54,941
And I'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find.

955
01:15:58,946 --> 01:16:00,405
We were working together.

956
01:16:00,573 --> 01:16:04,242
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

957
01:16:04,452 --> 01:16:05,702
I kept pushing things.

958
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:09,539
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.

959
01:16:10,041 --> 01:16:14,921
I just didn't understand the concept
that hours could turn into years down there...

960
01:16:15,089 --> 01:16:17,799
that we could get trapped so deep...

961
01:16:18,634 --> 01:16:21,969
that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

962
01:16:22,554 --> 01:16:25,098
<i>we lost sight of what was real.</i>

963
01:16:31,146 --> 01:16:33,731
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

964
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:37,360
<i>We did that for years.</i>

965
01:16:38,487 --> 01:16:40,488
<i>We built our own world.</i>

966
01:16:41,824 --> 01:16:43,533
How long were you stuck there?

967
01:16:44,701 --> 01:16:46,828
Something like 50 years.

968
01:16:50,207 --> 01:16:51,374
Jesus.

969
01:16:53,669 --> 01:16:55,002
How could you stand it?

970
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:57,922
It wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.

971
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:01,134
<i>The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.</i>

972
01:17:01,301 --> 01:17:05,680
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

973
01:17:05,848 --> 01:17:07,265
And what about for her?

974
01:17:10,727 --> 01:17:14,647
<i>She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.</i>

975
01:17:16,024 --> 01:17:21,279
<i>A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.</i>

976
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:26,701
Limbo became her reality.

977
01:17:28,036 --> 01:17:29,871
What happened when you woke up?

978
01:17:30,372 --> 01:17:34,041
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

979
01:17:35,127 --> 01:17:39,630
<i>to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?</i>

980
01:17:40,549 --> 01:17:44,302
<i>I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.</i>

981
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:47,930
Eventually, she told me the truth.

982
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:51,726
<i>She was possessed by an idea.</i>

983
01:17:51,894 --> 01:17:57,607
<i>This one very simple idea
that changed everything.</i>

984
01:17:58,734 --> 01:18:01,235
That our world wasn't real.

985
01:18:02,154 --> 01:18:06,407
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

986
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:09,327
that in order to get back home...

987
01:18:10,579 --> 01:18:12,371
we had to kill ourselves.

988
01:18:19,004 --> 01:18:22,465
- <i>What about your children?</i>
- <i>She thought they were projections...</i>

989
01:18:22,633 --> 01:18:25,635
<i>that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.</i>

990
01:18:25,802 --> 01:18:27,512
- I'm their mother!
- Calm down.

991
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:28,930
I can tell the difference.

992
01:18:29,097 --> 01:18:31,432
If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?

993
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,309
You don't know you're dreaming!

994
01:18:33,477 --> 01:18:35,686
<i>She was certain there was
nothing I could do...</i>

995
01:18:35,854 --> 01:18:39,690
no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

996
01:18:42,653 --> 01:18:45,696
She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

997
01:18:45,864 --> 01:18:52,370
<i>She loved me too much, so she came up
with a plan on our anniversary.</i>

998
01:19:18,438 --> 01:19:21,232
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

999
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:25,653
Just... Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.

1000
01:19:25,821 --> 01:19:30,284
No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

1001
01:19:30,451 --> 01:19:32,160
No, I'm not.

1002
01:19:32,328 --> 01:19:34,413
Now, you listen to me.

1003
01:19:34,998 --> 01:19:39,251
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.

1004
01:19:39,419 --> 01:19:41,336
Now, just step back inside.

1005
01:19:41,504 --> 01:19:44,256
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1006
01:19:44,424 --> 01:19:46,341
We've talked enough.

1007
01:19:48,428 --> 01:19:50,095
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...

1008
01:19:50,263 --> 01:19:52,973
- or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.

1009
01:19:57,228 --> 01:19:59,021
We're gonna talk about this.

1010
01:19:59,897 --> 01:20:01,064
All right?

1011
01:20:01,232 --> 01:20:06,320
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

1012
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,282
No, I can't.
You know I can't do that.

1013
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:13,201
Take a second, think about our children.

1014
01:20:13,369 --> 01:20:15,120
Think about James.

1015
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:17,497
Think about Phillipa, now.

1016
01:20:17,665 --> 01:20:20,584
If I go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.

1017
01:20:20,752 --> 01:20:24,046
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...

1018
01:20:24,505 --> 01:20:27,841
explaining how I'm fearful
for my safety.

1019
01:20:30,053 --> 01:20:32,220
How you've threatened to kill me.

1020
01:20:35,016 --> 01:20:37,643
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.

1021
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:39,561
Why did...?
Why would you do this to me?

1022
01:20:39,729 --> 01:20:42,606
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1023
01:20:42,774 --> 01:20:45,817
We're going home to our real children.

1024
01:20:45,985 --> 01:20:49,613
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

1025
01:20:49,781 --> 01:20:51,073
You're waiting for a train.

1026
01:20:51,574 --> 01:20:55,160
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

1027
01:20:55,328 --> 01:20:57,329
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1028
01:20:57,497 --> 01:21:01,333
You know where you hope this train will take you,
but you can't know for sure.

1029
01:21:01,501 --> 01:21:03,710
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

1030
01:21:03,878 --> 01:21:07,089
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.

1031
01:21:07,256 --> 01:21:11,093
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

1032
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:12,678
Jesus Christ!

1033
01:21:16,182 --> 01:21:19,935
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1034
01:21:20,103 --> 01:21:24,272
It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

1035
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:25,691
<i>So I ran.</i>

1036
01:21:27,527 --> 01:21:29,778
Right now, or never, Cobb.

1037
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:40,789
James! Phillipa!
Come on in! Come on!

1038
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,124
All right, let's go.

1039
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:46,461
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

1040
01:21:47,004 --> 01:21:50,882
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

1041
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:54,344
But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.

1042
01:21:55,596 --> 01:21:58,140
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

1043
01:21:58,307 --> 01:22:03,311
you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her.

1044
01:22:03,479 --> 01:22:05,313
But you don't have to do that alone.

1045
01:22:05,481 --> 01:22:07,733
- No, you're not...
- I'm doing it for the others.

1046
01:22:08,401 --> 01:22:13,488
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

1047
01:22:18,578 --> 01:22:20,078
We have to move.

1048
01:22:20,246 --> 01:22:21,663
Time's up.

1049
01:22:21,831 --> 01:22:24,583
All right.
I don't know any combination.

1050
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:27,836
- Not consciously, anyway.
- How about instinctively, huh?

1051
01:22:28,004 --> 01:22:31,965
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

1052
01:22:32,133 --> 01:22:35,010
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1053
01:22:35,178 --> 01:22:37,429
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

1054
01:22:37,597 --> 01:22:39,848
I said, right now!
Right now!

1055
01:22:40,016 --> 01:22:43,895
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

1056
01:22:47,775 --> 01:22:49,776
You'll have to do better than that.

1057
01:22:49,943 --> 01:22:53,279
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.

1058
01:22:57,659 --> 01:23:01,788
We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?

1059
01:23:07,044 --> 01:23:08,544
What'd you get?

1060
01:23:08,962 --> 01:23:11,506
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

1061
01:23:11,673 --> 01:23:12,715
This helps us how?

1062
01:23:12,883 --> 01:23:15,968
The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

1063
01:23:17,179 --> 01:23:20,264
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.

1064
01:23:20,432 --> 01:23:23,976
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.

1065
01:23:24,144 --> 01:23:27,730
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

1066
01:24:02,808 --> 01:24:03,850
Damn it.

1067
01:24:04,017 --> 01:24:07,019
You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

1068
01:24:23,787 --> 01:24:26,789
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1069
01:24:26,957 --> 01:24:30,960
- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his father...

1070
01:24:31,128 --> 01:24:33,462
whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

1071
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:36,632
We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.

1072
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,135
His security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.

1073
01:24:39,303 --> 01:24:41,804
- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.

1074
01:24:42,222 --> 01:24:43,639
- Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.

1075
01:24:43,807 --> 01:24:47,351
The second we get into that hotel
his security's gonna be all over us.

1076
01:24:47,519 --> 01:24:49,645
We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.

1077
01:24:49,813 --> 01:24:52,148
- You've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't work.

1078
01:24:52,316 --> 01:24:55,818
The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1079
01:24:55,986 --> 01:24:57,987
Excellent.
But you learned a lot, right?

1080
01:24:58,155 --> 01:25:00,281
- I need some kind of distraction.
- No problem.

1081
01:25:00,449 --> 01:25:02,658
How about a lovely lady
that I've used before?

1082
01:25:02,826 --> 01:25:04,869
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?

1083
01:25:05,037 --> 01:25:07,496
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

1084
01:25:12,044 --> 01:25:15,421
Don't jump too soon. We only got
one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

1085
01:25:15,589 --> 01:25:18,883
I'll play the music to let you know
it's coming. The rest is on you.

1086
01:25:19,051 --> 01:25:20,843
- You ready?
- Ready!

1087
01:25:22,095 --> 01:25:23,179
Sweet dreams.

1088
01:25:23,347 --> 01:25:25,264
Am I boring you?

1089
01:25:26,558 --> 01:25:29,769
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.

1090
01:25:31,605 --> 01:25:34,273
Um, I have a lot on my mind.

1091
01:25:35,817 --> 01:25:37,401
There goes Mr. Charles.

1092
01:25:42,115 --> 01:25:44,742
Mr. Fischer, right?

1093
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:48,412
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. I...

1094
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:49,705
Hmm.

1095
01:25:49,873 --> 01:25:52,541
- And you must be?
- Leaving.

1096
01:25:55,797 --> 01:25:56,922
In case you get bored.

1097
01:26:02,178 --> 01:26:03,553
Must've blown you off.

1098
01:26:03,721 --> 01:26:06,431
That is, unless her phone number
really is only six digits.

1099
01:26:08,601 --> 01:26:13,063
Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing your wallet like that.

1100
01:26:16,985 --> 01:26:19,319
Goddamn it. The wallet alone
is worth at least 500...

1101
01:26:19,487 --> 01:26:20,612
About $500, right?

1102
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:23,740
Don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.

1103
01:26:23,908 --> 01:26:25,867
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

1104
01:26:26,077 --> 01:26:29,746
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

1105
01:26:29,914 --> 01:26:31,248
And why don't you approve?

1106
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:33,417
It involves telling the mark
that he's dreaming...

1107
01:26:33,584 --> 01:26:35,752
which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

1108
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,839
- Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
- Hmm.

1109
01:26:39,007 --> 01:26:40,757
So now you've noticed how much time...

1110
01:26:40,925 --> 01:26:43,593
Cobb spends doing things
he says never to do.

1111
01:26:45,304 --> 01:26:47,097
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?

1112
01:26:47,265 --> 01:26:49,683
- I'm sorry, but...
- Hold on! Wait!

1113
01:26:51,019 --> 01:26:52,310
You look a bit perkier.

1114
01:26:52,478 --> 01:26:54,813
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

1115
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:02,571
Turbulence on the plane?

1116
01:27:02,739 --> 01:27:04,448
No, it's much closer.

1117
01:27:04,615 --> 01:27:06,283
That's Yusuf's driving.

1118
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:17,085
Um, I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?

1119
01:27:17,253 --> 01:27:19,337
Rod Green from marketing.

1120
01:27:19,505 --> 01:27:21,131
But that's not true at all, is it?

1121
01:27:23,217 --> 01:27:26,678
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?

1122
01:27:26,888 --> 01:27:28,847
I'm the head of your security down here.

1123
01:27:30,141 --> 01:27:32,059
Get out on a different floor,
keep moving.

1124
01:27:32,226 --> 01:27:34,561
Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.

1125
01:27:34,729 --> 01:27:38,231
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

1126
01:27:41,861 --> 01:27:43,445
Security, huh?

1127
01:27:45,865 --> 01:27:48,033
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.

1128
01:27:48,201 --> 01:27:52,829
I specialize in a very
specific type of security.

1129
01:27:53,206 --> 01:27:54,873
Subconscious security.

1130
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:57,167
You're talking about dreams?

1131
01:27:57,335 --> 01:28:00,170
Are you talking about, um, extraction?

1132
01:28:01,214 --> 01:28:02,631
I am here to protect you.

1133
01:28:16,062 --> 01:28:18,605
Mr. Fischer, I'm here
to protect you in the event...

1134
01:28:18,773 --> 01:28:22,150
that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

1135
01:28:22,318 --> 01:28:24,945
You're not safe here.

1136
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:27,364
They're coming for you.

1137
01:28:45,716 --> 01:28:47,759
Strange weather, isn't it?

1138
01:28:52,598 --> 01:28:53,723
You feel that?

1139
01:28:55,726 --> 01:28:56,893
What's happening?

1140
01:28:57,061 --> 01:29:00,313
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream...

1141
01:29:00,481 --> 01:29:03,358
which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer.

1142
01:29:03,526 --> 01:29:06,570
For me.
Quick, give me a kiss.

1143
01:29:11,577 --> 01:29:15,454
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.

1144
01:29:16,123 --> 01:29:18,166
We should probably get out of here.

1145
01:29:33,432 --> 01:29:37,018
You feel that? You've actually
been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

1146
01:29:37,185 --> 01:29:41,188
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shift in gravity.

1147
01:29:41,356 --> 01:29:44,525
None of this is real.
You're in a dream.

1148
01:29:49,323 --> 01:29:51,574
Now, the easiest way
for you to test yourself...

1149
01:29:51,783 --> 01:29:55,828
is to try and remember how you arrived
at this hotel. Can you do that?

1150
01:29:56,663 --> 01:29:57,955
Yeah, I...

1151
01:29:58,123 --> 01:30:00,597
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.

1152
01:30:00,697 --> 01:30:06,005
Accept the fact that you're in a dream,
and I'm here to protect you. Go on.

1153
01:30:08,008 --> 01:30:09,383
Mm-hm.

1154
01:30:12,179 --> 01:30:14,013
- You're not real?
- No.

1155
01:30:14,181 --> 01:30:17,558
No. I'm a projection of your subconscious.

1156
01:30:17,726 --> 01:30:19,810
I was sent here to protect you
in the event...

1157
01:30:19,978 --> 01:30:22,897
that extractors
tried to pull you into a dream.

1158
01:30:23,065 --> 01:30:26,317
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1159
01:30:27,402 --> 01:30:28,444
Yeah.

1160
01:30:28,612 --> 01:30:29,695
Okay.

1161
01:30:30,614 --> 01:30:31,822
Okay.

1162
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:36,661
Can you get me out of here?

1163
01:30:37,579 --> 01:30:40,164
Right away. Follow me.

1164
01:30:54,388 --> 01:30:55,721
Hold on a second.

1165
01:31:00,686 --> 01:31:02,520
Jesus Christ!
What are you doing?

1166
01:31:02,688 --> 01:31:04,939
These men were sent here
to abduct you, all right?

1167
01:31:05,107 --> 01:31:07,692
If you want my help,
you have to remain calm.

1168
01:31:09,403 --> 01:31:11,696
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

1169
01:31:23,417 --> 01:31:27,044
If this is a dream, I should just
kill myself to wake up, right?

1170
01:31:27,212 --> 01:31:29,296
I wouldn't do that if I were you,
Mr. Fischer.

1171
01:31:29,464 --> 01:31:32,967
I believe they have you sedated,
and if you pull that trigger...

1172
01:31:33,135 --> 01:31:34,301
you may not wake up.

1173
01:31:35,429 --> 01:31:39,724
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

1174
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:43,728
You remember the training.

1175
01:31:44,896 --> 01:31:46,272
Remember what I said to you.

1176
01:31:47,149 --> 01:31:48,315
Give me the gun.

1177
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,747
- This room should be directly below 528?
- Yeah.

1178
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:13,591
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

1179
01:32:13,759 --> 01:32:17,595
What do you remember
from before this dream?

1180
01:32:17,971 --> 01:32:20,598
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.

1181
01:32:20,767 --> 01:32:23,393
There was rain.

1182
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:25,520
Uncle Peter.

1183
01:32:25,772 --> 01:32:29,441
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?

1184
01:32:32,445 --> 01:32:35,739
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.

1185
01:32:35,948 --> 01:32:37,991
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.

1186
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:40,452
It had something to do with, um...

1187
01:32:41,079 --> 01:32:43,955
Something to do with a safe.

1188
01:32:44,582 --> 01:32:46,208
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1189
01:32:46,375 --> 01:32:49,086
It's like trying to remember a dream
after you've woken up.

1190
01:32:49,253 --> 01:32:50,962
Listen, it takes years of practice.

1191
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:53,548
You and Browning have been pulled
into this dream...

1192
01:32:53,716 --> 01:32:56,468
because they're trying to steal
something from your mind.

1193
01:32:56,636 --> 01:33:00,222
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1194
01:33:00,389 --> 01:33:02,015
What is it, Mr. Fischer?
Think!

1195
01:33:02,183 --> 01:33:05,936
A combination. They demanded
the first numbers to pop into my head.

1196
01:33:06,104 --> 01:33:08,814
They're trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.

1197
01:33:08,981 --> 01:33:12,776
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

1198
01:33:13,569 --> 01:33:16,696
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1199
01:33:16,864 --> 01:33:19,699
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1200
01:33:19,867 --> 01:33:21,201
Five.

1201
01:33:22,161 --> 01:33:24,621
Five, two... It was something,
it was a long number.

1202
01:33:24,789 --> 01:33:26,873
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.

1203
01:33:27,041 --> 01:33:28,083
Yep.

1204
01:33:28,251 --> 01:33:32,295
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.

1205
01:33:32,505 --> 01:33:35,757
While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1206
01:33:35,925 --> 01:33:38,051
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

1207
01:33:38,219 --> 01:33:42,180
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1208
01:33:42,348 --> 01:33:45,517
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

1209
01:33:45,685 --> 01:33:48,103
If it's too soon,
we won't get pulled out.

1210
01:33:48,271 --> 01:33:51,523
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.

1211
01:33:51,691 --> 01:33:55,527
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.

1212
01:33:56,028 --> 01:33:58,864
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.

1213
01:34:04,537 --> 01:34:06,746
They're with me.
Go on.

1214
01:34:31,063 --> 01:34:32,105
Mr. Charles.

1215
01:34:32,273 --> 01:34:35,233
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.

1216
01:34:35,401 --> 01:34:37,485
They were trying to put you under.

1217
01:34:37,904 --> 01:34:39,988
- I'm already under.
- Under again.

1218
01:34:40,156 --> 01:34:42,741
What do you mean,
a dream within a dream?

1219
01:34:43,326 --> 01:34:45,785
Hey. I see you've changed.

1220
01:34:45,953 --> 01:34:47,579
I'm sorry?

1221
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:51,958
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.

1222
01:34:52,126 --> 01:34:53,418
Oh.

1223
01:34:53,586 --> 01:34:55,712
Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

1224
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:59,299
No, no, no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.

1225
01:34:59,467 --> 01:35:01,343
Let's follow him
and see how he behaves.

1226
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:03,470
- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...

1227
01:35:03,638 --> 01:35:06,973
if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.

1228
01:35:07,141 --> 01:35:08,183
Shh.

1229
01:35:12,772 --> 01:35:15,273
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?

1230
01:35:15,441 --> 01:35:18,860
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.

1231
01:35:19,028 --> 01:35:20,487
And you saw them torture him?

1232
01:35:28,037 --> 01:35:29,871
The kidnappers are working for you?

1233
01:35:30,831 --> 01:35:32,290
Robert.

1234
01:35:32,458 --> 01:35:36,295
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?

1235
01:35:36,713 --> 01:35:40,967
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.

1236
01:35:41,134 --> 01:35:43,469
I'm not gonna throw away
my inheritance.

1237
01:35:43,637 --> 01:35:47,807
I couldn't let you rise
to your father's last taunt.

1238
01:35:48,642 --> 01:35:51,644
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?

1239
01:35:51,812 --> 01:35:53,771
That's his last insult.

1240
01:35:53,939 --> 01:35:57,566
A challenge for you
to build something for yourself...

1241
01:35:57,734 --> 01:36:01,529
by telling you you're not worthy
of his accomplishments.

1242
01:36:07,202 --> 01:36:12,581
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.

1243
01:36:13,959 --> 01:36:17,044
But he's wrong.

1244
01:36:17,796 --> 01:36:20,423
You can build a better company
than he ever did.

1245
01:36:20,590 --> 01:36:23,009
Mr. Fischer?
He's lying.

1246
01:36:23,176 --> 01:36:25,303
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.

1247
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:28,222
He's hiding something,
and we need to find out what that is.

1248
01:36:29,433 --> 01:36:32,852
I need you to do the same thing to him
that he was going to do to you.

1249
01:36:35,397 --> 01:36:39,483
We'll enter his subconscious and find out
what he doesn't want you to know.

1250
01:36:40,736 --> 01:36:42,194
All right.

1251
01:36:48,201 --> 01:36:49,452
- He's out.
- Wait.

1252
01:36:49,619 --> 01:36:51,704
Whose subconscious
are we going into exactly?

1253
01:36:51,872 --> 01:36:53,205
We're going into Fischer's.

1254
01:36:53,373 --> 01:36:56,042
I told him it was Browning's
so he'd be a part of our team.

1255
01:36:56,209 --> 01:36:58,544
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

1256
01:36:58,712 --> 01:37:00,296
That's right.

1257
01:37:00,464 --> 01:37:02,548
Security's gonna run you down hard.

1258
01:37:02,716 --> 01:37:05,051
And I will lead them on a merry chase.

1259
01:37:05,594 --> 01:37:08,220
- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1260
01:37:13,435 --> 01:37:14,643
You good?

1261
01:37:17,814 --> 01:37:19,148
Hey. You ready?

1262
01:37:19,316 --> 01:37:22,902
Yes, yes.
I'm fine. I'm ready.

1263
01:37:35,457 --> 01:37:36,791
Cobb?

1264
01:37:37,459 --> 01:37:39,919
Cobb? What's down there?

1265
01:37:43,256 --> 01:37:45,883
Hopefully, the truth
we want Fischer to learn.

1266
01:37:46,051 --> 01:37:47,927
I mean, what's down there for you?

1267
01:40:24,544 --> 01:40:26,294
Did you see that?

1268
01:40:44,772 --> 01:40:46,606
Eames, this is your dream.

1269
01:40:46,774 --> 01:40:49,901
I need you to draw the security away
from the complex, understand?

1270
01:40:50,069 --> 01:40:51,861
- Who guides Fischer in?
- Not me.

1271
01:40:52,029 --> 01:40:54,489
If I know the route,
everything could be compromised.

1272
01:40:54,657 --> 01:40:57,200
- I designed the place.
- No, you're with me.

1273
01:40:57,368 --> 01:40:58,910
I could do it.

1274
01:40:59,328 --> 01:41:01,788
All right. Brief him on the route
into the complex.

1275
01:41:01,956 --> 01:41:06,126
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- All right. What about you?

1276
01:41:06,294 --> 01:41:09,129
You keep this live.
I'll be listening in the whole time.

1277
01:41:09,297 --> 01:41:13,466
The windows on that upper floor are big
enough for me to cover you from that tower.

1278
01:41:13,634 --> 01:41:14,926
You're not coming in?

1279
01:41:15,094 --> 01:41:17,429
In order to find out the truth
about your father...

1280
01:41:17,597 --> 01:41:20,640
you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.

1281
01:41:21,475 --> 01:41:22,976
Come on, Fischer!

1282
01:42:18,033 --> 01:42:21,702
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
- Go, go, go!

1283
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:23,412
Move!

1284
01:42:24,956 --> 01:42:26,040
Go!

1285
01:42:41,223 --> 01:42:42,264
Sod it.

1286
01:42:53,443 --> 01:42:55,111
I hope you're ready.

1287
01:43:03,870 --> 01:43:05,621
No, it's too soon.

1288
01:43:12,129 --> 01:43:13,337
Cobb, do you hear that?

1289
01:43:13,505 --> 01:43:17,091
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago,
I thought it was the wind up here.

1290
01:43:17,592 --> 01:43:20,094
Yeah, I hear it.
It's music.

1291
01:43:20,262 --> 01:43:21,679
So, what do we do?

1292
01:43:21,847 --> 01:43:23,264
We move fast.

1293
01:43:28,770 --> 01:43:30,980
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.

1294
01:43:32,858 --> 01:43:35,234
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1295
01:43:36,153 --> 01:43:38,279
- Hey!
- That's him!

1296
01:43:38,947 --> 01:43:40,656
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.

1297
01:43:40,824 --> 01:43:44,118
- Can they make that route in an hour?
- They have to climb to the terrace.

1298
01:43:44,286 --> 01:43:47,121
Then they need a new route,
a more direct route.

1299
01:43:58,341 --> 01:43:59,967
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1300
01:44:00,135 --> 01:44:02,636
There must be access routes
that cut through the maze.

1301
01:44:02,804 --> 01:44:04,388
Eames?

1302
01:44:27,496 --> 01:44:28,746
Did Eames add any features?

1303
01:44:28,914 --> 01:44:30,372
I don't think I should tell you.

1304
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:32,833
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?

1305
01:44:33,293 --> 01:44:35,927
He added an air-duct system
that can cut through the maze.

1306
01:44:36,027 --> 01:44:37,362
Good. Explain it to them.

1307
01:44:37,496 --> 01:44:38,846
- <i>Saito?</i>
- Go ahead.

1308
01:45:12,165 --> 01:45:13,708
Paradox.

1309
01:46:23,613 --> 01:46:25,655
- What was that?
- The kick.

1310
01:46:26,282 --> 01:46:28,158
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?

1311
01:46:28,326 --> 01:46:30,035
Yeah, we missed it.

1312
01:46:30,202 --> 01:46:31,411
Man.

1313
01:46:31,579 --> 01:46:35,874
Couldn't someone have dreamt up
a goddamn beach? Huh?

1314
01:46:36,042 --> 01:46:37,292
Uh-huh.

1315
01:46:38,044 --> 01:46:40,211
<i>Well, what the hell do we do now?</i>

1316
01:46:40,379 --> 01:46:42,213
We finish the job before the next kick.

1317
01:46:42,381 --> 01:46:44,466
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.

1318
01:47:07,323 --> 01:47:10,784
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

1319
01:47:10,951 --> 01:47:12,786
<i>If you need help, hang up...</i>

1320
01:47:12,995 --> 01:47:16,331
How do I drop you without gravity?

1321
01:47:18,834 --> 01:47:21,503
Arthur has a couple minutes,
and we have about 20.

1322
01:47:44,902 --> 01:47:46,569
You okay?

1323
01:47:51,033 --> 01:47:54,911
Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!

1324
01:47:55,079 --> 01:47:56,621
Go, go, go!

1325
01:47:58,791 --> 01:47:59,958
There's something wrong.

1326
01:48:00,126 --> 01:48:02,460
They're heading your way,
like they know something.

1327
01:48:03,713 --> 01:48:05,922
Just buy us more time, all right?

1328
01:48:06,090 --> 01:48:07,924
- Come on!
- On my way.

1329
01:48:08,092 --> 01:48:09,801
Come on! Move!

1330
01:49:33,970 --> 01:49:35,513
All right.

1331
01:49:47,692 --> 01:49:50,486
Okay. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.

1332
01:49:50,654 --> 01:49:54,156
- Does the strong room have windows?
- It wouldn't be very strong if it did.

1333
01:49:54,324 --> 01:49:56,575
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

1334
01:49:58,203 --> 01:50:01,539
- Are those projections his subconscious?
- Yes.

1335
01:50:01,706 --> 01:50:05,084
- Are you destroying parts of his mind?
- No. They're just projections.

1336
01:50:31,361 --> 01:50:33,112
- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.

1337
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:35,114
There's an entire army headed your way.

1338
01:51:01,933 --> 01:51:03,309
I'm in.

1339
01:51:08,607 --> 01:51:09,732
There he is.

1340
01:51:52,318 --> 01:51:55,028
- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.

1341
01:51:56,197 --> 01:51:58,782
Come on. Come on, a little lower.

1342
01:52:04,497 --> 01:52:05,664
Cobb.

1343
01:52:06,290 --> 01:52:08,833
No, she is not real.

1344
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:10,669
How do you know that?

1345
01:52:10,836 --> 01:52:14,464
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.

1346
01:52:18,469 --> 01:52:20,011
Hello.

1347
01:52:24,684 --> 01:52:27,894
Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!

1348
01:53:11,814 --> 01:53:14,691
- What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.

1349
01:53:16,944 --> 01:53:18,987
I couldn't shoot her.

1350
01:53:19,655 --> 01:53:23,033
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.

1351
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:24,242
It's all over.

1352
01:53:25,995 --> 01:53:27,620
So that's it, then?
We failed?

1353
01:53:28,247 --> 01:53:30,415
We're done. I'm sorry.

1354
01:53:34,295 --> 01:53:36,921
It's not me that doesn't get back
to my family, is it?

1355
01:53:37,631 --> 01:53:41,551
Shame. I wanted to know what was
gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.

1356
01:53:41,719 --> 01:53:43,762
Let's set the charges.

1357
01:53:45,598 --> 01:53:47,098
No, there's still another way.

1358
01:53:48,392 --> 01:53:51,811
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.

1359
01:53:51,979 --> 01:53:54,814
No, but there will be
enough time down there.

1360
01:53:55,941 --> 01:53:57,067
And we will find him.

1361
01:53:57,234 --> 01:54:01,154
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1362
01:54:01,322 --> 01:54:04,240
We can give him his own kick
down below.

1363
01:54:05,242 --> 01:54:06,951
Look, you get him in there.

1364
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:09,996
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital...

1365
01:54:10,164 --> 01:54:12,957
and we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

1366
01:54:14,168 --> 01:54:18,922
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold
the guards off while I set the charges.

1367
01:54:19,090 --> 01:54:21,216
Saito will never make it, will he?

1368
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:25,720
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.

1369
01:54:25,888 --> 01:54:28,807
If you are not back before the kick,
I am gone with or without you.

1370
01:54:28,974 --> 01:54:32,227
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.

1371
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:38,650
Can I trust you to do
what needs to happen here?

1372
01:54:38,818 --> 01:54:40,026
Mal's gonna be down there.

1373
01:54:40,194 --> 01:54:42,612
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

1374
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:46,699
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.

1375
01:54:46,867 --> 01:54:49,035
She wants me back down there with her.

1376
01:55:15,814 --> 01:55:16,814
All right?

1377
01:55:24,072 --> 01:55:26,740
- This is your world?
- It was.

1378
01:55:27,534 --> 01:55:29,493
And this is where she'll be.

1379
01:55:30,203 --> 01:55:31,245
Come on.

1380
01:56:18,251 --> 01:56:20,711
Saito. Saito.

1381
01:56:21,171 --> 01:56:25,132
I need you to take care of Fischer
while I go set some charges, okay?

1382
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:28,719
No room for tourists on these jobs.

1383
01:56:31,389 --> 01:56:32,556
Don't be silly.

1384
01:57:05,048 --> 01:57:07,091
You built all this?
This is incredible.

1385
01:57:07,592 --> 01:57:09,593
We built for years.

1386
01:57:10,637 --> 01:57:12,638
Then we started in on the memories.

1387
01:57:19,688 --> 01:57:21,105
This way.

1388
01:58:02,772 --> 01:58:04,857
This was our neighborhood.

1389
01:58:05,025 --> 01:58:07,360
Places from our past.

1390
01:58:07,528 --> 01:58:09,320
That was our first apartment.

1391
01:58:09,488 --> 01:58:11,698
Then we moved to that building
right there.

1392
01:58:11,866 --> 01:58:14,409
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

1393
01:58:14,577 --> 01:58:17,370
You reconstructed all of this
from memory?

1394
01:58:17,538 --> 01:58:19,831
Like I told you,
we had lots of time.

1395
01:58:19,999 --> 01:58:21,583
What is that?

1396
01:58:23,127 --> 01:58:24,878
That's the house Mal grew up in.

1397
01:58:25,046 --> 01:58:27,505
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.

1398
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:28,840
Come on.

1399
01:58:29,008 --> 01:58:32,343
We both wanted to live in a house,
but we loved this type of building.

1400
01:58:32,511 --> 01:58:35,472
In the real world,
we'd have to choose, but not here.

1401
01:59:16,055 --> 01:59:18,056
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?

1402
01:59:18,474 --> 01:59:20,892
We're gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

1403
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:22,477
What?

1404
01:59:23,479 --> 01:59:24,562
I'm gonna improvise.

1405
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:29,400
Listen, there's something you should
know about me. About inception.

1406
01:59:42,498 --> 01:59:46,376
An idea is like a virus.
Resilient.

1407
01:59:47,211 --> 01:59:48,753
Highly contagious.

1408
01:59:48,921 --> 01:59:52,257
And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

1409
01:59:53,342 --> 01:59:55,301
It can grow to define...

1410
01:59:56,345 --> 01:59:57,929
or destroy you.

1411
02:00:01,058 --> 02:00:03,810
The smallest idea, such as:

1412
02:00:04,436 --> 02:00:06,771
"Your world is not real."

1413
02:00:07,064 --> 02:00:10,817
Simple little thought
that changes everything.

1414
02:00:12,069 --> 02:00:16,573
So certain of your world.
Of what's real.

1415
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:18,533
Do you think he is?

1416
02:00:20,327 --> 02:00:23,246
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?

1417
02:00:24,373 --> 02:00:25,874
I know what's real, Mal.

1418
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:30,253
No creeping doubts?

1419
02:00:30,963 --> 02:00:33,590
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1420
02:00:33,883 --> 02:00:35,216
Chased around the globe...

1421
02:00:35,384 --> 02:00:38,052
by anonymous corporations
and police forces...

1422
02:00:38,220 --> 02:00:40,847
the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1423
02:00:42,474 --> 02:00:43,975
Admit it.

1424
02:00:45,269 --> 02:00:48,104
You don't believe in one reality anymore.

1425
02:00:48,272 --> 02:00:49,814
So choose.

1426
02:00:49,982 --> 02:00:51,918
Choose to be here.

1427
02:00:52,507 --> 02:00:53,918
Choose me.

1428
02:01:20,096 --> 02:01:21,347
You know what I have to do.

1429
02:01:21,514 --> 02:01:24,183
I have to get back to our children
because you left them.

1430
02:01:25,518 --> 02:01:27,061
Because you left us.

1431
02:01:27,229 --> 02:01:29,021
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

1432
02:01:29,189 --> 02:01:31,232
You're confused.

1433
02:01:32,359 --> 02:01:34,401
Our children are here.

1434
02:01:35,195 --> 02:01:38,447
And you'd like to see their faces again,
wouldn't you?

1435
02:01:38,615 --> 02:01:41,700
Yes, but I'm gonna see them
up above, Mal.

1436
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:57,341
Up above?

1437
02:01:58,218 --> 02:02:01,887
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.

1438
02:02:02,389 --> 02:02:03,764
Watch.

1439
02:02:04,266 --> 02:02:05,975
James? Phillipa?

1440
02:02:06,142 --> 02:02:08,560
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.

1441
02:02:08,728 --> 02:02:11,230
You keep telling yourself that,
but you don't believe it.

1442
02:02:11,398 --> 02:02:13,274
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?

1443
02:02:13,692 --> 02:02:15,985
What if I'm what's real?

1444
02:02:17,195 --> 02:02:19,405
You keep telling yourself
what you know.

1445
02:02:20,991 --> 02:02:23,242
But what do you believe?

1446
02:02:24,202 --> 02:02:25,411
What do you feel?

1447
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:28,998
Guilt.

1448
02:02:30,208 --> 02:02:32,418
I feel guilt, Mal.

1449
02:02:32,961 --> 02:02:36,922
And no matter what I do,
no matter how hopeless I am...

1450
02:02:37,090 --> 02:02:41,343
no matter how confused,
that guilt is always there...

1451
02:02:41,511 --> 02:02:44,054
reminding me of the truth.

1452
02:02:44,556 --> 02:02:45,848
What truth?

1453
02:02:48,268 --> 02:02:53,522
That the idea that caused you
to question your reality came from me.

1454
02:02:56,901 --> 02:03:00,029
You planted the idea in my mind?

1455
02:03:01,531 --> 02:03:03,032
What is she talking about?

1456
02:03:03,950 --> 02:03:09,204
The reason I knew inception was possible
was because I did it to her first.

1457
02:03:10,248 --> 02:03:13,208
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

1458
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:15,461
We were lost in here.

1459
02:03:16,379 --> 02:03:21,008
<i>I knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.</i>

1460
02:03:24,220 --> 02:03:29,892
<i>She had locked something away,
something deep inside.</i>

1461
02:03:30,643 --> 02:03:34,813
<i>A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.</i>

1462
02:03:35,774 --> 02:03:37,900
And she couldn't break free.

1463
02:03:40,612 --> 02:03:43,322
<i>So I decided to search for it.</i>

1464
02:03:43,907 --> 02:03:48,786
<i>I went deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.</i>

1465
02:03:48,953 --> 02:03:50,829
<i>And I broke in...</i>

1466
02:03:51,414 --> 02:03:53,582
<i>and I planted an idea.</i>

1467
02:03:54,334 --> 02:03:58,087
<i>A simple little idea
that would change everything.</i>

1468
02:04:03,343 --> 02:04:05,677
<i>That her world wasn't real.</i>

1469
02:04:18,525 --> 02:04:21,693
That death was the only escape.

1470
02:04:29,119 --> 02:04:30,869
You're waiting for a train.

1471
02:04:33,207 --> 02:04:35,917
A train that'll take you far away.

1472
02:04:37,086 --> 02:04:40,088
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

1473
02:04:41,215 --> 02:04:43,216
but you can't know for sure.

1474
02:04:44,385 --> 02:04:45,927
Yet it doesn't matter.

1475
02:04:47,388 --> 02:04:50,557
- Now, tell me why!
- Because you'll be together!

1476
02:04:54,895 --> 02:04:58,940
<i>But I never knew that that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...</i>

1477
02:04:59,108 --> 02:05:01,526
<i>that even after she woke...</i>

1478
02:05:04,405 --> 02:05:06,906
That even after
you came back to reality...

1479
02:05:09,827 --> 02:05:12,787
that you'd continue to believe
your world wasn't real.

1480
02:05:15,583 --> 02:05:17,959
That death was the only escape.

1481
02:05:18,127 --> 02:05:20,795
Mal, no! Jesus!

1482
02:05:20,963 --> 02:05:24,674
- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.

1483
02:05:24,842 --> 02:05:26,259
You betrayed me.

1484
02:05:27,094 --> 02:05:30,763
But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.

1485
02:05:30,931 --> 02:05:33,975
We can still be together, right here...

1486
02:05:34,143 --> 02:05:36,603
in the world we built together.

1487
02:06:57,434 --> 02:06:59,769
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1488
02:07:00,646 --> 02:07:01,938
You can't have him.

1489
02:07:02,982 --> 02:07:06,401
- If I stay here, will you let him go?
- What are you talking about?

1490
02:07:10,864 --> 02:07:12,699
Fischer is on the porch.

1491
02:07:13,284 --> 02:07:15,868
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.

1492
02:07:16,036 --> 02:07:18,705
Go check he's alive right now.
Do it.

1493
02:07:34,346 --> 02:07:37,432
He's here! And it's time,
but you have to come now!

1494
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:41,269
- You take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.

1495
02:07:43,856 --> 02:07:46,567
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.

1496
02:07:46,735 --> 02:07:50,237
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.

1497
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:55,326
I can't stay with her anymore,
because she doesn't exist.

1498
02:07:55,493 --> 02:07:58,912
I'm the only thing
you do believe in anymore.

1499
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:00,414
No.

1500
02:08:01,583 --> 02:08:03,000
I wish.

1501
02:08:04,586 --> 02:08:07,087
I wish more than anything, but...

1502
02:08:08,214 --> 02:08:10,924
I can't imagine you
with all your complexity...

1503
02:08:11,092 --> 02:08:13,636
all your perfection,
all your imperfection.

1504
02:08:14,763 --> 02:08:15,763
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1505
02:08:15,930 --> 02:08:17,765
Look at you.

1506
02:08:19,017 --> 02:08:23,937
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.

1507
02:08:24,397 --> 02:08:27,024
And you were the best
that I could do, but...

1508
02:08:27,859 --> 02:08:30,277
I'm sorry, you're just not good enough.

1509
02:08:30,445 --> 02:08:32,112
Does this feel real?

1510
02:08:34,491 --> 02:08:37,117
- What are you doing?
- Improvising.

1511
02:08:45,710 --> 02:08:47,419
No, no, no!

1512
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:50,798
In there, now.
Go, go, go.

1513
02:09:35,635 --> 02:09:37,511
I was dis...

1514
02:09:39,222 --> 02:09:41,557
I was dis... Disa...

1515
02:09:42,434 --> 02:09:44,977
- I know, Dad.
- Dis...

1516
02:09:50,984 --> 02:09:53,068
I know you were disappointed...

1517
02:09:53,862 --> 02:09:55,237
I couldn't be you.

1518
02:09:55,655 --> 02:09:57,156
No.

1519
02:09:57,657 --> 02:09:58,866
No, no, no.

1520
02:09:59,909 --> 02:10:01,910
I was disappointed...

1521
02:10:03,663 --> 02:10:05,581
that you tried.

1522
02:10:28,855 --> 02:10:30,522
What?

1523
02:10:39,949 --> 02:10:41,074
Come on, come on.

1524
02:11:11,315 --> 02:11:12,816
Dad?

1525
02:11:51,146 --> 02:11:54,232
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

1526
02:12:07,079 --> 02:12:10,498
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

1527
02:12:10,666 --> 02:12:12,333
I will!

1528
02:12:52,499 --> 02:12:55,251
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

1529
02:12:55,419 --> 02:12:56,544
Yes.

1530
02:12:56,712 --> 02:12:59,756
You said you dreamt
that we'd grow old together.

1531
02:13:02,468 --> 02:13:03,968
But we did.

1532
02:13:05,888 --> 02:13:08,264
<i>We did. You don't remember?</i>

1533
02:13:12,937 --> 02:13:15,772
I miss you more than I can bear...

1534
02:13:18,150 --> 02:13:20,151
but we had our time together.

1535
02:13:21,487 --> 02:13:23,571
And I have to let you go.

1536
02:13:25,658 --> 02:13:27,450
I have to let you go.

1537
02:14:18,712 --> 02:14:20,004
I'm sorry, Robert.

1538
02:14:47,657 --> 02:14:51,326
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

1539
02:14:52,412 --> 02:14:54,455
not just to live for him.

1540
02:14:56,041 --> 02:14:58,584
That's what I'm gonna do,
Uncle Peter.

1541
02:15:08,344 --> 02:15:09,595
What happened?

1542
02:15:10,055 --> 02:15:11,764
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

1543
02:15:11,931 --> 02:15:13,182
No, to find Saito.

1544
02:15:15,477 --> 02:15:17,227
He'll be lost.

1545
02:15:19,773 --> 02:15:21,607
No, he'll be all right.

1546
02:15:37,624 --> 02:15:39,583
Have you come to kill me?

1547
02:15:43,880 --> 02:15:46,340
I'm waiting for someone.

1548
02:15:50,804 --> 02:15:53,555
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1549
02:15:56,309 --> 02:15:57,726
Cobb?

1550
02:15:59,646 --> 02:16:01,396
Impossible.

1551
02:16:01,940 --> 02:16:04,566
We were young men together.

1552
02:16:06,152 --> 02:16:08,487
I'm an old man.

1553
02:16:09,739 --> 02:16:11,782
Filled with regret.

1554
02:16:14,911 --> 02:16:17,621
Waiting to die alone.

1555
02:16:20,792 --> 02:16:22,960
I've come back for you.

1556
02:16:26,256 --> 02:16:30,092
To remind you of something.

1557
02:16:33,388 --> 02:16:35,764
Something you once knew.

1558
02:16:38,601 --> 02:16:40,853
That this world is not real.

1559
02:16:45,775 --> 02:16:50,279
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

1560
02:16:51,114 --> 02:16:53,866
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1561
02:16:59,956 --> 02:17:01,290
Come back...

1562
02:17:03,835 --> 02:17:07,212
so we can be
young men together again.

1563
02:17:10,967 --> 02:17:12,968
Come back with me.

1564
02:17:16,055 --> 02:17:17,472
Come back.

1565
02:17:27,234 --> 02:17:28,943
Hot towel, sir?

1566
02:17:29,570 --> 02:17:32,447
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

1567
02:17:32,615 --> 02:17:34,908
Do you need immigration forms?

1568
02:17:36,994 --> 02:17:38,328
Thank you.

1569
02:17:38,829 --> 02:17:40,455
Hot towel, sir?

1570
02:17:41,457 --> 02:17:44,459
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

1571
02:18:55,823 --> 02:18:56,906
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1572
02:18:58,033 --> 02:18:59,659
Thank you, sir.

1573
02:19:43,704 --> 02:19:45,079
Welcome.

1574
02:19:45,539 --> 02:19:46,956
This way.

1575
02:20:08,145 --> 02:20:11,606
James? Phillipa?

1576
02:20:15,319 --> 02:20:16,611
Look who's here.

1577
02:20:22,201 --> 02:20:23,284
Hey.

1578
02:20:24,369 --> 02:20:27,080
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
- Daddy! Daddy!

1579
02:20:27,247 --> 02:20:29,499
- Daddy!
- How are you?

1580
02:20:30,626 --> 02:20:32,210
Look what I've been building!

1581
02:20:32,377 --> 02:20:36,089
- What are you building?
- We're building a house on the cliff!

1582
02:20:36,256 --> 02:20:39,133
On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

1583
02:20:39,302 --> 02:20:41,845
- Let's go.
- Come on, Daddy!
