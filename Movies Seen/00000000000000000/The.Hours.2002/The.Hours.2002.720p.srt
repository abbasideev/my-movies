1
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,760
<i>Dearest, I feel certain</i>

2
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,600
<i>that I am going mad again.</i>

3
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,960
<i>I feel we can't go</i>

4
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,000
<i>through another
of these terrible times,</i>

5
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,160
<i>and I... shan't</i>

6
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,440
<i>recover this time.</i>

7
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,800
<i>I begin to hear voices,
and can't concentrate.</i>

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,840
<i>So, I am doing
what seems to be</i>

9
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,800
<i>the best thing to do.</i>

10
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,760
<i>You have given me</i>

11
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,560
<i>the greatest possible
happiness.</i>

12
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,040
<i>You have been in every way</i>

13
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,320
<i>all that anyone could be.</i>

14
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,840
<i>I know
that I am spoiling your life,</i>

15
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,480
<i>and without me,
you could work.</i>

16
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,520
<i>And you will,</i>

17
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,400
<i>I know.</i>

18
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,640
<i>You see, I can't
even write this properly.</i>

19
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,480
<i>What I want to say
is that I owe</i>

20
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,120
<i>all the happiness
of my life to you.</i>

21
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,040
<i>You have been entirely patient
with me...</i>

22
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,400
<i>and</i>

23
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,120
<i>incredibly good.</i>

24
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,400
<i>Everything's gone</i>

25
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,040
<i>from me but the certainty</i>

26
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,560
<i>of your goodness.</i>

27
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,360
<i>I can't go on
spoiling your life any longer.</i>

28
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,080
<i>I don't think two people
could have been happier</i>

29
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,520
<i>than we have been.</i>

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,080
<i>Virginia.</i>

31
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,280
Good morning, Doctor.

32
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,720
Mr. Woolf.

33
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,840
No worse, I think.

34
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,760
I see.

35
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,760
The main thing is to keep her
where she is, and calm.

36
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,040
Friday, then.

37
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,200
Good morning, Leonard.

38
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,480
Good morning, Virginia.

39
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,840
How was your sleep ?

40
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,440
Uneventful.

41
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,160
The headaches ?

42
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,920
No. No headaches.

43
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,320
Doctor seemed pleased.

44
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,920
That's all from this morning ?

45
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,320
Yes. This young man
has submitted his manuscript.

46
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,880
I've found three errors of fact

47
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,800
and two spelling mistakes,

48
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,280
and I'm not yet on page four.

49
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,280
Have you had breakfast ?

50
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Yes.

51
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,520
Liar.

52
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,520
Virginia, it's not
my insistence.

53
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,840
It's your own doctor's.

54
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,440
I'm going to send

55
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,800
Nelly up with some fruit
and a bun.

56
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,520
Right. Lunch, then.

57
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,520
Proper lunch,

58
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,160
husband and wife
sitting down together...

59
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,480
soup, pudding

60
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,240
and all.

61
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,520
By force if necessary.

62
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,640
Leonard, I believe
I may have a first sentence.

63
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,880
Work, then.

64
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,360
Then you must eat.

65
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,880
Mrs. Dalloway said...

66
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:52,120
she would buy the flowers...
herself.

67
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,360
<i>Mrs. Dalloway said</i>

68
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,560
<i>she would buy the flowers
herself.</i>

69
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Sally, I think I'll buy
the flowers myself.

70
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,360
What ?

71
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,440
What flowers ?

72
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,120
Oh, shit. I forgot.

73
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,840
You're never going
to be a big boy

74
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,960
if you don't eat
your breakfast.

75
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,360
You're going to be
the big brother.

76
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
It's a very important job.

77
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,600
Happy birthday.

78
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,280
- Morning, honey.
- Oh, Dan.

79
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,840
Roses on your own birthday.

80
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,200
You're too much.
Really.

81
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,680
He'll eat it

82
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,760
now that you're here.

83
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,000
It's your birthday.

84
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,600
You shouldn't be out
buying me flowers.

85
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,200
Well, you were still sleeping.

86
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,880
So ?

87
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,800
Well, we decided
it would be better

88
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,680
if we let you sleep in
a little, didn't we ?

89
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,920
Morning, bug.

90
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,720
You need to rest, Laura.

91
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,320
You're only four months away.

92
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,440
Dan, don't.

93
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,920
I'm fine.

94
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,840
I'm just tired.

95
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,080
I've been telling him
he's got to eat his breakfast.

96
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,280
That's true.

97
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,000
So, it's a beautiful day.

98
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,320
What are you two going
to be doing with it ?

99
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,880
We've got our plans,
don't we ?

100
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,080
What plans ?

101
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,400
Hmm...

102
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,000
Well, it wouldn't
be much of a party,

103
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,000
would it, if I told you

104
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
every detail in advance ?

105
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,280
Well, I better just stop

106
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,880
asking questions then, huh ?

107
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,080
That the time ?

108
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,400
I better get going.

109
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,360
Have a good day.

110
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,440
You, too.

111
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,480
Dan, happy birthday.

112
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,640
Oh, thank you.

113
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,000
You need to finish
your breakfast.

114
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,680
Oh, I'm going to make a cake.

115
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,800
That's what I'm going to do.

116
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,800
I'm going to make the cake
for Daddy's birthday.

117
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,360
Mommy, can I help ?

118
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,720
Can I help make the cake ?

119
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,800
Of course you can, sweet pea.

120
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,160
I'm not going to do
anything without you.

121
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,200
No, of course.

122
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,920
You have to come.

123
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,080
Of course.

124
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Well, I always wanted you

125
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,120
and everybody involved
in the actual ceremony.

126
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,840
I don't know.

127
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,240
Around 60.

128
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,640
Well, it will.

129
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,480
It'll mean so much.

130
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,760
The whole occasion.

131
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,760
It's the least I can do

132
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,760
to have a nice dinner
and say thank you

133
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,880
to everybody.

134
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,480
You've done so much for him.

135
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,960
Oh, I take that as a yes.

136
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,520
He'll be thrilled.

137
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,800
Oh, my God.

138
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,880
I'm thrilled.
Oh, good.

139
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,280
What if nobody comes ?

140
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,960
This is Clarissa Vaughan.

141
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,240
Yes, I am just confirming

142
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,520
that you're sending a car
to pick me up first.

143
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,840
Yeah.

144
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,440
- Hi, Clarissa.
- Hi, can't talk.

145
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,040
And then we're
going over to 679 Hudson,

146
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,920
which is at 9th and 14th.

147
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,480
Then you will take me uptown
and you will wait for us.

148
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,080
And it'll be over at seven.

149
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,720
Flowers !
What a beautiful morning.

150
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,640
Hi, Clarissa.
How are you ?

151
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,040
I'm having a party.

152
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,960
My friend Richard's won
the Carruthers.

153
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,360
Well, that's just terrific...

154
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,840
if I knew what it was.

155
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,440
It's a poetry prize
for a life's work.

156
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,240
It's the most prestigious.

157
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,680
For a poet,
it's the best you can do.

158
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,920
Oh, very good.

159
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,680
So, what would you like ?

160
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,520
The lilies are perfect.

161
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,560
No. Too morbid.

162
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,640
Hydrangeas, I think.

163
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,080
And, um...

164
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,040
Oh, oh, let's just have
buckets of roses.

165
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,400
And... I think I'm going
to take these with me.

166
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,200
Rodney ?

167
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,680
Okay.

168
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,680
Thank you.

169
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,040
I actually tried
to read Richard's novel.

170
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,920
You did ?

171
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,640
Oh, I know. It's not easy.

172
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,800
I know.

173
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,240
It did take him
ten years to write.

174
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,160
Maybe it just takes
another ten to read.

175
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,880
It's you, isn't it ?

176
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,280
What is ?

177
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,760
In the novel,
isn't it meant to be you ?

178
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,440
Oh, I see.

179
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,920
Yeah.

180
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,360
Sort of.

181
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,800
I mean, in a way.

182
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,080
You know, Richard's a writer.

183
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,360
That's what he is.

184
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,880
He uses things
which actually happen.

185
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,320
Yeah.

186
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,560
And years ago,
he and I were students.

187
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,680
That's true.

188
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,200
But, you know,
then he changes things.

189
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,040
Oh, sure.

190
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,160
I don't mean in a bad way.

191
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,720
It's more like...
he makes them his own.

192
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,320
A woman's whole life...

193
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,600
in a single day,

194
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,360
just one day...

195
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,200
and in that day,

196
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,160
her whole life.

197
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,880
This is what we need.

198
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,320
Shortening...

199
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,000
Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.

200
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,320
Yes, it's me !

201
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,800
Oh... It's me.

202
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,040
Come in.

203
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,640
Richard,
it's a beautiful morning.

204
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,040
How about we let in
a little more light ?

205
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,800
Is it still morning ?

206
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,680
Yes, it is.

207
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,840
Have I died ?

208
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,880
Good morning, my dear.

209
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,760
Any visitors ?

210
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,760
Yes.

211
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,920
Are they still here ?

212
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,400
No. They've gone.

213
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,240
Mm. How'd they look ?

214
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,200
Today ?

215
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,240
Sort of like black fire.

216
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,600
I mean, sort of light

217
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,000
and dark at the same time.

218
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,200
There was one a bit
like an electrified jellyfish.

219
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,520
They were singing.

220
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,040
May have been Greek.

221
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,000
So the ceremony is at 5:00.

222
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,280
Do you remember ?

223
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,520
And then...

224
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,880
the party is right after.

225
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,400
They did bring you breakfast,
didn't they ?

226
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,120
What a question. Of course.

227
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,160
Richard, you did eat it ?

228
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,520
Well, can you see it ?

229
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,680
Is it here ?

230
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,680
Any breakfast lying around ?

231
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,000
No, I don't see it.

232
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,760
Well, then I must have
eaten it, mustn't I ?

233
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,120
I suppose.

234
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Does it matter ?

235
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,080
Of course, it matters.

236
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,400
You know what the doctors say.

237
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,200
Have you been skipping pills ?

238
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,520
Clarissa, I can't take this.

239
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,480
Take what ?

240
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,760
Having to be proud and brave

241
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,200
in front of everybody.

242
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,280
Oh. Honey, it's not
a performance.

243
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,360
Of course it is.

244
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,560
I got the prize
for my performance.

245
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,560
Well, that is
nonsense.

246
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,680
I got the prize for having AIDS
and going nuts

247
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,880
and being brave about it.

248
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,200
I actually got the prize
for having come through.

249
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,960
It's not true.

250
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,520
- For surviving, that's what
- It's not true.

251
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,000
I got the prize for.
Oh, you think they

252
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,120
would have given it to me
if I were healthy ?

253
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,080
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

254
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,680
Is it here somewhere ?

255
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,640
What ?

256
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,080
The prize.
I'd like to look at it.

257
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,360
No, you haven't gotten it yet.

258
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,960
It's tonight.

259
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,520
Are you sure ?

260
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,680
Um...

261
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,880
I remember
the ceremony perfectly.

262
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,360
I seem to have
fallen out of time.

263
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,880
Richard.

264
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,560
Richard...

265
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,280
it's a party,

266
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,560
and it's only a party.

267
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,720
Hmm ? Populated entirely

268
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,400
by people who respect
and admire you.

269
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,920
A small party, is it ?

270
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,560
A select party, is it ?

271
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,040
Your friends.

272
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,880
I thought I lost all my friends.

273
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
I thought I drove
my friends crazy.

274
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,960
Jesus.

275
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,160
Oh, Mrs. Dalloway,

276
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,640
always giving parties
to cover the silence.

277
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,440
Richard...

278
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,960
You won't need to do anything.

279
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,920
All you have to do is appear,

280
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,960
sit on the sofa.

281
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,520
And I will be there.

282
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,920
This is a group of people

283
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,640
who want to tell you
your work is going to live.

284
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,840
Oh, is it ?

285
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,760
Is my work going to live ?

286
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,920
I can't go through with it,
Clarissa.

287
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,960
Oh... Why do you say that ?

288
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,560
- I can't.
- Why ?

289
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,200
Because I wanted
to be a writer, that's all.

290
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,160
So ?

291
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,000
I wanted to write about it all.

292
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,080
Everything that happens
in a moment.

293
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,120
The way the flowers looked

294
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,840
when you carried them
in your arms.

295
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,120
This towel, how it... smells,
how it feels.

296
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,240
This thread.

297
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,800
All our feelings,

298
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,560
yours and mine.

299
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,560
The history of it,

300
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,200
who we once were.

301
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,960
Everything in the world.

302
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,360
Everything all mixed up...

303
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,120
like it's all mixed up now.

304
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,640
And I failed.

305
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,520
I failed.

306
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,280
No matter what you start with,
it ends up being so much less.

307
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,560
Sheer fucking pride...

308
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,160
and stupidity.

309
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,800
We want everything, don't we ?

310
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,240
I suppose we do.

311
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,360
You kissed me on a beach.

312
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,080
Yeah.

313
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,880
Do you remember...

314
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,360
how many years ago ?

315
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,560
Of course.

316
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,840
What did you want then ?

317
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,840
Come closer.

318
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,320
I'm right here.

319
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,480
Come closer, would you, please ?

320
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,800
Take my hand.

321
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,280
Would you be angry ?

322
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,560
Would I be angry
if you didn't show up

323
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,840
at the party ?

324
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,080
Would you be angry if I died ?

325
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,320
If you died ?

326
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,640
Who is this party for ?

327
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,760
What do you mean, who's it for ?

328
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,600
What are you asking ?
What are you trying to say ?

329
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,320
I'm not trying to say anything.

330
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,440
Mm.

331
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,720
I'm saying...

332
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,720
I think I'm only staying alive
to satisfy you.

333
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Well...

334
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,320
so that is what we do.

335
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,080
That is what people do.

336
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,760
They stay alive for each other.

337
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,760
And the doctors told you,

338
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,200
you-you don't need to die.

339
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,160
They told you that.

340
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,600
You can... live
like this for years.

341
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,400
Well, exactly.

342
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,280
I don't accept this.

343
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,120
I don't accept what you say.

344
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,120
Oh.

345
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,360
And it's for you
to decide, is it ?

346
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,800
How long have you been
doing that ?

347
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,000
How many years ?

348
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,280
Coming to the apartment.

349
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,200
What about your own life ?

350
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,800
What about Sally ?

351
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,040
Just wait till I die.

352
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,440
Then you'll have to think
of yourself.

353
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,640
How are you going to like that ?

354
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,160
Richard...

355
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,360
it would be great
if you did come to the party,

356
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,800
if you felt
well enough to come.

357
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,000
Just to let you know,

358
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,040
I am making the crab thing.

359
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,960
Not that I imagine
it makes any difference to you.

360
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,600
Of course,
it makes a difference.

361
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,840
I love the crab thing.

362
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,760
Clarissa ?

363
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,880
Yes ?

364
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,960
I'll be back at 3:30,

365
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,440
and I'll help you
get dressed.

366
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,640
Wonderful.

367
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,680
3:30.

368
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,240
Wonderful.

369
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,520
<i>It's on this day,</i>

370
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,680
<i>this day of all days...</i>

371
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,520
<i>her fate becomes clear
to her.</i>

372
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,400
Excuse me, Mrs. Woolf.

373
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,720
Mr. Woolf said I was to come
and speak with you.

374
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,040
I've nearly finished, Nelly.

375
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,000
You can tell me in the kitchen.

376
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,520
I'll be down very soon.

377
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,360
Hmm.

378
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,680
What happens is,
she says she wants something,

379
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,160
and then it turns out
she doesn't.

380
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,840
Well, she never does, does she ?

381
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,840
She never wants anything.

382
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,840
Mm-hmm.

383
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,080
Especially when she's
particularly after it.

384
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,040
That's a sure sign.

385
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,240
I wish I'd been there.

386
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,600
I wish you had, too.

387
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,760
Did you give her that look ?

388
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
That sort of look you do ?

389
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,040
<i>I said, Madam...</i>

390
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,400
Yes, Nelly, tell me.

391
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,560
How can I help ?

392
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,880
It's about lunch.

393
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,200
I just had
to go ahead on my own.

394
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,960
I understand.

395
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,560
You chose a pie ?

396
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,280
I chose a lamb pie.

397
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,480
That seems suitable.

398
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,880
You being so busy
with your writing...

399
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,200
I had no instructions.

400
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,680
You do remember
that my sister is coming

401
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,280
at 4:00 with the children ?

402
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,480
Yes, ma'am.

403
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,440
I hadn't forgotten.

404
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,960
China tea, I think.

405
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
And ginger.

406
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,760
Ginger, Madam ?

407
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,400
I'd like
to give the children a treat.

408
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,560
We'd have to go to London

409
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,520
for ginger, Madam.

410
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,840
I haven't finished this,

411
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,760
and there's the rest
of lunch

412
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,200
to get ready.

413
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,040
The 12:30 train, Nelly,
will get you

414
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,600
into London just after 1:00.

415
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,080
If you return on the 2:30,

416
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,640
you should be back in Richmond
soon after 3:00.

417
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,480
Do I miscalculate ?

418
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,640
No.

419
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,080
Well, then, is something
detaining you, Nelly ?

420
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,840
I can't think of anything
more exhilarating

421
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,000
than a trip to London.

422
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,640
- Good morning, Mrs. Woolf.
- Good morning.

423
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,560
We shall publish
no more new authors.

424
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
I have to tell you,

425
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,400
I've discovered ten errors
in the first proof.

426
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,000
Lucky to have found them then.

427
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,640
<i>Passiondale was a...</i>

428
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,800
<i>charnel house</i>

429
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,400
<i>from which no min returned.</i>

430
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,840
Do you think it's possible that

431
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,520
bad writing actually
attracts a higher

432
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,400
incidence of error ?

433
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,120
If it's all right, I thought
I might take a short walk.

434
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,960
Not far ?

435
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,440
No. Just for air.

436
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,240
Go then.

437
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,320
If I could walk midmorning,

438
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,720
I'd be a happy man.

439
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,440
She'll die.

440
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,800
She's going to die.

441
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,720
That's what's going to happen.

442
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,240
Huh.

443
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,840
That's it.

444
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,440
She'll kill herself.

445
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,400
She'll kill herself
over something

446
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,240
which doesn't seem to matter.

447
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,760
Let's think.

448
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,520
You grease the pan, Mommy.

449
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
I know you grease the pan,
sweet one.

450
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,920
Even Mommy knows that.

451
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,520
This is what we're going to do.

452
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,680
Flour...

453
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,040
bowl...

454
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,200
sifter.

455
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
Can I do it, Mommy ?

456
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,840
Can you sift the flour ?

457
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,920
Yes, you can sift the flour,
baby,

458
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,640
if that's what makes you happy.

459
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,600
Yeah.

460
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,400
Isn't it beautiful ?

461
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,640
Don't you think
it looks like snow ?

462
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,600
Hmm ?

463
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,560
Okay.

464
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,880
Now, the next thing...

465
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,520
The next thing I'm going

466
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,600
to show you... uh, is...

467
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,760
we measure out the cups.

468
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,200
Mommy, it isn't that difficult.

469
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,960
Now, I know.
I know it isn't difficult.

470
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,960
It's just that I...

471
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,320
I just want to do this
for Daddy.

472
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,240
Because it's his birthday ?

473
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,200
That's right.

474
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,680
We're baking the cake

475
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,600
to show him
that we love him.

476
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,120
Otherwise he won't know
we love him ?

477
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,320
That's right.

478
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,680
I got all the stuff.

479
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,920
I'm going right out again.

480
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,600
My God, what a zoo !

481
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,280
Why do people have to talk
about dry cleaning ?

482
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,400
I mean, what is there
to talk about ?

483
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,040
I bought you some flowers.

484
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,440
Where are you ?

485
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,160
In here.

486
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,520
I got someone at work
to cover me.

487
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,680
I'll be with you all night.

488
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,040
Are you all right ?

489
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,920
Sure.

490
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,400
I guess you saw Richard.

491
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,720
That's right.

492
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,040
Well, of course.

493
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,960
I bet he said,

494
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,600
<i>Oh, by the way,
honey, do you mind ?</i>

495
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,720
<i>Can I skip the party ?</i>

496
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,920
Don't worry.

497
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,560
He always shows up.

498
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,640
Oh, sure.

499
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,760
In the end.

500
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,520
What, Richard miss an award ?

501
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,640
A chance to talk about his work.

502
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,040
I don't think so.

503
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,160
He'll show up.

504
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,880
You did the seating.

505
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,680
I did.

506
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,480
I don't believe it...
Louis Waters.

507
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,720
Is Louis coming ?

508
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,840
Richard's Louis ?

509
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,200
He is.

510
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,200
You put him next to me.

511
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,600
Why do I always have
to sit next to the exes ?

512
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,440
Is this some kind of a hint,
sweetheart ?

513
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,840
And, anyway, shouldn't
the exes have a table

514
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,200
of their own,
where they can all ex together

515
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,680
in ex-quisite agony ?

516
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,600
I'm off.

517
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,520
Try not to pass out
from excitement.

518
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,240
Clarissa...

519
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,520
it's going to be beautiful.

520
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,600
Thank you.

521
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,440
You're welcome.

522
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,960
Why is everything wrong ?

523
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,480
It didn't work.

524
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,520
Damn it !

525
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,480
It didn't work.

526
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,960
Hey, Scott.

527
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,000
Hi, Mrs. Barlowe.

528
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,160
Mommy, Mommy, there's
someone at the door !

529
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,760
Hello ?

530
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,600
Hello ? Laura ?

531
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,640
Hi, Kitty.

532
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,800
Hi. Am I interrupting ?

533
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,400
Oh, of course not. Come in.

534
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,520
Are you all right ?

535
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,080
Why, sure.

536
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,200
Hi, Richie.

537
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,320
Sit down.

538
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,760
I've got coffee on.

539
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,520
Um, would you like some ?

540
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,640
Please.

541
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,920
Oh, look.

542
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,160
You made a cake.

543
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,440
I know.

544
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,560
Didn't work.

545
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,120
I thought it was going to work.

546
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,560
I thought
it would work better than that.

547
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,640
Oh, Laura, I don't understand

548
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
why you find it so difficult.

549
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,760
I don't know either.

550
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,960
Anyone can make a cake.

551
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,920
I know.

552
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Everyone can.

553
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,640
It's ridiculously easy.

554
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,640
Like, I bet you didn't
even grease the pan.

555
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,280
I greased the pan.

556
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,320
All right.

557
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,440
You know, you have

558
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,720
other virtues... and
Dan loves you so much,

559
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,000
he won't even notice.

560
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Whatever you do,

561
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,400
he's going to say
it's wonderful.

562
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,680
Well, it's true.

563
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,160
Does Ray have a birthday ?

564
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Sure he does.

565
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,040
When is it ?

566
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,200
September.

567
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,640
We go to the country club.

568
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,440
We always go
to the country club.

569
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,240
We drink martinis and spend
the day with 50 people.

570
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,800
Ray's got a lot of friends.

571
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,160
He does.

572
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,720
You both have a lot of friends.

573
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,720
You're good at it.

574
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,880
How is Ray ?

575
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,840
I haven't seen him in a while.

576
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,960
Ray's fine.

577
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,120
Mmm.

578
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,200
These guys are
something, aren't they ?

579
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,480
You can say that again.

580
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,480
They came home from the war.

581
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,680
They deserved it, didn't they ?

582
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,920
After what they'd
been through.

583
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,640
What... did they deserve ?

584
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,840
I don't know.

585
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,840
Us, I guess.

586
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,720
All this.

587
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,360
Oh.

588
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,280
You're reading a book.

589
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,480
Yeah.

590
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,600
What's this one about ?

591
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,880
Oh, it's about...

592
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,560
this woman who's incredibly...

593
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,720
Well, she's a hostess, and
she's incredibly confident,

594
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,840
and she's going to give a party,

595
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,200
and maybe because
she's confident,

596
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,120
everyone thinks she's fine...

597
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,640
but she isn't.

598
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,960
So.

599
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,320
Well.

600
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,440
Kitty, what is it ?

601
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,240
Is something wrong ?

602
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,160
I, uh... I have
to go into the hospital

603
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,360
for a couple of days.

604
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,040
Kitty.

605
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,360
Yeah. I have, um...

606
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,560
some kind of... growth,
in my uterus,

607
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,160
and they're going to go in
and take a look.

608
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,120
When ?

609
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,400
This afternoon.

610
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,720
Well, I need you
to feed the dog.

611
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,760
Of course.

612
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,320
Is that what you
came here to ask ?

613
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,680
What did the doctor
say exactly ?

614
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,880
Well, it's probably
what the trouble's been.

615
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,280
About getting pregnant.

616
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,160
The thing is...

617
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,560
I mean, you know,

618
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,400
I've been...
really happy with Ray.

619
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,040
And now it turns out
there was a reason.

620
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,800
There was a reason
I couldn't conceive.

621
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,720
You're lucky, Laura.

622
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,920
I don't think you
can call yourself a woman

623
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,120
until you're a mother.

624
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,240
The joke is...

625
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,040
all my life
I could do everything.

626
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,560
I mean, I could
do anything, really.

627
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,120
Except the one thing I wanted.

628
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,920
Yes.

629
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,200
That's all.

630
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,840
Well, at least now they'll
be able to deal with it.

631
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,840
That's right.
That's what they're doing.

632
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,880
That's right.

633
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,280
Mm. I'm not worried.

634
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,720
What would be
the point of worrying ?

635
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,640
No, it's not in your hands.

636
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,960
But that's it.

637
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,320
It's in the hands of some
physician I've never even met.

638
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,880
Some surgeon who probably
drinks more martinis

639
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,920
than Ray and...

640
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,920
Oh, Kitty.

641
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,440
I'm mean, of course I'm worried
about Ray.

642
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,280
Come here.

643
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,520
I'm doing fine.

644
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,480
Really.

645
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,560
I know. I know you are.

646
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,880
I'm more worried about Ray.

647
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,040
If anything,
he's not good with this stuff.

648
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,600
Forget about him, hmm ?

649
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,000
Just forget about Ray.

650
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,680
You're sweet.

651
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,640
You know the routine, right ?

652
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,960
Half a can
in the evening, and...

653
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,080
check the water now and then,

654
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,000
and Ray will feed
him in the morning.

655
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,400
Kitty, you didn't mind ?

656
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,280
What ?

657
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,280
I didn't mind what ?

658
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,680
Do you want me to drive you ?

659
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,040
I think I'll feel better
if I drive myself.

660
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,160
Kitty, it's going to be
all right.

661
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,480
Of course it is.

662
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,800
Bye.

663
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,040
What ?

664
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,280
What do you want ?

665
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,960
Mr. Woolf, Mrs. Bell
has arrived.

666
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,000
Not due till 4:00.

667
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,960
I can't help it.
She's here.

668
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,320
You look a perfect angel.

669
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,520
Don't let the boys
make fun of you.

670
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,120
Fly away, fly.

671
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,760
Virginia.

672
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,720
Leonard thinks it's
the end of civilization...

673
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,680
people who are invited
at 4:00 and arrive at 2:30.

674
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,000
Oh, God.

675
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,400
Barbarians.

676
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,120
Well, we finished lunch
sooner than we imagined.

677
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,360
I've had to send Nelly off
to London for sugar ginger.

678
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,880
Oh, Virginia.

679
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,920
You're not still frightened
of the servants, are you ?

680
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,240
Come on.

681
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,960
And how are you, sister ?

682
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,080
Frantic.

683
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,880
It's been ridiculous in London.

684
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,760
Ridiculous ? How ?

685
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,120
Busy.

686
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,120
Why is busy ridiculous ?

687
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,640
I would have invited you
to our party,

688
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,800
but I knew you wouldn't come.

689
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,240
Did you ?
How did you know that ?

690
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,120
I thought
you never came to town.

691
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,800
That's because
you no longer ask me.

692
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,200
Are you not forbidden to come ?

693
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,760
Do the doctors not forbid it ?

694
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,800
Oh, the doctors.

695
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,040
Do you not pay heed
to your doctors ?

696
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,160
Not when they're a bunch
of contemptible Victorians.

697
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,280
So... what are you saying ?

698
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,760
Are you feeling better ?

699
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,240
Has this vastness
made you stronger ?

700
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,080
I'm saying, Vanessa, that even
crazy people like to be asked.

701
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,600
Nessa ! Nessa !

702
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,840
Hello, changelings.

703
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,520
What have you got ?

704
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,720
What have you found ?

705
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,160
We found a bird.

706
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,720
Did you ?

707
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,720
Yes.

708
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,320
Where did you find that ?

709
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,240
I think it must have
fallen from a tree.

710
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,640
Oh, my goodness.

711
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,280
Just look at him.

712
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,520
We might be able to save him.

713
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,000
Save him ?

714
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,080
I think you have
to be careful, Quentin.

715
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,080
There's a time to die,

716
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,400
and it may be
the bird's time.

717
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,320
Come on, let's pick some grass

718
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,880
to make a grave.

719
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,840
- Oh, Julian.
- I'm just saying.

720
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,520
Then at least there'll be
a bed for him to die on.

721
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,640
Come on, Nessa,
let's make a grave.

722
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,640
Nessa, come on !

723
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,880
Oh...

724
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,680
Very well, I'm coming.

725
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,920
Wait for me then.

726
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,480
Angelica, will
you be all right ?

727
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,520
Stay with your aunt.

728
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,640
You're going too fast.

729
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,560
Do you think she'd like roses ?

730
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,880
Is it a she ?

731
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,640
Yes, the females are larger.

732
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,320
And less colorful.

733
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,040
What happens when we die ?

734
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,800
What happens ?

735
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,000
We return to the place
that we came from.

736
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,840
I don't remember
where I came from.

737
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,320
Nor do I.

738
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,880
She looks very small.

739
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,960
Yes.

740
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,520
Yes, that's one
of the things that happens...

741
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,000
we look smaller.

742
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,200
But very peaceful.

743
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,640
Oh, is it done ?

744
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,840
Have we finished ?

745
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,760
Is the bird funeral complete ?

746
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,720
Yes.

747
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,080
Very well, then.

748
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,880
Are we to be denied tea
altogether for coming so early ?

749
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,280
No, of course not.

750
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,440
Good.

751
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,440
Come on, Angelica.

752
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,760
Come on, come on, boys.

753
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,800
Let's get some tea.

754
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,720
Nessa, tell him to stop it !

755
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,920
Now stop it, Julian.

756
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,480
Virginia, we're going in.

757
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,680
Virginia !

758
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,880
Hey, bug.

759
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,000
I've got this idea.

760
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,360
We're going
to make another cake.

761
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,800
We're going to make
a better one.

762
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,320
What happened
to the first one ?

763
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,200
And after that...

764
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,840
I think we should go out.

765
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,400
Yes ?

766
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,560
Clarissa, it's Louis.

767
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,040
Louis Waters.

768
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,840
Louis ? Oh, my God.

769
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,800
You're early.

770
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,800
Do you mind ?

771
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,400
Is it all right ?

772
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,080
Oh, why should I mind ?

773
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,200
I'm delighted !

774
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,760
Well, now !

775
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,400
I feel like I'm interrupting.

776
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,360
Oh, why ?!

777
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,800
No.

778
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,600
I know the ceremony
isn't until 5:00,

779
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,880
but I flew in this morning.

780
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,040
Oh, well, Richard's
going to be thrilled.

781
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,480
He'll be thrilled
to see you.

782
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,480
You think so ?

783
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,000
Of course.

784
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,400
What are we doing ?
We should go in.

785
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,840
Are you all right ?

786
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,480
Yes. It's nothing.

787
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,280
It's just the party.

788
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,800
Oh, right.

789
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,400
Oh, wow !

790
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,360
It's looking beautiful.

791
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,040
Thanks.

792
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:41,800
Are you still with... ?

793
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,800
Yes, I am.

794
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,720
Still with her. Ten years.

795
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,600
It's crazy.

796
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,640
Why is it crazy ?

797
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,320
No reason.

798
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,840
Would you like something
to drink ?

799
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,480
Some water.

800
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,360
Okay.

801
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,640
Are you still an editor ?

802
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,840
Oh, sure.

803
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,200
With the same publisher ?

804
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,800
Mm-hmm.

805
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,640
How's San Francisco ?

806
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,600
Oh, it's one of those cities
people tell you to like.

807
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,520
Richard said he thought

808
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,600
you were happy out there.

809
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,560
Oh, great.

810
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,520
So now the illness
makes him psychic.

811
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,800
You have to prepare
yourself, Louis.

812
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,080
He's very changed.

813
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,120
I read the book.

814
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,320
Oh, God...

815
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,240
Exactly.

816
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,000
I thought you were
meant to do more

817
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,600
than just change people's names.

818
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,600
Well...

819
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,800
Isn't it meant to be fiction ?

820
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,480
He even had you living

821
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,000
on 10th Street.

822
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,080
It isn't me.

823
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,160
Isn't it ?

824
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,400
You know how Richard is.

825
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,440
It's a fantasy.

826
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,920
A whole chapter on

827
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,640
<i>Should she buy
some nail polish ?</i>

828
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,960
And then, guess what ?

829
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,000
After 50 pages, she doesn't.

830
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The whole thing seems to go on
for eternity.

831
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:23,960
Nothing happens.

832
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,920
And then, wham !

833
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,320
For no reason,
she kills herself.

834
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,600
His mother

835
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,680
kills herself.

836
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,320
Yeah, sure, his mother,
but still for no reason.

837
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,560
Well, I...

838
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,600
Out of the blue.

839
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,200
I know the book is tough,
but I liked it.

840
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,280
I know.

841
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,680
Only one thing upset me.

842
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,920
What's that ?

843
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,880
What upset you ?

844
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,280
Well...

845
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,160
that there wasn't more
about you.

846
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,360
That's kind.

847
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,880
I went back to Wellfleet.

848
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,080
You did ?

849
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,040
One day.

850
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,160
I didn't tell you ?

851
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,880
No.

852
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,880
But then, I never see you.

853
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,040
You remember the house.

854
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,560
It's still there.

855
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,600
I think you're courageous.

856
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,400
Courageous ? Why ?

857
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,160
To dare go visit.

858
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,360
What I mean is...

859
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,160
to face the fact

860
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,520
that we have lost
those feelings forever.

861
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,720
Shit !

862
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,600
Clarissa ?

863
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,800
Um...

864
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,800
I don't know what's happening.

865
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,760
I'm sorry.

866
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,200
I seem to be in some strange

867
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,720
sort of mood.

868
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,720
I'm sorry.

869
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,560
It's, uh, it's very rude of me.

870
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,840
I seem to be unraveling.

871
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,840
I shouldn't have come.

872
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,880
No, it's not you.

873
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,720
It's not you.

874
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,640
It's more like having
a presentiment.

875
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,200
Do you know what I'm saying ?

876
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,280
Oh, God,
it's probably just nerves

877
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,240
about the party, you know ?

878
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,720
Bad hostess !

879
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,320
Clarissa, what's happened ?

880
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,080
Jesus !

881
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,400
What is it ?!

882
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,840
Oh ! Oh, God !

883
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,680
Do you want me to go ?

884
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,320
No, don't go ! Don't...

885
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,080
Don't go.

886
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,920
Explain to me
why this is happening.

887
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,280
Don't... don't touch me.

888
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,520
Jesus.

889
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,640
It's better if you don't.

890
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,240
It's just too much.

891
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,080
You fly in from San Francisco,

892
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,920
and I've been nursing Richard
for years.

893
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,920
And all the time,
I've held myself together...

894
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,400
no problem.

895
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,880
I know.

896
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,720
One morning, in Wellfleet...

897
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:08,040
you were there,
we were all there...

898
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,520
I'd been sleeping with him,

899
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,560
and I was out
on the back porch.

900
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,360
He came out behind me,

901
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:22,080
and he put his hand
on my shoulder.

902
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,800
<i>Good morning, Mrs. Dalloway.</i>

903
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,920
That's...

904
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,640
That's when...

905
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,400
From then on, I've...
been stuck.

906
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,480
Stuck ?

907
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,640
Yep.

908
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,040
Yeah.

909
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,960
With the name, I mean.

910
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,960
And now you walk in.

911
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,120
To see you

912
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,520
walk in...
because I never see you.

913
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,920
Look at you.

914
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,200
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

915
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,120
It was you he stayed with.

916
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,120
It was you he lived with.

917
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,160
I had one summer.

918
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,520
The day I left him,

919
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:31,960
I got on a train
and made my way across Europe.

920
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,440
I felt free
for the first time in years.

921
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,280
So... tell me about
San Francisco.

922
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,560
What's to tell ?

923
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,120
I still teach drama
to idiots, mostly.

924
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,680
They can't all be idiots.

925
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,840
No, no. In fact,

926
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,800
I shouldn't tell
you this, but...

927
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,000
I've fallen in love.

928
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,120
Really ?

929
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,200
Yes.

930
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,280
With a student.

931
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,960
Exactly.

932
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,880
I know.

933
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,240
You think,
Am I still up for this ?

934
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,160
All this intensity,
all those arguments,

935
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,920
doors being slammed.

936
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,800
Well, you know what it's like.

937
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,240
Are you feeling better ?

938
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,440
A little.

939
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,000
Thank you.

940
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,840
You think I'm ridiculous ?

941
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,080
Ridiculous ?

942
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,680
Fortunate, too.

943
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,920
I'm going to leave you
at Mrs. Latch's.

944
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,840
I have to do something.

945
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,080
Mommy, I don't want to go.

946
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,200
You have to. I'm sorry.

947
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,360
I have something to do
before Daddy gets home.

948
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,960
Hello.

949
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,480
Hi, Mrs. Latch.

950
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,120
My boy's not very happy.

951
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,360
Mommy, I don't want
to do this.

952
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,800
I have to go, honey.

953
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,240
Your mommy has things
she has to do.

954
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,720
Come in, I got cookies.

955
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,000
Okay, baby ?

956
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,440
You have to be brave now.

957
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,840
Don't worry now.

958
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,240
It's going to be fine.

959
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,240
Well...

960
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,200
Honey !

961
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,760
Come on. Come on, darling.

962
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,400
Mommy !

963
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,360
- Stop it.
- No !

964
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,600
Darling, stop it.

965
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,720
Mommy !

966
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,840
- All right.
- Mommy !

967
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,080
Mommy !

968
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,040
Come on.

969
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,480
Mommy !

970
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,000
Mommy !

971
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,720
No !

972
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,080
Breakfast is served

973
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,000
between 7:00 and 11:00
in the Regency Room,

974
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,280
and room service is available

975
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,840
24 hours.

976
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,040
Thank you, ma'am.

977
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,600
Is there anything else
you need ?

978
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,240
Yes, um...

979
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,160
No.

980
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,800
Not to be disturbed.

981
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,400
<i>'Did it matter, then ? '
She asked herself,</i>

982
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,800
<i>walking toward Bon Street.</i>

983
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,960
<i>Did it matter that she must
inevitably cease completely ?</i>

984
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,600
<i>All this must go on
without her.</i>

985
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,720
<i>Did she resent it ?</i>

986
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,640
<i>Or did it not become consoling</i>

987
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:23,480
<i>to believe that death
ended absolutely ?</i>

988
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:27,840
<i>It is possible to die.</i>

989
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,120
It is possible...

990
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,560
<i>...to die.</i>

991
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,520
There was a lovely coat
for Angelica at Harrod's,

992
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,040
then nothing for the boys.

993
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,200
It seems so unfair.

994
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,800
Why should Angelica
be favored ?

995
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,200
Virginia ?

996
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,480
Virginia ?

997
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,920
Virginia !

998
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,920
What are you thinking about ?

999
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,560
Are you still with us ?

1000
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:26,320
Your aunt's a very
lucky woman, Angelica...

1001
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,760
because she has two lives.

1002
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,160
She has the life
she's leading,

1003
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,720
and also the book she's writing.

1004
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,880
This makes her very
fortunate indeed.

1005
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,920
What were you thinking about ?

1006
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,920
I was going to kill
my heroine...

1007
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,320
but I've changed my mind.

1008
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,360
I... I can't.

1009
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,840
I fear I may have to kill
someone else instead.

1010
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,680
Oh, Quentin !

1011
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,000
We're ready !

1012
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,120
A fascinating visit.

1013
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,360
We enjoyed it thoroughly.

1014
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,640
Do you have to go already ?

1015
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,520
I do wish you wouldn't go.

1016
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,480
Oh, Virginia,

1017
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:00,280
the last thing you want
is our noisiness.

1018
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,800
My hopeless, clumsy boys.

1019
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,640
Say good-bye, boys.

1020
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,000
Bye !

1021
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,440
You'll return to what ?

1022
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,880
Tonight ?

1023
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:18,120
Oh, just some...
insufferable dinner.

1024
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,040
Not even you could
envy, Virginia.

1025
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,520
But I do.

1026
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,280
Say something, Nessa.

1027
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,920
Didn't you think
I seemed better ?

1028
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,240
Yes...

1029
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,640
Yes... Virginia,
you seemed better.

1030
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,360
You think...

1031
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,680
You think I may one day escape ?

1032
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,840
One day. One...

1033
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,400
Nessa.

1034
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:34,960
Nessa !

1035
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,560
Come on, Nessa.

1036
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,160
Come, Angelica, we must go.

1037
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,560
Come on !

1038
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,520
Good-bye.

1039
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,560
Good-bye, little girl.

1040
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,240
Angelica !

1041
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,640
The train !

1042
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,360
We're going to miss the train.

1043
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,840
Come on. Hurry up.

1044
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,840
Big step.

1045
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,480
Come on, come on, come on !

1046
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,080
I want to go home.

1047
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,040
Yeah, all right.

1048
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,400
We stayed too long,
we've missed the train.

1049
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,560
Stay close.

1050
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,040
I'm sorry, I know.

1051
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,440
I tried to get here earlier.

1052
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,000
I tried, okay ? Don't start.

1053
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,840
I know,

1054
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,520
it's just incredibly important
because it's your party.

1055
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,080
Julia, how have you been doing ?

1056
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,560
I'm fine.

1057
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,400
Come here.

1058
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:48,160
What have you been doing ?

1059
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,520
Well, studying, Mom.

1060
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,320
Um...

1061
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,240
So, what should I do ? Chairs ?

1062
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,480
No. Let's clear off the desk
first.

1063
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,360
You can take it
into the bedroom.

1064
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,720
I bumped into Louis Waters.

1065
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,000
Oh, you did ?

1066
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,200
Where ?

1067
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,160
In the street.

1068
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,560
They're all here, aren't they ?

1069
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:14,640
All the ghosts.

1070
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,360
All of the ghosts are
assembling for the party.

1071
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,080
He's so weird.

1072
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,520
Oh, what ?

1073
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,840
You can't see that ?

1074
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,280
You can't see that
Louis Waters is weird ?

1075
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,880
I can see that he's sad.

1076
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,200
Well... all your friends
are sad.

1077
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,160
You've been crying.
What's happening ?

1078
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,240
All it is,
I looked around this room,

1079
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,040
<i>and I thought,
I'm giving a party.</i>

1080
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,600
<i>All I want to do
is give a party.</i>

1081
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:52,880
And ?

1082
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,640
I know why he does it;
he does it deliberately.

1083
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,560
Oh, is this Richard ?

1084
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,080
Of course.

1085
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,840
He did it this morning.

1086
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,800
He gives me that look.

1087
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,240
What look ?

1088
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,760
To say...

1089
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,480
<i>Your life is... trivial.</i>

1090
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:16,400
<i>You are so trivial.</i>

1091
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,800
Just...

1092
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,320
daily stuff, you know.

1093
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,680
Schedules and parties
and... details.

1094
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:26,400
That's what he means... by it,
that is what he's saying.

1095
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,560
Mom, it only matters
if you think it's true.

1096
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,760
Well ?

1097
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,680
Do you ? Tell me.

1098
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,720
When I'm with him, I feel...

1099
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,960
Yes, I am living.

1100
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:50,040
And when I'm not with him...

1101
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,600
Yes, everything does seem
sort of s...

1102
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,880
...silly.

1103
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,520
I don't mean with you.

1104
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,760
Oh, I...

1105
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,480
God. Jesus.

1106
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,640
Never with you.

1107
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,760
It's all the rest of it.

1108
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,040
Sally ?

1109
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,000
The rest of it.

1110
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,840
False comfort.

1111
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,360
Because ?

1112
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,360
<i>If you say to me,
When were you happiest ?</i>

1113
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,520
Mom...

1114
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,000
<i>Tell me the moment
you were happiest.</i>

1115
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,120
I know, I know,
it was years ago.

1116
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:40,120
Yeah.

1117
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:44,560
All you're saying is...
you were once young.

1118
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,000
I remember one morning...

1119
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,040
getting up at dawn,

1120
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:59,240
there was such a sense
of possibility.

1121
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,160
You know ?
That feeling ?

1122
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,240
Hmm ?

1123
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,560
And I remember
thinking to myself,

1124
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,400
<i>So, this is the
beginning of happiness.</i>

1125
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,200
<i>This is where it starts.</i>

1126
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,240
<i>And, of course, there
will always be more.</i>

1127
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:18,040
It never occurred to me

1128
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,040
it wasn't the beginning.

1129
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,840
It was happiness.

1130
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:31,360
It was the moment...

1131
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,560
right then.

1132
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,960
Ah, Nelly, good evening.
I was wondering

1133
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,120
if you'd seen Mrs. Woolf.

1134
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,080
I thought you knew, sir.

1135
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,080
Mrs. Woolf has gone out.

1136
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,720
Excuse me ! Excuse me !

1137
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,880
Mr. Woolf, what an
unexpected pleasure.

1138
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,400
Perhaps you could tell me

1139
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,560
exactly what you think
you're doing ?

1140
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,920
What I was doing ?

1141
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,240
I went to look for you,
and you weren't there.

1142
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,760
You were working in the garden.
I didn't wish to disturb you.

1143
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,480
You disturb me
when you disappear.

1144
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,480
I didn't disappear.

1145
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,600
I went for a walk.

1146
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,160
A walk ?!
Is that all ?

1147
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,800
Just a walk ?

1148
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,560
Virginia, we must go home now.
Nelly's cooking dinner.

1149
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,960
She's already had
a very difficult day.

1150
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,720
It's just our obligation
to eat Nelly's dinner.

1151
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,040
There is no such
obligation.

1152
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,320
No such obligation exists.

1153
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,360
Virginia,

1154
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,920
you have an obligation
to your own sanity.

1155
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I have endured this custody !

1156
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,400
I have endured
this imprisonment.

1157
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,720
Oh, Virginia !

1158
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,400
I am attended by
doctors, everywhere.

1159
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,240
I am attended by doctors

1160
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,800
who inform me of
my own interests !

1161
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,000
They know your interests.

1162
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,040
They do not !

1163
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,880
They do not speak
for my interests.

1164
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,200
Virginia, I can...

1165
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,560
I can see that it must be
hard for a woman of your...

1166
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,400
- Of what ? Of my what, exactly ?
- Uh, your...

1167
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,480
your talents to see

1168
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,400
that she may not be
the best judge

1169
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:06,600
of her own condition !

1170
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,600
Who, then, is a better judge ?

1171
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:09,880
You have a history !

1172
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,200
You have a history
of confinement.

1173
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,680
We brought you to Richmond

1174
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,640
because you have a history
of fits, moods, blackouts,

1175
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,160
hearing voices.

1176
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,120
We brought you here

1177
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,560
to save you
from the irrevocable damage

1178
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,680
you intended upon yourself.

1179
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,320
You've tried to kill yourself
twice !

1180
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,480
I live daily with that threat.

1181
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,920
I set up the press...
we set up the printing press

1182
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,960
not just for itself,

1183
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:41,200
not just purely for itself,
but so that you might have

1184
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,560
a ready source
of absorption and of remedy.

1185
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,800
Like needlework ?

1186
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,960
It was done for you !

1187
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,200
It was done for your betterment !

1188
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,240
It was done out of love !

1189
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,680
If I didn't know you better,
I'd call this ingratitude.

1190
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,600
I am ungrateful ?

1191
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,760
You call me ungrateful ?

1192
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,880
My life has been stolen from me.

1193
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,400
I'm living in a town
I have no wish to live in.

1194
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:18,920
I'm living... a life
I have no wish to live.

1195
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:25,400
How did this happen ?

1196
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:41,200
It is time for us
to move back to London.

1197
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,640
I miss London.

1198
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:51,640
I miss London life.

1199
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,200
This is not you speaking,
Virginia.

1200
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,680
This is an aspect
of your illness.

1201
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,640
- It's not you.
- It is me. It is my voice.

1202
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,720
It's not your voice.

1203
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:01,960
It's mine and mine alone.

1204
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,400
This is the voice
that you hear.

1205
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,080
It is not ! It is mine !

1206
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,040
I'm dying in this town !

1207
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,920
If you were thinking clearly,
Virginia,

1208
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,240
you'd recall it was London

1209
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,920
that brought you low.

1210
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,760
If I were thinking clearly...

1211
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,480
If I were thinking clearly...

1212
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:26,160
We brought you to Richmond
to give you peace.

1213
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,960
If I were thinking clearly,
Leonard,

1214
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,840
I would tell you that I wrestle
alone in the dark,

1215
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:36,000
in the deep dark,
and that only I can know,

1216
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,960
only I can understand
my own condition.

1217
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,800
You live with the threat...
you tell me...

1218
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,680
you live with the threat
of my extinction.

1219
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,160
Leonard, I live with it,

1220
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,680
too.

1221
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,720
This is my right.

1222
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,960
It is the right
of every human being.

1223
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,440
I choose not the suffocating
anesthetic of the suburbs,

1224
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,680
but the violent jolt
of the capital.

1225
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,440
That is my choice.

1226
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,960
The meanest patient,

1227
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,560
yes, even the very lowest
is allowed some say

1228
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:12,160
in the matter of her own
prescription.

1229
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,480
Thereby she defines
her humanity.

1230
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,600
I wish, for your sake, Leonard,

1231
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:31,000
I could be happy in this
quietness.

1232
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:36,200
But if it is a choice between
Richmond and death,

1233
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,920
I choose death.

1234
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,240
Very well, London, then.

1235
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,720
We'll go back to London.

1236
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,840
You hungry ?

1237
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,440
I'm a little hungry myself.

1238
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,360
Come along.

1239
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,440
London train on platform one !

1240
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:04,520
This is the London train
terminating at Vauxhall.

1241
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:13,360
You cannot find peace
by avoiding life, Leonard.

1242
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,040
This is the London train !

1243
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:28,040
London train on platform one !

1244
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,960
Mommy !

1245
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,960
Hey. Hey, there, bug.

1246
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,960
Hey, what's wrong ?

1247
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,720
Hi, Mrs. Latch.

1248
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:03,840
Sorry I'm late.

1249
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:04,920
He's fine.

1250
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,920
He's been fine.

1251
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:07,400
He's, he's just happy
to see you.

1252
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,680
Aw, it couldn't have been
that bad, could it ? Hmm ?

1253
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,360
So, you got it cut, then ?

1254
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,240
Oh, yes, yes. No problem.

1255
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,160
Looks great.

1256
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,600
Well, they didn't have
to do very much.

1257
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,280
Well, we had a fine time

1258
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:18,600
together.

1259
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,560
Thank you very much.

1260
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,360
So, that wasn't too bad, was it ?

1261
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,920
I wasn't gone too long.

1262
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
No, you weren't long.

1263
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,800
That's right.

1264
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:40,160
At one point...

1265
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,120
I don't know.

1266
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:49,480
There was a moment where
I thought I might be longer.

1267
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,280
But I changed my mind.

1268
01:23:58,760 --> 01:23:59,680
What is it, honey ?

1269
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:03,120
Mommy, I love you.

1270
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,240
I love you, too, baby.

1271
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,120
What's wrong ?

1272
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:21,760
What ?

1273
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,560
Don't worry, honey,
everything's fine.

1274
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,280
We're going to have
a wonderful party,

1275
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:37,000
and we've made your daddy
such a nice cake.

1276
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,920
I love you, sweetheart.

1277
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,360
You're my guy.

1278
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:27,400
Mommy !

1279
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:24,440
Richard, it's me. I'm early.

1280
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,880
What the hell is going on ?

1281
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:32,760
Richard !

1282
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,840
What are you doing here ?
You're early !

1283
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,080
Wha-What is going on here ?

1284
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,720
What are you doing ?

1285
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,520
I- I had this wonderful idea.

1286
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:46,720
I needed some light.
I needed to let in some light !

1287
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:49,360
Richard, what are you doing ?

1288
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,680
I had this fantastic notion.

1289
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,880
I took the Xanax
and the Ritalin together.

1290
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,360
It-it never occurred to me.

1291
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,040
Richard...

1292
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,160
Don't come near me !

1293
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:07,280
It seemed to me I needed
to let in some light.

1294
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:12,880
What do you think ?
I cleared away all the windows.

1295
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,440
All right, Richard,
do me one simple favor.

1296
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:16,600
Come. Come sit.

1297
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,480
I don't think I can make it
to the party, Clarissa.

1298
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,600
You don't have to go
to the party.

1299
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:21,880
You don't have to go
to the ceremony.

1300
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,520
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

1301
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,040
You can do as you like.

1302
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:28,000
But I still have to face
the hours, don't I ?

1303
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,080
I mean, the hours
after the party,

1304
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,320
and the hours after that...

1305
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:35,320
You do have good days still.

1306
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,080
You know you do.

1307
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,360
Not really.

1308
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:42,200
I mean, it's kind of you
to say so, but it's...

1309
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:43,520
not really true.

1310
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:52,880
Are they here ?

1311
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,640
Who ?

1312
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:55,440
The voices.

1313
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,240
Oh, the voices are always here.

1314
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:01,880
And it's the voices that you're
hearing now, isn't it ?

1315
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,600
No, no, no, no.

1316
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,920
Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.

1317
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:14,800
I've stayed alive for you,

1318
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,640
but now you have to let me go.

1319
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,320
Richard, I...

1320
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,360
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1321
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,600
Wait.

1322
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,200
Tell me a story.

1323
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,800
What about ?

1324
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,640
Tell me a story from your day.

1325
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:33,640
I, um...

1326
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,560
I- I got up...

1327
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,200
Yes ?

1328
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:43,480
...and I went out, and, uh,
I went to buy flowers,

1329
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,360
Like Mrs. Dalloway,
in the book, you know ?

1330
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,760
Yes.

1331
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:47,840
And it was a beautiful morning.

1332
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,320
Was it ?

1333
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,320
Yes, it was so beautiful.

1334
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,000
It was so fresh.

1335
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,720
Oh, fresh, was it ?

1336
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:55,760
Yes.

1337
01:28:59,440 --> 01:28:59,960
Like a...

1338
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:02,680
like a morning on the beach ?

1339
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,240
Yes.

1340
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,360
Like that ?

1341
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,200
Yes.

1342
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:11,000
Like that morning when you
walked out of that old house,

1343
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:14,120
and you were, you were 18,
and maybe I was 19.

1344
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,920
Yes.

1345
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,040
I was 19 years old,

1346
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:22,480
and I'd never seen
anything so beautiful.

1347
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:24,520
You...

1348
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,400
coming out of a glass door

1349
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,880
in the early morning,
still sleepy.

1350
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,640
Isn't it strange ?

1351
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:37,360
Most ordinary morning
in anybody's life.

1352
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:42,680
I'm afraid I can't make it
to the party, Clarissa.

1353
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:46,040
The party...

1354
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:48,040
doesn't matter.

1355
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:51,440
You've been so good to me,
Mrs. Dalloway.

1356
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,600
I love you.

1357
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,000
<i>I don't think two people</i>

1358
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,360
<i>could've been happier
than we've been.</i>

1359
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,040
Oh, God, no !

1360
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,800
Happy birthday.

1361
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:25,120
Happy birthday, Dan.

1362
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,400
This is perfect.

1363
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,160
This is just perfect.

1364
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,320
Oh, do you think so ?

1365
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,440
Do you really think so ?

1366
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:32,400
Why, sure.

1367
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,200
You must've been
working all day.

1368
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,880
Well, that's what
we were doing.

1369
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,520
Weren't we, bug ?

1370
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,680
Been working all day.

1371
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:40,840
This is just fantastic.

1372
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,360
It's what I've always wanted.

1373
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,120
Oh, Dan.

1374
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,480
One day, Richie, I'll tell you.

1375
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,200
I'll tell you
how it all happened.

1376
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,120
Don't.

1377
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,240
I want to.

1378
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,120
I want to tell him the story.

1379
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,120
What happened...

1380
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,720
when I was in the war.

1381
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,200
At war, I found myself

1382
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:00,360
thinking about this girl
that I had seen...

1383
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:01,760
I had never met her...

1384
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,080
at high school,

1385
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,600
this... strange,

1386
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:08,560
fragile-looking girl
named Laura McGrath.

1387
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,160
Yeah.

1388
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:14,240
And she was shy...

1389
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,760
and she was interesting.

1390
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,120
And... well,
your mother won't mind if

1391
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:21,080
I tell you this, Richie.

1392
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,600
She was the sort of
girl that you see

1393
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:23,680
sitting mostly on her own.

1394
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,400
And I'll tell you...

1395
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,880
sometimes, when I was
in the South Pacific,

1396
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,560
the fact is

1397
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,880
that I used to think

1398
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,440
about this girl.

1399
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,440
Dan.

1400
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:34,880
I used to think

1401
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,800
about bringing her to a house,

1402
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:39,040
to a life.

1403
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,080
Pretty much like this.

1404
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,200
And it was the thought
of the happiness...

1405
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,080
the thought of this woman,

1406
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:52,200
the thought of this life...

1407
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:53,960
that's what kept me going.

1408
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:57,760
I had an idea of our happiness.

1409
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,480
Why does someone have to die ?

1410
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:31,880
Leonard...

1411
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,600
In your book,
you said someone had to die.

1412
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,560
Hmm.

1413
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:36,640
Why ?

1414
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:41,040
Is that a stupid question ?

1415
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,400
No.

1416
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,760
I imagine my question is stupid.

1417
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:47,400
Not at all.

1418
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:49,920
Well ?

1419
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,440
Someone has to die

1420
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:57,080
in order that the rest of us
should value life more.

1421
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,960
It's contrast.

1422
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,120
And who will die ?

1423
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,400
Tell me.

1424
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,960
The poet will die.

1425
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,600
The visionary.

1426
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,440
What are you doing ?

1427
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:31,680
I'm brushing my teeth.

1428
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,760
Are you coming to bed ?

1429
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:40,280
Yeah, in a minute.

1430
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,480
Come to bed, Laura Brown.

1431
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,240
I ran into Ray.

1432
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:52,200
He said Kitty had to
go to the hospital.

1433
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,680
I know.

1434
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:56,960
Nothing serious.

1435
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,120
He said just a checkup.

1436
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,560
I'm terrified.

1437
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,600
Why ?

1438
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,120
Only I knew
that she could disappear.

1439
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,160
Maybe you could

1440
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:13,920
go see her
in the morning, honey.

1441
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,920
I was going to.

1442
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,600
I was going to stop by.

1443
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:28,320
I've had a wonderful day,

1444
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,800
and I have you to thank.

1445
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:40,320
Come to bed, honey.

1446
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,360
I'm coming.

1447
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:53,480
Are you coming ?

1448
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:55,400
Yes.

1449
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,120
What ?

1450
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,240
I was hoping
you were going to bed.

1451
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,320
I am.

1452
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,280
I am going to bed.

1453
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,480
What, then ?

1454
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,640
All else is clear.

1455
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:36,320
The outline of the story
is planned,

1456
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,120
now one thing only.

1457
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:40,960
Mrs. Dalloway's destiny
must be resolved.

1458
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:23,400
You're Laura Brown.

1459
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:28,120
Yes, I'm Richard's mother.

1460
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,120
Of course.

1461
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:35,560
I'm Clarissa Vaughan.

1462
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:37,360
Please come in.

1463
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:48,640
My friend Sally
is in the kitchen,

1464
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,960
and my daughter.

1465
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,800
I'll take this.

1466
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,680
We were having a party.

1467
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:58,920
We were going to have a party.

1468
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,160
I was lucky.

1469
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:01,920
I got the last plane
from Toronto.

1470
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:06,360
So, that's the monster.

1471
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,520
Hope I did the right thing.

1472
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:10,480
I found your number
in his phone book.

1473
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,760
Yes, he had it.

1474
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:17,240
We didn't speak often.

1475
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:31,880
It's a terrible thing,
Miss Vaughan... to outlive

1476
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:33,520
your whole family.

1477
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:39,320
Richard's father died.

1478
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,680
Yes, he-he died of cancer
quite young.

1479
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,560
And Richard's sister is dead.

1480
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,040
Obviously, you...
feel unworthy.

1481
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:57,880
Gives you feelings
of unworthiness.

1482
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:01,000
You survive and they don't.

1483
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,360
Have you read the poems ?

1484
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,840
Oh, yes. Oh...

1485
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,400
I also read the novel.

1486
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:25,680
You see, uh, people say
the novel is difficult.

1487
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:29,280
Uh... I know.

1488
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,160
They say that.

1489
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,360
I know.

1490
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:43,040
He had me die in the novel.

1491
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:45,680
I- I-I know why he did that.

1492
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:51,480
It hurt, of course.

1493
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,760
I can't pretend it didn't hurt,
but I...

1494
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:57,160
I know why he did it.

1495
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:03,760
You left Richard
when he was a child.

1496
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:09,600
I left both my children.

1497
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:12,240
I abandoned them.

1498
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,480
They say it's the worst thing
a mother can do.

1499
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:35,640
You have a daughter.

1500
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,560
Yes...

1501
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,440
But I never met Julia's father.

1502
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,600
You so wanted a child.

1503
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:50,880
That's right.

1504
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:53,800
You're a lucky woman.

1505
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:05,240
There are times
when you don't belong,

1506
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:08,240
and you think you're going
to kill yourself.

1507
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,600
Once, I went to a hotel.

1508
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:23,680
Later that night, I made a plan.

1509
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,120
The plan was
I would leave my family

1510
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:30,240
when my second child was born...

1511
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,680
and that's what I did.

1512
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:36,360
I got up one morning,

1513
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,840
made breakfast,

1514
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:42,240
went to the bus stop,

1515
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:45,360
got on a bus.

1516
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,600
I'd left a note.

1517
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:56,280
I got a job in a library
in Canada.

1518
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:04,440
It would...

1519
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:10,120
be wonderful to say
you regretted it.

1520
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:12,120
It would be easy.

1521
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:19,720
But what does it mean ?

1522
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:23,640
What does it mean to regret...

1523
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:26,480
when you have no choice ?

1524
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:38,800
It's what you can bear.

1525
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,240
There it is.

1526
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:48,600
No one's going to forgive me.

1527
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:58,600
It was death.

1528
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:01,280
I chose life.

1529
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,120
Time to take your coat off.

1530
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:45,240
I thought you might like
a cup of tea.

1531
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,920
Oh my goodness.

1532
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,760
Thank you, dear.

1533
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,840
I feel like I'm stealing
your room.

1534
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:53,760
Um, we put the food away,

1535
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:55,600
so, if you're at all hungry
in the night,

1536
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:56,760
just help yourself.

1537
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:57,960
Oh, I will.

1538
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,080
Where will you sleep ?

1539
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,400
Oh, the sofa.

1540
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,280
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1541
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,160
Good night, sweetheart.

1542
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:16,240
Good night.

1543
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:37,200
<i>Dear Leonard,</i>

1544
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:42,240
<i>to look life in the face...</i>

1545
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:48,320
<i>always to look life in the face,</i>

1546
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:53,600
<i>and to know it for what it is.</i>

1547
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:59,000
<i>At last, to know it,</i>

1548
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:02,600
<i>to love it for what it is,</i>

1549
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:06,160
<i>and then...</i>

1550
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:08,840
<i>to put it away.</i>

1551
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:15,640
<i>Leonard...</i>

1552
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:20,120
<i>always the years between us,</i>

1553
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:23,760
<i>always the years...</i>

1554
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:28,960
<i>always... the love...</i>

1555
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,160
<i>always...</i>

1556
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:34,560
<i>the hours.</i>
