1
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,141
<i>Come on, Jack.</i>

2
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,561
<i>Just pull the damn trigger.</i>

3
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,199
I can't.

4
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,302
<i>My brother Forrest once said,</i>

5
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,597
<i>"Nothing can kill us.
We can't never die."</i>

6
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,641
<i>The reason being that in the great war,</i>

7
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,893
<i>my eldest brother, Howard,
saw his entire battalion</i>

8
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,436
<i>drown in the sea.</i>

9
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,355
<i>Every last one of them.</i>

10
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,316
<i>He was the only survivor.</i>

11
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,864
<i>And Forrest, well, that same year,</i>

12
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,574
<i>Spanish Lady flu hit Franklin,</i>

13
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,951
<i>damn near wiped out the entire state.</i>

14
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,619
<i>It got Ma and Pa and Forrest</i>

15
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,371
<i>but against all the odds,</i>

16
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,124
<i>he somehow managed to fight it off.</i>

17
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,459
<i>So you could see
why Forrest felt that way.</i>

18
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,590
<i>Me and my brothers are moonshiners.</i>

19
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,924
<i>Bootleggers.</i>

20
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,135
<i>In 1920, they passed the Prohibition Act</i>

21
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,012
<i>making the sale of alcohol illegal.</i>

22
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,307
<i>Well, at least it was supposed to be.</i>

23
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,975
You want a case, Sheriff?

24
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,770
- Morning, Forrest.
- Pure corn whiskey.

25
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,314
That there's the white lightning, Sheriff.

26
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,899
It'll come at you like a knife,

27
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,775
pointy end first,
sharp and hot all the way down.

28
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,986
Aw, damn it. Give me two.

29
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,196
All right, then.

30
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,449
- You all right there?
- Thanks, boys.

31
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,826
Always happy to oblige an officer of the law.

32
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,626
<i>They called Franklin
the wettest county in the world</i>

33
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:34,338
<i>on account of almost everybody
was making the stuff.</i>

34
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,882
<i>Now, you can make moonshine whiskey
from just about anything.</i>

35
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,509
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Hey, Selma.

36
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,930
<i>Turnips, pumpkins, blackberries,
cornmeal, tree bark.</i>

37
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,681
- <i>Anything.</i>
- All right, then.

38
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,939
He's so fucking sick, man,
can't get himself out the bed to tend the stills.

39
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,316
- You want me to take it up to him?
- No, I can do it.

40
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:57,819
<i>And at night, in them hills,</i>

41
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,780
<i>you could see them fires
from the stills burning</i>

42
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,282
<i>like lights on a damn Christmas tree.</i>

43
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,412
<i>over the mountains, in the cities,</i>

44
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,457
<i>there was the biggest crime wave
this country'd ever seen.</i>

45
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:13,043
<i>And all that illegal liquor</i>

46
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,463
<i>was flowing down from the hills
to the cities by the truckload.</i>

47
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,261
<i>Gangsters were just scooping money
off the streets like candy.</i>

48
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,973
<i>They had men like Al Capone, Tommy Maloy,</i>

49
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,350
<i>that mad dog Floyd Banner.</i>

50
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,560
<i>They just moved in and took over.</i>

51
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,357
<i>Meanwhile, we were hauling stuff around
in our old, beat-up jalopies.</i>

52
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,575
All right now, Jack,
I want you to stay here.

53
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,286
- What?
- Stay in the truck.

54
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,997
Ain't like someone's gonna steal
this piece of shit, Forrest.

55
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,499
Just do what you're told, Jack.

56
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:04,886
All right, Forrest, go on.

57
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,704
Amen! Amen!

58
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,789
Here we go. All right, then.

59
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,291
Get some of this.

60
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,965
Welcome, welcome.
How're you boys doing?

61
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,925
Sorry to hear about Little Bean,
Ida Belle.

62
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:47,054
You know Little Bean loved his gals
and his giggle water.

63
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,973
She sure is giving him
one hell of a send-off.

64
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,145
Give me your money, boy.

65
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,396
Yeah, you do as I say

66
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,107
- Or I'm gonna cut you.
- Hold on, now, I ain't got nothing.

67
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,817
I'm just a driver.

68
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,152
You boys staying?

69
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,945
No, we gotta be getting off, Ida Belle.

70
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,405
Come on, Forrest, one damn drink.

71
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,948
No, we better be getting back now.

72
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,326
You ever seen a Harlem sunset?

73
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,453
Well, I'm fixing to cut one
right into you...

74
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,621
I ain't got nothing.

75
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,331
if you don't hand over that goddamn money.

76
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,332
Motherfucker.

77
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,875
Here, I'll take care of this.

78
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,336
Hey you, come on now,
you don't want to do this.

79
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,089
Why don't you put that knife away,
take you and your friends on home?

80
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,299
I'd listen to him if I was you.

81
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,135
You the boss?

82
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,930
You just sold a load to those dinges
in there, didn't you?

83
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,601
You hand over that cash or I'm gonna
cut some daylight into you.

84
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,854
Listen here, mister.

85
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,315
We got no way of understanding this world.

86
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,860
We got about as much sense of it
as a bird flying in the sky.

87
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,488
There is a lot that bird don't know.

88
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,698
But it don't change the fact that

89
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,160
the world is happening to him
all the same.

90
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,037
What I'm trying to say is...

91
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:58,083
is that the course of your life,
it is changing.

92
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,044
- You don't even see it.
- What are you talking about?

93
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,510
Let's go!

94
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,555
Yep. That's what he's talking about.

95
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:14,683
Yeah, all right now.

96
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,184
You all right there, Jack?

97
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,562
Just caught me off guard is all.

98
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,273
You still good to drive?

99
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,984
- Fuck you, Howard.
- Oh, whatever you say, little doggie.

100
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,692
All right, Jack, come on,
we gotta go set up over here.

101
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,203
Thank you.

102
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,621
Finest apple?

103
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,957
All right, then.

104
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,755
Are you gonna talk to Forrest
about taking some of me and Cricket's liquor?

105
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,508
- We're working on somethin' big.
- What do you mean talk to him?

106
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,092
About letting us in, Howard.

107
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,094
Not with that damn popskull shit
you been cooking up.

108
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,263
- We're still perfecting it.
- Perfecting it, my ass,

109
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,016
Jack, that shit ain't fit to slop hogs.

110
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,102
Forrest don't want you involved, is all.

111
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,270
Why is that?

112
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,606
'Cause he don't think you got the grit.

113
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,983
Gimme another jar, Jack. Huh?

114
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,321
You might wanna slow down some, Howard.
We're trying to sell this stuff.

115
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,204
- Who is that?
- She's one of them crazies

116
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,289
from that church at Burnt Chimney.

117
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,168
Her daddy over there,
he's gonna be the preacher.

118
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,879
You wanna get yourself a crowbar, Jack,
if you wanna get inside of her.

119
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,131
She don't look that crazy.

120
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,717
Her daddy don't look too happy, neither.

121
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,641
All right, now.

122
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,352
Jack, go on and take this around the back.

123
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,145
Store whatever's left in the shed.

124
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,439
You too, Howard.

125
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,151
- Come on, Jack.
- Yeah.

126
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,871
Are you Forrest Bondurant?

127
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,919
I'm Maggie Beaufort.

128
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,974
They say in town you're looking
for someone to help out 'round the place.

129
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,021
Is that position still vacant?

130
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,440
Forgive me for asking, but...

131
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,694
what does a lady like you...

132
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,572
want here?

133
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,824
The city can grind a girl down.

134
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,912
Gets to a point where you start looking
for somewhere quiet.

135
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,085
Damn.

136
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,967
Well, Mr. Bondurant...

137
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,266
do I get the job?

138
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,328
Quick. Quick.

139
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,046
Hey!

140
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,464
Cricket!

141
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,216
Hey!

142
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,302
Hey!

143
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,139
You ain't never gonna believe
what I just seen.

144
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,518
Floyd Banner shoot the tires
out of a goddamn ATU car

145
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,770
right smack in the middle of town
with a goddamn Tommy gun.

146
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,021
- Floyd Banner?
- Floyd Banner.

147
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,817
Oh, hey, look here. In the middle of all that,
I was thinking about you.

148
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,236
Got you one of these shell cases, Cricket.

149
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,570
- Oh, thanks, Jack!
- Yeah.

150
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,572
Figured we could put holes in it,
you know.

151
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,283
Put a chain through it,
hang it around our necks for luck or something.

152
00:13:49,118 --> 00:13:52,539
Floyd Banner.
He looked like he had direction, vision.

153
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,085
You got smoke coming out the cabin.

154
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,880
Jesus Christ, Cricket.

155
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,260
- This gonna work?
- Naturally,

156
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,596
I'm still messing with the recipe, of course.

157
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,807
And with this set-up through the pipes,

158
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,851
no one'll even know it's down here.

159
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,198
The man tucks away his bottle,
out he goes.

160
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,245
Well... Partner, I don't know
if that's the stupidest thing I ever seen

161
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,414
or you're some kind of damn genius.

162
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,093
Did Jimmy pay us?

163
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,345
- Yup.
- He did?

164
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,065
Thank you.

165
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,118
Hi, Forrest.

166
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,513
This here's the new Special Deputy.

167
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,682
He's been brought in from the city
to help us out.

168
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,977
You know, make sure things go smooth.

169
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,687
What things might they be?

170
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,815
Sorry, something amuse you?

171
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,611
My name is Charlie Rakes,
I'm from Chicago.

172
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,199
That damn brother of yours,
is he somewhere about?

173
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:41,666
Who's in the car?

174
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,211
That there's the new Commonwealth's Attorney,
Mason Wardell.

175
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,591
He wants to work it out
so everybody gets to do some business.

176
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,347
Henry, go see what Mr. Wardell wants.

177
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,613
Pete, who the hell is this son of a bitch?

178
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,534
Me? I'm the one who's going to make your life
real difficult from now on

179
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,120
if you don't toe the line, country boy.

180
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,750
Don't you ever touch me again.

181
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:28,004
All right, all right.

182
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,590
Forrest, it already settled.

183
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,092
The whole county's gonna get on board eventually.

184
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,429
Start at $20 a week, $30 a load

185
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,556
and that gets you free passage
throughout the whole county.

186
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,517
- No one'll bother you.
- Don't nobody bother me now.

187
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:47,023
Mr. Wardell, he'd like a jar
of your finest apple brandy.

188
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,524
That be all right?

189
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,885
Can I help you, son?

190
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,512
Yeah.

191
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,473
You send your clown with the bow tie
around here again,

192
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,810
and I guarantee you'll personally pull a cleaver
out of his fucking skull.

193
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,269
You understand me?

194
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,067
You're gonna regret this, Forrest.

195
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,319
He's already regretting it,
he's just too ignorant to know it yet.

196
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,487
Go on, go inside now.

197
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,540
You thinking of drawing on me?

198
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,985
Say your piece, Jimmy.
I got a business to run.

199
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,114
All right, Forrest. Now we got a chance

200
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,575
to make a good stack of money here
while the getting is good.

201
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,702
But for things to run smooth,

202
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,288
you got to grease the tracks.

203
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,874
Yeah, I hear what you're saying, Jimmy, and...

204
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,920
we go back a long way,
so I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this,

205
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,505
but, uh...

206
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,092
I'm a Bondurant.

207
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,139
And we don't lay down for nobody.

208
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,893
We'll continue to operate
free and clear here, as always.

209
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:50,855
Me, I'll never pay no money
to no Mason Wardell

210
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,357
or the next damn bloodsucker come after him.

211
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,902
I never have, I never will.

212
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,740
I'm sorry you feel that way, Forrest.

213
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,868
Jimmy, do you have something
that you really wanna say to me?

214
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,621
You can't do it the old way no more.

215
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,748
I remember there was a time
you had some balls, Jimmy.

216
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,307
Well, I guess we'll see what happens.

217
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,425
Gentlemen.

218
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,645
Look, Deputy, we've got
something of a problem here.

219
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:34,357
It's Special Deputy,
and I don't see a problem at all.

220
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,735
I hear these mountain boys have got, uh...

221
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,946
Injun blood in them.

222
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:43,908
Cherokee. This would explain
why they're a little...

223
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,577
animalistic in their nature.

224
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,955
I don't rightly understand what you mean.

225
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:53,209
But there's a feeling around these parts
that Forrest Bondurant

226
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,461
is different than other folks.

227
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,965
- Different?
- Indestructible.

228
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:03,803
Do you mean "immortal"?

229
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:12,395
Shit. You fucking hicks
are a sideshow unto yourselves.

230
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,902
Sheriff, you have any idea

231
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,363
what a Thompson submachine gun
does to "immortal"?

232
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,492
Well, this ain't Chicago.
You can't just shoot him.

233
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,495
Do that, people around here
will string us up from a tree.

234
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,875
Do I look stupid to you?

235
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,796
I've been brought in to do a job.

236
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,590
And I know just who to start with.

237
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,137
You know something?

238
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,390
I don't much like you.

239
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,477
Yeah, well, not many do.

240
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,164
- Gimme some of that.
- Yeah, it's good.

241
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,088
I could run them blockades.

242
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:27,011
- You? A blockader? Shit.
- What do you mean "shit"?

243
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,514
Danny, I can drive a damn sight
better than you can.

244
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,641
Just not in the shitcan we got.

245
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,770
Oh, yeah? Well, Forrest,
he don't wanna hear about it.

246
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,607
Yeah, well... the hell with Forrest.

247
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,026
I'm sick of being his house dog.

248
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,492
You gonna tell him that?
or you want me to do that, too?

249
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,123
You all right there, Jack?

250
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,875
Shut up, Howard.

251
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,919
Forrest ain't got no aspirations.

252
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,963
He still sleeps on a mattress on the floor
like a fucking Chinaman.

253
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,802
You might wanna watch your mouth there,
little brother.

254
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:10,471
Fuck off, Howard.

255
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,099
- Oh, come on.
- Stop. Stop.

256
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,383
It's...

257
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,147
Where are you going with that stuff?

258
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,982
Church.

259
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,610
Hell, you better take it easy
on that jar then!

260
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:20,541
<i>He gave a peace</i>

261
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:25,379
<i>Of the world</i>

262
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,051
Let us pray.

263
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,681
If any man loved the world,

264
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,476
the love of the Father is not in him.

265
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,021
For all that is in the world,

266
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:46,984
the lust of the flesh
and the lust of the eyes

267
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,153
and the pride of life

268
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,740
is not of the Father,
but is of the world.

269
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,118
Amen.

270
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,205
Thirty-nine, top.

271
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,223
Too much rust in the tank, maybe.

272
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,326
Or lead.

273
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,578
Mind if I come in?

274
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,250
Don't expect no biscuits
coming out around here.

275
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,296
- Who's that?
- Aunt Winnie.

276
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,716
Why don't you tell Aunt Winnie
this is not a social visit.

277
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,719
Well, I ain't sure that'll do no good, sir.

278
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,096
She ain't right in the head.

279
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,854
Three things you gotta tell us, son.

280
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,066
Where's the still, where's the liquor
and where's the money?

281
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,616
He don't have it.

282
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,287
Now who might you be?

283
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,164
That there is Jack Bondurant.

284
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,335
Well, I'll be damned.

285
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,713
I was told I'd find you here.

286
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,383
And look...

287
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,970
here you are.

288
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,266
Go find the still, leave us alone.

289
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,445
So, the runt of the litter.

290
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,550
You boys don't get it, do you?

291
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,868
Look at me, son.

292
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,460
Oh, you're a peach.

293
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,299
What's going on?

294
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,557
Come closer.

295
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,810
Step forward.

296
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,524
Stop right there.

297
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,902
Get up.

298
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,258
I thought they said you Bondurant boys were

299
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,302
a bunch of hard-boiled sons of bitches.

300
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,855
Oh, this is terrible.

301
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,192
This just won't do.

302
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,749
My brothers are gonna get you.

303
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,584
They're gonna kill you.

304
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,377
Is that so?

305
00:29:58,145 --> 00:29:59,713
It's not gonna help right now, is it?

306
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,555
Why don't you tell those brothers of yours

307
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,891
we're coming for them next.

308
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,105
You tell 'em.

309
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,066
No more!

310
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,277
No more, please. Please.

311
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,240
Don't touch me!

312
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,502
Next time I come down real hard.

313
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,180
All right.

314
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,978
So you want to get into this racket.

315
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,982
But I see you sitting there,

316
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,026
looking like somebody's punching bag.

317
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,739
So I ask you...

318
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,701
what do you intend to do now?

319
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,748
- What do I intend to do?
- Yeah.

320
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,084
You.

321
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,923
You expect somebody else to handle it?

322
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,591
- No.
- Howard, maybe?

323
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,676
- That ain't what I meant.
- What did you mean?

324
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,845
I don't need no help.

325
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,056
I'm sorry?

326
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,101
- I don't need no help.
- Oh, you don't?

327
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,398
Here it is.

328
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,070
As long as you are my brother,

329
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,614
you will never let this happen again,
do you understand?

330
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,866
- I get it.
- I don't think you do.

331
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,955
What if I can't?

332
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,709
I mean, I ain't...
I'm not built like you and Howard.

333
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,711
I ain't never been like you.

334
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,464
It's all right.

335
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,679
Jack...

336
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:00,394
it is not the violence
that sets a man apart.

337
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:04,231
All right? It is the distance
that he is prepared to go.

338
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,444
Jack, look at me.

339
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,738
We're survivors.

340
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,907
We control the fear.

341
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,743
And without the fear,

342
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,579
we are all as good as dead.

343
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,378
Do you understand?

344
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,088
- Do you?
- Rakes told me to tell you

345
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,090
they're coming for you next.

346
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,763
Yeah, well, they'll be back,
you can be sure of that.

347
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,526
A present from your preacher friend.

348
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,240
You gonna open it?

349
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,880
Fuck you, Howard.

350
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,635
Ah, damn.

351
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,177
Forrest Bondurant.

352
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:01,515
It seems you've been involved
in certain illegal activities.

353
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,893
Illegal activities?

354
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,856
Look here, Forrest,
if you play ball with us,

355
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:13,026
we can make this here summons disappear.

356
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,030
Are you trying to shake me down, Henry?

357
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,785
I'm just the messenger here, Forrest.

358
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,916
Have you met Howard?

359
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,503
Oh, what? You gonna shoot me, huh?

360
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,039
Howard! Howard!

361
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,847
Huh? You gonna hurt my brother?!

362
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:46,143
Huh? You trying to intimidate us, Sheriff? Huh?

363
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,271
The Bondurants?

364
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,234
All right now. That's enough now.

365
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,404
You gonna sell out
like them other cocksuckers?

366
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,658
That's enough now.

367
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,663
Howard, that's enough.

368
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,783
All right.

369
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,920
You old piece of shit.

370
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,548
Now, y'all oughta know better
than to come around here

371
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,551
when Howard's been on the stump whiskey
for a few days.

372
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,512
I think you might wanna
get out of here.

373
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:27,517
You give my regards

374
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,478
- to Special Deputy Rakes.
- Oh, yeah.

375
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,156
It ain't nothing personal, Henry.

376
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,373
He got that special look in his eye.

377
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,499
No I don't.

378
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,918
- Yes, he does.
- Yes, you do.

379
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,315
I saw you at the Bondurant place.

380
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,489
You're not from around here.

381
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,368
Chicago, right?

382
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,874
You were a dancer up there.

383
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,543
The Apex Club, wasn't it?

384
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,255
Did a little number with feathers, I believe.

385
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,678
Something troubling you?

386
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,846
Get out of my way.

387
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,516
Oh, you don't need to worry about me.

388
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,394
I ain't the kind
to drink from a greasy cup.

389
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,651
Where's Jack?

390
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,029
I've seen him swanning around
in Daddy's old suit.

391
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,408
- Listen, Howard.
- Yeah?

392
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,035
I need you here with me tonight...

393
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,037
I got some business
with a couple out-of-towners

394
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,539
I never dealt with before.

395
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,250
- Yeah? Where they from?
- Chicago.

396
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,630
Yeah, well, me and Danny,
we just gotta stop by the stills first.

397
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,550
You just be here by 11:00 now.
You got that?

398
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,262
I got it.
When have I ever let you down?

399
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,417
How'd you like to come
for a ride with me sometime?

400
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,085
You must be jingle-brained
if you think I'm gonna

401
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,047
get in a car with the likes of you.

402
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:05,091
Anyway, you oughta be worried
if my father catches you here.

403
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,010
Talking to me.

404
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,262
He's just in the feed store, there.

405
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,099
Why'd I need to be worried?

406
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,977
You know, coming to the church meeting
like that.

407
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,813
And bustin' out of there
like a crazy person.

408
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,024
Are you affected in the head?

409
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,944
Hold on, now, look here. Look.

410
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,156
Crazy person wear a suit
as fancy as this?

411
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,034
Still don't explain
why you acted like a lunatic.

412
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,620
I didn't want my feet washed, is all.

413
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,375
- I know who you are.
- Yeah? Who's that?

414
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,837
One of them Bondurant boys,
and that's enough.

415
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,007
There ain't many that have
a good word to say about you.

416
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,010
- Yeah?
- Except some rubbish about a legend.

417
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,054
Yeah.

418
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,474
About you guys being invincible
or some such nonsense.

419
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,144
- Say that word again. What'd you say?
- Invincible.

420
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,146
Well, shoot, I don't know what that means.

421
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,149
Sounds good, though.

422
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:07,153
My daddy thinks you boys are the worst thing
ever to hit Franklin.

423
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,322
Well, what would your daddy know?

424
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,577
You sure got a funny way of courting,
Jack Bondurant.

425
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,997
That is what you're doing, right?
Courting?

426
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,667
Yeah.

427
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,755
All right, then.

428
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,884
You tell your daddy I said hi.

429
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,848
- Oh sh...
- Thank you.

430
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,665
Oh, shit!

431
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,893
Hey, Red.

432
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,644
Where them feathers at?

433
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,658
He's a crip. Don't worry about it.

434
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,951
Hey, Forrest.

435
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,585
All right, go tell Maggie
to shut her down.

436
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:53,760
All right now, that's enough.
Come on, now, get out of here.

437
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:01,267
I paid for another jar
and she won't give it.

438
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:05,271
- And then the bitch done me.
- No, you didn't.

439
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,815
We gonna buy near 100 gallons
of your liquor.

440
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,193
Now you ain't gonna throw in some extra?

441
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,278
You ain't buying a goddamn thing.
Now go on, get out of here.

442
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,657
He pulled a gun on her,
then she pulled the knife around and cut him.

443
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,120
Did you pull a gun on this woman?

444
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,333
Forrest!

445
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,133
I may be a cripple boy,
you sack of shit

446
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,970
but I'll blow your goddamn brains out
if you move!

447
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,357
All right now. Sorry.

448
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,072
Yeah.

449
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,146
Goddamn you, Howard.

450
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,919
Well, you best be getting home.

451
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,414
Okay.

452
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,562
Are you sure you're all right?

453
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:21,074
A bit too much whoopee
for one night, I guess.

454
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,576
Yeah.

455
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,585
Bye, Forrest.

456
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:29,475
Hm. Well that don't make no sense.

457
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,065
Well, I don't see nothin'...

458
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,574
Now you got trouble.

459
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,837
Fuckin' hillbilly.

460
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,722
Damn.

461
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,138
Forrest?

462
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,448
Forrest?

463
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,332
Forrest?

464
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,161
There's something you need to know.

465
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,962
Mm, now we're gonna have some fun.

466
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,256
You can come in.

467
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,008
But don't let him talk.

468
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,395
Hey, Forrest.

469
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,942
Them doctors are saying
you walked in here.

470
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,696
All the ways from Blackwater Station.

471
00:49:11,864 --> 00:49:13,783
Through the damn snow.

472
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,332
Did you get 'em, Forrest?

473
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,504
'Cause I want to be there when you do.

474
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,297
I'll hold them down myself.

475
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,717
Walking all the way here from

476
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,971
- Blackwater Station...
- Jack, why don't you shut up a minute?

477
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,245
You should've been there, Howard.

478
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,327
Look what they did to you.

479
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,465
I'm leaving, Forrest.

480
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,182
Well, it ain't really the quiet life
you're looking for?

481
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,559
Those people, Forrest...

482
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:11,317
People like them,
they're why I left Chicago.

483
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,821
I got out and ran.

484
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,578
Come here, Maggie.

485
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,924
Now this has nothing
to do with you, you hear?

486
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,427
Nothing at all.

487
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,348
Did you check out of that place yet?

488
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:48,521
I want you to come stay
at the station for a while.

489
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:54,276
With those guys still around,
you're best off close to us.

490
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,573
We don't want to see you getting hurt.

491
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,785
"We?"

492
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,204
You can, uh...

493
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,875
You can use the spare room.

494
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,394
I know a fella across the county line,
take your whole run

495
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,812
for five dollars on the gallon.

496
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,480
- Baloney.
- No, Howard, it's a fact.

497
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,315
- Cricket got a message to him.
- Five dollars?

498
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,817
- Yep.
- Beat it, Jack.

499
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,403
I'm not in the mind for your horseshit.

500
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,114
I'll do the driving, Howard,
you ain't gotta worry about nothing.

501
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,740
You?

502
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,576
- And Cricket.
- And Cricket,

503
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,162
that twisted little gimp.
You're gonna deal with Floyd Banner?

504
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,956
You're a goddamn house dog, Jack.
You sweep the floors.

505
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,791
You got no goddamn vision, Howard.

506
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,585
Go on, scram, get outta here.

507
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,964
Hey what's eatin' you anyway, huh?

508
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,966
The fact that you let your own brother,
old Forrest, down?

509
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,926
Shut your mouth!

510
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,632
What you doin', Jack?

511
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,302
Checkin' on you.

512
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,805
- I'm all right.
- All right, then.

513
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,974
Yeah, I'm all right.

514
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:52,061
- Yeah, I was just worried.
- I'll be home tomorrow.

515
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,189
Go on, now.

516
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:57,858
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

517
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,739
- Hey.
- What the hell are you doin', Jack?

518
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,990
Come here and help me with this.

519
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,201
Shit, Jack, are you off your nuts?

520
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,745
- I'm done waiting for table scraps.
- Forrest is gonna throttle you.

521
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,997
Don't you worry about that, grab a box.

522
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,666
You just call Gummy Walsh.

523
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,751
You tell him we're bringing a big load.

524
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,670
Two hundred gallons at least.

525
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,922
- "We?"
- Yeah.

526
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,549
You mean you and me?

527
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:26,178
Well, hell, I need backup, Cricket.
You my partner or what?

528
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,013
Shit.

529
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,723
Grab that tarp.

530
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,518
Shit.

531
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:46,365
Jesus, Cricket, you look like
you're about to shit yourself a kitten.

532
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,950
Whoa, you wouldn't really shoot that thing.

533
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,743
If anybody gonna give me cause to, I might.

534
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,036
- Oh, bullshit, I don't believe you.
- Absolutely.

535
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,622
Pow, right between the eyes.

536
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,589
What is that?

537
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,050
The transmission?

538
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,928
It don't sound like it.

539
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,763
Did you put gas in it?

540
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,894
- Did you put gas in the truck?
- Shit!

541
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,897
You forgot to put gas in it.
Well, what the fuck are we gonna do now?

542
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,280
I'm sorry, Jack!
I had other things on my mind.

543
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,407
Like robbing your brothers, for instance.

544
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,909
Other things on your mind?
All you had to do was put gas in the truck!

545
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,411
All you had to do was put gas in it!

546
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,039
I got me an idea.
I got an idea.

547
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,082
Now we're just two bootleggers
waiting for the ATU!

548
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,336
This road is crawling with cops, Cricket!

549
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,504
You know that we're just sitting ducks?

550
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,383
- You gotta be kidding me!
- What, you got a better idea?

551
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,096
You're gonna put moonshine
in the gas tank?

552
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,018
Come on!

553
00:56:08,697 --> 00:56:09,990
Oh, shit!

554
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,409
Yeah! Yeah!

555
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,178
You must be Cricket Pate, huh?

556
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:17,099
Jack, meet Gummy Walsh.

557
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,187
So what you got?

558
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,441
Well, sir, we got 100 gallons
of quality White Lightning,

559
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,192
and 100 finest Crazy Apple.

560
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,863
- Eel juice from Franklin County?
- Yes, sir.

561
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,032
All right.

562
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,577
It's all right.

563
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,416
What you got there,
a little pea-shooter?

564
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,215
Okay, now walk.

565
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:52,885
- Walk.
- We had a deal.

566
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,888
You're one stupid sack of shit,
ain't you, boy?

567
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,890
Can't we work something out?

568
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,645
That how you hillbillies do business?
With a pop-gun?

569
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,731
I said fucking walk!

570
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,500
That's far enough.

571
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,010
All right, you're next.

572
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:41,016
You dug them boys
a hole like I told you?

573
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,479
Meet Floyd Banner.

574
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:56,031
Ain't no honor in the business anymore.

575
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,992
- Shoot 'em.
- Wait, wait.

576
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,287
Best stand back, fellas,
unless you wanna get your suits all splattered.

577
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,623
These country boys
can make a real mess.

578
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,708
Wait, wait, wait!
My name's Jack Bondurant.

579
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,961
I come from Blackwater Station.

580
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,817
That's impressive.

581
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:39,658
I'll give you four dollars,
but keep it to yourself.

582
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,911
Those boys out front,
they only get but three and a half.

583
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,373
I was told five.

584
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,052
Let's get it unloaded.

585
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,102
I respect you Bondurants standing up to

586
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,022
that Commonwealth's District Attorney.

587
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,149
He's got everybody in his pocket.

588
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:15,736
He takes a shit and half of Virginia
falls out his ass.

589
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,871
There's something you ought to know.

590
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,209
I heard what happened to your brother, Forrest.

591
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:34,755
Them cocksuckers that did it
used to work for me.

592
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,136
- They work for you?
- They left my outfit.

593
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:45,807
Got an offer from some slick-looking deputy.
He wore perfume.

594
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,059
Charlie Rakes?

595
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,647
Yeah, that was him.

596
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,066
What happened to Forrest...

597
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:55,984
had nothing to do with me.

598
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,446
Make sure you tell Forrest that.

599
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,407
Tell him Floyd Banner says hello.

600
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,080
Give him this.

601
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,250
Say it's a gift

602
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:15,629
from the Midnight Coal Company.

603
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:27,265
Yeah. Now I remember them Bondurant boys.

604
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:28,433
That boy's brother,

605
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:33,021
he's the one who walked 20 miles
with his head cut clear off.

606
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:36,441
They say he goes around drinking white mule
through a hole in his throat.

607
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:44,366
I got every lawman in three fucking states
up my ass!

608
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,785
The last thing I need
is some hard-ass crackers

609
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:49,955
pulling a damn blood feud on me!

610
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,791
Now get this sack of shit out of here!

611
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:19,526
You're gonna hold on, Forrest.
You gotta hear me out.

612
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,028
I sold your whole lot to Floyd Banner
in one damn go.

613
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:24,448
Would have taken you a month
to off-load that.

614
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,992
Not only that, I sold it
for five dollars on the barrel.

615
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,578
That's twice what you get.
Right here?

616
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:35,667
That's two thousand dollars,
minus my commission.

617
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,680
Look at you.

618
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,350
You think you're so goddamn smart.

619
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,230
You're swanning around
like you're Al Capone.

620
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,400
With your new best friend.

621
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,821
You take a good look, Jack.

622
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:06,907
That's your new best friend.

623
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,533
Yeah, you're wrong there, too.

624
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,871
Special Deputy Rakes was the one
hired the men to do that to you.

625
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,081
- Who told you that?
- Floyd Banner himself.

626
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:17,751
Oh, Floyd Banner himself.

627
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:21,546
Well, that must be gospel.
What's that?

628
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:24,466
It's a gift. From Floyd Banner.

629
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,052
It's an address, Forrest.

630
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,429
For where you can find them bastards
who cut your throat.

631
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,642
I say we get 'em tonight.

632
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,484
Anything else I can do for you, Forrest?

633
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,070
Sweep your fuckin' floors, maybe?

634
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,576
I got somewhere I gotta be.

635
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,014
Can I come in?

636
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,936
- Better be quick then.
- I'll be quick.

637
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:21,982
Got me one of them cameras.

638
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:26,027
- Stand right here.
- Here?

639
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:34,286
Lord, if my daddy caught me with one
of those things, he'd murder me.

640
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:36,329
You gotta keep steady now,
so as I can get it.

641
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,624
All right.

642
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:40,625
Why'd you stop fooling around?

643
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,627
That's how the movie stars
do it in California.

644
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,296
All right.

645
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:47,340
One, two, three.

646
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,304
- Now you.
- All right.

647
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:54,848
Ready?

648
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,563
How'd I look?

649
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,523
Like trouble, Jack Bondurant.

650
01:05:13,584 --> 01:05:15,744
I got me a new car.

651
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,414
Forrest?

652
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,500
Hey.

653
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,465
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yeah.

654
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:29,674
Where's Forrest?

655
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,427
- What?
- Jack.

656
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,012
- Have they gone without me?
- You don't have to be like...

657
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,306
Shit. I found out where they was.

658
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:26,898
You know how they say
you ain't got no balls, Jack?

659
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:35,073
They was wrong.

660
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,118
You send these to Rakes.

661
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,587
You're looking real sharp there, kid.

662
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,262
The trumpet has been blown,

663
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:01,558
the battlement stormed,
and the walls have come tumbling down.

664
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:21,828
Who's there?

665
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:34,859
<i>I kept hearing the country
was in a real bad way.</i>

666
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:40,198
<i>Folks outta work, people dusted out,</i>

667
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,784
<i>losing their homes and their farms and all.</i>

668
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,869
<i>But from my perspective,</i>

669
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:48,873
<i>the situation was something
different entirely.</i>

670
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:51,876
<i>Once we started shifting that liquor
across the county line,</i>

671
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,295
<i>that money just started pouring in.</i>

672
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,090
<i>That don't mean the runs were easy.</i>

673
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,092
<i>Rakes was coming at us day and night.</i>

674
01:09:04,064 --> 01:09:05,890
Go on, boy, gimme a reason.

675
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,642
Y'all get the fuck out of Franklin.

676
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:19,320
<i>Then Cricket, he had one of his ideas.</i>

677
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,240
<i>He stuck a souped-up carburetor
in that Ford.</i>

678
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,159
<i>It was thing of pure beauty.</i>

679
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:26,244
<i>He's gifted, that boy.</i>

680
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:30,123
<i>Me, well, ain't no one could say
I couldn't drive a damn car.</i>

681
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:50,643
- Forrest, dance with me!
- I ain't dancing to this.

682
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,063
Come on...

683
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,785
<i>Meanwhile, Howard and me hammered out</i>

684
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:10,663
<i>four 300 gallon submarine stills.</i>

685
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,626
<i>They were the biggest stills
Franklin had ever seen</i>

686
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:17,670
<i>and we hid them deep in the woods
where Rakes could never find them.</i>

687
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:21,674
Come on, you gotta look tough, Cricket.

688
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:34,812
Get off my property, boy!

689
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,314
I catch you near my daughter again,

690
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,358
God Himself won't be able to help you!

691
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:41,819
- You hear me?!
- One, two, three.

692
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:56,584
<i>By that time,
Jimmy and them others caved in,</i>

693
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,503
<i>made deals with Wardell.</i>

694
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:01,506
<i>All except our cousin, Spoons.</i>

695
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:08,221
<i>But Rakes took him
out of the picture altogether.</i>

696
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:18,106
<i>We Bondurants, we were the last ones standing.</i>

697
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,811
You just gonna watch me forever?

698
01:13:28,987 --> 01:13:31,489
Uh... What... What you doin'?

699
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:26,127
Damned if you don't keep a girl waiting.

700
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:35,219
Forrest?

701
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,639
Now hold on, Bertha,
before you start talking about your soul,

702
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:22,934
vanity and all that sort of stuff,
I wanna make sure you understand something.

703
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:25,811
This here vehicle,
you know what that is?

704
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:28,189
That's a Rumbleseat Roadster.
It's a Ford V8.

705
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,274
Not many in the world get a chance
to drive in such a thing.

706
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:32,610
It's only fair of me to warn you
before you open that door

707
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,779
and get inside, nothing's gonna be
the same as it was before.

708
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,697
Your whole life is gonna change forever.

709
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,783
Now you can sit there on that gate
and you can shake your head,

710
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,618
talking about "Daddy this" and "Daddy that"
till you're blue in the face

711
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,788
or you can climb down off that gate,
you can live a little bit,

712
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,248
- you can get inside my car...
- Hey, Jack...

713
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:46,874
Hold on, Bertha, this is the best part.

714
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,292
- There's kudzu fields just up...
- Jack.

715
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,127
Yeah?

716
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,630
You still got the price tag on your coat.

717
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:57,301
No, I don't.

718
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:01,138
- Come here.
- Where?

719
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,282
Jeepers, Jack.

720
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:20,866
It sure goes fast.

721
01:16:21,034 --> 01:16:22,326
Fast?

722
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,542
Now we're going fast.

723
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,935
Don't you like it?

724
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,231
It don't matter if I like it,
I can't wear this.

725
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:37,276
I just wanted to get you something nice.

726
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:41,238
Where do you think I'd be able
to wear something like that?

727
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:44,450
I'll take you somewhere
so you can wear something like that every day.

728
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,538
Why don't you try it on?

729
01:17:52,583 --> 01:17:54,335
What? Here?

730
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,837
- Yeah, ain't nobody around.
- You're around.

731
01:17:57,005 --> 01:18:00,257
I... I'll just... listen to my radio,
look out at this tree here.

732
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:03,427
I won't look, you can go back
behind the car and put it on.

733
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:14,355
All right, seeing as you bought it and all.

734
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:31,038
You better not look.

735
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,297
- You better not be looking.
- I'm not looking.

736
01:18:40,465 --> 01:18:42,925
Just over here at this woodpecker on a tree.

737
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,023
Well?

738
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:00,818
How do I look?

739
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,164
Come on.

740
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:55,122
Oh, shit, Jack. Goddamn.

741
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,224
I got you, you dumb hick.

742
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:27,571
Watch your step, here. Whatcha think?

743
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:30,658
- What do I think about what?
- My place of employment.

744
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:37,081
- Hey.
- Hot socks, Jack.

745
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:38,791
What's she doing here?

746
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:43,045
Miss Bertha Minnix, meet my partner,
the Cricket Pate.

747
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:45,381
Pleased to meet you, Cricket Pate.

748
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:49,218
The pleasure's all mine, miss.

749
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:53,264
Boy, oh, boy, Jack, your brothers
are gonna shit their grits.

750
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:54,598
Don't you worry about it.

751
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:58,269
This is it.

752
01:20:58,436 --> 01:21:00,396
- It's a real hideout.
- Howard's up in the look-out.

753
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:03,399
It's the biggest distillation set-up
in these hills.

754
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,109
We're able to put out
1,000 gallons a week.

755
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:06,569
No one around here comes close
to doing that.

756
01:21:06,903 --> 01:21:07,820
You're an outlaw, Jack.

757
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:10,489
No, that's just a matter of perspective.

758
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,324
I'm just doing what any man
around here would do

759
01:21:12,492 --> 01:21:14,618
if he had the same strength of character.

760
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:19,164
You got it all figured out?

761
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:20,791
Yeah.

762
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,632
Damned if your face
don't belong on a coin, Bertha.

763
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:33,012
- Jack.
- I mean it.

764
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:37,141
I ain't never seen nothing
as beautiful as you right here.

765
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:38,601
Not never.

766
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:40,394
I wish I had the damn words to tell you.

767
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,146
You're doing just fine.

768
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,882
You're a damn fool, Jack.

769
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:22,227
- Jack!
- What?

770
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:23,604
- It's the law!
- What?

771
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,439
The law! The ATU! It's the law!

772
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,149
Come here, come here.

773
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:33,072
- What the hell was that?
- We gotta go!

774
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:36,992
All right, look.
You take her. Take her.

775
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,452
- Go to the Station, I'll meet you there.
- Jack...

776
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,371
Go. Go, go, goddamn it, go!

777
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:50,673
- Keep moving!
- Where the fuck is that coming from?

778
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:58,097
Go, go, go!

779
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:14,196
- Do you think we scared them off?
- I don't know.

780
01:23:25,966 --> 01:23:27,001
What the hell's that?

781
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,759
- Goddamn it, listen!
- Shit.

782
01:23:55,111 --> 01:23:56,113
Fuck!

783
01:24:02,245 --> 01:24:04,955
- I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker.
- Hey, Rakes!

784
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:10,995
Remember me?

785
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:22,181
- You're not gonna shoot me.
- Oh, yeah?

786
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:26,078
Look at you.

787
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,188
Okay, let's go. Close in!

788
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:30,932
Goddamn nance.

789
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,109
- Move in!
- Come on, Jack!

790
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:38,113
Go, go, go!

791
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:47,289
Get those sons of bitches! Fuck!

792
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,260
- Good job, boys.
- Thank you, sir.

793
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:04,515
They found Cricket Pate and some gal.

794
01:25:04,682 --> 01:25:06,850
- The cripple boy?
- Yep.

795
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:09,353
- Hiding out in the woods.
- You all right?

796
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:14,733
Come on, miss, let's get you home, now.

797
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:15,657
Come on.

798
01:25:20,901 --> 01:25:21,657
Come on.

799
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:24,493
Don't worry, miss, he'll be fine.

800
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:05,659
Keep on going.

801
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:14,668
That friend of yours,
he called me a nance.

802
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,962
Why would he say that?

803
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:19,298
I don't know, sir.

804
01:26:19,465 --> 01:26:21,884
Maybe 'cause you smell funny.

805
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:30,684
What's wrong with your damn legs, anyway?

806
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:36,523
I got rickets when I was a kid.

807
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,609
Left me a little hinky.

808
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:46,450
That's it. Down a bit.

809
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,497
Here, just go in here.

810
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:59,796
What are we...
Why do you want me to go in there?

811
01:26:59,964 --> 01:27:02,299
It's fine. Come on.

812
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:15,062
He makes a goddamn mess
on Charlie Rakes' shirt!

813
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:22,828
He called me a fucking nance!

814
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:27,759
<i>Forrest, I never meant to...</i>

815
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:32,097
Go on, you never meant what?

816
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:37,602
To walk around like you own the place?

817
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:40,439
Or like you're...

818
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:44,067
you're public enemy number one now?

819
01:28:44,235 --> 01:28:46,069
Forrest, I was just trying to make sure...

820
01:28:49,907 --> 01:28:53,076
Letting you in was a mistake.

821
01:28:53,244 --> 01:28:54,311
I'm sorry.

822
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:56,997
I said I'm sorry.
I'm sorry they damn blew up your stills.

823
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:59,082
I'm sorry they got the car.

824
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,835
- I'm sorry they took your money.
- My money?

825
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:04,171
Hold on. My money?

826
01:29:06,424 --> 01:29:08,133
This ain't about the goddamn money.

827
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:10,427
This is about a goddamn principle.

828
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,095
Might be he's had enough, Forrest.

829
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:13,555
Yeah, as for you,
you dumb son of a bitch...

830
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:15,098
I just heard...

831
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:17,309
They got Cricket.

832
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:24,816
- What do you mean?
- They killed him.

833
01:29:27,653 --> 01:29:29,613
Cricket's dead, Jack.

834
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:55,972
That boy never hurt a... fly.

835
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,484
He was a good boy.

836
01:30:27,629 --> 01:30:29,214
Them bastards!

837
01:31:01,038 --> 01:31:02,080
Forrest.

838
01:31:04,667 --> 01:31:07,919
Uh, we just want to say how...

839
01:31:08,087 --> 01:31:10,213
How sorry we are about Cricket.

840
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:12,132
We all liked that boy.

841
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:15,760
And whatever was done to him
goes beyond the point of forgiveness.

842
01:31:17,513 --> 01:31:19,973
Yeah, well there's a lot
that can't be forgiven.

843
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:22,767
All right, Forrest,
I know what we done wasn't right...

844
01:31:22,935 --> 01:31:24,895
You sold us out, Jimmy.

845
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:29,983
It's time y'all picked a side.

846
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:06,353
Jack.

847
01:33:03,369 --> 01:33:05,537
- What do you want?
- I need to talk to Forrest.

848
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:07,664
- No you don't.
- Ja...

849
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:09,416
You talk to me now.

850
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:13,336
Now, looky here, Jack.

851
01:33:13,504 --> 01:33:16,840
I just want y'all to know
that neither me nor my officers

852
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:19,676
had anything to do
with what happened to Cricket.

853
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:21,761
- He was a good boy...
- Just your best buddy, Rakes.

854
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:24,347
He ain't my buddy.

855
01:33:24,515 --> 01:33:26,391
What he done to that boy...

856
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:28,059
there can be no absolution.

857
01:33:28,227 --> 01:33:30,228
You come all the way out here
to tell me that?

858
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:33,106
I'm risking something being here, Jack.

859
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:36,985
Now... I come here to tell you
that what happened to Cricket

860
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:41,031
ain't the end of something, but the start
of something. You understand me?

861
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:43,199
Mason Wardell, he's gotten Rakes to bring in

862
01:33:43,367 --> 01:33:45,702
extra ATU officers from the city.

863
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,871
They're gonna shut down
the whole damn county.

864
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:50,874
They already got me and my deputies
close down the bridge.

865
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:52,751
No one's getting in
and no one's getting out.

866
01:33:52,918 --> 01:33:54,794
- Where is Rakes?
- Never you mind.

867
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:57,213
- I asked you a question.
- I'm warning you, son.

868
01:33:57,381 --> 01:33:58,923
You keep your voice down.

869
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:03,053
You better lay low.

870
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:07,140
At least till this blows over.
This is a war they is waging.

871
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:09,392
You ain't gonna survive.

872
01:34:13,272 --> 01:34:14,731
You best get out of here now.

873
01:34:18,861 --> 01:34:20,320
Go on.

874
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:52,519
Jack!

875
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:57,107
Forrest!

876
01:34:57,274 --> 01:34:59,818
- Ah, shit.
- Hey, wake up!

877
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,613
Damn it, Jack.

878
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:08,410
What are you doing?

879
01:35:08,744 --> 01:35:11,830
Well, Jack's gone off half-cocked.

880
01:35:13,997 --> 01:35:15,875
That's it, then.

881
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:18,378
Forrest, Jack done took off
in Cricket's car!

882
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:20,964
Calm down, Howard. Go fetch the car.

883
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:23,466
He got trouble written all over him.

884
01:35:25,219 --> 01:35:26,803
Come on, Danny, I said get up!

885
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:28,805
I gotta watch you die all over again.

886
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:30,974
What you talkin' about?

887
01:35:31,976 --> 01:35:34,436
I gotta find you lying in a pool
of your own blood?

888
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:37,397
Drag your damn body into my car?

889
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:42,861
Drive you down to the hospital,
your throat cut from ear to ear?

890
01:35:48,492 --> 01:35:50,076
You did that?

891
01:35:52,371 --> 01:35:54,664
I'm not doing it again.

892
01:35:57,835 --> 01:35:59,252
I thought I walked.

893
01:36:00,546 --> 01:36:01,838
Isn't that just like you

894
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:05,008
to believe your own damn legend?

895
01:36:06,677 --> 01:36:08,511
Come on, Forrest, get a move on!

896
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:11,431
Wait a minute.
You came back here that night?

897
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,688
They see you?

898
01:36:22,568 --> 01:36:24,778
Forrest, come on!

899
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:28,198
- Then what happened?
- Nothing.

900
01:36:31,368 --> 01:36:33,745
I asked you a question.

901
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:35,246
I told you.

902
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:39,918
Look at me.

903
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:50,804
Maggie, look at me.

904
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:02,899
- What happened when you got back?
- Not a damn thing.

905
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:07,403
Now you know.

906
01:37:07,571 --> 01:37:10,490
Not a goddamn one of them bastards

907
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:14,244
ever did a damn thing to me.

908
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:21,668
Forrest, come on!

909
01:37:27,091 --> 01:37:28,676
Son of a bitch.

910
01:38:18,642 --> 01:38:21,686
- Wasn't that Jack Bondurant?
- Shit!

911
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:37,327
It's that Bondurant boy!

912
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:43,541
Where's that murdering piece of shit?!

913
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:45,710
He's got a gun.

914
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:48,421
Rakes! You motherfucker, where are you?!

915
01:38:48,589 --> 01:38:50,673
- Where are you?!
- Just hold it right there, Jack.

916
01:38:50,841 --> 01:38:54,552
- Rakes, you bastard!
- You looking for me, son?

917
01:38:57,614 --> 01:38:58,681
Stop!

918
01:38:59,349 --> 01:39:00,475
Rakes!

919
01:39:00,643 --> 01:39:04,228
Deputy! Stand down, deputy!

920
01:39:04,396 --> 01:39:07,398
- You are one stupid boy!
- Put down your weapon.

921
01:39:17,983 --> 01:39:19,118
Forrest.

922
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,371
Hey!

923
01:39:27,544 --> 01:39:28,628
Kill those sons of bitches!

924
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:06,666
Hold your fire!

925
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:08,751
Huh? How's that feel?

926
01:40:09,919 --> 01:40:11,087
Come on, Danny.

927
01:40:13,655 --> 01:40:15,008
Cease fire!

928
01:40:23,934 --> 01:40:25,601
Cease fire, deputies!

929
01:40:25,769 --> 01:40:27,729
Take that, you shit-kicking rubes!

930
01:40:31,608 --> 01:40:32,692
Jack!

931
01:40:32,943 --> 01:40:34,986
- Get him out of there!
- Howard!

932
01:40:38,115 --> 01:40:40,283
I'll teach you to mess
with Special Deputy Charlie Rakes.

933
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:41,826
Sheriff?

934
01:40:41,994 --> 01:40:43,619
You are nothing now!

935
01:40:45,205 --> 01:40:47,457
That goes for all you hicks!

936
01:40:49,209 --> 01:40:51,711
Stand down, everybody! Stand down!

937
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:53,339
Cease fire!

938
01:40:55,007 --> 01:40:57,300
Hold your fire. Jimmy, please.

939
01:40:58,177 --> 01:41:01,220
Let's stop this right here.
No one else needs to get hurt.

940
01:41:01,388 --> 01:41:04,140
Time to die, you chicken-shit sons of bitches!

941
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:07,310
Stand down, deputy!

942
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:08,770
It's time for me to take out the garbage!

943
01:41:08,937 --> 01:41:10,813
- Goddamn it, Rakes, stand down!
- Immortal?

944
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:12,648
- Immortal?! What a fucking laugh!
- Deputy!

945
01:41:14,859 --> 01:41:15,860
Fuck!

946
01:41:20,657 --> 01:41:22,492
Someone help Forrest!

947
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:34,837
Now get the fuck out of Franklin.

948
01:41:38,675 --> 01:41:39,842
You gonna let him walk away?

949
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:42,512
Get out of my way! All of you!

950
01:41:42,679 --> 01:41:45,848
- Now, everybody...
- Fuck!

951
01:41:46,016 --> 01:41:48,518
- Just stay calm.
- Come on, just take it easy.

952
01:41:48,685 --> 01:41:50,436
I work for the Commonwealth's attorney!

953
01:41:50,604 --> 01:41:52,522
Stay where you are, Jimmy.

954
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:57,819
You're candy-assed motherfuckers!

955
01:41:58,153 --> 01:41:59,563
Every single one of you!

956
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:03,024
You bastard!

957
01:42:08,539 --> 01:42:11,874
- Forrest! Forrest!
- Goddamn it, stop shooting!

958
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:13,668
- Holster your weapons!
- No!

959
01:42:13,877 --> 01:42:16,712
Get some help!
Somebody get some help!

960
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:17,880
What was he thinking?

961
01:42:18,048 --> 01:42:20,550
You fucking bastards
are gonna pay for this!

962
01:42:22,427 --> 01:42:24,512
Rakes!

963
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:28,391
Jack! Now just hold it
right there, Jack!

964
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:31,727
Gimme the gun.

965
01:42:34,815 --> 01:42:38,442
Now, everybody just stay calm.

966
01:42:38,610 --> 01:42:40,403
Let it be, Jimmy.

967
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:44,407
Jack.

968
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:46,409
Jack!

969
01:42:48,077 --> 01:42:49,195
Fuck.

970
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:10,266
Christ.

971
01:43:32,664 --> 01:43:34,832
Son of a bitch.

972
01:44:05,197 --> 01:44:06,822
All right then.

973
01:44:45,696 --> 01:44:49,532
<i>In December 1933, Prohibition finished.</i>

974
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:56,414
<i>So ended the great
Franklin County Moonshine Conspiracy,</i>

975
01:44:56,581 --> 01:44:58,040
<i>as it became known.</i>

976
01:45:00,877 --> 01:45:03,546
<i>That same year,
Commonwealth Attorney Mason Wardell</i>

977
01:45:03,714 --> 01:45:05,881
<i>was arrested on charges of corruption.</i>

978
01:45:17,811 --> 01:45:21,647
<i>A couple years later,
Howard moved to Martinville,</i>

979
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:24,483
<i>found work in the textile mills there.</i>

980
01:45:24,651 --> 01:45:28,904
<i>Surprised us all by getting hitched,
haoing a whole bunch of children.</i>

981
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:33,701
<i>Bertha Minnix,</i>

982
01:45:33,869 --> 01:45:36,996
<i>the preacher's daughter, well,</i>

983
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:40,583
<i>that gal always had
a rebellious streak in her.</i>

984
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:43,002
<i>We got married the following year.</i>

985
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:46,630
<i>I ran my daddy's farm.
Raised cattle,</i>

986
01:45:46,798 --> 01:45:47,631
<i>grew tobacco.</i>

987
01:45:49,134 --> 01:45:50,426
All right, then, here we go.

988
01:45:50,594 --> 01:45:52,094
<i>After he got shot at the bridge,</i>

989
01:45:52,429 --> 01:45:56,474
<i>Forrest spent two weeks
recuperating in the hospital.</i>

990
01:45:56,641 --> 01:45:59,935
<i>Then he walked out of there
and married Maggie.</i>

991
01:46:00,103 --> 01:46:02,688
- You gonna toast, Howard?
- Yeah.

992
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:06,692
<i>Neither of them told no one.</i>

993
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,569
<i>I only found out years later.</i>

994
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:10,571
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

995
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:12,323
<i>He was like that, Forrest.</i>

996
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:17,453
Don't you boys be making a commotion

997
01:46:17,621 --> 01:46:19,330
when you come upstairs, all right?

998
01:46:19,498 --> 01:46:20,498
- Yes, ma'am.
- I'm going to bed.

999
01:46:20,665 --> 01:46:22,458
Come on, you, up to bed.

1000
01:46:24,086 --> 01:46:24,752
Night.

1001
01:46:26,838 --> 01:46:28,255
Good night, boys.

1002
01:46:32,969 --> 01:46:34,970
Hey, come on, Forrest.
Come on.

1003
01:46:35,138 --> 01:46:37,139
Why don't you show us a dance?

1004
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:41,143
Come on, Uncle Forrest, get up.
Come on!

1005
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:44,647
- Come on.
- I ain't dancing for you two jackasses.

1006
01:46:45,815 --> 01:46:47,900
Come on, huh?

1007
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:49,735
I'm gonna go get me some air.

1008
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:53,406
- Do one move.
- No.

1009
01:46:53,573 --> 01:46:57,993
- Here we go, here we go! Oh, oh...
- Come on...

1010
01:46:58,161 --> 01:46:59,871
There ain't enough space.

1011
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:02,032
Let him walk it off.

1012
01:47:04,751 --> 01:47:08,003
Yep, I'm gonna...
I'm going to bed, too.

1013
01:47:08,171 --> 01:47:11,841
It's too damn cold to be sitting
out here on this porch.

1014
01:47:13,343 --> 01:47:15,010
Midnight's upon us already.

1015
01:47:16,596 --> 01:47:18,013
Night, Forrest.

1016
01:47:21,059 --> 01:47:22,726
- Night, Jack.
- Good night.

1017
01:47:29,192 --> 01:47:32,111
<i>Forrest once said nothing could kill us,</i>

1018
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:33,904
<i>that we could never die.</i>

1019
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:38,200
<i>And back then I think
I actually believed it.</i>

1020
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:41,454
<i>Hell, I know Forrest did.</i>

1021
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,459
<i>'Cause no matter what this world
flung at him</i>

1022
01:47:47,544 --> 01:47:50,629
<i>he seemed to be able to just stand up
and keep on going.</i>

1023
01:47:52,215 --> 01:47:54,049
<i>Getting a little more bent,</i>

1024
01:47:54,217 --> 01:47:56,093
<i>a little more twisted each time.</i>

1025
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,766
<i>But nobody leaves this world alive.</i>

1026
01:48:03,768 --> 01:48:05,078
<i>Not even Forrest.</i>

1027
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:26,165
<i>And in the end,</i>

1028
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:28,959
<i>it was dumb luck and pneumonia
that got him.</i>

1029
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:35,341
<i>It was as simple and indifferent as that.</i>

1030
01:48:40,847 --> 01:48:44,308
<i>Nowadays, we Bondurants abide by the law.</i>

1031
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:48,521
<i>People ain't trying to cut our throats,
stab us, shoot us no more.</i>

1032
01:48:51,942 --> 01:48:53,859
<i>Them days are long gone.</i>

1033
01:48:57,113 --> 01:48:58,781
<i>Sometimes when I'm out on the porch,</i>

1034
01:48:58,949 --> 01:49:01,825
<i>just sitting around doing nothing,</i>

1035
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:03,702
<i>hell...</i>

1036
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:07,540
<i>it sure does get real quiet
around here.</i>
