1
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,087
Then where are they?
- I'm faxing the revisions now.

2
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,722
Did you make all the
changes I asked for?

3
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,963
Yes. I included the four
percent increase...

4
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:38,208
and the extra 2 million.

5
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:40,515
No, no. If it's a four
percent increase then...

6
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:42,630
you have to add at
least 3 million dollars.

7
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,994
That's not what I was told.

8
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,583
Who told you that?
- Their lawyers.

9
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:48,787
They're all idiots.
I don't understand...

10
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:50,571
this total lack of communication.

11
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,041
It's okay. I just had
no way of knowing, sir.

12
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,424
Look, this is what I need you to do.

13
00:02:55,524 --> 00:02:56,811
Sir, could I put you
on hold for a second?

14
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:57,911
Okay.

15
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,182
Thanks. Hi, Jody.

16
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:02,249
Mr. Harper wants to
see you in his office.

17
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,801
Great. Of course.
- Still want me to fax those?

18
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,177
You don't have to.
I'm not even done yet.

19
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:08,305
You should go home.

20
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:09,935
Are you sure?
- It's late.

21
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:12,976
I don't want your parents to worry.
Get out of here.

22
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:17,396
Okay. Merry Christmas, Angela.
- Merry Christmas, Jody.

23
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,907
Hi, Lorraine. Of course
I'm going to make it.

24
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,038
Just let me call you back. Okay?

25
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:38,149
In a few minutes, I promise. Okay.

26
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,186
Still on the Morgan deal?

27
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,449
What can I do for you, Jim?

28
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,591
I...

29
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,429
I don't know how to...

30
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,336
Angela, I feel terrible
about what happened.

31
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:58,706
It's fine. Let's just
not worry about it, okay?

32
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:03,038
No, it's not okay. I
acted like a real jerk.

33
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,559
I had too many drinks
and... You know...

34
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,116
how these Christmas
parties can be.

35
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,696
We had a baby last year, and...

36
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,454
It's been a hard year.

37
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,641
I'm sure that it has.

38
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:22,621
I simply want to tell you
that I'm really, really sorry. Okay?

39
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,030
Apology accepted.

40
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:29,428
Thanks. Merry Christmas, Angela.

41
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,937
You too, Jim.

42
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:45,785
You calling me from work?

43
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,354
Thought you were
going home first.

44
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,184
I brought everything
with me. Don't worry.

45
00:04:49,284 --> 00:04:50,124
Get over here, Angie.

46
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,226
God, I am so late with this dinner.

47
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:53,775
Did you pick up the
Santa Claus costume?

48
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:54,874
I hope you didn't forget it.

49
00:04:54,974 --> 00:04:56,974
It's in the car.

50
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,767
I think Dad is more
excited than the kids.

51
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:03,017
I can't wait to get out of here
and see you guys.

52
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:05,372
Jimmy, put that back.
We're having dinner soon.

53
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,255
You want Santa to
come tonight or not?

54
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:08,656
Mommy, I want Santa to come.

55
00:05:08,756 --> 00:05:10,756
Then help me set the table.

56
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:14,216
Please don't be late.
- I won't. I promise.

57
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,248
Okay, bye.
- Bye.

58
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,355
Okay.

59
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,921
Oh, Jesus.
- My God.

60
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,448
Sorry, Angela...
- It's okay.

61
00:06:07,548 --> 00:06:08,688
I was just locking up the floors.

62
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:10,217
I didn't know anybody
would be working...

63
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:11,952
this late on Christmas Eve.

64
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:13,856
Me neither.
- Sorry.

65
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,988
I'll come back later, all right?

66
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:18,826
Actually, if you wouldn't
mind waiting, I'll lock my office...

67
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:20,839
and take the elevator
down with you.

68
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:21,162
Sure.

69
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:23,262
Two seconds.

70
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,165
Do you work all night?

71
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:27,290
Yeah, but they're
closing the building...

72
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,555
for the next three days.

73
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:31,169
Besides, I get New Year's Eve off.
- That's good.

74
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:32,621
I hope to get home in time...

75
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:34,509
for the girls to open
up the presents.

76
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:36,756
How are they?
- Great.

77
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:41,401
Your parents can't stand me.
- You're wrong. They love you.

78
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,324
So, where are you
going this evening?

79
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:45,450
I'm going to my sister's
house in Jersey.

80
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,390
I thought of you more as
an Upper East Side girl.

81
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:54,110
Upper east side of Maine, actually.
I grew up on a farm.

82
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,532
Now, I'm having
trouble believing that.

83
00:06:56,632 --> 00:06:59,942
Hey, don't let the
fancy clothes fool you.

84
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,288
I keep it real.

85
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,748
Is that what you call
it? Keeping it real?

86
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,206
Goodnight, Karl.
- Merry Christmas, Angela.

87
00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:09,466
You too. I'll see you soon.

88
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,120
I promise you I'm
leaving right now.

89
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:26,583
I know. I'm sorry, but
I'm in the elevator.

90
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,327
Twenty-five minutes, tops.

91
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:34,076
I can't hear you. What?
Lorraine, you're breaking up.

92
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,688
Hello?

93
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,778
You have got to be kidding.

94
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,028
Come on.

95
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,806
Oh, God. What am I gonna do?

96
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:10,406
I'm getting out of the car
is what I'm gonna do.

97
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,305
Oh, shit.

98
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,389
Hello?

99
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,738
Jesus.

100
00:09:53,838 --> 00:09:56,990
Rocky, what are you doing? Heel.

101
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,165
Stay. Down.

102
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,634
Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

103
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,888
Look, can you unlock the door
to the elevator room?

104
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:09,257
My car won't start, and I need to
get upstairs and get a cab.

105
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:13,438
Yeah, I can.
I've just got to find my key cards.

106
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,674
Sorry. Where are those darn keys?

107
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:18,101
I'm about to do my
rounds anyway, so...

108
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,767
Okay, great.
- What happened to your car?

109
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:24,038
I have no idea.
- You probably left the lights on.

110
00:10:24,138 --> 00:10:25,930
I don't think so. I'm
usually pretty good...

111
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,027
about that kind of thing.

112
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,683
People do it all the
time. It's instinctive.

113
00:10:29,783 --> 00:10:32,399
You drive down here,
it's dark... It happens.

114
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:33,512
Here we go.

115
00:10:33,612 --> 00:10:35,647
Great.
- You know, actually...

116
00:10:35,747 --> 00:10:38,057
I have a charger in the
back, so if it is...

117
00:10:38,157 --> 00:10:40,307
your battery probably
you could use that.

118
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:44,890
Thank you, but... I really should
just take a cab. I'm so late as it is.

119
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,201
No, no. It would
probably take longer...

120
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:49,116
to get a cab. It's Christmas Eve.

121
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:53,056
So... I don't know. Up to you.
Whatever you want.

122
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:57,994
How long will it take?
- Just a few minutes.

123
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,809
Now with beautiful Metropolitan
Opera House in the background,

124
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:05,909
let's check out...

125
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:07,968
the temperatures in
the Tri-State Area.

126
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,488
Which way to your car?
- Over there.

127
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,588
Okay.

128
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,930
Working late, huh?
I know how you feel.

129
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:24,713
These are pretty reliable cars
for the most part, right?

130
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,818
They're supposed to be.

131
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,984
All right. Positive...

132
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,093
Negative.

133
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:41,230
All right, try it. Turn her over.
- Okay.

134
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,205
Strange.

135
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,585
Hang on. Can you turn
your headlights on?

136
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,664
Weird. Try turning the keys again.

137
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,181
Damn it.

138
00:11:56,281 --> 00:11:59,387
All right. I guess turn
the headlights off.

139
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:01,121
You know what?

140
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,221
That's it.

141
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,358
You've been a great
help, but I give up.

142
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,462
Sorry. I don't know what happened.
I thought I could do something.

143
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,800
You've been great. Could you just
let me in the elevator room now?

144
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,980
I was just trying to help.

145
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:19,970
I know. And I appreciate
it. Thank you.

146
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:32,219
Hey, I know you're upset
about your car not starting, but...

147
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:35,088
It's the holidays. It's
time to be thankful.

148
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,701
You know what? You're right.

149
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:39,041
Yeah?
- I should be thankful.

150
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,466
I, uh...

151
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,472
I prepared
a small Christmas meal for myself.

152
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,735
You could join me if you want.

153
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,209
I'm just kidding.
- Oh, sorry. I'm exhausted.

154
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,516
But thanks for your help.

155
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,925
You're welcome. Maybe
some other time?

156
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,889
Sure.

157
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,760
All right.

158
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,904
Here you go. You sure...

159
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:16,596
you don't want me
to call you a cab?

160
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:20,000
No. I've got a number in my bag.
- Suit yourself. Merry Christmas.

161
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Merry Christmas.

162
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,587
Karl?

163
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:06,569
Hi. Can I get a car
at 2370 Park Avenue, please?

164
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,687
Are you sure? No, that's okay.
I'll wait. Thanks.

165
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:26,206
Lorraine, you won't
believe what happened.

166
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:28,386
No, my car wouldn't start.

167
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,919
Just start without me,
and I'll be there...

168
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:35,175
within the hour and I'll
make it up to them.

169
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:38,142
Okay. I'll see you soon. Bye.

170
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:37,660
Hello? Oh, great. Thank you.

171
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,737
Okay. Okay.

172
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,046
Oh, come on.

173
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,682
What?

174
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,575
This is not happening.
Is this a joke?

175
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:58,315
God, no, you gotta be kidding me.

176
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,354
Karl? Where are you?
Is anybody here?

177
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,543
Come on, come on, come on.

178
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,940
What?

179
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:20,153
One second, okay?
I'll be right back.

180
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:22,253
Just one second.

181
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,534
Hello, can you hear me?

182
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,768
I've got a cab waiting for me.

183
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:46,439
Can you open the
front gate, please?

184
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,539
Hello?

185
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,901
No... Wait.

186
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:57,781
No. Damn it.
Why would you leave me here?

187
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,052
Wake up. The cab just left.

188
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,643
Hey. I'm still in here. Wait.

189
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,766
Great.

190
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,171
It's okay.

191
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,489
Hello?

192
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,893
Stop being paranoid.

193
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,299
Go down to the office.

194
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,274
Hello?

195
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,758
Oh, fuck.

196
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,230
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
You've been a good little girl.

197
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,786
Wait. It's okay. You're
all right. Okay?

198
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,857
All right?

199
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,656
You're not looking so
good. Are you okay?

200
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:05,756
Take it easy. It's okay.

201
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,260
What happened to
me? What time is it?

202
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,188
You just fell. You'll be all right.

203
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,611
I don't feel good.
I'm going to be sick.

204
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,906
I'll get you some water.

205
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,986
Be careful. You're
gonna hurt yourself.

206
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,086
Try to stay calm.

207
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,089
Okay.

208
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:37,523
It's okay. Here. Okay?

209
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,666
I'm going to help you up, okay?

210
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,936
Here we go.

211
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:50,269
There you go. It's okay.

212
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,113
All right. Try to relax
while I clean this up.

213
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,649
Okay.

214
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:09,186
Clean this up. Okay.

215
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,794
All right. I'll be right back.

216
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:37,983
Hungry? I've got turkey,

217
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:43,718
mashed potatoes, cranberries,
and I've even got some cornbread.

218
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:50,833
Oh, man. I'm sorry about this.
I was just teasing.

219
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,031
I didn't mean to scare you.

220
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,602
I hope it's still warm.

221
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,078
If not, I have a microwave.

222
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:11,115
Are you feeling any better?

223
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:15,265
What happened to my clothes?

224
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:21,496
Like I said, you fell
and your clothes got dirty...

225
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:28,538
Maybe you'd like some wine.

226
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,294
Help you relax a
little bit, you know?

227
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:34,824
I don't know what you're doing,

228
00:23:34,924 --> 00:23:38,044
but you'd better just
fucking untie me.

229
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,499
This is a California wine.

230
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:46,749
It's Sonoma County.
That's where I'm from.

231
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,792
It's beautiful up there.

232
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:54,198
Where are you from?

233
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:01,797
What do you want?
- I want to know where you're from.

234
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,176
I'm from Readfield.

235
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:11,893
Readfield. Where's that?
- Please, tell me what you want.

236
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:16,322
I just want to know
where Readfield is.

237
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,422
And I want you to relax.

238
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,774
Cheers.

239
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,500
I'll make a toast.

240
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,720
Here's to good friends
and hometowns...

241
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,840
and Readfield. Wherever that is.

242
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,771
Listen...
- Tom.

243
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:55,871
Tom.

244
00:24:56,796 --> 00:25:01,062
I have someplace to
be. I have obligations.

245
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,263
Yeah. I know. Way too many.

246
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:09,485
You need time for
yourself. You don't need...

247
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:12,305
to be at everyone's beck and call.

248
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,819
Then maybe we should
get a drink in the new year.

249
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:24,217
I've already prepared everything.
It's all here.

250
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:27,197
I know, and it looks really good.

251
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:30,684
Yeah? Great. Well, let's eat.

252
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,481
I'm starving.

253
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:35,484
Tom, this is really sweet of you,
and I mean that.

254
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:37,344
But my whole family
is expecting me.

255
00:25:37,444 --> 00:25:38,048
I have plans.

256
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:41,428
I guess some plans
are made to be broken.

257
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,070
Do you want to say
grace or should I?

258
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,814
Hell, let's skip it.
I've never been religious anyway.

259
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,422
Bon appétit.

260
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,430
What do you like to do?

261
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:12,588
After work and stuff?
I guess, hobbies.

262
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,289
That's a mundane question,
but I guess people ask that...

263
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:18,760
just to get to know
each other, right?

264
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,146
I read. Right now I'm
reading Hemingway,

265
00:26:22,246 --> 00:26:24,246
The Sun Also Rises.

266
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:29,617
And you really should eat.
It's gonna get cold.

267
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:35,821
Anyway, in the book
this guy loves this girl so much...

268
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:40,435
that he's willing to forgive
everything that she does.

269
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,634
Even her infidelities.

270
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:48,164
That's a pretty intense story, but...

271
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:52,501
That's what love is
supposed to be, right?

272
00:26:56,682 --> 00:27:01,642
My boyfriend is gonna get worried
and come looking for me, Tom.

273
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,982
If I don't show up,
he'll come looking for me.

274
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:15,082
He knows where I work.

275
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:23,058
How long have you guys been
dating or hanging out?

276
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,009
Two years.
- Two years?

277
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:30,102
Do you live together?

278
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:33,214
That's none of your
fucking business.

279
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,759
That's not very nice dinner talk.

280
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:40,877
Yeah, we live together, okay?

281
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,531
Two years...

282
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:53,601
That's more than a boyfriend.
That sounds like wedding bells.

283
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,173
Do you have any plans?

284
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:00,543
Yes.
- What does your fiancé do?

285
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,029
He's a journalist.

286
00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:06,833
I knew he had to be smart.
What kind of journalist?

287
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:09,319
Sports.
- What paper?

288
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:11,588
Post.
- I read The Post.

289
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,807
What's his name?
- Mark Clayton.

290
00:28:13,907 --> 00:28:17,954
Clayton. I don't
remember that name.

291
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:25,061
I have one over here.
- It's The Post online.

292
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:36,007
It's amazing...

293
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:38,885
that you're able to
keep a relationship...

294
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:40,786
with the amount of
hours you work.

295
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:45,606
He must get really Lonely
when you have to work late, right?

296
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,559
Do you love him?

297
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,396
Does he love you?

298
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,739
I'm only asking because
I'm worried about...

299
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,479
how quickly he's going to get here.

300
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:06,219
I'm sure he's already on his way.

301
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,753
Right. He's probably...

302
00:29:11,853 --> 00:29:14,536
on the Harlem River
Drive as we speak.

303
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:16,836
What kind of car does he drive?
- I don't know.

304
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:19,071
You don't know what kind of car
your fiancé drives?

305
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:23,595
Toyota, I think.
- Toyota. That is a fast car.

306
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:27,733
He can be here a lot sooner
than I was thinking.

307
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:31,273
He could be coming down
this ramp right now.

308
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,398
You haven't been very talkative
since we met.

309
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:49,979
But now you're telling
me all about...

310
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,823
your boyfriend. Oh,
sorry, your fiancé.

311
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:59,325
So either we've become
best friends...

312
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:02,145
over dinner or you're lying to me.

313
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:05,102
I'm guessing...

314
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,504
you're lying to me.

315
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,847
You don't really have
a boyfriend, do you?

316
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:16,947
But you want one.

317
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:21,983
You want somebody who
cares about you...

318
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:27,318
Worries about you...
- Please, don't.

319
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:30,726
You've got a great family.

320
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,731
You've got Lorraine.

321
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:39,127
Jimmy and Rose. They love you.

322
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:45,247
They're probably getting
worried about you.

323
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:49,231
Maybe we should give
them a call. Yeah?

324
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,848
Tell them you're okay.

325
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:55,752
What do you think?

326
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,069
What should we say?

327
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:14,972
I know.

328
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:17,872
We should say you
made other plans.

329
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:21,063
No. You probably
already said that one.

330
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,933
You know what?
You should think of something.

331
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,451
You're a good liar.

332
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:30,654
Go ahead.

333
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:33,959
Go.

334
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,059
No.

335
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:51,670
Hello? Hello?

336
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,277
Hey, Rosie.

337
00:31:53,377 --> 00:31:56,441
Can you get your
mommy on the phone?

338
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,615
Who's calling, please?

339
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,824
It's Auntie Angie.
- Mommy, it's Aunt Angie.

340
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:07,015
Give me a second, okay?
Hey, where are you?

341
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,420
Angela?
- I'm not feeling well.

342
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,499
What do you mean?
We're all waiting for you.

343
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,078
She says she's not feeling well.

344
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:19,271
That's what she said the last time.
Can I talk to my sister, please?

345
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:20,654
Where are you, Angie?

346
00:32:20,754 --> 00:32:23,475
She's got a real job. It's not like...

347
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,575
Angela?

348
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,845
I went home.

349
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,107
What's wrong? Where is she?

350
00:32:31,128 --> 00:32:33,096
I don't understand.
Last time I talked to you,

351
00:32:33,196 --> 00:32:35,969
you were on your way.
What about the costume?

352
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:37,069
Let's just eat.

353
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:39,358
You should know
your sister by now.

354
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,639
It would be nice if you'd try...

355
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:42,594
and put your family
ahead of your work sometimes.

356
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,897
That's enough. Give me the phone.

357
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:46,997
Angie, what's wrong?

358
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:51,261
Hello? I can't hear her.

359
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,228
Sweetie? Can you hear me?

360
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,882
Hi, Mom. I'm here.

361
00:32:55,982 --> 00:32:58,919
Honey, what happened?
Where are you?

362
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,645
I don't know.

363
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,262
I think it's the flu.

364
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:08,442
You really sound terrible.
Are you sure you're okay?

365
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:13,787
Yeah. I just need some rest.

366
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:16,195
Okay.

367
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:20,265
Rest up and hopefully you'll
feel better for lunch tomorrow.

368
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,565
And don't worry about
the costume, okay?

369
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:28,429
Merry Christmas, angel. I love you.
- I love you too, Mom.

370
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:43,060
That was the best
Christmas present...

371
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,160
anyone's ever given me.

372
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,524
Thank you.

373
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:50,867
And now I have a present for you.

374
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,851
Go ahead.

375
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:17,621
Open it.

376
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,592
Aren't you even curious?

377
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,395
Open it.

378
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,433
Yes.

379
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,912
Bet you're curious now.

380
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,449
Okay. Enough torture.

381
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:54,219
Watch. It's all cued up.

382
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,471
Why are you showing this to me?
- Wait.

383
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:32,288
You fucked up now, asshole.

384
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,947
Sorry you had to see that.

385
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,915
You want to go for a stroll?

386
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:55,811
These guys always do
whatever they want.

387
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:04,427
Here we go.

388
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Rocky, sit down.

389
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,848
Why did you do that?

390
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,187
Rocky, shut the fuck up.

391
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,339
Let me help you up.
- Don't.

392
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:39,145
Don't touch me.
- I'm not gonna hurt you. All right?

393
00:36:39,245 --> 00:36:40,244
You're hurting my arm.

394
00:36:40,344 --> 00:36:44,024
That's because you won't
relax your arms. Okay?

395
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,072
Come on.

396
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,856
Just let me go. I won't tell anyone.

397
00:36:49,956 --> 00:36:54,276
Yeah, I believe you.
I just need to show you something.

398
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,562
Let's put that all behind us, yeah?

399
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:16,626
Here we go.

400
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,915
Uh-oh.

401
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:34,684
I think I drank too much wine.

402
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:38,421
I really shouldn't be driving.

403
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,759
I'm just kidding.

404
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:50,635
You know, I've seen you drive
out of here so many times.

405
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,455
Strange being in the car with you.

406
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,075
It's great, actually.

407
00:37:57,175 --> 00:38:00,046
I thought you said we
were taking a drive.

408
00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:01,146
We are.

409
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:03,806
Then why are we
going down, Tom?

410
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:06,416
It's freezing out there.

411
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:10,480
Besides, this is
gonna be much better.

412
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:23,252
Why are we down here, Thomas?

413
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,370
Tom?

414
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,157
Oh, my God, Tom.

415
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:50,894
What is this?

416
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:53,676
This is my present to you.

417
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:07,508
I want you to take
this and show him.

418
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,848
Show him what?

419
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:14,711
Show him you're not a slut.

420
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:17,842
Take this and teach
him he can't be...

421
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:20,342
touching every woman he wants.

422
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,274
Are you talking about
what happened in the elevator?

423
00:39:24,374 --> 00:39:26,971
Oh, Tom, no. You
don't understand.

424
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:28,500
That was a mistake.

425
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,215
A stupid mistake.

426
00:39:30,315 --> 00:39:32,875
What? He tried to rape you.
- No.

427
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:35,574
He got a little out of
hand at a party, Tom.

428
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:36,925
He hardly tried to rape me.

429
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:40,774
Look, he was drunk.
He apologized.

430
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,973
Oh, he apologized.

431
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:47,135
You think you're the first woman
he tried to do this to?

432
00:39:47,235 --> 00:39:49,732
I've seen him try to touch
every woman in the building.

433
00:39:49,832 --> 00:39:53,222
He's a pervert. A degenerate.
- No.

434
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:56,693
He's a good man, Tom.

435
00:39:57,028 --> 00:40:01,781
Look at him. He has a family.
He has a wife. Tom, please don't.

436
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:02,881
Tom, Tom...

437
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:05,070
Stop calling out my
name, all right?

438
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,683
I know what you're trying to do.

439
00:40:06,783 --> 00:40:09,285
You're trying to humanize yourself,
like you're some poor victim.

440
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:13,159
I told you, I'm not gonna hurt you.
All right?

441
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:15,562
Stop calling out my name.
Enough's enough.

442
00:40:15,662 --> 00:40:19,182
Tom, Tom, Tom.
How many times can you say it?

443
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,250
Okay.

444
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,829
I know you're a person, okay?

445
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:35,632
I'm a person, too.

446
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,614
I know you have feelings.
I have feelings, too.

447
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:42,732
I care about your feelings.

448
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:46,251
He's the one you
should be scared of.

449
00:40:46,351 --> 00:40:48,991
He's the one who has no feelings.

450
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:52,141
So if you want to help him,

451
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,545
take this and teach him a lesson.

452
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:05,353
I told you, he apologized.

453
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:08,916
What? He can just apologize
and then he can do it again?

454
00:41:09,016 --> 00:41:10,850
And then he's just gonna
apologize again and then...

455
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,390
You've got to stop
letting these assholes...

456
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,253
have their way with you.

457
00:41:13,353 --> 00:41:15,189
Tom, please believe me.

458
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:18,192
It was just a
misunderstanding, Tom.

459
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:19,292
Tom, Tom.

460
00:41:19,392 --> 00:41:22,770
Just stop calling out
my name. I told you.

461
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:26,707
Didn't I?
- Yes. Yes.

462
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,484
I'm sorry, but you're scaring me.

463
00:41:30,584 --> 00:41:33,579
Jesus. When are you
gonna understand?

464
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:37,779
I'm here to help you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

465
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,942
Okay.

466
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,114
I'll do it.

467
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:01,824
You untie me and I'll do it.

468
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:11,662
No. Oh, no. Whoa.

469
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,356
You're a good person.

470
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,649
You're a good person, too.

471
00:42:16,749 --> 00:42:19,485
I should have never asked
you to do this. I'm sorry.

472
00:42:19,585 --> 00:42:24,520
No. It's okay because I want to.

473
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:29,342
You just have to untie me
and I'll do it for you.

474
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:42,071
No, no. It's my job to protect you.

475
00:42:42,171 --> 00:42:46,464
No, Tom, listen to me. It's not.
Please don't do anything.

476
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,804
Don't try to run away, okay?

477
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,300
Can I trust you?

478
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,037
Can I trust you?
- Yes.

479
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
You can trust me.

480
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:05,243
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry.

481
00:43:08,553 --> 00:43:10,553
So...

482
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:13,916
You like to touch girls, do you?

483
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:16,759
No? Look at her.

484
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,595
I said look at her.

485
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:25,227
Does she look happy to you? Huh?

486
00:43:27,806 --> 00:43:29,806
Yeah.

487
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,454
You messed with the wrong girl.

488
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,725
What makes you think
you deserve her? Huh?

489
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,849
What gives you the right?

490
00:43:40,752 --> 00:43:43,069
You're something
else, you know that?

491
00:43:43,169 --> 00:43:47,750
You pretentious Ivy
League piece of shit.

492
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:51,796
You don't own the world
and everyone in it.

493
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:53,243
What is a guy like you thinking...

494
00:43:53,343 --> 00:43:54,978
when he puts his hands
all over a girl...

495
00:43:55,078 --> 00:43:59,878
who obviously is not interested?
Who is obviously not a slut?

496
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:03,420
Because that's what
you think they are, right?

497
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,192
Yeah? I can't hear
you. What did you say?

498
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:10,062
What? Can you speak up?

499
00:44:10,162 --> 00:44:14,642
Because you can't talk your way
out of this one, can you?

500
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:17,578
Why am I even wasting
my time with you?

501
00:44:17,678 --> 00:44:19,257
No.

502
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:21,701
What? Angela, he deserves it.

503
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:24,557
Don't do anything,
Thomas, please.

504
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:42,078
No.

505
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:45,815
Stop it. Stop it.

506
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:07,249
Way to ruin Christmas, asshole.

507
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:26,227
Well, he won't be
bothering you again.

508
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:28,491
Where are we going?

509
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:32,263
We can't just leave him here.
You have to get him.

510
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:34,399
What? Why are you
defending him?

511
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:36,884
I'm not. I'm not.

512
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,550
Do you like this?
Do you like to get touched?

513
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:41,651
You like it when he touches you
in the parking garage?

514
00:45:41,751 --> 00:45:44,321
Do you want to get laid here?
- You know that's not true.

515
00:45:44,421 --> 00:45:47,845
So what is it? A career thing?

516
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,660
Did you fuck him to
get a promotion?

517
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:55,151
We can't leave him here.

518
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:01,282
You're right. I'm sorry.

519
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:05,134
We shouldn't leave him here.

520
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,530
Wait. Thomas, stop.

521
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:14,126
What are you doing?

522
00:46:14,226 --> 00:46:16,875
We're gonna just take
him for a little drive.

523
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:21,207
What are you doing?
Tom, stop the car. Please.

524
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:23,507
Please stop. Please.

525
00:46:24,716 --> 00:46:28,083
Stop it. What are
you doing, Tom? No.

526
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:33,222
No. No.

527
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:36,051
Oh, my God.

528
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:42,697
No, please. Oh, my
God. Don't do this.

529
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:45,902
Please don't. No.

530
00:46:53,745 --> 00:46:55,359
Thomas, no.

531
00:46:55,459 --> 00:46:59,459
You're a good person, Thomas.
Please don't do this.

532
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:05,419
No. God, no. Stop it.

533
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,360
Hey. Hey.

534
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:15,131
Where are you going?

535
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:20,236
Angela. Come back.

536
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:23,840
You fucked him, didn't you? Liar.

537
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,101
Hey. Down here.

538
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,566
Can you hear me? Help.

539
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:04,513
Down here. Can't you hear me?

540
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:37,106
Good boy.

541
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:53,018
Sit. Good boy.

542
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:57,922
Stay right there, Rocky.

543
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:27,890
Stay there.

544
00:50:56,921 --> 00:51:00,482
Help me. Help me, please.

545
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:05,902
Help me, please.

546
00:51:06,002 --> 00:51:09,399
Someone's trying to
kill me. Help me.

547
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:13,936
Help me.

548
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:17,372
Somebody's trying to kill me.

549
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,734
Oh, Karl. Where are you?

550
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:24,113
Oh, my God.

551
00:52:24,075 --> 00:52:26,075
Angela?

552
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:28,924
Please.
If anyone can hear me...

553
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,070
I'm trapped in the
underground parking...

554
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:32,729
structure of the Arcadia Building.

555
00:52:32,829 --> 00:52:35,308
It's 2370 Park Avenue.

556
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:36,900
Someone's trying to kill me.

557
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Angela.

558
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,825
Angela, come out.

559
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,829
Shit.

560
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,929
Angela?

561
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:53,035
Can we talk about this?

562
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:02,236
Looks like somebody's
playing games, huh, Rocky?

563
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:11,887
Angela?

564
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:16,685
Come on.

565
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:24,492
Come on. Lobby.
Come on. Lobby. Come on.

566
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:26,829
Why is it fucking locked?

567
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,734
Angela.

568
00:54:39,076 --> 00:54:41,076
Hello?

569
00:54:43,047 --> 00:54:45,208
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

570
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:16,260
Please, hello?

571
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,360
Answer, please?

572
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:22,603
Yes?
Five Brothers Security here. Hello?

573
00:55:25,256 --> 00:55:28,191
Yes. I'm here. Can you hear me?

574
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:30,843
I can hear you fine.
How can I help you?

575
00:55:30,943 --> 00:55:32,057
I'm being kidnapped.

576
00:55:32,157 --> 00:55:34,376
I work at Brieter,
Smith and Steinberg.

577
00:55:34,476 --> 00:55:36,113
It's 2370 Park Avenue...

578
00:55:36,213 --> 00:55:38,517
and I'm hiding in the elevator.
Please can you call 911?

579
00:55:38,617 --> 00:55:39,641
Calm down, miss.

580
00:55:39,741 --> 00:55:42,106
Is there someone
with you right now?

581
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:46,477
No, he's outside in the parking lot.
He already killed someone else.

582
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:47,792
Did you see him do it?

583
00:55:47,892 --> 00:55:49,449
Yes. His name is Thomas and he's...

584
00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:51,197
the parking attendant
in my building.

585
00:55:51,297 --> 00:55:53,498
If you'll just please
hurry. I'm in danger.

586
00:55:53,598 --> 00:55:56,620
Ma'am, you have got to relax
and take a deep breath.

587
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,497
How do you fucking
expect me to relax?

588
00:55:58,597 --> 00:55:59,990
This man is trying to kill me.

589
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:03,894
Can you please try to understand
and call the cops?

590
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:06,519
Please just call 911.

591
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:10,599
The police?

592
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:14,360
No. I'm sure he's just
trying to help you.

593
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,740
Right?

594
00:56:19,276 --> 00:56:21,276
Angela?

595
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,713
Are you still there?

596
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:28,558
Listen you fuck-face,
I called the cops...

597
00:56:28,658 --> 00:56:29,733
and I'm gonna stay down here...

598
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,922
as long as it takes
until they get here,

599
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:34,058
so I suggest that
you get the fuck out.

600
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:36,353
I just wanna talk to you.

601
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,639
That's why I pretended to be...

602
00:56:38,739 --> 00:56:41,298
someone else, okay?
So don't be upset.

603
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,492
Will you come out?
I was just kidding.

604
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:46,602
Just go to hell.

605
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:49,740
Don't you understand?
I did it for you.

606
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,320
That guy showed you no respect.

607
00:56:54,678 --> 00:56:57,318
Why won't you talk to me, Angela?

608
00:56:58,649 --> 00:57:00,649
Just give me a chance.

609
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:06,386
If you just give us a chance,
it can work out.

610
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:09,124
You'll grow to like me.

611
00:57:09,326 --> 00:57:11,644
That's usually what happens
when two people...

612
00:57:11,744 --> 00:57:15,081
are forced to be together
in a stressful situation.

613
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,333
They have to depend
on one another.

614
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:19,837
And eventually they
support each other.

615
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:24,257
They like each other.
Sometimes they even fall in love.

616
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,444
Angela.

617
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:33,274
Please don't do this.

618
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:38,487
Why won't you talk to me?

619
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:44,261
You know, I wish you had just...

620
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:47,481
a little bit more
respect for yourself.

621
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:30,731
I'm not coming out.
Do you hear me?

622
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,833
I'm not fucking moving, you fuck.

623
01:00:30,027 --> 01:00:32,689
Karl. Oh, no, please.

624
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:58,887
Karl.

625
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:04,016
Come on, Karl.

626
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:36,024
Angela?

627
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,096
You must be freezing out here.

628
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,333
Angela.

629
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,380
What a mess.

630
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,054
Angela.

631
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:09,491
I think Karl is hurt.

632
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:15,127
Angela? Should we call
him an ambulance?

633
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:20,432
That way he can go
back to his kids...

634
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:23,240
and family, and you can
go to your sister's.

635
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:26,798
And I could stay here.
In this parking lot.

636
01:02:26,977 --> 01:02:29,104
All by myself.

637
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:33,013
Because that's obviously
what everybody wants.

638
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:38,954
Angela?

639
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:48,174
I just can't keep
chasing you around all night.

640
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:53,526
Besides, the whole place is locked.

641
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:59,541
Angela?

642
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:02,808
Where are you gonna
go if you get away?

643
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:06,648
It's freezing out there.

644
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:09,985
You can't go out.

645
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:13,154
Angela?

646
01:03:14,658 --> 01:03:16,658
Angela.

647
01:03:21,365 --> 01:03:23,365
Angela?

648
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:35,943
Way to ruin Christmas, Karl.

649
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:10,175
I'll have a blue

650
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:15,641
Christmas without you

651
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:21,614
I'll be so blue

652
01:04:21,992 --> 01:04:26,656
Just thinking about you

653
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:33,663
Decorations of red

654
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:38,197
On a green Christmas tree

655
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,907
Won't be the same, dear

656
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:48,312
If you're not here with me

657
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:52,385
And when those blue

658
01:04:53,156 --> 01:04:57,320
Snowflakes start falling

659
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:02,228
That's when those blue

660
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:07,159
Memories start calling

661
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:14,104
You'll be doing all right

662
01:05:15,112 --> 01:05:19,208
With your Christmas of white

663
01:05:20,484 --> 01:05:24,477
But I'll have a blue

664
01:05:24,855 --> 01:05:27,847
Blue, blue, blue Christmas

665
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:54,180
You'll be doing all right

666
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:58,985
With your Christmas of white

667
01:06:00,524 --> 01:06:04,290
But I'll have a blue

668
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:07,458
Blue, blue, blue Christmas

669
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:12,967
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

670
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:21,176
Oh, yeah.

671
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,383
Do you want makeup?

672
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,028
Okay.

673
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:20,161
You have the most beautiful lips

674
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:23,839
I have ever seen in my life.

675
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:27,508
You're beautiful.

676
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:32,419
Thank you for accepting
my invitation.

677
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,913
You have a wonderful body.

678
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:46,725
It was meant to be, babe.

679
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:51,199
Me and you.

680
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:54,499
Your skin...

681
01:07:57,307 --> 01:07:59,307
It's soft.

682
01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:03,611
Honey.

683
01:08:04,347 --> 01:08:08,613
I love you. Angela,
you know that, right?

684
01:08:28,538 --> 01:08:30,073
Hello?

685
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:31,152
Shit.

686
01:08:31,252 --> 01:08:34,292
I'm down here. Hello?
Can you hear me?

687
01:08:39,883 --> 01:08:41,883
It's okay.

688
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:10,591
Hello, Officer. Can I help you?

689
01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:13,854
Can you open up the gate, please?

690
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,645
Yes, sir. I'll be right up.

691
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:25,427
I'm sorry. I have to do this.

692
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,689
Hey.

693
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:56,735
Sorry about that.

694
01:09:56,835 --> 01:10:00,195
I was on the bottom
floor doing my rounds.

695
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:05,815
What's going on tonight?

696
01:10:05,915 --> 01:10:07,815
We got a call about a disturbance...

697
01:10:07,915 --> 01:10:10,140
at this address. Know
anything about that?

698
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,809
No, it's been real quiet all night.

699
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:16,029
See anything, hear
anything suspicious?

700
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:19,913
Like I said, I was
just doing my rounds.

701
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:22,768
It's been really quiet.
I haven't seen anybody down here.

702
01:10:22,868 --> 01:10:24,868
Any cars in there?

703
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:27,274
Well, it is a parking garage.

704
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:33,012
There's a few cars scattered
over here in this level.

705
01:10:33,112 --> 01:10:36,299
On the second level
there's a rental thing.

706
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,132
Like I said, there's been no one...

707
01:10:38,232 --> 01:10:40,016
around tonight.
Except me and Rocky.

708
01:10:40,116 --> 01:10:42,005
Two of you working here tonight.

709
01:10:42,105 --> 01:10:46,505
Kind of. He's my dog.
He's down in the office right now.

710
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:48,043
We're gonna take a look around.

711
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:49,961
Get in the back.
We'll give you a ride.

712
01:10:50,061 --> 01:10:52,061
That's a great idea.

713
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:55,125
I've just gotta close this gate.

714
01:10:55,225 --> 01:10:58,185
A lot of homeless
people around here.

715
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,463
Thanks for the ride.

716
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:45,784
If you guys wanna
check out the other floors,

717
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:47,517
just keep going around this way.

718
01:11:47,617 --> 01:11:48,625
But be careful on P3.

719
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:50,388
There's a broken
water main, okay?

720
01:11:50,488 --> 01:11:52,888
We'll come back around.
- Okay.

721
01:13:00,944 --> 01:13:03,744
What the hell's
going on here, man?

722
01:13:48,725 --> 01:13:51,592
Help me. Help.

723
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:20,821
Help me. Help.

724
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:36,837
Help me.

725
01:14:38,007 --> 01:14:40,623
Sure you haven't seen
anything weird tonight?

726
01:14:40,723 --> 01:14:43,923
No. Everybody left
really early tonight.

727
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,397
You having a party in here?

728
01:14:46,497 --> 01:14:50,017
No, no. It's just me
and Rocky, not a party.

729
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:57,175
Got anybody coming over to visit?
You know, a little action?

730
01:14:57,275 --> 01:14:59,225
Me? No. The company
would fire me...

731
01:14:59,325 --> 01:15:01,164
if I had anyone down here tonight.

732
01:15:01,264 --> 01:15:03,581
Especially at this hour.

733
01:15:03,681 --> 01:15:06,344
Well, we don't want
to break any rules.

734
01:15:06,444 --> 01:15:07,437
Right, partner?

735
01:15:07,537 --> 01:15:09,537
Not on my watch.

736
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,339
Come on, let's go.

737
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:17,211
Help me.

738
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,049
Help me.

739
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:23,987
I've got to open the gate,
so I'll just take the stairs.

740
01:15:24,087 --> 01:15:26,087
Let's do it.

741
01:15:45,408 --> 01:15:47,408
Open.

742
01:16:03,526 --> 01:16:05,585
Wait.

743
01:16:15,705 --> 01:16:17,006
You guys stay warm.

744
01:16:17,106 --> 01:16:19,846
You keep your eyes
and ears open, huh?

745
01:16:19,946 --> 01:16:21,946
You bet.

746
01:16:25,348 --> 01:16:27,988
Merry Christmas.
- You too, buddy.

747
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:38,154
Wait. Wait.

748
01:19:45,081 --> 01:19:46,296
911.

749
01:19:46,396 --> 01:19:47,408
Yes, please, I need your help.

750
01:19:47,508 --> 01:19:48,767
All our lines are
busy at the moment.

751
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:49,830
Please hold.

752
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:52,034
Someone will be with you shortly.
- Hello?

753
01:19:52,134 --> 01:19:54,134
Thank you.

754
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,474
All our lines are
busy at the moment.

755
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:30,574
Please hold.

756
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:35,654
911. All our lines are
busy at the moment.

757
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,140
Rock? Rocky.

758
01:20:58,254 --> 01:21:01,690
Why would you do that?

759
01:21:05,761 --> 01:21:07,761
He's just an animal.

760
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:11,532
Angela.

761
01:21:11,801 --> 01:21:15,001
Why would you kill a
defenseless animal?

762
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:30,116
After all I did for
you? To help you?

763
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:33,921
This is what I get?

764
01:21:35,191 --> 01:21:37,191
You killed my dog.

765
01:21:38,461 --> 01:21:40,461
Answer. Please answer.

766
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,729
Angela?

767
01:21:42,865 --> 01:21:46,357
You're really starting
to piss me off.

768
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:48,602
Angela.

769
01:22:37,253 --> 01:22:39,551
Hello? Are you there?

770
01:22:39,855 --> 01:22:43,375
Hello? This is the police.
Is somebody there?

771
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:45,802
Is this an emergency?

772
01:22:45,902 --> 01:22:48,831
If you can hear me,
please say something.

773
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:52,851
Tap the phone, let me know
if you're there. Hello?

774
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:55,850
This is the police. This is 911.

775
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:58,750
Are you okay? Are
you there? Hello?

776
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:07,439
You're trying to get
me fired, aren't you?

777
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:11,578
Bet you'd really like that.

778
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:28,602
But, honey...

779
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:32,119
What are we gonna do then?

780
01:23:33,042 --> 01:23:36,322
We couldn't just live
off of your salary.

781
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:15,475
Angela.

782
01:25:18,013 --> 01:25:20,013
Angela.

783
01:25:24,153 --> 01:25:26,153
Angela.

784
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:55,349
Shit.

785
01:26:48,003 --> 01:26:50,003
Shit.

786
01:27:59,475 --> 01:28:03,235
Let's fucking do this.
You want to fuck with me?

787
01:28:06,348 --> 01:28:08,348
Come on.

788
01:28:17,726 --> 01:28:19,806
Come on, you chicken shit.

789
01:29:34,336 --> 01:29:36,336
Angela?

790
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:40,420
Let me help you out, okay?

791
01:29:54,823 --> 01:29:56,539
Help me? You're gonna help me?

792
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:01,199
Why don't you let me help you,
for a change? Motherfucker.

793
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:34,840
What the fuck are
you doing, Angela?

794
01:30:35,297 --> 01:30:38,323
Come back here, now. Let me go.

795
01:30:39,635 --> 01:30:43,395
Come over here
and get me out of this right now.

796
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,919
Why are you doing this, Angela?

797
01:30:48,744 --> 01:30:50,744
Angela.

798
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:56,007
Angela? I just wanted
us to be friends.

799
01:30:58,186 --> 01:31:00,186
I'm alone.

800
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:03,015
I'm always alone.

801
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:09,654
Why can't we just
spend more time together?

802
01:31:10,999 --> 01:31:14,093
Angela? Wait.

803
01:31:15,237 --> 01:31:17,237
Why?

804
01:31:17,673 --> 01:31:19,834
Why can't we be friends?

805
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:24,277
Why can't we just
spend Christmas together?

806
01:31:25,047 --> 01:31:28,327
Do you hear me? You
stupid, fucking cunt.

807
01:31:41,263 --> 01:31:43,263
Angela, wait. I didn't...

808
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:45,999
Merry Christmas, Thomas.

809
01:31:48,904 --> 01:31:52,806
No. No. No.

810
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:55,434
No. No.

811
01:33:53,562 --> 01:33:55,562
You all right, lady?
