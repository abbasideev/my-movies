1
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,097
<i>Are you watching closely?</i>

2
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:10,401
<i>Every magic trick consists
of three parts, or acts.</i>

3
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,880
<i>The first part is called "the pledge."</i>

4
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,316
<i>The magician shows you
something ordinary.</i>

5
00:01:17,385 --> 00:01:20,843
<i>A deck of cards, a bird or a man.</i>

6
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,896
<i>He shows you this object.</i>

7
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,558
<i>Perhaps he asks you to inspect it,</i>

8
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:35,659
<i>to see that it is indeed real,</i>

9
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:38,796
<i>unaltered, normal.</i>

10
00:01:42,443 --> 00:01:45,344
<i>But, of course, it probably isn't.</i>

11
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:47,210
Where do you think you're going?

12
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,647
I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

13
00:02:02,562 --> 00:02:05,030
<i>The second act is called "the turn."</i>

14
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:22,538
<i>The magician takes
the ordinary something</i>

15
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,210
<i>and makes it do
something extraordinary.</i>

16
00:02:31,724 --> 00:02:35,820
<i>Now you're looking for the
secret, but you won't find it,</i>

17
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:39,728
<i>because, of course,
you're not really looking.</i>

18
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:41,425
<i>You don't really want to know.</i>

19
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,061
<i>You want to be... fooled.</i>

20
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:51,175
<i>But you wouldn't clap yet,</i>

21
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:55,407
<i>because making something
disappear isn't enough.</i>

22
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:59,076
<i>You have to bring it back.</i>

23
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:04,352
<i>That's why every magic trick
has a third act.</i>

24
00:03:04,422 --> 00:03:06,083
<i>The hardest part.</i>

25
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:08,682
<i>The part we call...</i>

26
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,091
<i>..."the prestige."</i>

27
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:25,070
The prestige? And did Robert
Angier, the Great Danton, your employer,

28
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:27,577
get to that final part
of his trick that night?

29
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:29,738
- No, sir. Something went wrong.
- What went wrong?

30
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:34,407
I saw someone making
their way below stage.

31
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:36,385
I followed him.

32
00:03:36,454 --> 00:03:39,719
It was Borden,
watching Mr. Angier drown.

33
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,226
Would you please describe
your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter.

34
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:45,659
<i>I'm an ingénieur, I design illusions</i>

35
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,892
and construct the apparatus
necessary for performing them.

36
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:53,402
So, Mr. Cutter, was this
water-filled tank beneath the stage

37
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,062
part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

38
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:59,006
No. The tank was brought
on for the first trick

39
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:01,043
and then taken offstage.

40
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:04,410
Borden must have placed it
under the trap door after the end of it.

41
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:06,039
How large was this tank?

42
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:08,710
It's a normal tank
for escape under water,

43
00:04:08,785 --> 00:04:10,912
about 400 or 500 gallons.

44
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:13,478
How do you think he
was able to move the tank

45
00:04:13,556 --> 00:04:15,922
under the trap door
without anyone noticing?

46
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:18,357
He's a magician, ask him.

47
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:19,519
I ask again,

48
00:04:19,595 --> 00:04:22,826
would this man explain the mechanics
of Mr. Angier's illusion.

49
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:26,231
The Real Transported Man is one
of the most sought after illusions

50
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:27,496
in this business.

51
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,128
I have the right to sell it on.

52
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:31,833
If I reveal the method here,
the trick is worthless.

53
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:34,171
How can we know
that the tank wasn't simply

54
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:36,711
some part of the trick that went wrong?

55
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:38,838
Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament.

56
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:41,314
But Alfred Borden's life
hangs in the balance.

57
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:44,546
If you were prepared to disclose
the details to me in private,

58
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,453
I might be able to judge
their relevance to the case.

59
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:50,151
Might this be an acceptable compromise?

60
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:11,810
I'm going to have to ask
you to turn out your pockets.

61
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,511
Not my idea, sir. The warden saw
his show in Manchester last year

62
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,452
where he vanished into thin air.

63
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:24,014
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

64
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,225
I told him the only way
Borden's going to disappear

65
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,731
is if I leave him out there
with the other inmates.

66
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:39,936
Check the locks...

67
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,200
...twice.

68
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:52,809
My name is Owens.

69
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,150
I'm a solicitor.

70
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,885
I represent Lord Caldlow, an
accomplished amateur magician and...

71
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,553
How much?

72
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,959
- He is interested...
- How much for my tricks?

73
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,622
Five thousand pounds.

74
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,189
<i>Talk to Fallon, my ingénieur.
Money's for him.</i>

75
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,964
Yes, I did. He offered
to sell me your tricks.

76
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,905
All except the most valuable
one, The Transported Man.

77
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,273
Well, I won't forgive myself
for selling my greatest trick.

78
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,777
Even for your daughter?

79
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:25,781
If you are for the drop, your daughter
is going to need looking after.

80
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:27,580
Fallon will take care of her.

81
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,382
Perfect, Fallon.

82
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,480
A man with a past
as obscure as your own.

83
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:36,585
The courts have motioned she be removed
from his care. She will be an orphan.

84
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:38,925
I know you're no stranger
to the workhouse.

85
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:41,529
It's better than here?

86
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,831
I'm offering you a way to wrap up
your affairs with dignity.

87
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:46,871
I'm offering your daughter a future.

88
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:49,964
As Lord Caldlow's ward,
she will want for nothing...

89
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,872
...ever.

90
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:54,935
Well, think it over.

91
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:58,779
And Lord Caldlow
would like you to have this,

92
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,375
as a show of good faith.
It might be of interest.

93
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:04,980
Robert Angier's diary, including
the time he spent in Colorado

94
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:06,318
learning your trick.

95
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:08,086
- He never learned it.
- Really?

96
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:11,686
On his return, he mounted
a version of The Transported Man

97
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:15,721
that the papers said was
better even than your original.

98
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,994
If you want Angier's secrets,

99
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:22,630
you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

100
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:24,571
I want your secret, Mr. Borden.

101
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:28,944
Consider your daughter.

102
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:38,355
<i>A cipher,</i>

103
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:40,447
<i>an enigma...</i>

104
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:44,190
<i>...a search,</i>

105
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:45,250
<i>a search for answers.</i>

106
00:07:52,935 --> 00:07:56,735
<i>Even if Colorado
is the end of my journey,</i>

107
00:07:56,806 --> 00:08:00,003
<i>it'll take much longer to unravel</i>

108
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:01,976
<i>the rest of Borden's secrets.</i>

109
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:06,013
<i>See, the cipher in his notebook is</i>

110
00:08:06,082 --> 00:08:08,573
<i>unlocked by a single word,</i>

111
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:11,620
<i>but it will still take months
to translate his writing.</i>

112
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:14,452
<i>And to know his mind.</i>

113
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:19,725
<i>Well, my passion is equal to the task.</i>

114
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:36,335
Mr. Angier, welcome
to Colorado Springs.

115
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:54,787
- The whole town has electricity.
- Yes, sir.

116
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:13,469
Well...

117
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,037
...quite a reception.

118
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:17,607
You're our first guest
of the season, Mr. Angier.

119
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:21,177
Your telegram didn't indicate
how long you'd be staying with us.

120
00:09:21,255 --> 00:09:22,882
As long as it takes.

121
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:26,222
I will need a coach tomorrow
to take me up the mountain.

122
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:28,022
Well, the peak's closed, sir.

123
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:29,926
For scientific experimentation.

124
00:09:29,997 --> 00:09:31,965
Yes, I know.

125
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:33,329
That's why I'm here.

126
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:42,803
Whoa. Whoa.

127
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:47,446
You'll have to walk
the rest, I'm afraid, sir.

128
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:26,211
I'm amazed how many
of you newspaper writers

129
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:28,344
can't read my sign.

130
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,685
Not the welcome I was expecting.

131
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:40,723
I know you.

132
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:46,226
You're the Great Danton.

133
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:48,602
I saw your show in London.

134
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:51,437
Seven times you guessed every object

135
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:53,739
the audience had in their pockets.

136
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:57,872
I'm Alley. Sorry about the fence.
People keep interfering with our work.

137
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,611
- I've come to see Tesla.
- Why?

138
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:04,746
He made a machine
for a colleague of mine some time ago.

139
00:11:04,822 --> 00:11:08,314
- Can you get me a meeting with him?
- Impossible, I'm afraid.

140
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:10,622
I've brought a lot of money.

141
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:12,356
I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

142
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:15,991
I simply can't help.

143
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:20,296
I'll be staying
at the hotel, indefinitely.

144
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,733
Hey, what am I holding?

145
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,106
Your watch.

146
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:35,407
<i>Borden's journal
entry for April 3, 1897,</i>

147
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:37,578
<i>describes a show
at the Orpheum Theater.</i>

148
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:40,555
<i>That was just days
after he first met me.</i>

149
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:46,660
<i>We were two young men
at the start of a great career,</i>

150
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,062
<i>two young men devoted to an illusion,</i>

151
00:11:49,132 --> 00:11:51,692
<i>two young men who never
intended to hurt anyone.</i>

152
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:53,531
Which of you brave souls

153
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:56,333
is willing to bind
this lovely young woman?

154
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,041
Me!

155
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:10,041
If you would tie her wrists,

156
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:13,019
bind her feet...

157
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:15,613
...around the ankle.

158
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,784
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

159
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,691
- No.
- No.

160
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:23,590
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

161
00:13:26,693 --> 00:13:30,288
He's complacent,
he's predictable, he's boring.

162
00:13:30,364 --> 00:13:32,924
Milton has gotten success,
whatever that means,

163
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,231
so now he's scared.
He won't take any risks at all.

164
00:13:36,303 --> 00:13:39,363
He's squandering the goodwill
of his audience with tired,

165
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:42,033
- second-rate tricks...
- They're all favorites.

166
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:45,601
Give me something fresh.
He won't even try a bloody bullet catch.

167
00:13:45,678 --> 00:13:47,509
A bullet catch is suicide.

168
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,573
All it takes is some smartass
volunteer to put a button in the barrel.

169
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,914
- Use a plant.
- You can't for every trick.

170
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:55,954
No seats left for the punters.

171
00:13:56,022 --> 00:13:59,822
All right, no bullet catch, whatever,
but the point is a real magician

172
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,519
tries to invent something new

173
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:04,461
that other magicians will
scratch their heads over.

174
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,725
Then you sell it to him
for a small fortune.

175
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:09,893
- What?
- I suppose you have such a trick?

176
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:12,529
- I sure do.
- Would you care to sell it to me?

177
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:14,197
No. No one else can do my trick.

178
00:14:14,273 --> 00:14:16,400
- Any trick can be duplicated.
- Wrong.

179
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:20,206
If Mr. Borden has invented
his masterpiece,

180
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:22,178
he's prepared to do it.

181
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:24,374
Milton is a showman,
but Borden is right,

182
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:26,076
he won't get his hands dirty.

183
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:29,712
If you want to see what
it takes to make real magic,

184
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:33,622
go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman
there and he really has what it takes.

185
00:14:33,691 --> 00:14:35,921
- Chung Ling Soo.
- I can't afford that.

186
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:37,723
I know the bloke run the door.

187
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:42,130
You two go and see that show, and
whichever one of you can tell me

188
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,294
how he does the goldfish bowl
trick gets the prize.

189
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,634
- Which is?
- Ten minutes onstage

190
00:14:47,705 --> 00:14:49,536
with my old friend, Mr. Ackerman.

191
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:51,040
- Really?
- Who's Ackerman?

192
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:54,169
The top theatrical agent in London.

193
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:57,236
- I saw you drop the knot again.
- I turned my wrists.

194
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,942
Some nights you
just don't get it, do you?

195
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:02,884
I mean, if that knot slips
and Julia's on the hoist,

196
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:04,045
she'll break her leg.

197
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:05,748
It's the wrong knot.

198
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:08,690
Like I said, the Langford
double will hold tighter.

199
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,286
The Langford double isn't
a wet knot. It's too dangerous.

200
00:15:12,362 --> 00:15:14,592
If the rope swells, she can't slip it.

201
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,896
- I can slip a Langford underwater.
- We can practice.

202
00:15:17,968 --> 00:15:21,904
- Borden, he said no.
- Oh, you know knots better than me?

203
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:23,963
Listen, no more mistakes.

204
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,737
All right. Yeah? Do you?
You want to take over?

205
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,745
- Just leave.
- I didn't think so.

206
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,014
Hey, Cutter, where's he from?

207
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:39,384
Where are you from? He shifts
props for Virgil at the hall.

208
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:42,618
- Worried he'll steal your tricks?
- Doesn't deal in methods.

209
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,752
- How do you know?
- Because I hired him

210
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:49,059
to find out how Virgil
does the orange trick.

211
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:51,464
- I don't trust him.
- He's a natural magician.

212
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,627
'Course you can't trust him.

213
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,068
I think he's all right.

214
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:57,470
- You think everyone's all right.
- Even you.

215
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,374
Watch your sightlines. If I can see you
kiss your wife's leg every night,

216
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:04,106
so can the blokes at the ends
of rows three and four!

217
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:38,612
You're wrong. It can't be.

218
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,411
- Look at the man.
- This is the trick.

219
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:44,508
This is the performance. Right here.

220
00:16:44,585 --> 00:16:46,951
This is why no one
can detect his method.

221
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:50,314
Total devotion to his art.

222
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:53,054
A lot of self-sacrifice.

223
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:55,493
You know.

224
00:16:55,563 --> 00:16:58,259
It's the only way to escape...

225
00:16:58,332 --> 00:17:00,766
...all this, you know?

226
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:08,235
I can barely lift this thing
and it's not even filled with water.

227
00:17:09,877 --> 00:17:12,209
Or fish, look.

228
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:14,543
I don't know. Hang on a second.

229
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:19,178
He must be strong as an ox.

230
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:24,654
He's been pretending
to be a cripple for years.

231
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:28,319
Any time he's in public,
any time he goes out. It's unthinkable.

232
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:31,329
Borden saw it at once.
But I couldn't fathom it.

233
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:34,264
Living my whole life
pretending to be someone else.

234
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:36,063
You are pretending.

235
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:38,160
I don't think changing a name compares.

236
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:40,706
Not your name. Who you are
and where you're from.

237
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:44,732
I promised I wouldn't embarrass
my family with my theatrical endeavors.

238
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:48,510
I thought of a name for you.

239
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:53,374
The Great Danton.

240
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:56,421
Do you like it? But it's sophisticated.

241
00:17:56,488 --> 00:17:57,921
It's French.

242
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:08,059
<i>Borden writes as if no one but
he understood the true nature of magic.</i>

243
00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:16,435
<i>But what does he know of self-sacrifice?</i>

244
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:23,673
You bloody fool.

245
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:54,837
- He killed it.
- It's OK.

246
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:58,746
- He killed it.
- He didn't.

247
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:04,514
Look, now he'll bring it back.

248
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:09,691
- No, he killed it.
- No, he didn't.

249
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:20,970
Look, see, he's all right. He's fine.

250
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:25,133
- Look at him.
- But where's his brother?

251
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:31,109
He's a sharp lad, your son.

252
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:33,775
Oh, he's my nephew.

253
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,340
Ah.

254
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:41,078
You're the lucky one today.

255
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:04,840
Are you watching closely?

256
00:20:07,616 --> 00:20:09,106
Look closer.

257
00:20:12,187 --> 00:20:13,984
Never show anyone.

258
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:16,785
They'll beg you
and flatter you for the secret,

259
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:20,350
but as soon as you give it up,
you'll be nothing to them.

260
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,692
You understand? Nothing.

261
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,824
The secret impresses no one.

262
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,495
The trick you use it for is everything.

263
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:36,676
Well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.

264
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:38,234
You're welcome.

265
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,341
Alfred, it's Alfred.

266
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,008
Alfred.

267
00:20:43,084 --> 00:20:46,053
So I could use a cup of tea.

268
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,647
I can't allow...
It's the landlord. It's not...

269
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:54,322
You think that's...
Is that enough to keep me out?

270
00:20:54,394 --> 00:20:57,625
I think so.

271
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,224
So I'll see you again?

272
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:11,934
Milk and sugar?

273
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:35,000
What's in there?

274
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:37,001
Angier's machine.

275
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:47,205
You built this, Mr. Cutter?

276
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,146
Oh, no, sir. This wasn't
built by a magician.

277
00:21:50,216 --> 00:21:52,241
This was built by a wizard.

278
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:57,312
A man who can actually do
what magicians pretend to do.

279
00:21:57,389 --> 00:22:01,587
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens
with these things after the trial?

280
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:03,627
They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.

281
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:06,459
An avid collector,
very interested in the case.

282
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:09,022
Yeah. Well, don't let him take this.

283
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,898
- Why ever not?
- It's too dangerous.

284
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,131
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles

285
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:16,503
it's got a simple
and disappointing trick.

286
00:22:16,574 --> 00:22:19,008
The most disappointing of all, sir.

287
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:22,874
It has no trick.

288
00:22:25,316 --> 00:22:26,908
It's real.

289
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:32,319
This is the tank Angier drowned in?

290
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,449
Yes.

291
00:22:34,526 --> 00:22:36,687
This is the...

292
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,820
...place where the performer's
hand reaches through

293
00:22:39,897 --> 00:22:41,159
to the trick padlock.

294
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:43,495
A standard magical
apparatus for escapes?

295
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:46,058
Yeah, with one important difference.

296
00:22:46,136 --> 00:22:48,161
This isn't a trick lock.

297
00:22:48,238 --> 00:22:50,206
It's been switched for a real one.

298
00:22:50,274 --> 00:22:52,242
What a way to kill someone.

299
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:55,005
They're magicians, Your Honor.

300
00:22:55,078 --> 00:23:00,482
Showmen, men who live by dressing up
plain and sometimes brutal truths,

301
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:03,648
to amaze, to shock.

302
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,881
Even without an audience?

303
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:09,025
There was an audience.

304
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,919
You see, this water tank

305
00:23:11,994 --> 00:23:15,430
was of particular significance
to these two men.

306
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:19,257
Particularly awful significance.

307
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:27,165
Which of you brave souls is
willing to bind this lovely young woman?

308
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:31,235
If you would tie her wrists,

309
00:23:31,314 --> 00:23:33,475
bind her feet around the ankle.

310
00:23:46,696 --> 00:23:49,290
- Are either of you gentlemen sailors?
- No.

311
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:53,461
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

312
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:49,850
Robert!

313
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,410
No, no.

314
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,908
Julia. Julia!

315
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,463
I knew an old sailor once.

316
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,433
They told me he went overboard,

317
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:12,594
tangled in the sails.

318
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,467
They pulled him out,

319
00:26:14,538 --> 00:26:18,440
but it took him five minutes to cough.

320
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:20,534
He said it was like...

321
00:26:20,611 --> 00:26:22,442
...going home.

322
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:30,117
What do you want, Borden?

323
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:38,952
I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.

324
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,826
Which knot did you tie?

325
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:50,906
I keep asking myself that.

326
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:52,965
- And?
- And...

327
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:57,578
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

328
00:26:59,649 --> 00:27:01,139
You don't know?

329
00:27:02,986 --> 00:27:04,920
I'm sorry.

330
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:08,483
You don't know?

331
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:14,290
You don't know?!

332
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,903
- Alfred?
- Good news. We got our first booking.

333
00:27:24,373 --> 00:27:26,307
I don't think we've had the pleasure.

334
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:29,401
<i>- Mr. Fallon is my ingénieur.
- Where did you get all...?</i>

335
00:27:29,478 --> 00:27:33,471
- I had to borrow and... don't ask.
- He's a very enterprising soul

336
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:35,346
is... is Mr. Fallon. So...

337
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:38,853
- We can't afford to pay him.
- The money will come with the audience.

338
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:42,618
But what about until then?
What I earn, it's barely enough for us.

339
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:46,650
Don't worry about it. I'll share
half my food with him or something.

340
00:27:46,728 --> 00:27:49,697
You're going to be
doing that with someone else.

341
00:27:49,765 --> 00:27:51,665
No. You're...

342
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:53,997
Having a baby.

343
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:56,970
Oh, my God.

344
00:27:57,038 --> 00:27:59,871
We should have told Fallon.
That is great.

345
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:02,409
Oh, come here.

346
00:28:02,476 --> 00:28:05,445
Oh.

347
00:28:05,513 --> 00:28:07,037
Alfred, what is this?

348
00:28:07,114 --> 00:28:11,278
Oh, this is just the trick to work
Ackerman up at the end of my act.

349
00:28:11,352 --> 00:28:14,048
Is it the masterpiece, the great trick?

350
00:28:14,121 --> 00:28:16,885
No, no, no, the world is
not ready for that one yet.

351
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:21,292
This is just your run-of-the-mill,
daring, spectacular bullet catch.

352
00:28:21,362 --> 00:28:23,887
- A bullet catch.
- Yeah, but it's safe.

353
00:28:23,965 --> 00:28:26,263
I promise. Look.

354
00:28:28,636 --> 00:28:30,900
- Shoot me.
- Shoot you?

355
00:28:30,972 --> 00:28:32,200
Go on, shoot me.

356
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:36,733
- Right there.
- No, I can't.

357
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,370
No, no, not there.
Shoot me here. Don't...

358
00:28:43,617 --> 00:28:46,484
How's that?

359
00:28:46,553 --> 00:28:49,886
That's very good. Tell me how you do it.

360
00:28:49,956 --> 00:28:51,082
No, I can't do that.

361
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,026
- Well, then you can't do it.
- I can't do it?

362
00:28:56,096 --> 00:28:59,429
I'm sorry, but I can't
raise a child on my own.

363
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:01,831
You don't tell anybody that I told you.

364
00:29:01,902 --> 00:29:04,234
- OK.
- Gunpowder.

365
00:29:06,806 --> 00:29:07,932
Wadding.

366
00:29:09,575 --> 00:29:11,668
Then the bullet.

367
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:14,007
Ramrod.

368
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:20,708
Hold out your hand.

369
00:29:22,788 --> 00:29:26,724
The bullet is not even in the
gun when the charge is fired.

370
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:30,558
Once you know,
it's actually very obvious.

371
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,621
Well, I mean, you still get...

372
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:35,291
It's dangerous.

373
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:37,562
- People still get killed doing that.
- How?

374
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:40,366
You get some smartass who
could put a penny or a button

375
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:43,772
or, God forbid, Sarah, somebody
could put a bullet down there.

376
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:47,038
Don't worry. Don't worry,

377
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:50,376
because I'm not gonna let
anything happen.

378
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:53,315
Everything's gonna
be all right because...

379
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:57,951
...I love you very much.

380
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:03,890
- Say it again.
- I love you.

381
00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:07,431
- Not today.
- What?

382
00:30:07,498 --> 00:30:10,661
Well, some days it's not true,
and today you don't mean it.

383
00:30:10,735 --> 00:30:13,966
Maybe today you're more
in love with magic than me.

384
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:16,666
I like being able
to tell the difference.

385
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:19,539
It makes the days it is true

386
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,941
mean something.

387
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,013
All right.

388
00:30:44,001 --> 00:30:47,300
Metal rings,
ladies and gentlemen.

389
00:30:47,371 --> 00:30:50,033
If there are any
ladies and gentlemen here.

390
00:30:50,107 --> 00:30:53,474
- Solid metal.
- Seen that already.

391
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,212
Who threw that?

392
00:31:21,804 --> 00:31:23,601
This is what you came for, is it?

393
00:31:27,443 --> 00:31:28,933
So...

394
00:31:30,046 --> 00:31:31,946
...who wants to volunteer?

395
00:31:32,013 --> 00:31:33,776
- I do!
- Me!

396
00:31:41,523 --> 00:31:42,581
Me.

397
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,418
Me.

398
00:31:59,841 --> 00:32:02,332
Are you man enough, sir?

399
00:32:07,314 --> 00:32:09,145
Yes.

400
00:32:19,927 --> 00:32:21,986
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

401
00:32:28,202 --> 00:32:30,466
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

402
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:33,333
I don't know.

403
00:32:48,888 --> 00:32:52,551
<i>He came in to demand
an answer, and I told him the truth.</i>

404
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:55,788
<i>That I have fought with myself
over that night,</i>

405
00:32:55,862 --> 00:32:59,195
<i>one half of me swearing blind
that I tied a simple slipknot,</i>

406
00:32:59,265 --> 00:33:02,632
<i>the other half convinced
that I tied the Langford double.</i>

407
00:33:02,702 --> 00:33:04,727
<i>I can never know for sure.</i>

408
00:33:07,673 --> 00:33:09,937
How can he not know!

409
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:11,772
<i>How can he not know?</i>

410
00:33:13,412 --> 00:33:15,903
<i>He must know what he did.</i>

411
00:33:15,982 --> 00:33:17,381
<i>He must.</i>

412
00:33:20,018 --> 00:33:22,009
Sarah, that bloody hurts.

413
00:33:22,721 --> 00:33:25,349
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

414
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:27,857
It's as bad as the day it happened.

415
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:33,530
- We have to get a doctor back.
- We can't afford the doctor back.

416
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,695
- You've woken her.
- Great.

417
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,671
I'm sorry, I need this to heal
so I can get back to work.

418
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,506
You've got to face things. What tricks
can you perform with this injury?

419
00:33:45,577 --> 00:33:49,035
I can do car pulls.
I can do some prop tricks.

420
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:53,483
I can still do that. I can do
the trick I've been telling you about.

421
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:55,678
The one that they're
gonna remember me for.

422
00:33:58,055 --> 00:33:59,647
Come on.

423
00:34:25,216 --> 00:34:28,413
I never thought I'd find an answer
at the bottom of a pint glass.

424
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,076
Hasn't stopped your looking.

425
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:38,158
Heard about a booking.
Nice little theater.

426
00:34:38,228 --> 00:34:41,061
- Young, up-and-coming magician.
- Who?

427
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,860
- You.
- Me? Booking? Why?

428
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:46,026
I want to keep on working.

429
00:34:46,102 --> 00:34:49,333
<i>Who's going to hire the ingénieur
that killed Julia McCullough</i>

430
00:34:49,405 --> 00:34:51,532
in front of a sellout crowd
at the Orpheum?

431
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:54,503
Someone who knows it wasn't your fault.

432
00:34:54,577 --> 00:34:58,069
Someone who knows Alfred Borden
and his repertoire of exotic knots.

433
00:34:58,147 --> 00:35:01,674
I hear he had a spot of bad luck
catching a bullet south of the river.

434
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:04,549
That's a dangerous trick, that one.

435
00:35:09,758 --> 00:35:11,726
We'll have to whitewash the windows,

436
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:15,490
confound the more curious
members of the public, but it will do.

437
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:20,961
- We should see about an assistant.
- I've made some arrangements.

438
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,633
You settled on a name?

439
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,200
Yes, I have.

440
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:28,140
The Great Danton.

441
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,735
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

442
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:34,377
No, it's sophisticated.

443
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:37,213
The birdcage can't be
our climax. Everybody knows it.

444
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:39,686
- Not like this.
- I don't want to kill doves.

445
00:35:39,754 --> 00:35:41,619
Then stay off the stage.

446
00:35:41,689 --> 00:35:43,384
You're a magician, not a wizard.

447
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:47,325
You got to get your hands dirty, if
you're going to achieve the impossible.

448
00:35:48,796 --> 00:35:51,162
In here, Miss Wenscombe.

449
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:55,692
No point in meeting Mr. Angier
if you don't fit. On the right.

450
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:00,898
- What's so hard about this?
- Nothing.

451
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:03,500
You're going... down here.

452
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:12,184
- And this will conceal, right?
- Oh, sure.

453
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:14,445
- Tighten up on there.
- Yep.

454
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:15,546
OK.

455
00:36:17,657 --> 00:36:18,715
This ties up here?

456
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:20,191
- Ties in the back.
- Good.

457
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:28,461
Breathe as little as possible.

458
00:36:34,974 --> 00:36:37,602
Now, you see?

459
00:36:37,677 --> 00:36:39,076
- That's it.
- OK.

460
00:36:42,515 --> 00:36:44,346
She's not experienced,

461
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:46,442
but she knows how to present herself.

462
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:51,115
A pretty assistant is the most
effective form of misdirection.

463
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,557
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,
for my final trick,

464
00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:57,390
I will require the assistance
of two volunteers.

465
00:36:57,463 --> 00:36:59,727
Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me?

466
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:03,157
Yep.

467
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,665
- Under?
- Under, yeah.

468
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,537
Come around his foot.

469
00:37:09,608 --> 00:37:11,041
- Careful.
- It's all right.

470
00:37:31,896 --> 00:37:34,160
- Your volunteer, put their hand there.
- Yeah?

471
00:37:34,232 --> 00:37:36,063
And another one here.

472
00:37:36,134 --> 00:37:39,661
If you'll place your hands
on either side of the cage, please.

473
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:41,068
Thank you, Olivia.

474
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:44,905
You best not be intending
to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier.

475
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:47,342
- Of course not.
- Ready? Right.

476
00:37:48,112 --> 00:37:50,910
- One...
- Two...

477
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:52,911
Three.

478
00:37:56,921 --> 00:37:58,718
That's bloody marvelous, Cutter.

479
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:00,918
Very nice.

480
00:38:00,992 --> 00:38:02,789
And the best part is...

481
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:10,599
I thought you said I had
to get my hands dirty.

482
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,567
Someday, perhaps you will.

483
00:38:12,636 --> 00:38:14,194
I just had to know that you can.

484
00:38:14,271 --> 00:38:16,205
Very nice. Very nice, indeed.

485
00:38:16,273 --> 00:38:19,936
I haven't had the chance to compliment
you on your beautiful theater.

486
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,376
It'll be a lot more
beautiful when it's full.

487
00:38:22,446 --> 00:38:23,435
Don't worry.

488
00:38:23,513 --> 00:38:25,743
You all say that. Why should I worry?

489
00:38:25,816 --> 00:38:28,683
If your tricks don't get them
in, somebody else's will.

490
00:38:28,752 --> 00:38:32,848
Maybe somebody willing
to do a bullet catch or a water escape?

491
00:38:32,923 --> 00:38:34,481
Cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit.

492
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:38,221
People hoping for an accident,
likely to see one too.

493
00:38:38,294 --> 00:38:40,285
What would that do for your business?

494
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:43,229
You got a week, John.

495
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:46,666
Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

496
00:38:54,643 --> 00:38:56,008
Thank you.

497
00:38:57,813 --> 00:39:01,442
Uh... Sir, in the third row there.

498
00:39:01,517 --> 00:39:04,213
Please stand up
and show us your handkerchief.

499
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:08,019
This isn't mine.

500
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,548
Perhaps you'd return it to the lady
in the aisle of the second row.

501
00:39:11,627 --> 00:39:13,925
I believe she has yours.

502
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:24,932
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm making
so many mistakes. I'm so nervous.

503
00:39:25,006 --> 00:39:27,270
The audience doesn't seem
to be responding.

504
00:39:27,342 --> 00:39:29,572
They've seen a lot of tricks before,

505
00:39:29,644 --> 00:39:32,135
but not this next one.

506
00:39:41,189 --> 00:39:42,952
Cloth over.

507
00:39:43,024 --> 00:39:44,787
Keep your fingers crossed.

508
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:47,123
I'll have the champagne ready.

509
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,907
- You've seen this one before?
- We've seen them all before.

510
00:40:04,978 --> 00:40:07,105
I'll make it a little
harder then, shall I?

511
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,149
Two volunteers, please.
A lady and a gentlemen.

512
00:40:10,217 --> 00:40:13,414
To hold this cage with me.

513
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:15,455
I'll perform this feat in a manner

514
00:40:15,522 --> 00:40:20,050
never before seen by yourselves or any
other audience anywhere in the world.

515
00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:25,157
Madame, place one hand
on the back of the cage,

516
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:26,755
one hand on the front.

517
00:40:26,832 --> 00:40:29,198
Sir, one hand on the bottom of the cage

518
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:30,792
one hand on the top.

519
00:40:44,284 --> 00:40:47,185
- I should've spotted him.
- You had a lot of plates going.

520
00:40:47,254 --> 00:40:49,415
- Don't suppose we can do this again.
- No.

521
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,923
- So, what's the climax of our show?
- Show?

522
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:55,120
- You don't have a show.
- We have a week's engagement.

523
00:40:55,195 --> 00:40:58,790
To perform magic, not butcher birds
and break my customers' fingers.

524
00:40:58,865 --> 00:41:01,561
Clear out, anything here
in the morning gets burned.

525
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:04,068
- Mr. Merrit...
- It's done, John.

526
00:41:04,136 --> 00:41:06,934
I've hired a comedian.
You know I hate comedians.

527
00:41:09,074 --> 00:41:11,565
Well, there's
plenty of good theaters.

528
00:41:11,644 --> 00:41:14,477
If we can come up with a new trick,

529
00:41:14,547 --> 00:41:17,778
- change the name of the act.
- The name stays.

530
00:41:19,618 --> 00:41:24,749
Right, well, then the new trick's
gonna have to be irresistible then.

531
00:41:24,824 --> 00:41:26,849
I have a couple of methods to try out.

532
00:41:26,926 --> 00:41:30,157
And then we need a new angle
on the presentation.

533
00:41:30,229 --> 00:41:32,060
And if you need some inspiration,

534
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:35,294
there's a technical exposition
at the Albert Hall this week.

535
00:41:35,366 --> 00:41:38,096
Engineers, scientists, you know?

536
00:41:38,169 --> 00:41:41,468
That sort of thing captures
the public's imagination.

537
00:41:58,523 --> 00:42:01,924
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends
me down here during the storms.

538
00:42:01,993 --> 00:42:05,224
Perfect excuse to come join
the Great Danton for a drink.

539
00:42:06,197 --> 00:42:08,597
Two of them.

540
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:11,294
Beautiful, isn't it?
God, I miss New York, though.

541
00:42:11,368 --> 00:42:13,802
- Why are you here?
- The lightning lives here.

542
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:15,498
And not much else.

543
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:17,096
Our work is secret.

544
00:42:17,741 --> 00:42:19,641
That a cipher?

545
00:42:21,745 --> 00:42:24,873
A rotating transposition
that shifts every day of the diary.

546
00:42:24,948 --> 00:42:28,941
Simple but time-consuming to translate,
even with the five-letter keyword.

547
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:30,748
Which is?

548
00:42:30,821 --> 00:42:32,812
We magicians have a circle of trust.

549
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:36,986
You have a circle of trust
with someone whose diary you stole?

550
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,823
Maybe I bought it.

551
00:42:38,896 --> 00:42:41,626
And you're hoping to find
a great secret in there?

552
00:42:41,698 --> 00:42:43,996
I've already found it.

553
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:45,466
That's why I'm here.

554
00:42:51,674 --> 00:42:54,302
Tesla built one for another magician.

555
00:42:54,377 --> 00:42:56,140
Why would you want the same thing?

556
00:42:56,212 --> 00:42:58,203
Call it a professional rivalry.

557
00:42:58,281 --> 00:43:02,411
Mr. Tesla has built unusual
machines for unusual people.

558
00:43:03,419 --> 00:43:06,513
- But he would never talk about it.
- I understand discretion.

559
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:07,886
I just want the machine.

560
00:43:11,227 --> 00:43:12,888
Finish your drink.

561
00:43:13,863 --> 00:43:16,559
I want to show you something.
I think you'll have

562
00:43:16,632 --> 00:43:18,862
a special appreciation for our work.

563
00:43:18,935 --> 00:43:22,393
- I thought it was a secret.
- You're a magician.

564
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,199
Who's gonna believe you?

565
00:43:25,373 --> 00:43:27,568
Not long now.

566
00:43:27,642 --> 00:43:30,110
Our equipment requires
a great deal of current.

567
00:43:30,178 --> 00:43:31,907
Tesla electrified the whole town

568
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,040
in exchange for using the
generators when we need them.

569
00:43:36,251 --> 00:43:39,448
We do our tests when
the townspeople are asleep.

570
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:42,217
Mr. Tesla doesn't want
to scare anyone.

571
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,065
Where are the wires?

572
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:04,706
Exactly.

573
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:16,617
Where's the generator?

574
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,123
You saw it last week.

575
00:44:18,192 --> 00:44:21,286
- That must be ten miles from here.
- Fifteen.

576
00:44:21,362 --> 00:44:25,458
And I have to ride all of them
before I get to bed.

577
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:28,228
I'll send word for you
in a few days, Mr. Angier.

578
00:44:28,302 --> 00:44:32,398
<i>Magic. Real magic.</i>

579
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:34,600
Now appearing, only here
at London's Royal Albert Hall,

580
00:44:36,643 --> 00:44:38,941
one of the miracles of our age.

581
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:43,608
A technological marvel. You've never
seen anything like it in your lives.

582
00:44:43,683 --> 00:44:46,413
Your eyes will not believe
what they're witnessing.

583
00:44:46,486 --> 00:44:49,353
The miracle of Nikola Tesla,
ladies and gentlemen.

584
00:44:49,422 --> 00:44:51,913
Free, clean power.
Like to know the future?

585
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:55,051
The man who's speaking right now
is going to change the world.

586
00:44:55,128 --> 00:44:59,497
Come one, come all.
Immediate seating, no waiting.

587
00:45:14,613 --> 00:45:15,841
Ladies and gentlemen,

588
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,780
objections have been raised...

589
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:23,287
They should be raised.
Does that look safe to you?

590
00:45:23,355 --> 00:45:25,915
Part of Thomas Edison's smear campaign

591
00:45:25,991 --> 00:45:31,691
against Mr. Tesla's
superior alternating current.

592
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:34,596
We have asked Mr. Tesla
to reconsider.

593
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:37,157
Which he will not!

594
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:42,400
But I've been told he refuses
to appear under any such restrictions.

595
00:45:42,474 --> 00:45:45,034
This thing's gonna blow.

596
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:48,811
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

597
00:46:27,517 --> 00:46:28,643
Hey.

598
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:33,321
Hello, Jess.

599
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:39,592
Have you had a nice day
with mommy? Huh?

600
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,555
Sarah.

601
00:46:42,632 --> 00:46:45,533
- I love you.
- See, today it's true.

602
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:48,162
- Yeah.
- Hello.

603
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,439
<i>I saw happiness.</i>

604
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:55,137
<i>Happiness that should have been mine.</i>

605
00:46:55,211 --> 00:46:57,236
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

606
00:46:57,312 --> 00:47:01,942
<i>His notebook reveals that
he never had the life that I envied.</i>

607
00:47:02,017 --> 00:47:04,645
<i>The family life
that he craves one minute,</i>

608
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,020
<i>he rails against the next,
demanding freedom.</i>

609
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:12,083
<i>His mind... his mind is a divided one.</i>

610
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:13,594
<i>His soul is restless.</i>

611
00:47:13,662 --> 00:47:15,789
<i>His wife and child, tormented</i>

612
00:47:15,864 --> 00:47:19,823
<i>by his fickle and contradictory nature.</i>

613
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:26,530
So, what do you think you'll call her?

614
00:47:26,608 --> 00:47:27,973
I don't know.

615
00:47:28,043 --> 00:47:30,341
Everybody needs a name, so, what's hers?

616
00:47:31,245 --> 00:47:33,042
Maybe Sarah.

617
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:37,816
That's a lovely name.
That's a lovely name.

618
00:47:37,885 --> 00:47:41,116
Well, you talk about what you want
to do for the rest of the day.

619
00:47:41,189 --> 00:47:43,054
All right, go on, you talk with her.

620
00:47:45,493 --> 00:47:49,759
Are they taking her away?

621
00:47:49,831 --> 00:47:51,731
To the workhouse?

622
00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:56,059
You keep talking.

623
00:47:58,773 --> 00:48:01,173
Tell Owens I've reconsidered. Take it.

624
00:48:01,242 --> 00:48:03,039
Go on, take it.

625
00:48:06,614 --> 00:48:08,741
It's for the best.

626
00:48:13,553 --> 00:48:16,147
Let me see.

627
00:48:16,223 --> 00:48:18,851
I'm gonna learn
all the professor's secrets.

628
00:48:18,925 --> 00:48:22,361
Only if I teach you how to read.

629
00:48:22,429 --> 00:48:24,795
They're just stupid tricks, right?

630
00:48:24,865 --> 00:48:28,096
Haven't helped you
get out of here, have they?

631
00:48:28,168 --> 00:48:31,501
Or can't you undo real locks, professor?

632
00:48:32,873 --> 00:48:35,535
Maybe I'm just biding my time.

633
00:48:35,609 --> 00:48:38,100
Maybe one day I'll...

634
00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:40,806
...open my hand, get your attention,

635
00:48:40,881 --> 00:48:43,782
ask, "Are you watching closely?"

636
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:45,942
Maybe a magic whirl or two.

637
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:50,385
And then I'll be gone.

638
00:48:53,993 --> 00:48:57,053
How'd you get so famous then?

639
00:48:57,963 --> 00:48:59,692
Magic.

640
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:05,034
Oi! Borden, get back here!

641
00:49:05,104 --> 00:49:06,662
Thank you.

642
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:08,707
Shut up!

643
00:49:12,011 --> 00:49:14,104
Where's the bloody key?!

644
00:49:20,718 --> 00:49:23,186
<i>February 8, 1899.</i>

645
00:49:23,254 --> 00:49:25,381
<i>Today, finally, a breakthrough.</i>

646
00:49:25,456 --> 00:49:28,186
<i>Tesla's agreed to see me.</i>

647
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:37,094
Perfectly safe.

648
00:49:58,622 --> 00:50:02,388
So this is the Great Danton.

649
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:07,055
Mr. Alley has effused about your act
to me on any number of occasions.

650
00:50:08,899 --> 00:50:10,457
Hold out other hand.

651
00:50:19,042 --> 00:50:22,842
- What's conducting the electricity?
- Our bodies, Mr. Angier.

652
00:50:22,913 --> 00:50:27,111
Quite capable of conducting
and, indeed, producing energy.

653
00:50:28,652 --> 00:50:30,711
Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?

654
00:50:32,621 --> 00:50:35,784
I need something impossible.

655
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,327
You're familiar with the phrase,
"Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

656
00:50:42,398 --> 00:50:44,093
Is a lie.

657
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,191
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

658
00:50:47,403 --> 00:50:50,270
Society only tolerates
one change at a time.

659
00:50:51,741 --> 00:50:55,006
First time I tried to change the world,

660
00:50:55,077 --> 00:50:56,840
I was hailed as a visionary.

661
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:59,473
Second time...

662
00:50:59,548 --> 00:51:02,574
...I was asked politely to retire.

663
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:07,246
So here I am, enjoying my retirement.

664
00:51:07,322 --> 00:51:11,190
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.
What you want is simply expensive.

665
00:51:11,259 --> 00:51:13,489
If I were to build for you this machine,

666
00:51:13,561 --> 00:51:16,621
you would be presenting it
merely as illusion?

667
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:20,031
Well, if people actually
believed the things I did on stage,

668
00:51:20,101 --> 00:51:22,501
they wouldn't clap, they'd scream.

669
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,561
Think of sawing a woman in half.

670
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:26,971
Have you considered the cost of this?

671
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,976
Price is not an object.

672
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:33,003
Perhaps not, but have you
considered the cost?

673
00:51:33,982 --> 00:51:35,313
I'm not sure I follow.

674
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,215
Go home, forget this thing.

675
00:51:38,286 --> 00:51:40,481
I can recognize an obsession.

676
00:51:40,554 --> 00:51:44,581
- No good will come of it.
- Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

677
00:51:44,658 --> 00:51:47,889
At first, but I have
followed them too long.

678
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:49,895
I am their slave.

679
00:51:49,963 --> 00:51:53,057
And one day,
they will choose to destroy me.

680
00:51:54,868 --> 00:51:59,305
If you understand an obsession, then
you know you won't change my mind.

681
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,229
So be it.

682
00:52:02,743 --> 00:52:04,074
Will you build it?

683
00:52:05,045 --> 00:52:08,606
I've already begun
to build it, Mr. Angier.

684
00:52:08,682 --> 00:52:12,675
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.
This will take some time.

685
00:52:36,609 --> 00:52:39,305
Uh... I thought you'd gone.

686
00:52:40,446 --> 00:52:42,914
I don't really have anywhere to go.

687
00:52:44,884 --> 00:52:46,784
You've been sleeping here?

688
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:51,586
Cutter said it'd be all right till we
get another booking. What are you doing?

689
00:52:51,656 --> 00:52:53,886
Uh... research.

690
00:52:53,959 --> 00:52:55,392
Part of a magician's job

691
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:58,327
is to... watch his competition,
see what illusions...

692
00:52:58,396 --> 00:53:01,331
You're going to do something
to that man, aren't you?

693
00:53:01,399 --> 00:53:03,264
Cutter's hoping you let things lie.

694
00:53:03,335 --> 00:53:06,202
He says if Borden thinks
things are even between you...

695
00:53:06,271 --> 00:53:08,102
Even?

696
00:53:08,173 --> 00:53:10,733
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

697
00:53:10,809 --> 00:53:13,903
He has a family now
and he's performing again.

698
00:53:13,979 --> 00:53:16,812
Borden is out there living
his life just as he intended,

699
00:53:16,882 --> 00:53:19,578
as if nothing had happened
and look at me.

700
00:53:19,651 --> 00:53:22,142
I'm alone and no theater will touch me.

701
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,812
Us.

702
00:53:23,889 --> 00:53:26,255
You're going to need a better disguise.

703
00:53:43,774 --> 00:53:45,969
I need a volunteer.

704
00:53:46,043 --> 00:53:47,510
What happened?

705
00:53:48,512 --> 00:53:50,343
Did you hurt him?

706
00:53:52,249 --> 00:53:53,546
What happened, Robert?

707
00:53:55,953 --> 00:53:59,912
You, sir. Just a rubber ball, yes?

708
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,082
Thank you.

709
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:03,752
Just a rubber ball? No.

710
00:54:03,826 --> 00:54:07,023
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

711
00:54:07,096 --> 00:54:08,222
It's magic.

712
00:54:09,032 --> 00:54:11,091
He had a new trick.

713
00:54:25,114 --> 00:54:26,672
Was it good?

714
00:54:31,054 --> 00:54:35,013
It was the greatest
magic trick I've ever seen.

715
00:54:38,927 --> 00:54:41,054
Did they applaud
when you saw it?

716
00:54:41,129 --> 00:54:44,997
It was too good. It was too simple.
The audience hardly had time to see it.

717
00:54:45,067 --> 00:54:47,934
- He's a dreadful magician.
- A wonderful magician.

718
00:54:48,003 --> 00:54:50,528
He's a dreadful showman.
He doesn't dress it up,

719
00:54:50,606 --> 00:54:52,437
- how to sell it.
- How does he do it?

720
00:54:52,507 --> 00:54:54,532
- He uses a double.
- No, it's too simple.

721
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:56,100
This is a complex illusion.

722
00:54:56,178 --> 00:54:58,578
You say that because
you don't know the method.

723
00:54:58,647 --> 00:55:01,047
It's a double that comes out.
It's the only way.

724
00:55:01,116 --> 00:55:05,018
I've seen him perform it three times.
The prestige is the same man.

725
00:55:05,087 --> 00:55:08,614
- No, it's not.
- The same man comes out of the cabinet.

726
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:10,954
It's the same man.

727
00:55:11,026 --> 00:55:13,722
He wears padded gloves
to hide his damaged fingers,

728
00:55:13,794 --> 00:55:16,388
but, if you look closely, you can tell.

729
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:20,966
He doesn't know how to sell it
to an audience, but I do.

730
00:55:21,035 --> 00:55:23,469
Yeah, we could use it
as a climax to the show.

731
00:55:23,537 --> 00:55:25,937
Yes.

732
00:55:26,007 --> 00:55:29,204
The man stole my life,
I'm gonna steal his trick.

733
00:55:29,277 --> 00:55:31,438
We got to find someone
who looks like you.

734
00:55:31,512 --> 00:55:35,039
- He doesn't use a double.
- I don't know how Borden does it.

735
00:55:35,116 --> 00:55:39,610
Either... You either wait for him
to retire and buy the secret,

736
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:41,484
or you listen to how I would do it.

737
00:55:41,555 --> 00:55:44,080
And the only way
that I know how to do it

738
00:55:44,158 --> 00:55:46,626
is to find you a bloody good double.

739
00:55:47,628 --> 00:55:49,027
All right.

740
00:55:50,463 --> 00:55:52,954
Take a good look.
Let's get out there and find me.

741
00:55:53,033 --> 00:55:55,160
Whoo!

742
00:55:55,235 --> 00:55:56,725
Look, look.

743
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:02,798
What's that?

744
00:56:06,146 --> 00:56:08,444
- It's for you.
- What's this for?

745
00:56:09,082 --> 00:56:10,913
Come.

746
00:56:14,054 --> 00:56:15,817
You...

747
00:56:15,889 --> 00:56:19,916
- I asked you last week...
- You caught me in a wrong mood.

748
00:56:19,993 --> 00:56:22,188
- But you won't ever...
- Sarah,

749
00:56:22,262 --> 00:56:25,425
I'm gonna have
to change my mind, aren't I?

750
00:56:25,497 --> 00:56:30,161
The act is taking off. Soon we'll be in
a bigger theater, things will work out.

751
00:56:32,738 --> 00:56:36,538
I can't believe it. Thank you.
Thank you. It's beautiful.

752
00:56:43,182 --> 00:56:46,276
- Gerry?
- Darling, look at you.

753
00:56:46,352 --> 00:56:49,321
Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier,
I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

754
00:56:49,388 --> 00:56:51,549
Mm-hm.

755
00:56:54,393 --> 00:56:58,329
A pleasure. Pleasure
to meet you fine gentlemen.

756
00:56:58,397 --> 00:57:02,128
Would you like for me
to tell you a little joke? Come here.

757
00:57:05,169 --> 00:57:08,263
Yes. Are you laughing now?

758
00:57:11,709 --> 00:57:13,336
I have to take a piss.

759
00:57:14,746 --> 00:57:17,840
- He's out of his mind.
- Of course, he's an out-of-work actor.

760
00:57:17,915 --> 00:57:19,815
He's perfect. He needs a little help.

761
00:57:19,884 --> 00:57:22,853
But when I get done with him,
he could be your brother.

762
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,514
I don't need him to be my
brother, I need him to be me.

763
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,285
Give me a month.

764
00:57:34,065 --> 00:57:36,693
So you open the door...

765
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,234
...and...

766
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:47,372
Come on.

767
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:53,015
Couldn't you have found a softer one?

768
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:55,415
Well, it's not for sleeping on.

769
00:57:55,485 --> 00:57:57,544
So, if you come down through there...

770
00:58:00,223 --> 00:58:03,249
- ...does Root go up through there?
- Yep.

771
00:58:03,326 --> 00:58:05,385
It's going to be amazing.

772
00:58:05,462 --> 00:58:08,920
Well, it has to be. Borden's
trick is getting noticed.

773
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:14,133
The place was packed today.

774
00:58:15,738 --> 00:58:17,535
You went and saw his show again.

775
00:58:17,606 --> 00:58:20,040
Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?

776
00:58:28,417 --> 00:58:30,749
All I have to do is
keep myself stinking drunk,

777
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,152
and no one will be able
to tell the difference.

778
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:35,315
Have a little faith, sir.

779
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:39,293
Now, would you favor us
with a performance, Mr. Root?

780
00:59:00,048 --> 00:59:04,212
You'd drink, too, if you knew
the world half as well as I do.

781
00:59:07,922 --> 00:59:09,617
Did you think you were unique?

782
00:59:09,691 --> 00:59:12,387
I've been Caesar, I've played Faust.

783
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,554
How difficult could it possibly
be to play the Great Danton?

784
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:18,758
You can go back to being
yourself now, Root, for nothing.

785
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:21,097
I'd rather be him for now.

786
00:59:21,169 --> 00:59:23,933
I find it, uh... amusing.

787
00:59:27,374 --> 00:59:29,103
"My liege,

788
00:59:29,176 --> 00:59:32,509
I did deny no prisoners."

789
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:34,740
- You look wonderful.
- Oh, thank you.

790
00:59:34,815 --> 00:59:38,080
Root has to keep a low profile.
Anyone sees him, the game's up.

791
00:59:38,151 --> 00:59:40,949
I don't know how you do things.
I'm not sure I wanna know.

792
00:59:41,021 --> 00:59:43,353
Have you thought what we should call it?

793
00:59:43,423 --> 00:59:47,587
There's no point being coy. Borden
calls his trick The Transported Man.

794
00:59:51,498 --> 00:59:54,661
Ladies and gentlemen, much
of what you've seen may be termed

795
00:59:54,735 --> 00:59:58,501
as illusions or entertaining trifles.

796
01:00:03,175 --> 01:00:04,233
Alas...

797
01:00:06,412 --> 01:00:08,937
...I cannot claim
this next feat as illusion.

798
01:00:09,849 --> 01:00:11,043
Watch carefully.

799
01:00:12,485 --> 01:00:14,919
You will see no trickery,

800
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:18,081
for no trickery is employed.

801
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:21,524
Merely a technique familiar
to certain citizens of the Orient

802
01:00:21,594 --> 01:00:23,755
and various holy men of the Himalayas.

803
01:00:27,033 --> 01:00:30,059
Indeed, many of you may be
familiar with this technique,

804
01:00:30,136 --> 01:00:33,299
but for those of you who
are not, do not be alarmed.

805
01:00:33,372 --> 01:00:36,432
What you're about to see
is considered safe.

806
01:01:08,006 --> 01:01:11,066
To our achievement.

807
01:01:11,141 --> 01:01:13,905
The manager says he's
never seen a reaction like it.

808
01:01:14,094 --> 01:01:17,393
At least he saw it. I spent
the ovation hiding under the stage.

809
01:01:17,464 --> 01:01:19,796
No one cares about
the man who disappears.

810
01:01:19,866 --> 01:01:21,857
They care about the one who comes out.

811
01:01:21,935 --> 01:01:23,994
I care about the man in the box.

812
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:28,370
Thank you. I don't know,
maybe we could switch before the trick.

813
01:01:28,441 --> 01:01:30,602
I'm the prestige,
and Root's below stage.

814
01:01:30,677 --> 01:01:33,612
No, the anticipation
of the trick is everything.

815
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,740
We need your showmanship
to build up the suspense.

816
01:01:36,816 --> 01:01:40,377
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over.
He can't introduce this trick.

817
01:01:40,453 --> 01:01:43,183
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

818
01:01:43,256 --> 01:01:46,851
Root, you bloody fool,
get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

819
01:01:46,925 --> 01:01:49,587
Anyone could walk in here at any minute.

820
01:01:49,661 --> 01:01:51,720
Congratulations, all.

821
01:01:51,797 --> 01:01:55,494
Life is not full of these
moments. We worked hard.

822
01:01:55,567 --> 01:01:57,228
We need to celebrate properly.

823
01:02:00,973 --> 01:02:03,441
What's wrong? Is it your wife?

824
01:02:03,509 --> 01:02:05,807
No, it's the trick.
It isn't good enough.

825
01:02:05,878 --> 01:02:09,211
Borden's trick is nothing
compared to ours. He has no style.

826
01:02:09,281 --> 01:02:13,149
He doesn't spend the finale
hiding under the stage.

827
01:02:13,218 --> 01:02:16,119
- I need to know how he does it.
- Why?

828
01:02:16,188 --> 01:02:18,679
So I can do it better.

829
01:02:20,759 --> 01:02:23,227
I need you to go and work for him.

830
01:02:26,264 --> 01:02:27,993
Work for him? Are you joking?

831
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:30,461
You'll be my spy.

832
01:02:30,535 --> 01:02:32,730
We just got our start.
You want me to leave?

833
01:02:32,804 --> 01:02:34,897
That's how we advance. Think of it.

834
01:02:34,972 --> 01:02:38,169
People are excited by Cutter's
version. Imagine what we'd do

835
01:02:38,242 --> 01:02:42,679
with the real illusion. We'd have the
greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.

836
01:02:42,747 --> 01:02:46,513
- He knows I work for you.
- Exactly why he'll want to hire you.

837
01:02:46,584 --> 01:02:49,144
- He'll want my secret.
- Why would he trust me?

838
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:51,916
Because you're
gonna tell him the truth.

839
01:02:54,826 --> 01:02:56,657
Hmm?

840
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:05,327
Good girl.

841
01:03:08,505 --> 01:03:12,032
You must be curious to see what
so much money has bought you.

842
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:15,610
Fitting you should be here
for her maiden voyage.

843
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:17,510
Your hat.

844
01:03:25,455 --> 01:03:28,049
You might want to stand back.

845
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:49,636
I don't understand.

846
01:03:49,712 --> 01:03:52,044
Perhaps it would be best
if you left us to it.

847
01:03:52,114 --> 01:03:53,741
Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla?

848
01:03:53,816 --> 01:03:55,841
- No. Come back next week.
- Next week?

849
01:03:55,918 --> 01:03:58,478
- Next week, it will be fine.
- Tesla!

850
01:03:58,554 --> 01:04:00,283
Just a little temperamental.

851
01:04:06,128 --> 01:04:09,029
- Interesting workshop.
- Yeah, we make do.

852
01:04:09,097 --> 01:04:11,258
- My name is Olivia...
- I know who you are.

853
01:04:11,332 --> 01:04:12,993
Here to steal the rest of my show?

854
01:04:13,067 --> 01:04:14,967
To give your show what it's missing.

855
01:04:15,036 --> 01:04:18,267
- Yeah, what might that be?
- Me.

856
01:04:18,339 --> 01:04:22,799
I was just
saying that, wasn't I?

857
01:04:22,877 --> 01:04:25,175
- A woman's touch.
- I've left Angier.

858
01:04:25,246 --> 01:04:27,305
- All right.
- I want a job.

859
01:04:27,382 --> 01:04:28,713
Yeah.

860
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:30,614
I know you've no reason to trust me.

861
01:04:30,685 --> 01:04:32,243
Why wouldn't I trust you?

862
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:35,756
You're only the mistress of my
enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?

863
01:04:37,425 --> 01:04:39,359
- Mr. Borden.
- Alfred.

864
01:04:41,796 --> 01:04:43,457
I'm going to tell you the truth.

865
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:45,760
Now that is a slippery notion

866
01:04:45,832 --> 01:04:48,164
in our line of work,
isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?

867
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:52,932
I am here because he sent me here.

868
01:04:53,006 --> 01:04:55,474
He wants me to work for you
and steal your secret.

869
01:04:55,542 --> 01:04:58,909
What does he need my secret for?
His trick is topnotch.

870
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:01,573
He vanishes,
and then he reappears instantly

871
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:04,139
on the other side
of the stage, mute, overweight

872
01:05:04,217 --> 01:05:06,777
and, unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

873
01:05:06,853 --> 01:05:10,345
It's astonishing. How does
he do it? And tell me, Olivia,

874
01:05:10,424 --> 01:05:13,882
does he enjoy taking his bows
under the stage?

875
01:05:13,961 --> 01:05:17,260
It's killing him. He's obsessed
with discovering your methods.

876
01:05:17,331 --> 01:05:20,391
He thinks of nothing else,
takes no pleasure in our success.

877
01:05:20,466 --> 01:05:21,956
And I've had enough.

878
01:05:22,034 --> 01:05:24,434
There is no future with him.

879
01:05:25,571 --> 01:05:29,302
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've come to offer you his.

880
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:33,277
This is the truth... is it?

881
01:05:37,817 --> 01:05:40,115
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

882
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:44,213
Root, you're late and more drunk than
usual. Get down below stairs right away.

883
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:46,019
No.

884
01:05:46,092 --> 01:05:49,459
No, we need to have
a little chat, Mr. Cutter.

885
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:53,862
We have a problem. Cutter, Borden
is performing right across the street.

886
01:05:53,933 --> 01:05:57,198
Yeah, we have a bigger problem.

887
01:05:57,268 --> 01:06:00,260
Root. He's realized
that he can make demands.

888
01:06:00,338 --> 01:06:02,431
Wha...? He's blackmailing us?

889
01:06:02,507 --> 01:06:04,475
I was surprised, to tell you the truth.

890
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:07,136
It usually takes them
a lot longer to figure it out.

891
01:06:07,212 --> 01:06:09,772
- How much does he want?
- It makes no difference.

892
01:06:09,848 --> 01:06:13,306
- We've got to stop doing the trick.
- Stop the trick? Look at this.

893
01:06:13,385 --> 01:06:19,221
Last week they said you were
the premier stage performer in London.

894
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:22,657
Not magician, mind you.
Performer of any kind.

895
01:06:22,727 --> 01:06:25,958
- What's your point?
- My point is, you've climbed too high

896
01:06:26,031 --> 01:06:28,465
to get away with
professional embarrassment.

897
01:06:28,533 --> 01:06:31,900
We don't do any tricks we can't control.

898
01:06:34,071 --> 01:06:37,370
Just pay him for now. We keep
doing the trick until Borden opens,

899
01:06:37,441 --> 01:06:39,409
and then we'll phase it out.

900
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:41,800
All right.

901
01:06:44,581 --> 01:06:46,708
<i>Cutter was always surprised</i>

902
01:06:46,784 --> 01:06:48,684
<i>how fast Root turned bad.</i>

903
01:06:48,752 --> 01:06:53,314
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this rather welcome pint of ale?

904
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:56,518
- You're the Great Danton, aren't you?
- Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

905
01:06:56,593 --> 01:07:00,256
Of course I am, but don't advertise it,
because I'll be mobbed with fans.

906
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:02,764
<i>We paid him enough
to keep him in beers.</i>

907
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:04,926
<i>You wouldn't expect him
to rock the boat.</i>

908
01:07:05,002 --> 01:07:07,596
Many of you may be
familiar with this technique,

909
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:11,162
but for those of you
who aren't, do not be alarmed.

910
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,403
What you're about to see
is considered safe.

911
01:07:14,477 --> 01:07:18,106
- And who are you?
- I am a humble admirer

912
01:07:18,181 --> 01:07:20,775
and a fellow practitioner.

913
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:23,216
Mmm. Very good.

914
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:35,428
- Another one?
- Oh, if you insist.

915
01:07:35,498 --> 01:07:38,228
- Another.
- I'm not performing tonight.

916
01:07:38,301 --> 01:07:40,326
I'm only doing one show,
but to be frank,

917
01:07:40,403 --> 01:07:42,735
my people pretty much
run things these days.

918
01:07:42,804 --> 01:07:43,998
Get up there.

919
01:07:45,373 --> 01:07:46,431
Get up!

920
01:07:46,508 --> 01:07:49,272
Your illusion, The Transported Man,

921
01:07:49,344 --> 01:07:51,938
I'm not claiming to know your methods,

922
01:07:52,013 --> 01:07:56,211
but I had a similar trick in my act,

923
01:07:56,284 --> 01:07:59,117
and, uh... I used a double.

924
01:07:59,187 --> 01:08:04,386
- Mm, I see, very good.
- Well, it was, and then it went bad.

925
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:07,860
What I didn't count on was that
when I incorporated this bloke

926
01:08:07,929 --> 01:08:10,022
into my act,

927
01:08:10,098 --> 01:08:12,089
he had complete power over me.

928
01:08:13,235 --> 01:08:14,862
Complete power, you say?

929
01:08:30,851 --> 01:08:32,284
Ohh!

930
01:08:32,353 --> 01:08:37,620
Be very careful giving
someone that power over you.

931
01:08:37,691 --> 01:08:42,025
Huh. Thank you. Um...

932
01:08:42,096 --> 01:08:44,963
Yes, thank you for the warning.

933
01:08:45,032 --> 01:08:47,728
Hmm. Cheers.

934
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:51,297
I cannot claim
this next feat as illusion.

935
01:08:51,372 --> 01:08:54,739
What you're about to see
is considered safe.

936
01:08:59,045 --> 01:09:00,740
Ahh!

937
01:09:32,978 --> 01:09:37,938
Oh! The Great Danton.

938
01:09:44,156 --> 01:09:46,021
I apologize.

939
01:09:46,091 --> 01:09:49,857
There simply is too much magic...

940
01:09:49,928 --> 01:09:52,692
...for my stage at The Pantages

941
01:09:52,764 --> 01:09:54,925
across the street.

942
01:09:58,971 --> 01:10:01,906
Pardon my intrusion.

943
01:10:03,975 --> 01:10:08,378
And go easy on the poor chap.
He does try so very hard.

944
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:13,683
I don't know how Borden found him.

945
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:15,651
Kept him under wraps. I was careful.

946
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,381
Yeah, well, he did.

947
01:10:18,556 --> 01:10:20,547
Do you think it was her?

948
01:10:26,797 --> 01:10:29,766
You weren't expecting me?

949
01:10:29,834 --> 01:10:32,564
I expected you sooner.
Your message said afternoon.

950
01:10:32,637 --> 01:10:34,901
It takes a bit for me
to get around these days.

951
01:10:34,972 --> 01:10:39,033
He's taken everything from me.
My wife, my career,

952
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:40,974
- now you.
- You sent me.

953
01:10:41,044 --> 01:10:44,104
I sent you to steal his secret,
not to improve his act.

954
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:45,738
- It's my job.
- Or fall in love!

955
01:10:45,815 --> 01:10:48,579
- I did everything you asked!
- Yes? Yes?

956
01:10:48,652 --> 01:10:51,143
- How does he do it?
- Cutter was right, a double.

957
01:10:51,221 --> 01:10:53,451
- 'Course he said that.
- He didn't say it.

958
01:10:53,523 --> 01:10:56,959
I've seen things, makeup, glasses, wigs.
We don't use for the show.

959
01:10:57,027 --> 01:10:59,757
- I've seen it hidden backstage.
- Misdirection.

960
01:10:59,829 --> 01:11:02,525
He leaves them lying
around to make you think that.

961
01:11:02,599 --> 01:11:04,464
He doesn't know when I'm looking.

962
01:11:04,534 --> 01:11:07,765
All the time, Olivia! That's who he is!

963
01:11:07,837 --> 01:11:09,099
That's what it takes!

964
01:11:09,172 --> 01:11:11,606
He lives his act, don't you see?

965
01:11:13,643 --> 01:11:17,010
Just because you're sleeping
with him doesn't mean he trusts you.

966
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:19,479
You think you can see
everything, don't you?

967
01:11:19,548 --> 01:11:22,381
The Great Danton is a blind fool.

968
01:11:22,451 --> 01:11:23,850
His notebook.

969
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,484
You stole it?

970
01:11:27,556 --> 01:11:29,353
I borrowed it for tonight.

971
01:11:29,425 --> 01:11:31,620
I thought you could translate
some of it...

972
01:11:31,694 --> 01:11:35,755
I can't. No one can. It's a cipher.

973
01:11:35,831 --> 01:11:39,267
Even with the keyword,
it will take months to decode.

974
01:11:39,335 --> 01:11:42,236
- And without the keyword?
- Perhaps never.

975
01:11:42,304 --> 01:11:43,931
- We'll see.
- We will not see.

976
01:11:44,006 --> 01:11:46,941
If I don't get that back by
tomorrow he'll know I took it.

977
01:11:47,009 --> 01:11:49,307
- Leave him.
- I can't. He knows where I live.

978
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:55,446
This is his diary, Olivia. All of his
secrets are right here in my hands.

979
01:11:56,117 --> 01:11:57,709
It won't bring your wife back.

980
01:11:57,785 --> 01:12:00,481
I don't care about my wife.
I care about his secret.

981
01:12:13,735 --> 01:12:16,465
Look, I'll, um...

982
01:12:16,537 --> 01:12:18,869
I'll go to his workshop
and stage a break-in.

983
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:22,137
- He'll know you took it.
- Yes, me. Not you.

984
01:12:23,244 --> 01:12:25,235
Understand?

985
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:34,676
Robert.

986
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:39,888
I have fallen in love with him.

987
01:12:40,794 --> 01:12:43,262
Then I know how hard
this has been for you.

988
01:12:51,805 --> 01:12:53,295
Notebook?

989
01:12:55,942 --> 01:12:57,933
Then he's just getting started.

990
01:13:27,173 --> 01:13:28,640
Professor!

991
01:13:28,707 --> 01:13:30,197
Good evening.

992
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,707
I'm walking tonight.

993
01:13:36,782 --> 01:13:39,342
Let him come. I don't care.

994
01:13:39,417 --> 01:13:42,113
Professor! Professor!

995
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,933
Ahh!

996
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:08,562
- You all right?
- I'm alive.

997
01:15:08,638 --> 01:15:10,731
Saves me cutting you an air hole.

998
01:15:24,819 --> 01:15:27,379
- I'm impressed.
- Why is that?

999
01:15:27,455 --> 01:15:30,424
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

1000
01:15:30,492 --> 01:15:33,393
It's what a good trick costs, Angier.

1001
01:15:33,461 --> 01:15:36,259
Risk, sacrifice.

1002
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:38,822
The sacrifice, I'm afraid,
is all gonna be yours,

1003
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,527
unless you give me what I want.

1004
01:15:41,903 --> 01:15:44,030
- Which is?
- Your secret.

1005
01:15:44,105 --> 01:15:45,504
My secret?

1006
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:48,702
Your method for The Transported Man.

1007
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:51,610
Fallon wouldn't tell me.
He doesn't talk at all.

1008
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:55,172
- You have my notebook.
- Useless without the keyword.

1009
01:15:56,651 --> 01:16:00,212
Write down your method,
Mr. Borden, describe it in full.

1010
01:16:13,334 --> 01:16:15,700
I want the whole method,
not the keyword.

1011
01:16:15,769 --> 01:16:18,169
I don't know if your secret's
in your notebook.

1012
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:20,706
The keyword is the method.

1013
01:16:24,712 --> 01:16:26,009
<i>Where's my ingénieur?</i>

1014
01:16:33,153 --> 01:16:35,781
- Alive?
- How fast can you dig?

1015
01:16:38,257 --> 01:16:41,283
Fallon, you hear me? Fallon!

1016
01:16:42,595 --> 01:16:45,257
- How's the arm?
- Still attached.

1017
01:16:46,699 --> 01:16:48,257
Did you find your answer?

1018
01:16:48,334 --> 01:16:52,100
Our answer, Cutter. I haven't
looked yet. I wanted you to share this.

1019
01:16:52,171 --> 01:16:54,605
I already know how he does it, Robert.

1020
01:16:54,674 --> 01:16:57,768
Same way he always has,
the same way as we do.

1021
01:16:57,844 --> 01:17:00,312
It's just that you want something more.

1022
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:03,144
Well, let's find out then, shall we?

1023
01:17:07,453 --> 01:17:08,886
What does it mean?

1024
01:17:16,728 --> 01:17:19,196
It means, Cutter, we have
a journey ahead of us.

1025
01:17:19,264 --> 01:17:22,131
- To America.
- Robert?

1026
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,169
Listen to me.

1027
01:17:25,237 --> 01:17:28,695
Obsession is a young man's game.

1028
01:17:28,774 --> 01:17:30,298
Come on.

1029
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:32,843
I can't follow you any further in it.

1030
01:17:33,912 --> 01:17:35,846
I can't, I'm sorry.

1031
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:41,646
Then the rest is up to me.

1032
01:17:43,722 --> 01:17:45,246
I'm sorry.

1033
01:17:50,561 --> 01:17:54,156
Good evening. Hello, darling.

1034
01:17:54,231 --> 01:17:55,721
Champagne, your finest.

1035
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,496
I didn't know we were going
to be joined for dinner.

1036
01:17:58,569 --> 01:18:00,867
Absolutely, we are celebrating.

1037
01:18:00,938 --> 01:18:02,633
Miss Wenscombe, Mr. Fallon.

1038
01:18:03,641 --> 01:18:06,508
- What are we celebrating?
- We've hit upon a new trick.

1039
01:18:06,577 --> 01:18:08,636
- Haven't we?
- What trick, Freddie?

1040
01:18:08,713 --> 01:18:10,738
Yes, Freddie, what trick?

1041
01:18:10,815 --> 01:18:15,218
I am going to bury
myself alive every night,

1042
01:18:15,286 --> 01:18:19,154
and then someone will come along
and dig me up. Wonderful.

1043
01:18:19,223 --> 01:18:22,317
- I think he's had quite enough...
- No, pour the champagne.

1044
01:18:22,392 --> 01:18:26,089
Pour the... Sarah, don't talk to me
like that. I'm not a bloody child.

1045
01:18:26,162 --> 01:18:29,359
- Perhaps it would be better...
- Mr. Fallon, escort her home.

1046
01:18:29,432 --> 01:18:32,265
- My husband's being a bore.
- Oh, please.

1047
01:18:32,335 --> 01:18:36,135
- I see no reason you should suffer.
- Don't ruin this evening.

1048
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:41,442
Good night, Mrs. Borden.
Good night, Freddie.

1049
01:18:45,882 --> 01:18:48,180
- Freddie?
- That's my name.

1050
01:18:48,251 --> 01:18:51,618
- Not at home.
- I'm not always at home, am I?

1051
01:18:53,423 --> 01:18:56,085
Couldn't you have at least
taken off the beard?

1052
01:18:56,159 --> 01:19:00,323
Sarah, I just came from
the bloody theater just now.

1053
01:19:00,395 --> 01:19:03,455
All right? I'm out in public.
Everybody else loves it.

1054
01:19:03,532 --> 01:19:05,466
Why are you being like this?

1055
01:19:05,534 --> 01:19:08,435
I had a terrible ordeal today.

1056
01:19:08,504 --> 01:19:12,270
I thought that
something very precious...

1057
01:19:13,442 --> 01:19:15,376
...had been lost to me.

1058
01:19:15,444 --> 01:19:18,572
So I just wanted
to celebrate just a little.

1059
01:19:18,647 --> 01:19:22,105
All right, what? What did you lose?

1060
01:19:27,256 --> 01:19:28,814
I see, more secrets.

1061
01:19:29,758 --> 01:19:32,921
Sarah, secrets are my life.

1062
01:19:34,862 --> 01:19:38,127
- Our life.
- No, Alfred, stop, this isn't you.

1063
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:40,667
Stop performing.

1064
01:20:04,826 --> 01:20:07,317
I thought I had the place to myself.

1065
01:20:07,395 --> 01:20:10,694
Unexpected guests, not very polite.

1066
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,595
A lot of questions.

1067
01:20:12,666 --> 01:20:15,464
At first, I thought they
worked for the government.

1068
01:20:15,535 --> 01:20:19,198
- No?
- Worse, they work for Thomas Edison.

1069
01:20:21,174 --> 01:20:23,665
<i>Today, a most
curious development.</i>

1070
01:20:23,743 --> 01:20:26,803
<i>His assistant came to us
with a proposition.</i>

1071
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:31,849
<i>Obviously, Angier has sent her
and told her to admit as much.</i>

1072
01:20:31,918 --> 01:20:34,716
Does he enjoy taking
his bows under the stage?

1073
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:38,554
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've come to offer you his.

1074
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:41,594
This is the truth...

1075
01:20:41,661 --> 01:20:42,650
...is it?

1076
01:20:50,703 --> 01:20:54,161
No, that's what he told
me to tell you. The truth...

1077
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:58,074
...is that I loved him and I stood by
him and he sent me to you,

1078
01:20:58,143 --> 01:21:01,670
like he would send a stagehand
to pick up his shirts.

1079
01:21:01,747 --> 01:21:04,545
I hate him for that.

1080
01:21:04,617 --> 01:21:07,848
I could spot Angier's methods
from the back of the theater.

1081
01:21:09,555 --> 01:21:11,819
So, what could you
possibly have to offer me?

1082
01:21:11,891 --> 01:21:13,518
You may know his tricks,

1083
01:21:13,592 --> 01:21:16,652
but you can't understand why
no one sees yours are better.

1084
01:21:16,729 --> 01:21:19,289
You hide this.
I had to look very closely

1085
01:21:19,365 --> 01:21:21,697
to spot it
during The Transported Man,

1086
01:21:21,766 --> 01:21:24,599
but this makes you unique.

1087
01:21:24,669 --> 01:21:26,694
It shows you aren't using a double.

1088
01:21:26,771 --> 01:21:29,262
You mustn't hide it.
You must display it proudly.

1089
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:34,107
I'm sure it takes great skill
to perform illusions with one good hand.

1090
01:21:34,178 --> 01:21:35,941
Yeah, it does.

1091
01:21:37,715 --> 01:21:40,878
So let people know.

1092
01:21:40,952 --> 01:21:44,444
You can be so much more than
he is and I can show you how.

1093
01:21:46,157 --> 01:21:48,751
<i>I think
she's telling the truth.</i>

1094
01:21:48,826 --> 01:21:50,953
<i>I think we cannot trust her.</i>

1095
01:21:54,499 --> 01:21:56,967
<i>But I love her. I need her.</i>

1096
01:21:58,168 --> 01:22:01,501
<i>To open myself to such a relationship,</i>

1097
01:22:01,571 --> 01:22:05,405
<i>to the dangers of such an affair,</i>

1098
01:22:05,475 --> 01:22:10,276
<i>I need assurances of fidelity, of love.</i>

1099
01:22:11,315 --> 01:22:12,907
<i>But how to be sure?</i>

1100
01:22:15,118 --> 01:22:19,452
<i>I know a way. It's the only
way to know her mind.</i>

1101
01:22:19,523 --> 01:22:21,354
How could he send you away?

1102
01:22:23,226 --> 01:22:26,320
<i>She must help me
rid ourselves of Angier.</i>

1103
01:22:32,935 --> 01:22:35,927
<i>Today, my mistress
proves her truthfulness.</i>

1104
01:22:36,005 --> 01:22:37,734
<i>Not to me, you understand.</i>

1105
01:22:37,807 --> 01:22:40,435
<i>I've been
convinced since she led me to Root.</i>

1106
01:22:40,509 --> 01:22:44,036
<i>Today, Olivia proves her love for me</i>

1107
01:22:44,113 --> 01:22:46,581
<i>to you, Angier.</i>

1108
01:22:46,649 --> 01:22:51,052
<i>Yes, Angier, she gave you
this notebook at my request.</i>

1109
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:54,556
<i>And yes, "Tesla" is merely
the key to my dairy,</i>

1110
01:22:54,623 --> 01:22:57,421
<i>not to my trick.
You really think I'd part</i>

1111
01:22:57,493 --> 01:23:00,621
<i>with my secret so easily after so much?</i>

1112
01:23:00,696 --> 01:23:02,357
<i>Goodbye, Angier.</i>

1113
01:23:02,431 --> 01:23:04,797
<i>May you find solace
for your forward ambition</i>

1114
01:23:04,867 --> 01:23:06,664
<i>back in your American home.</i>

1115
01:23:16,177 --> 01:23:17,804
Tesla!

1116
01:23:19,748 --> 01:23:22,148
Tesla! Alley!

1117
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:24,340
Alley!

1118
01:23:24,419 --> 01:23:27,013
Tesla never made a machine
like the one I asked for.

1119
01:23:27,088 --> 01:23:29,886
- I never said he had.
- You let me believe that he had.

1120
01:23:29,958 --> 01:23:32,654
You stole my money because
your funding was cut off.

1121
01:23:32,727 --> 01:23:35,628
You've been shooting
sparks in my top hat,

1122
01:23:35,697 --> 01:23:39,189
laughing at me all along,
while using my money to stave off ruin.

1123
01:23:40,035 --> 01:23:42,162
- I have seen Edison's men.
- Where?

1124
01:23:42,236 --> 01:23:44,727
In the hotel, I have a mind
to bring them up here.

1125
01:23:44,805 --> 01:23:47,501
That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.

1126
01:23:47,574 --> 01:23:50,702
It is true that you are
our last remaining financier,

1127
01:23:50,778 --> 01:23:52,643
but we have not stolen your money.

1128
01:23:52,713 --> 01:23:54,180
This is my cat.

1129
01:23:54,248 --> 01:23:57,308
When I told you I could make you
a machine, I spoke a truth.

1130
01:23:57,384 --> 01:23:58,476
Why isn't it working?

1131
01:23:58,552 --> 01:24:00,884
Because exact science, Mr. Angier,

1132
01:24:00,954 --> 01:24:02,353
is not an exact science.

1133
01:24:02,423 --> 01:24:05,586
The machine simply
does not operate as expected.

1134
01:24:05,659 --> 01:24:09,686
- It requires further examination.
- So where did my top hat go?

1135
01:24:09,763 --> 01:24:10,821
Nowhere.

1136
01:24:10,898 --> 01:24:13,696
We tried the damn thing a dozen times.

1137
01:24:13,767 --> 01:24:15,394
The hat went nowhere.

1138
01:24:15,469 --> 01:24:17,369
We need to try different material.

1139
01:24:17,438 --> 01:24:19,599
It may provoke a different result.

1140
01:24:22,241 --> 01:24:23,799
Great.

1141
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:34,909
You are responsible for whatever
happens to this animal, doctor.

1142
01:24:56,441 --> 01:24:59,069
I hope whatever you were
really doing with my money

1143
01:24:59,144 --> 01:25:01,578
was more worthwhile, Mr. Tesla.

1144
01:25:57,501 --> 01:25:58,490
Alley!

1145
01:26:01,572 --> 01:26:03,301
So the machine was working?

1146
01:26:03,374 --> 01:26:07,003
I never checked the calibration,
'cause the hat never moved.

1147
01:26:07,076 --> 01:26:09,943
These things never quite
work as you expect them to.

1148
01:26:10,013 --> 01:26:12,504
That's one of the principal
beauties of science.

1149
01:26:12,582 --> 01:26:16,040
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out
the problems with the machine.

1150
01:26:16,119 --> 01:26:18,178
We'll send word when it's ready.

1151
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:23,359
Don't forget your hat.

1152
01:26:23,426 --> 01:26:27,157
- Well, which one is mine?
- They are all your hats.

1153
01:26:33,102 --> 01:26:36,094
You look so pretty
in this new dress of yours.

1154
01:26:36,172 --> 01:26:40,006
- Are we going to the zoo?
- No, Daddy has some errands to run.

1155
01:26:40,075 --> 01:26:42,305
- But you promised.
- I promised, did I?

1156
01:26:42,377 --> 01:26:44,675
Then go to the zoo, we shall.

1157
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:48,204
Daddy will go run his errands,
and I'll be back before you know it.

1158
01:26:48,283 --> 01:26:52,014
So you go get ready. We'll go
see those chimpanzees.

1159
01:26:55,023 --> 01:26:58,424
Sarah... what are you doing?

1160
01:27:02,097 --> 01:27:05,089
Each of us have our vices.

1161
01:27:08,203 --> 01:27:10,671
Sarah, whatever you may think...

1162
01:27:12,241 --> 01:27:15,870
...your only competition
for my affections is our little girl.

1163
01:27:15,943 --> 01:27:18,912
I love you. I will always love you

1164
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:20,413
and you alone.

1165
01:27:22,283 --> 01:27:26,083
- You mean it today.
- Absolutely.

1166
01:27:26,153 --> 01:27:29,987
Which makes it so much
harder when you don't.

1167
01:27:39,333 --> 01:27:42,131
More shopping. She does
love the smell of money.

1168
01:27:42,203 --> 01:27:46,503
The little lady wants to go to the zoo,
so I thought you could take her, yeah?

1169
01:27:46,574 --> 01:27:48,940
I mean, I can do it tomorrow, if not.

1170
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:52,309
And, uh... Sarah,

1171
01:27:52,379 --> 01:27:54,506
she knows.

1172
01:27:54,581 --> 01:27:58,745
Uh, at least she knows
that something is not right,

1173
01:27:58,818 --> 01:28:01,719
so if you can just do
whatever you can to help me.

1174
01:28:01,788 --> 01:28:06,350
Talk to her, just
convince her that I do love her.

1175
01:28:17,003 --> 01:28:18,971
What is it, Freddie?

1176
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:21,337
Listen, don't call me that, please.

1177
01:28:21,408 --> 01:28:25,276
It's nothing. It's just that
sometimes it seems wrong.

1178
01:28:25,345 --> 01:28:27,836
I told you, when you're
with me, you're with me.

1179
01:28:27,913 --> 01:28:30,939
Leave your family at home
where they belong.

1180
01:28:31,016 --> 01:28:34,281
I'm trying. I'm trying, Olivia.

1181
01:28:34,353 --> 01:28:36,719
- I'll get dressed.
- Yeah.

1182
01:28:38,223 --> 01:28:41,249
I saw Fallon hanging around again.

1183
01:28:41,327 --> 01:28:43,795
There's something about
that man I don't trust.

1184
01:28:43,862 --> 01:28:46,922
You trust me? Then trust Fallon.

1185
01:28:46,999 --> 01:28:49,661
He protects the things
that I care about.

1186
01:29:27,905 --> 01:29:30,396
We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.

1187
01:29:30,475 --> 01:29:33,035
We were sorry to see
Mr. Tesla leave, as well.

1188
01:29:33,111 --> 01:29:35,204
He's very good to Colorado Springs.

1189
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:37,941
Mr. Angier,

1190
01:29:38,014 --> 01:29:41,643
I didn't think it was necessary
to tell Edison's men about the box.

1191
01:29:41,718 --> 01:29:43,379
What box?

1192
01:30:08,712 --> 01:30:12,113
<i>I apologize for leaving
without saying goodbye.</i>

1193
01:30:12,182 --> 01:30:17,415
<i>But I seem to have outstayed
my welcome in Colorado.</i>

1194
01:30:17,486 --> 01:30:21,980
<i>The truly extraordinary is not
permitted in science and industry.</i>

1195
01:30:22,057 --> 01:30:24,855
<i>Perhaps you'll find
more luck in your field,</i>

1196
01:30:24,927 --> 01:30:27,589
<i>where people are happy to be mystified.</i>

1197
01:30:27,663 --> 01:30:31,622
<i>You will find what you
are looking for in this box.</i>

1198
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:36,137
<i>Alley has written you
a thorough set of instructions.</i>

1199
01:30:36,205 --> 01:30:40,938
<i>I add only one suggestion
on using the machine.</i>

1200
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:42,978
<i>Destroy it.</i>

1201
01:30:43,045 --> 01:30:46,344
<i>Drop it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean.</i>

1202
01:30:46,415 --> 01:30:49,816
<i>Such a thing will bring you only misery.</i>

1203
01:30:53,688 --> 01:30:57,317
<i>Tesla's warning is
as unheeded as he knew it would be.</i>

1204
01:30:57,392 --> 01:31:00,953
<i>Today I tested the machine.
Taking precautions in case</i>

1205
01:31:01,029 --> 01:31:03,998
<i>Tesla hadn't ironed out
the kinks in its operation.</i>

1206
01:31:04,065 --> 01:31:05,862
<i>But if it went wrong,</i>

1207
01:31:05,934 --> 01:31:08,095
<i>I would not want to live
like that for long.</i>

1208
01:31:27,554 --> 01:31:31,684
<i>But here at the turn,
I must leave you, Borden.</i>

1209
01:31:31,758 --> 01:31:33,988
<i>Yes, you, Borden,</i>

1210
01:31:34,061 --> 01:31:36,427
<i>sitting there in your cell,</i>

1211
01:31:36,497 --> 01:31:40,524
<i>reading my diary, awaiting your death,</i>

1212
01:31:40,601 --> 01:31:42,592
<i>for my murder.</i>

1213
01:31:47,941 --> 01:31:51,240
Angier's journal, that gesture
of good faith, that's a fake.

1214
01:31:51,311 --> 01:31:52,608
I assure you, it's not.

1215
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:55,614
The provenance of the journal
is clear and under no doubt.

1216
01:31:55,682 --> 01:32:00,176
And it's written in Angier's own hand,
for which we have numerous examples.

1217
01:32:02,054 --> 01:32:03,954
It don't matter.

1218
01:32:05,892 --> 01:32:07,917
So my tricks.

1219
01:32:11,163 --> 01:32:14,621
- All of them.
- Including The Transported Man?

1220
01:32:16,068 --> 01:32:19,265
- Lord Caldlow will be very pleased.
- No, he won't.

1221
01:32:19,338 --> 01:32:21,704
They're not complete.

1222
01:32:21,774 --> 01:32:24,504
It's just the pledge
and the turn for each.

1223
01:32:24,577 --> 01:32:28,638
Without the prestige for these
tricks, these are worthless.

1224
01:32:28,714 --> 01:32:30,739
Yeah.

1225
01:32:30,816 --> 01:32:34,343
You get the rest of it...
when you bring my daughter here.

1226
01:32:37,088 --> 01:32:39,318
I want to say goodbye.

1227
01:32:41,059 --> 01:32:44,222
We have to go through it now.
We have to go through it now.

1228
01:32:44,296 --> 01:32:46,662
Now, listen to me, deny it all you want.

1229
01:32:46,731 --> 01:32:49,097
Olivia means nothing.

1230
01:32:49,167 --> 01:32:50,964
- Olivia?
- I need an assistant.

1231
01:32:51,036 --> 01:32:53,869
- I'll go to her, I'll tell her.
- You'll tell her what?

1232
01:32:53,939 --> 01:32:55,998
I know what you really are, Alfred.

1233
01:32:58,109 --> 01:32:59,872
- I know.
- Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

1234
01:32:59,945 --> 01:33:02,573
- I can't keep it in.
- You can't talk like this.

1235
01:33:02,647 --> 01:33:05,172
- No. No.
- Sarah, shut up! Sarah, shut up!

1236
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:09,380
I don't want to hear it anymore.
You can't talk like this.

1237
01:33:11,989 --> 01:33:15,390
You can't hide it anymore,
because I know, Alfred, I know.

1238
01:33:15,459 --> 01:33:18,895
I know what you really are, Alfred.

1239
01:33:18,963 --> 01:33:21,761
I can't live like this.

1240
01:33:21,832 --> 01:33:23,959
Oh, well, you think
I can live like this?

1241
01:33:24,034 --> 01:33:27,197
You think I bloody enjoy
living like this?

1242
01:33:27,271 --> 01:33:31,674
We have this beautiful house,
lovely little girl, we're married.

1243
01:33:31,742 --> 01:33:33,403
What is so wrong with your life?

1244
01:33:33,477 --> 01:33:36,071
Alfred, I can't live like this!

1245
01:33:36,146 --> 01:33:38,512
Well, what do you want from me?

1246
01:33:41,852 --> 01:33:45,549
I... I want...

1247
01:33:45,623 --> 01:33:48,683
I want you to be... honest with me.

1248
01:33:51,427 --> 01:33:53,895
No tricks.

1249
01:33:53,963 --> 01:33:56,056
No lies.

1250
01:33:56,132 --> 01:33:59,932
And no secrets.

1251
01:34:06,209 --> 01:34:09,542
Do you... do you love me?

1252
01:34:12,615 --> 01:34:14,242
Not today.

1253
01:34:16,386 --> 01:34:17,444
No.

1254
01:35:55,115 --> 01:35:56,139
Who's there?

1255
01:35:59,285 --> 01:36:01,378
I'm looking for an old friend.

1256
01:36:01,454 --> 01:36:04,389
I heard about a booking,
nice little theater,

1257
01:36:04,457 --> 01:36:06,891
- good up-and-coming magician.
- You're back.

1258
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,552
It's good to see you, John.

1259
01:36:09,329 --> 01:36:12,059
Good rehearsal space.

1260
01:36:12,131 --> 01:36:14,895
Blind stagehands, I like it.

1261
01:36:14,967 --> 01:36:17,629
You always had a good eye for publicity.

1262
01:36:17,703 --> 01:36:19,034
I need your help, John.

1263
01:36:19,104 --> 01:36:21,902
It's my last show. A limited engagement.

1264
01:36:21,974 --> 01:36:23,601
Your last show?

1265
01:36:23,675 --> 01:36:27,805
A wise man once told me obsession
was a young man's game.

1266
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:31,441
I'm almost done. There's one thing left.

1267
01:36:32,451 --> 01:36:34,976
The Real Transported Man.

1268
01:36:36,789 --> 01:36:38,780
You want to design a show around it?

1269
01:36:38,857 --> 01:36:41,724
I don't want you backstage
I need you in front managing.

1270
01:36:41,794 --> 01:36:44,456
Call in any favors
or connections you have left

1271
01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:45,997
to get us the right booking.

1272
01:36:46,063 --> 01:36:48,156
What sort of booking you after?

1273
01:36:48,232 --> 01:36:50,632
The sort that Borden can't ignore.

1274
01:36:57,008 --> 01:37:00,239
Oh, what an honor it is
to see you again, sir.

1275
01:37:00,311 --> 01:37:04,270
You told me you only wanted to show me
one trick that'd pique my interest.

1276
01:37:04,348 --> 01:37:07,511
- It's a very clever trick.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman.

1277
01:37:07,585 --> 01:37:10,452
Likewise, I'm sure.
Let's get on, shall we?

1278
01:37:14,091 --> 01:37:15,854
Turn it on, gentlemen.

1279
01:37:21,097 --> 01:37:22,223
Very pretty.

1280
01:37:33,276 --> 01:37:36,939
That's it, Cutter? He simply disappears?

1281
01:37:37,013 --> 01:37:39,379
That's not a trick. He has to come back.

1282
01:37:39,449 --> 01:37:41,610
- There has to be a...
- A prestige?

1283
01:37:41,685 --> 01:37:42,674
Exactly.

1284
01:37:45,689 --> 01:37:48,351
Pardon me.

1285
01:37:48,425 --> 01:37:51,690
It's very rare to see...

1286
01:37:51,761 --> 01:37:53,228
...real magic.

1287
01:37:54,731 --> 01:37:56,426
It's been many years since...

1288
01:37:56,498 --> 01:37:58,227
Are you interested in helping us?

1289
01:38:00,302 --> 01:38:04,033
Yes... but you'll have
to dress it up a little.

1290
01:38:06,308 --> 01:38:07,969
Disguise it.

1291
01:38:09,645 --> 01:38:12,136
Give them enough reason to doubt it.

1292
01:38:12,948 --> 01:38:16,179
You haven't spoken
about her, Freddie, not once.

1293
01:38:16,252 --> 01:38:19,949
Why would I talk about her to you, hm?

1294
01:38:20,022 --> 01:38:23,890
Because she was a part of
your life and now she's gone.

1295
01:38:26,862 --> 01:38:31,356
You know, the day before she killed
herself she said she wanted to meet me.

1296
01:38:31,433 --> 01:38:34,368
That she had something
to tell me about you.

1297
01:38:34,435 --> 01:38:38,030
I was such a coward,
I couldn't bring myself to face her.

1298
01:38:38,106 --> 01:38:39,596
But...

1299
01:38:40,808 --> 01:38:43,072
...what would she have said?

1300
01:38:43,144 --> 01:38:46,238
You want to know the truth about me?

1301
01:38:47,515 --> 01:38:50,006
The truth is that...

1302
01:38:52,186 --> 01:38:54,177
...I never loved Sarah.

1303
01:38:55,390 --> 01:38:56,880
I never loved her.

1304
01:38:56,958 --> 01:38:59,188
You married her,
you had a child with her.

1305
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:02,354
Yes. Part of me. Part of me did, but...

1306
01:39:02,430 --> 01:39:04,364
...the other part didn't.

1307
01:39:04,432 --> 01:39:08,664
The part that found you,
the part that's sitting here right now.

1308
01:39:08,735 --> 01:39:11,795
I love you. No, Olivia, I love you.

1309
01:39:11,872 --> 01:39:13,840
That's the truth.

1310
01:39:13,907 --> 01:39:16,307
That is the truth that matters.

1311
01:39:16,376 --> 01:39:20,779
You could be in some other restaurant
with some other woman right now,

1312
01:39:20,847 --> 01:39:22,439
talking about me that way.

1313
01:39:22,516 --> 01:39:24,643
- No.
- Yes.

1314
01:39:28,088 --> 01:39:31,819
It's inhuman to be so cold.

1315
01:39:37,497 --> 01:39:38,759
He's back.

1316
01:39:39,666 --> 01:39:42,931
After two years, he's got a new trick.

1317
01:39:43,002 --> 01:39:45,664
They're saying it's
the best London's ever seen.

1318
01:39:47,873 --> 01:39:50,341
You should see the look
on your face, Professor.

1319
01:39:52,211 --> 01:39:54,145
You should go to him.

1320
01:39:54,213 --> 01:39:56,738
You two deserve each other.

1321
01:40:01,721 --> 01:40:05,657
But I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow
Ballet plays through next year.

1322
01:40:05,725 --> 01:40:10,287
Then get rid of them. There will be
100 performances, no more, no less.

1323
01:40:10,363 --> 01:40:12,854
Five performances a week, no matinees.

1324
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:17,693
That's what you'll
charge for each ticket. Good day.

1325
01:40:40,425 --> 01:40:45,055
Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of
the evening involves considerable risk.

1326
01:40:46,297 --> 01:40:47,662
Anyone in the audience

1327
01:40:47,732 --> 01:40:50,565
who would be irrevocably
damaged by seeing a man drown

1328
01:40:50,635 --> 01:40:52,227
should leave now.

1329
01:40:52,303 --> 01:40:55,101
When I tell you the lady
who taught me this illusion

1330
01:40:55,172 --> 01:40:57,163
actually died performing it,

1331
01:40:57,241 --> 01:41:00,540
you'll understand the seriousness
of the dangers involved.

1332
01:41:02,713 --> 01:41:05,113
Let's begin.

1333
01:41:14,825 --> 01:41:17,453
In my travels, I have seen the future.

1334
01:41:19,263 --> 01:41:22,858
And it is a strange future, indeed.

1335
01:41:22,933 --> 01:41:25,094
The world, ladies and gentlemen,

1336
01:41:25,169 --> 01:41:27,467
is on the brink of new

1337
01:41:27,538 --> 01:41:29,267
and terrifying possibilities.

1338
01:41:49,759 --> 01:41:53,217
What you're about to witness
is not magic.

1339
01:41:54,397 --> 01:41:55,796
It's purely science.

1340
01:41:55,865 --> 01:41:58,299
I'd like to invite you
to come up on stage now

1341
01:41:58,367 --> 01:42:01,359
so that you can examine
the machine for yourselves.

1342
01:42:56,657 --> 01:42:58,488
Man's reach

1343
01:42:58,559 --> 01:43:01,687
exceeds his imagination.

1344
01:43:12,973 --> 01:43:14,338
Bravo!

1345
01:43:22,382 --> 01:43:25,112
One hundred performances. Why?

1346
01:43:25,185 --> 01:43:26,743
Does his method dictate that?

1347
01:43:26,819 --> 01:43:28,719
Is it a publicity move? What is it?

1348
01:43:28,788 --> 01:43:31,154
He's a no-talent magician,
and they call him

1349
01:43:31,224 --> 01:43:33,624
the bloody best in England. Why?

1350
01:43:33,693 --> 01:43:36,457
Fifty yards in a second! In a second!

1351
01:43:36,529 --> 01:43:39,623
And all that we know
is he uses a trap door.

1352
01:43:39,699 --> 01:43:43,965
Brilliant! What is going on
under that stage? Huh?!

1353
01:43:44,037 --> 01:43:46,471
Why can't you out-think him?

1354
01:44:01,587 --> 01:44:06,786
They do this every night,
after each performance. Yeah?

1355
01:44:33,084 --> 01:44:34,415
Huh.

1356
01:44:35,286 --> 01:44:38,255
We're done.

1357
01:44:39,557 --> 01:44:41,115
All right?

1358
01:44:42,426 --> 01:44:44,189
Let him have his trick.

1359
01:44:44,262 --> 01:44:46,753
I don't need his secret.

1360
01:44:46,831 --> 01:44:48,321
So...

1361
01:44:49,834 --> 01:44:52,803
...don't go back there,
you leave him alone.

1362
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:56,135
Both of us... just leave him alone.

1363
01:44:56,207 --> 01:44:57,834
We're done.

1364
01:45:06,583 --> 01:45:08,642
I told you, John.

1365
01:45:08,718 --> 01:45:10,811
I don't want you backstage on this one.

1366
01:45:12,455 --> 01:45:14,855
I would like to
invite you onstage now

1367
01:45:14,924 --> 01:45:17,620
so that you can examine
the machine for yourselves.

1368
01:45:46,822 --> 01:45:50,553
- Hey, where do you think...?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

1369
01:45:59,568 --> 01:46:00,557
Who was that?

1370
01:46:57,124 --> 01:47:01,254
Hey! Where's the bloody key?!

1371
01:47:01,328 --> 01:47:02,886
Where's the bloody key?!

1372
01:47:05,332 --> 01:47:09,063
Where's the bloody key?!
He's bloody drowning!

1373
01:47:18,311 --> 01:47:19,300
Hold on!

1374
01:47:24,618 --> 01:47:26,085
What have you done?

1375
01:47:47,907 --> 01:47:53,345
Alfred Borden, you have been found
guilty of the murder of Robert Angier.

1376
01:47:53,412 --> 01:47:57,644
You will be hanged
by the neck until dead.

1377
01:47:57,716 --> 01:48:00,685
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

1378
01:48:02,454 --> 01:48:04,615
Mr. Cutter?

1379
01:48:04,689 --> 01:48:06,316
Owens.

1380
01:48:06,391 --> 01:48:09,224
Oh, thank you for coming, Mr. Owens.

1381
01:48:09,294 --> 01:48:13,663
It has fallen to me to dispose
of Mr. Angier's equipment.

1382
01:48:13,731 --> 01:48:15,323
But I notice from this manifest

1383
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:19,097
that Lord Caldlow has purchased
the bulk of the items.

1384
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:22,469
Mr. Cutter, if you need to know
where to deliver these items...

1385
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:26,135
No, it's just there is
one particular item,

1386
01:48:27,078 --> 01:48:29,672
this item, in fact,

1387
01:48:29,747 --> 01:48:32,011
- I would like to...
- You would like to...

1388
01:48:32,083 --> 01:48:33,175
...buy.

1389
01:48:33,251 --> 01:48:35,151
- Buy yourself?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

1390
01:48:36,387 --> 01:48:38,321
- This is the machine?
- Yes.

1391
01:48:38,388 --> 01:48:40,618
Well, I'm afraid
Lord Caldlow was adamant

1392
01:48:40,691 --> 01:48:42,921
about purchasing this particular item.

1393
01:48:42,993 --> 01:48:46,087
Do you think I could
talk to Lord Caldlow in person?

1394
01:48:46,163 --> 01:48:48,927
Out of the question, I'm afraid.

1395
01:48:51,368 --> 01:48:53,268
Of course,

1396
01:48:53,337 --> 01:48:56,568
I suppose if, in the course
of your delivery arrangements,

1397
01:48:56,640 --> 01:49:01,100
your paths were to cross,
I can't stop you speaking your mind.

1398
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:03,205
Thank you.

1399
01:49:04,781 --> 01:49:06,942
- Still here, Borden?
- For now.

1400
01:49:07,551 --> 01:49:10,520
You got a visitor. Lord Caldlow.

1401
01:49:10,587 --> 01:49:12,680
With a little girl.

1402
01:49:20,963 --> 01:49:22,863
Jess?

1403
01:49:22,932 --> 01:49:24,559
Hello, my love.

1404
01:49:24,634 --> 01:49:28,092
How are you? I've missed you so much.

1405
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:30,297
Fallon's missed you too. We both have.

1406
01:49:30,373 --> 01:49:32,705
Daddy, can I come in there?

1407
01:49:33,342 --> 01:49:35,970
Not right now. Not right now, darling.

1408
01:49:36,045 --> 01:49:38,309
No, but everything
is gonna be all right.

1409
01:49:39,882 --> 01:49:41,611
You must be Lord Caldlow?

1410
01:49:41,684 --> 01:49:45,415
Caldlow. Yes, I am. I always have been.

1411
01:49:50,458 --> 01:49:52,653
They flatter you with all those chains.

1412
01:49:52,727 --> 01:49:55,753
Don't they know you can't escape
without your rubber ball?

1413
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:58,822
I pulled you out... out of that tank.

1414
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:02,734
All I wanted to do was prove
that I was a better magician.

1415
01:50:02,804 --> 01:50:04,704
But you couldn't leave me alone.

1416
01:50:06,207 --> 01:50:08,300
I don't know what you've done.

1417
01:50:10,211 --> 01:50:13,908
But you're not afraid to get
your hands dirty anymore, are you?

1418
01:50:13,982 --> 01:50:17,247
No, not anymore. And I win.

1419
01:50:17,319 --> 01:50:20,652
No one cares about the man
in the box, the man who disappears.

1420
01:50:20,722 --> 01:50:21,848
You win?

1421
01:50:23,291 --> 01:50:27,955
This ain't a bloody competition
anymore. This is my little girl's life.

1422
01:50:28,028 --> 01:50:31,020
And don't you dare
put her in the middle of this.

1423
01:50:31,098 --> 01:50:34,090
Oh, I know how hard it is
to have someone so special

1424
01:50:34,168 --> 01:50:36,534
taken away from you, don't I, Borden?

1425
01:50:37,538 --> 01:50:40,268
And you can't take it
with you, now, can you?

1426
01:50:40,341 --> 01:50:42,241
Oh, she'll be looked after.

1427
01:50:42,309 --> 01:50:44,334
Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling.

1428
01:50:44,411 --> 01:50:46,174
No, no, no, no, stop, my darling.

1429
01:50:46,246 --> 01:50:48,373
Look, here.

1430
01:50:49,917 --> 01:50:53,182
That's what you're after.
That's what this is about.

1431
01:50:53,988 --> 01:50:55,353
Take it.

1432
01:50:55,422 --> 01:50:57,117
- Your secret?
- Yeah.

1433
01:51:00,326 --> 01:51:03,887
You always were the better magician.
We both know that.

1434
01:51:04,530 --> 01:51:07,124
Whatever your secret was,
you have to agree,

1435
01:51:08,267 --> 01:51:09,598
mine is better.

1436
01:51:11,304 --> 01:51:14,671
Don't do this. Don't do this,
Angier. Jess, Jess!

1437
01:51:14,741 --> 01:51:18,268
Jess, I'm gonna take you
home soon. I promise.

1438
01:51:18,344 --> 01:51:20,904
- For God's sake.
- I promise. Look!

1439
01:51:24,751 --> 01:51:28,346
I promise. I love you, Jess.

1440
01:51:28,421 --> 01:51:30,082
I love you.

1441
01:51:30,156 --> 01:51:31,783
- Come on.
- I love you.

1442
01:51:31,858 --> 01:51:33,553
I love you, Jess.

1443
01:51:33,626 --> 01:51:35,958
Angier! Angier!

1444
01:51:36,028 --> 01:51:38,121
What, do you think
this place can hold me?

1445
01:51:38,196 --> 01:51:41,222
Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me!

1446
01:51:41,299 --> 01:51:43,824
And you can put a stop to this now!

1447
01:51:44,469 --> 01:51:46,664
Listen! Listen! That man...

1448
01:51:46,738 --> 01:51:49,104
Listen, that man is
the one I'm in for killing!

1449
01:51:49,174 --> 01:51:53,508
Listen! If he's alive, I'm not guilty!

1450
01:51:53,578 --> 01:51:55,842
- I'm not guilty!
- I don't care!

1451
01:51:55,914 --> 01:51:58,007
- Get hold of him.
- Angier!

1452
01:52:02,688 --> 01:52:05,248
Run along now.

1453
01:52:05,323 --> 01:52:07,848
Sir, there's a gentleman waiting.

1454
01:52:24,675 --> 01:52:27,405
- Dear God.
- Hello, Cutter.

1455
01:52:28,379 --> 01:52:30,813
You're still alive.

1456
01:52:30,881 --> 01:52:32,746
How is it you're still alive?

1457
01:52:32,817 --> 01:52:35,217
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.

1458
01:52:38,222 --> 01:52:40,247
- Child.
- Good night, sir.

1459
01:52:40,324 --> 01:52:42,292
Good night, Jess.

1460
01:52:43,527 --> 01:52:45,188
I've seen her before.

1461
01:52:45,262 --> 01:52:47,787
I saw her in court with...

1462
01:52:48,732 --> 01:52:50,359
...Fallon.

1463
01:52:52,469 --> 01:52:55,063
- What have you done?
- She needs looking after.

1464
01:52:55,138 --> 01:52:57,629
She needs her father.

1465
01:52:57,707 --> 01:53:00,676
You're letting him hang,
and I helped you.

1466
01:53:00,744 --> 01:53:05,681
I came here to beg Lord Caldlow
to let me destroy that machine.

1467
01:53:07,150 --> 01:53:10,586
I am not going to beg you for anything.

1468
01:53:10,653 --> 01:53:13,918
You don't have to. I'm gonna
make sure it is never used again.

1469
01:53:15,058 --> 01:53:18,152
Then, Lord Caldlow...

1470
01:53:20,697 --> 01:53:22,756
...where do you want me to deliver it?

1471
01:53:22,831 --> 01:53:26,597
My theater. It belongs
with the prestige materials.

1472
01:53:27,069 --> 01:53:29,663
John, I tried not to involve you.

1473
01:53:42,618 --> 01:53:44,882
So...

1474
01:53:46,922 --> 01:53:49,516
We go alone now.

1475
01:53:49,591 --> 01:53:52,025
Both of us.

1476
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:58,231
I mean, I don't have
as far to go as you.

1477
01:54:03,538 --> 01:54:04,869
No.

1478
01:54:06,407 --> 01:54:09,467
You were right. I should have
left him to his damn trick.

1479
01:54:11,245 --> 01:54:13,338
I'm sorry.

1480
01:54:14,882 --> 01:54:17,214
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1481
01:54:18,352 --> 01:54:21,082
I'm sorry about Sarah.

1482
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:25,648
Didn't mean to hurt her, I didn't.

1483
01:54:27,528 --> 01:54:31,862
You go live your life in full now,
all right? You live for both of us.

1484
01:54:40,707 --> 01:54:42,197
Goodbye.

1485
01:55:27,987 --> 01:55:30,421
Are you watching closely?

1486
01:56:01,786 --> 01:56:03,720
Put it down on the end.

1487
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:40,886
Take a minute to consider
your achievement.

1488
01:56:41,959 --> 01:56:44,757
I once told you about a sailor

1489
01:56:44,828 --> 01:56:47,126
who described drowning to me.

1490
01:56:47,197 --> 01:56:49,392
Yes, he said it was like going home.

1491
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:54,266
I was lying. He said it was agony.

1492
01:57:34,009 --> 01:57:38,173
Alfred Borden, this day,
in the name of the king

1493
01:57:38,246 --> 01:57:40,237
and the High Court of England,

1494
01:57:40,315 --> 01:57:42,146
you will meet your end.

1495
01:57:44,252 --> 01:57:46,277
No one cares about the man in the box.

1496
01:57:51,126 --> 01:57:52,855
Cutter?

1497
01:57:57,532 --> 01:57:59,056
Cutter!

1498
01:58:00,935 --> 01:58:03,199
Do you have anything to say?

1499
01:58:07,941 --> 01:58:09,340
Abracadabra.

1500
01:58:45,978 --> 01:58:48,708
A brother? A twin?

1501
01:58:50,550 --> 01:58:52,916
You were Fallon.

1502
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:57,082
- The whole time?
- No.

1503
01:58:58,124 --> 01:59:00,456
We were both Fallon.

1504
01:59:00,526 --> 01:59:02,426
We were both Borden.

1505
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:10,769
Were you the one who went into the box?

1506
01:59:10,837 --> 01:59:12,532
Or the one who came back out?

1507
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:16,138
We took turns.

1508
01:59:20,946 --> 01:59:23,005
The trick is where we would swap.

1509
01:59:29,221 --> 01:59:31,121
Cutter knew. Cutter knew.

1510
01:59:31,189 --> 01:59:33,453
But I told him it was
too simple, too easy.

1511
01:59:34,659 --> 01:59:35,648
No.

1512
01:59:37,195 --> 01:59:39,163
Simple, maybe, but not easy.

1513
01:59:39,231 --> 01:59:42,997
There's nothing easy
about two men sharing one life.

1514
01:59:48,673 --> 01:59:51,870
I don't understand,
how it can be bleeding again?

1515
01:59:55,346 --> 01:59:58,144
Wha... What about Olivia and your wife?

1516
01:59:59,150 --> 02:00:01,050
We each loved one of them.

1517
02:00:04,688 --> 02:00:07,418
I loved Sarah.

1518
02:00:07,491 --> 02:00:10,016
He loved Olivia.

1519
02:00:10,094 --> 02:00:12,528
We each had half of a full life,

1520
02:00:12,596 --> 02:00:15,588
really, which was enough for us...

1521
02:00:15,666 --> 02:00:16,655
...just.

1522
02:00:19,303 --> 02:00:21,032
But not for them.

1523
02:00:23,607 --> 02:00:25,837
See, sacrifice, Robert,

1524
02:00:25,910 --> 02:00:28,640
that's the price of a good trick.

1525
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:33,240
You wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

1526
02:00:36,519 --> 02:00:38,453
I've... I've made sacrifices.

1527
02:00:38,521 --> 02:00:40,489
- No.
- Yes.

1528
02:00:40,957 --> 02:00:44,051
It takes nothing
to steal another man's work.

1529
02:00:44,127 --> 02:00:46,891
Yeah, it takes everything.

1530
02:01:06,949 --> 02:01:09,076
No, no, wait, I'm not...

1531
02:01:15,757 --> 02:01:18,385
It took courage.

1532
02:01:20,395 --> 02:01:23,592
It took courage to climb
into that machine every night,

1533
02:01:24,399 --> 02:01:26,833
not knowing...

1534
02:01:26,902 --> 02:01:29,029
...if I'd be the man in the box...

1535
02:01:32,074 --> 02:01:33,336
...or in the prestige.

1536
02:01:34,676 --> 02:01:37,702
Do you want to see...

1537
02:01:37,779 --> 02:01:40,077
...what it cost me?

1538
02:01:40,147 --> 02:01:42,911
You didn't see where you are, did you?

1539
02:01:43,818 --> 02:01:46,218
Look. Look.

1540
02:01:47,321 --> 02:01:48,811
I don't care.

1541
02:01:53,527 --> 02:01:57,088
You went halfway around the world.

1542
02:01:57,164 --> 02:01:59,928
You spent a fortune.

1543
02:02:02,003 --> 02:02:04,528
You did terrible things.

1544
02:02:05,539 --> 02:02:08,007
Really terrible things, Robert.

1545
02:02:10,044 --> 02:02:11,534
And all for nothing.

1546
02:02:12,513 --> 02:02:13,707
For nothing?

1547
02:02:13,781 --> 02:02:15,112
Yeah.

1548
02:02:18,785 --> 02:02:21,413
You never understood...

1549
02:02:21,488 --> 02:02:23,479
...why we did this.

1550
02:02:26,593 --> 02:02:29,153
The audience knows the truth.

1551
02:02:30,297 --> 02:02:32,731
The world is simple.

1552
02:02:32,799 --> 02:02:34,528
It's miserable.

1553
02:02:34,601 --> 02:02:38,298
Solid... Solid all the way through.

1554
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:42,972
But if you could fool them,

1555
02:02:43,043 --> 02:02:45,204
even for a second...

1556
02:02:46,746 --> 02:02:49,146
...then you could make them wonder.

1557
02:02:50,283 --> 02:02:52,478
And then you...

1558
02:02:52,551 --> 02:02:54,781
Then you got to see something

1559
02:02:54,853 --> 02:02:56,514
very special.

1560
02:03:00,826 --> 02:03:03,351
You really don't know.

1561
02:03:06,432 --> 02:03:08,093
It was...

1562
02:03:09,168 --> 02:03:12,137
...it was the look on their faces.

1563
02:03:27,318 --> 02:03:32,153
<i>Every magic trick
consists of three parts, or acts.</i>

1564
02:03:35,593 --> 02:03:39,051
<i>The first part is called "the pledge."</i>

1565
02:03:39,130 --> 02:03:41,894
<i>The magician shows you
something ordinary.</i>

1566
02:03:43,034 --> 02:03:45,969
<i>The second act is called "the turn."</i>

1567
02:03:47,438 --> 02:03:50,305
<i>The magician takes
the ordinary something</i>

1568
02:03:50,375 --> 02:03:53,242
<i>and makes it into
something extraordinary.</i>

1569
02:03:54,579 --> 02:03:58,481
<i>But you wouldn't clap yet,
because making something disappear</i>

1570
02:03:58,549 --> 02:04:02,645
<i>isn't enough. You have to bring it back.</i>

1571
02:04:37,087 --> 02:04:39,521
<i>Now you're looking for the secret.</i>

1572
02:04:42,458 --> 02:04:46,189
<i>But you won't find it, because,
of course, you're not really looking.</i>

1573
02:04:49,298 --> 02:04:52,734
<i>You don't really want to work it out.</i>

1574
02:04:55,538 --> 02:04:57,836
<i>You want to be fooled.</i>
