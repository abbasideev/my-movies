It's my dog.

It's my dog.

(FAX MACHINE RINGING)
It's the big, bad dog.

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,500
Number one dog,
dog at the top.

14
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,125
Slow down, Fido.
We need to talk.

Vince.

Did you see those

00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,500
We hit that
demographic dead on.

18
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,041
Yeah, looking good.
Talk about what?
Us.

we're 24 hours away

No.
No? No? What do
you mean no?

23
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,458
Look, Nelson, we've been
killing ourselves with this.

What?

Forgot about my parents,
didn't you?

37
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,917
I can't make it.
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,041
Nelson, this is their
third trip to the city.

39
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,542
You could make an effort.

40
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,583
This is important to me.

41
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,834
This account is
very important to me.

42
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,417
Come on, it's Dr. Diggity.

43
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:58,750
It's practically
an American institution.

Dr. Diggity.

46
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,875
Do you know there are
actually people

47
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,583
who don't work
24 hours a day?

48
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:10,208
They stop, relax,
have lives.

49
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:17,041
I have a life, Angelica,
and I'm late for it.

50
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,250
Look, I'm not sure
I like the tagline anymore.

51
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,125
It's working too hard.
Needs to be deadpan.

52
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,834
I want to keep
playing with it.

53
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,625
Look, cut it out, man.
The copy's good.

54
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,333

don't fix it.

We want perfection.

58
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,959
What we want
is a check, Nelson.

59
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,000
Bonuses, promotions.
Man, you worry too much.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,750
I worry because
worrying about losing
keeps you winning.

61
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,333
Congrats, Nelson.
You got the ad age
for the Pelican spot.

62
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,708
Give that to me.
Give it, give it!

63
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,291
Look, it says "team."
I'm "team." God!

64
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,625
Morning, Mr. Moss.

65
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,834
Thanks.

Beatrice, I'll have the...
The tea.

67
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,625
Hey, did you hear
Edgar Price is coming
out of retirement?

68
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,917
Says he's tired of
being ripped off,

69
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:09,875
might as well get
back in the game,
rip himself off?

70
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,875
Edgar Price, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

71
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,291
He was the best.

72
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,250
Remember that Mercedes ad
about a trillion years ago?

73
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,834
The car just floating
in outer space,

74
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:19,667
come right at you,
boom! Genius.

75
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,667
Check this out.
What?

76
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,083
Balance.

77
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,208
How's my dream team?
Got it locked up?

78
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,458
Sure, Chief,
just finessing--

79
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,333
No, no, it's all
locked up, it's locked up.

80
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,959
It's minor, minor details.
Minor details.

81
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,583
See that?
Uh-huh.

82
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,166
Make it happen.
Right.

83
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,750
Red! Blood red!

84
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,708
I can't read this.
Is English her
second language?

85
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,583
I mean this is...
Hey, Nelson.

86
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,000
You're gonna love
these frames.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,166
I took your idea,
you know. I ran with it.

88
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,834
It's still you idea.
It's just better.

89
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:52,208
Client will love it.

Ethnic?

91
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,083
Give me a bonfire.
Make it 3/4.

92
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,208
More cleavage,
more dogs.

93
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,750
Nelson, I've got
three girls here.

94
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,708
Let's make this night.

95
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,333
Night? Night.

96
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,542
What's this? Porno?

97
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,708
Well, you said
you wanted edge.

98
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,375
I don't feel it.
There you are.

99
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,500
Blood red.
VINCE: Blood red.

100
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,250
Did you forget your
1:00 at the DMV?

101
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,875
Reschedule.

102
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,041
Beatrice, I don't have
time for this.

103
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,542
Wait until
the presentation's over.

104
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,375
If you don't renew today,

105
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,041
they will suspend
your license,

106
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,708
which means the next time
you get pulled over

107
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,333
they can throw you in jail.

108
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,583
And I bet you don't have
time for that, either.

109
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,291
Nobody beats
the DMV, Nelson,
not even you.

110
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,750
Bye-bye. I got it.

111
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,166
Yeah, yeah.
Gotta feel it.

112
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,125
Yeah, I'm feeling it.
Blood red.

113
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,458
Blood red! Let's go!
Let's bleed!

114
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,083
(BABY CRYING)

115
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,792
Thank you.

116
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,583
All right, they'll
be no talking,

117
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,750
eating, or drinking
during the test.

118
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,000
If your personal hygiene
becomes a distraction,

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,375
you'll be asked to leave.

120
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,083
Sorry.

121
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,959
If you need to use
the bathroom,

122
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,375
raise your hand.

123
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,417
Could you pass me
the Columbo, please?

124
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,333
Yeah, the salami.

125
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,458
Thanks.

126
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:40,959
PROCTOR: You cannot
take the test with you
to the bathroom.

127
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,041
If you do not come back
from the bathroom,

128
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,125
you cannot pass the test.

129
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,417
You may begin.

131
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,208
Oh, Christ.

132

Hey. Psst. Psst.

133
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,667
Number nine.
True or false?

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,333
Oh.

135
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,792
I'm not there yet.
Sorry.

136
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,542
But for 19--

137
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:42,750
Excuse me.

138

139
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:48,583
Bring your test papers
forward, please.

140
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,208
Me?

141
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,375
You.

143
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,208
Yes.

144
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,041
I really wasn't cheating.

145
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,417
I mean, why would I cheat
on a DMV test?

146
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,542
You may re-take
the test in 30 days.

(SNORTS)

148
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,959
That's a joke, right?

149
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,917
Thirty days? That's
a whole month.

150
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:32,917
Great.

151
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,708
Fine.

152
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,208

00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,125
Hey, did Ruben
tweak the music?

158
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,458
No, he's said it's fine.

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,333
Shit!

160
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,583
Cut him.
What?

161
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,959
Get Johnson McDonald.

162
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,500
Give him the sample.
Tell him--

163
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,542

lost your mind.

gotta do now--
Hey, Vince.

168
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,917
What?
What do you think
about this?

169
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,792
Barking mad for Dr. Diggity.

170

That sucks.

Congratulations.
You can read.

172
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,291
Call you back.
No, no, no--

173
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,667
Can I help you?

174
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:38,291
Hmm. Can you help me?

175
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:40,291
Yeah.

00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,667
I don't have
problems.

356
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:02,250
Ah. Now, see, that usually
is the first sign.

357
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,250
Of what?
Denial.

358
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,750
Denial.

359
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,708
First of all, I think
you work too much.

360
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:10,041
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

361
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,542
And what do you know
about work?

362
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:13,542
Plenty.

363
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:14,917
You admitted
you do nothing else

364
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,041
and it doesn't
make you happy,

365
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,583
so how's that
for screwy logic?

366
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,333
I admitted nothing.
I was silent.

367
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,917
No special interests,
no pets. You hate dogs.

368
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:24,375
Busted.

369
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,708
Actually, I do have
a pet, a fish.

370
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,542
A fish. Doesn't count.

371
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:30,792
Cold-blooded. Sorry.

372
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:34,083
Nope, you are
a walking case study.

373
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,291
Look at you.

374
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,625
You're a workaholic
at such an advanced stage

375
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,250
that your intimacy skills
have withered away

376
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,792
to almost nothing.

377
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,834
Left untreated, Nelson,

378
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,625
you could become
emotionally extinct.

379
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,583
Out of sheer
perverse curiosity,

380
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,583
how does a lunatic
like you help
a guy like me?

381
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,792
You live in a box.

382
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,041
I could lift the lid.

383
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,250
Let some light in.

384
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,083
Wow, that's deep.

385
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,750
I feel almost cured
just hearing it.

386
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,417
Well, if you want my help,

387
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:16,125
it will require
a commitment on your part.

388
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,959
You have to live with me
here for a month.

389
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,166
(LAUGHS)

390
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,417
No more, no less,

391
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:25,959
and no work allowed.

392
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,125
You don't even know me,

393
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,834
and you're inviting
me to move in?

394
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:33,667
Mmm-hmm.

395
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:36,959
And how's my girlfriend
supposed to feel
about that?

396
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:39,959
Girlfriend?

397
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,166
You don't have
a girlfriend.

398
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,291
I mean, it's something
that you feel.

399
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,625
There's something
very intimate

400
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,959
that a woman
leaves on a man

401
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,458
that you definitely
don't have.

402
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,834
Her name's Angelica.

403
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,000
Well, I feel sorry
for Angelica.

404
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:59,041
Great.

405
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,166
I'll relay that to her
when I leave,

406
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,000
which is, uh,
right about now.

407
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,792
October's almost over.

408
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,000
We can start midnight.

409
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,208
First of November.

410
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,542
If you're brave enough
to commit,

411
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:15,375
I will devote myself
entirely to you.

412
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,542
Brave enough,
but not stupid enough.

413
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,166
Now, listen up, Moonbeam.

414
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,750
Here's how it works.

415
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,834
No more harassment,
no more rides,

416
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,708
no more extortion.

417
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,000
Next time you come
into my building,

418
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,083
I really will
call the cops.

419
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,250
This is your brand
image, Mr. Leach.

420
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,458
We polled your
primary demographic.

421
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,583
You know what 89% said?

422
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,917
Boring. Safe.

423
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,333
We need to drop a bomb.

424
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,417
We don't want
hot dogs, safe.

425
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:08,834
What's in a hot dog?
Don't tell me.

426
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:10,041
I don't want to know.

427

They're dangerous.

429
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,542
What are we selling here?

430
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:18,041
We're selling temptation,

431
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:21,583
desire, animal instincts,

432
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,959
gluttony, sin.

433
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,250
We want to show man
as he really is...

434
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,417
A savage.

435
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:30,583
He needs fire.
He needs food.

436
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,792
He hunts and gathers.

437
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:33,250
What does he get?

438
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,458
He gets a hot dog.

439
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,083
We're pagans.
We love our rituals.

440
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,041
Our team hits the ball
out of the park.

441
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,917
We're screaming,
we're insane.
What do we want?

442
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,708
We want a hot dog!

443
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,583
Let's go straight
to your pre-teen
demographic.

444
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,458
Kids, the little angels.

445
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,583
They're not angels.
They're monsters!

446
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:53,917
We give them
a tuna sandwich.

447
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:56,083
They don't want
a tuna sandwich!

448
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,583
They want a hot dog!

449
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:02,375
We need women.
We've got the mothers.

450
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,583
We want the daughters.

451
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,333
Let's ask that
age-old question.

452
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,625
What does a woman
really want?

453
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,625
You know. I know.

454
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,917
She wants a hot dog.

455
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:18,333
We're hot-blooded.
We need sex.

456
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,875
We need a sinful,
dangerous food.

457
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,458
What is it?

458
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:24,959
It's a hot dog!

459
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:27,875
It's a hot dog!

It's a hot dog!

It's a hot dog.

462

Dr. Diggity.
It's a hot dog.

463
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:48,000
No.

464
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,375
(CHUCKLES) No?

465
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,583
What do you mean?

466
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,625
It's not for us.

you're making a mistake.

00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:18,917

I mean, you're
in big trouble.

478
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,375
Oh, no.

favorite hot dog, son.

too far, you little punk,

so I'm gonna tell you
what I really think
of your campaign.

486

This is cheap,
tasteless crap.

Well, that's funny.

calm down!

happened in there?

believe that asshole?

you're brilliant, Nelson.

one of these days

and we'd all burn.

about, burn?

what was at stake here?

dollars you just lost?

my agency's name
through the gutter.

this agency's got.

you a wreck!

Well, can I look at it?

Because I'm a vampire.

00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:50,875
(ERNIE WHIMPERS)
Hey, there, Ernie. Hi.

716
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:56,000
Ernie. Are you sad?
Do you miss your brother?

717
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,542
You'll stay with me
till we find you some
decent parents, okay?

718
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:00,917
Hey, by the way,

719
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:02,875
when do I get to meet
your parents?

720
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,208
My parents are dead.

721
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:09,041
I'm sorry.

722
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:11,500
Sara, I'm not amused.
I want my clothes back.

723
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,708
Now.

724
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,708
I told you.
I gave them away.

725
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:20,667
I promise
I'll never lie to you.

726
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:27,458
So...

727
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:32,250
Would you like
vegan sausage,
vegan bacon...

728
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,291
Yeah, well, that's
all we got now. Huh?

729
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:36,166
I make it with a lot
of vegan butter

730
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:38,458
so it gets really nice
and black and crispy.

731
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,375
But if you don't
like it that way,

732
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:41,917
I won't make it
that way, okay?

733
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:43,375
Hey, hey!

734
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,083
Three hours sleep last night.

735
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:50,041
Tried valerian root.
Melatonin.

736
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:51,708
The Shopping Channel.

737
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,708
You know what did
the trick in the end?
What?

738
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,250
Jimmy Cagney.

739
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,083
Public Enemy.

740
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,917
Violence as a tranquilizer,
how twisted is that?

741
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,166
Ah.

742
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:09,417
You're looking
very sexy today.

743
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,417
Yeah?
Yeah.

744
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:13,250
Wow.

745
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:18,208
I do believe that is
my favorite sweatshirt I see.

746
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:19,417
SARA: Mmm-hmm.

747
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,083
You must be November.

748
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:24,458
I must be November?

749
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:26,041
That's Nelson.

750
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:29,750
Hey, Nelson. Howdy.

751
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:31,750
I'm Chaz.

752
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,792
Hey.

753
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,417
You know what?

754
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:39,125
Keep the sweatshirt.
Looks better on you.

755
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:42,083
Is this some kind
of a communal, culty,

756
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,000
Squeaky-Charlie
type of deal?

757
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,291
That's very good.
He's very funny.

758
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:48,667
Much cooler
than October.

759
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:50,875
What a wanker he was.
All right, I gotta go.

760
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:52,667
Mmm.
Mmm.

761
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:55,125
I love you, baby.
I love you.

762
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,917
Are you sure
you don't want any food?

763
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:58,500
And get fat like you?
Ah.

764
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,792
See you around, Nelson.

765
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:03,959
NELSON: See ya.

766
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:10,291
I think I'll pull myself out
of monthly rotation
while I'm ahead.

767
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,458
What? Nelson.

768
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:17,166
Who the hell was
that? Your pimp?

769
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,291
Chaz?
Chaz lives downstairs.

770
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,041
We just look
after each other.

771
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:23,166
I think Chaz can
take care of himself.

772
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:25,000
He just needs
a good night's sleep.

773
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,166
Hello, sweetheart
how are you?

774
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:28,166
Hey, you guys.
Nelson, these are...

775
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:29,458
Sorry.

776
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:31,542
I was trying
to introduce you.

777
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:34,542
That's Al and Osiris.
They own that bookstore.

778
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:36,959
They used to be
really close friends
with Jack Kerouac.

779
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,375
I don't care.
I don't read.

780
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,834
Sara, can you spare
15 bucks?

781
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:42,333
Bruce, I just gave
you those clothes.

782
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,125
Why you gotta be
so greedy?

783
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,417
That's my shirt!
Those are my pants!

784
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:49,041
Hey! Hey!

785
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:51,000
SARA: Doesn't it
feel good to give?

786
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,959
Leave me alone!
No.

787
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:53,834
You November?

788
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,291
Where am I?

789
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:56,750
Boy, you guys
have to meet.

790
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,834
Nelson, this is Abner.
Abner, Nelson.

791
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:01,750
Abner's gonna set
a world record
one day, right?

792
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,417
Yeah.
What's today's project?

793
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,875
Standing on one leg.
You wanna time me?

794
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:08,583
I have to break
the current record
of 300 hours.

795
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:10,166
No.

796
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:11,750
Loser.

797
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,708
Get a life.

798
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,166
Good one. (LAUGHS)

799
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,250
You let a 10-year-old
wind you up?

800
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,458
Forget him.
What about you?

801
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:22,375
You sleep
with half the city,

802
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:25,041
get the whole
neighborhood involved.

803
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:27,208
What? You'd prefer
if I was a virgin?

804
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:28,917
Considering
the alternative, yes.

805
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:31,875
I'm yours.

806
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:34,583
All yours.

807
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,375
Look, Sara, you're great.

808
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:41,375
You're a very sexy,
smart, interesting,

809
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:44,625
somewhat unusual woman.
But we, uh...

810
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:48,250
I always think it's best
to clarify issues.

811
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,291
You are the most
egotistical man
I've ever met.

812
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:53,917
I am talking
about a month.

813
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:56,000
The truth is,
I don't have a month.

814
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,291
Time is money.

815
00:41:57,959 --> 00:41:59,458
(SIGHS)

816
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,458
Okay, this...
Let's just...

817
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:07,291
Just how long do you
think you can put

818
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,375
this big, fat lucrative
career of yours on hold?

819
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:10,959
(STUTTERS) Just...

820
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:13,542
God, what am I
talking about?

821
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:15,375
You don't,
you're are unemployed!

822
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:18,542
You don't have a job!
You got fired, Nelson.

823
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:20,625
You have nothing
to go back to.

824
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:24,291
You know, the more
I think about it,

825
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,000
this project of yours
feels like an excuse
to get laid.

826
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:39,834
Sara.
Sara, I'm sorry. I...

827
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:41,500
Sara, I didn't mean to...
I didn't think you'd...

828
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,834
I...

829
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:46,083
I just don't understand why
you're doing this is all.

830
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:51,834
I told you.
I have my reasons.

831
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,625
Still friends?

832
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,458
Only if you give me
what I want.

833
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:02,458
(CHUCKLES)

834
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,083
What?

835
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:05,625
Time.

836
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,166
All I can do is a day.

837
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:11,333
I'll take it.

838
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:12,875
Okay.

839
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:17,125
I'll take it.

840
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:20,500
Always a thrill to explore
new career possibilities.

841
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:23,542
How much do you
charge for this?

842
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:25,166
I don't do this
for the money.

843
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:26,959
Why do you do it?

844
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:28,458
Because I like it.

845
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:29,667
You can take 'em
off the leashes.

846
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:31,375
Come here. Oh, yes.

847
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,500
You're so excited, I know.

848
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,125
Yeah, go raise some hell.
Come here.

849
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,667
Don't tell your mom, okay?

850
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:38,000
You can let 'em go,
you know, Nelson.

851
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,166
Whoo!

852
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:43,333

(BARKING)

872
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:49,625
Yeah.

873
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:55,750
So, tell me.
When was the last time

874
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,208
you spent a whole day
outside?

875
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:02,917
When my parents
dragged me to Alcatraz

876
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:04,333
for the day
at the age of nine.

877
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:05,542
Wow.

878
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:09,083
Now you tell me
something.
Anything.

879
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:12,166
What was so enlightening
about what we did today?

880
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:13,834
Why is letting
some dogs go wild

881
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:16,417
a better way to live
than my way?

882
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:18,750
I mean, granted,
it was mildly amusing.

883
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,291
But I gotta tell you,
my third eye didn't open.

884
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:23,458
Well, these things
take time,

885
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:25,750
and you don't have time.

886
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,458
No, seriously, it's
a question of values.

887
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:30,834
Why is doing something
fundamentally trivial

888
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:34,291
better than living
a responsible life,

889
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:37,000
boring as that
might seem to you?

890
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,667
And who made you
the expert,
the doctor, the guru?

891
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:43,291

were laughing at him.

1069
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:35,083
You ever been laughed at?

1070
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:37,333
Okay. Cheating's bad.
I guess.

1071
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,458
You're a father
figure now.

1072
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:42,667
Get out of here,
father figure.
The kid just met me.

1073
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:44,291
Well, when you
don't know your dad
you're not that picky.

1074
00:56:46,542 --> 00:56:50,208
Look at that,
Nelson. That's life.

1075
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:54,166
It's just happening
around us all the time.

1076
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:56,917
I think that's
so beautiful.

1077
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:04,959
Tell me your
secret dream.

1078
00:57:04,959 --> 00:57:07,000
I'm not much
on that kind of thing.

1079
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,667
Oh, come on.
Everybody's got one.

1080
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:13,500
One they only tell
after a couple of drinks.

1081
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:15,458
Tell me.

1082
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,250
My father sold
door-to-door.

1083
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:23,792
Vacuum cleaners,
life insurance.

1084
00:57:23,792 --> 00:57:26,542
For a while,
he even sold plastic food.

1085
00:57:26,542 --> 00:57:29,500
We were, uh,
kind of the joke
of the neighborhood.

1086
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,500
And believe me,
the neighborhood

1087
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,834
was a pretty grim
joke itself.

1088
00:57:33,834 --> 00:57:35,500
Where'd you grow up?

1089
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,875
Here. I, uh...

1090
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:40,333
I still own
the house, but...
I never go there.

1091
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,583
Anyway, uh...

1092
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,875
Every night after dinner,
he would...

1093
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:51,917
Shut himself in the TV room

1094
00:57:51,917 --> 00:57:55,500
and listen to 45s.

1095
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,041
Bobby Darin, Perry Como,
Tony Bennett.

1096
00:58:00,959 --> 00:58:02,875
For a year or so...

1097
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,500
I desperately
wanted to be a singer.

1098
00:58:10,542 --> 00:58:12,583
'Cause you thought
it would make him happy?

1099
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:14,875
No, I...

1100
00:58:16,542 --> 00:58:18,208
I thought those guys...

1101
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:21,875
Were everything he wasn't.

1102
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,750
Successful, proud...

1103
00:58:27,917 --> 00:58:29,417
In control.

1104
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:34,166
I'd like to hear you sing.

1105
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:37,625
(CHUCKLES)
That will never happen.

1106
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:38,583
(LAUGHS)

1107
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:42,792
Come on. One day.

1108
00:58:42,792 --> 00:58:44,750
One day you'll
sing for me, right?

1109
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:47,875
WOMAN: What are we doing?

1110
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:52,083
The movie starts
in 10 minutes.
Maybe we should skip it.

1111
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:53,708
I'll get you
a cappuccino.

1112
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:56,083
God, if I can find
a cappuccino. Relax.

1113
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:03,208
I hope that I can
eat all this.

1114
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,375
VINCE: Oh, my God.

1115
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:09,000
Somebody went
domestic on me.

1116
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,959
Okay. Okay, wow.
No, I get it.
It all makes sense.

1117
00:59:12,959 --> 00:59:14,959
Mystery woman unveiled,

1118
00:59:14,959 --> 00:59:16,792
and what... Uh,
what is this place?

1119
00:59:16,792 --> 00:59:18,125
What kind of bohemian
backwater is...

1120
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:19,750
Do they read poetry here?

1121
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,500
Sara, Vince.
Vince, Sara.

1122
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,708
Hey.

1123
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:24,792
Very nice to meet you.

1124
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:28,375
I got to go.
Bye, Abner.

1125
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:30,750
Something I said?
Vince, the movie.

1126
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,125
Oh, that's my
good friend, um...

1127
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:34,917
Uh...

1128
00:59:34,917 --> 00:59:36,834
What, you can't
remember her name?

1129
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:38,625
Oh, she shouldn't care
if I remember her name

1130
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:41,000
as long as I remember
to pick up the check, right?

1131
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,834
That's incredible.

1132
00:59:42,834 --> 00:59:46,417
That is, I think,
the most astute
observation

1133
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:50,000
of female behavior
I've ever heard.

1134
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,500
She's funny.
You're funny. That's funny.

1135
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,500
This is my very good
friend Nelson,

1136
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,708
and his very good
friend, um...

1137
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:58,000
Uh... Tell me.

1138
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,625
Sara.
Sara.

1139
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:01,375
Hi. Lexy.
Hi, nice to meet you.

1140
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:03,041
Lexy, Sara. Sara, Lexy.

1141
01:00:03,041 --> 01:00:05,000
We all... We should
all go out sometime,

1142
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,333
get drunk and nasty.
What do you say?

1143
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:08,500
Hey, uh, quick order.
One cappuccino to go.

1144
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,625
Uh, quick answer.
No quick orders.

1145
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:12,333
Okay. Well, we love
this place.

1146
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:13,500
We'll be back every day.

1147
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,667
I got to go take care
of, uh, Lexy.

1148
01:00:14,667 --> 01:00:17,834
Remember the 17th,
you, me and God.

1149
01:00:17,834 --> 01:00:19,667
Sara, very nice
to meet you.

1150
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:22,250
It was an honor.

1151
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,291
Very entertaining.

1152
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:26,625
"God." Wow.

1153
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,291
We're going
to be late,

1154
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:31,125
and it's your fault.

1155
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:32,667
He's actually
a good guy, deep down.

1156
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:35,208
Somewhere.

1157
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:37,917
Yeah.

1158
01:00:37,917 --> 01:00:40,750
I just mean
the glibness...

1159
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,875
It kind of wears you out
after a while.

1160
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:46,333
(CHUCKLES)

1161
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:50,375
Do you trust him?

1162
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:53,750
Like friends do,
you know?

1163
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,208
Do you think he'll
be there for you?

1164
01:00:56,041 --> 01:00:57,166
When?

1165
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,542
Like a scary situation
or something.

1166
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:07,583
Well, you may
have noticed I...

1167
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:10,750
I don't put myself
in scary situations.

1168
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:11,917
(CHUCKLES)

1169
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:15,125
Hey, you know what?

1170
01:01:16,917 --> 01:01:19,083
Why don't we go see
that house
you grew up in?

1171
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:20,125
Wanna do that?

1172
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:25,291
That's not
too scary, is it?

1173
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:40,250
It's just a house.

1174
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:41,750
Come.

1175
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,667
(BOBBY DARIN SINGING)

1176
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:18,000
I've tried so hard
not to come back here.

1177
01:02:27,208 --> 01:02:28,667
Come here.

1178
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:30,250
(SINGING CONTINUES)

1179
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:37,708
Sorry.

1180
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,792
Ouch.
(SARA GIGGLES)

1181
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:46,083
Sara,

1182
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:48,000
I know I don't
know a lot of things,

1183
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,500
but, uh, I do know
how to slow dance.

1184
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:53,250
You're terrible.

01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:57,458
Here, here,
let me show you.

1187
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:03,834
Follow me.

1188
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:21,542
Aah!

1189
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:28,417
Whoa!

1190
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,875
Aah! Aah!

1191
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:35,291
Aah!

1192
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:36,834
Yes, one apple.

1193
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,667
Oh, no, no.
No pay, no pay.

1194
01:03:39,667 --> 01:03:42,041
You eat two.
You too skinny.

1195
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:43,708
I'm too skinny?
Yeah, yeah.

1196
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,542
Should be fat.
Much better.

1197
01:03:45,542 --> 01:03:47,583
Whoo!
Thank you.

1198
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:51,208
...the party,
and the sound,

1199
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:52,917
and everything.
I mean, I'm totally...

1200
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:56,875
It's just insane.

1201
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,959
I looked up your website
the other night.

1202
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,250
Your sister's pretty.

1203
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:03,083
Looks a lot like you.

1204
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:05,750
Yeah, well, it's not
my website anymore.

1205
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,583
It's not my anything
anymore.

1206
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:09,583
Why'd you quit?

1207
01:04:11,917 --> 01:04:14,625
It started out small
and then it got big.

1208
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:17,250
That's generally considered
a good thing in business.

1209
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:20,041
Yeah, well,
everything got big.

1210
01:04:20,917 --> 01:04:23,750
Egos. Lives. Desires.

1211
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:27,083
I didn't like
the big me.

1212
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:29,250
I wasn't very happy.

01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,083
You want to know
the most amazing
part of it all?

1214
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:35,875
What?

1215
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:39,417
I got out before
it got really big.

1216
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:41,500
Can you imagine that?

1217
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,458
No, I can't imagine you

1218
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:44,834

and millions of dollars.

1222
01:04:51,834 --> 01:04:53,500
It's hazelnut.
You don't like it?

01:04:54,417 --> 01:04:55,792
Honestly?

1224
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,458
It tastes like camel piss.

to the classics in future.

01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:00,625
Excuse me.

01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:02,000
Privacy.
Heard of it?

1228
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,417
Very impressive set of pecs
you got there, Nelson.

going dancing.

01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:33,083
No, the phone call.

1413
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:35,083
Who was that?

1414
01:12:35,792 --> 01:12:36,959
Her sister.

1415
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:43,417
It's a long story, and I am
not going to tell it.

1416
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:07,959
Hey!

1417
01:13:07,959 --> 01:13:09,834
I'm sorry
about what...

1418
01:13:09,834 --> 01:13:12,083
What happened down there.
That's okay.

1419
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:14,166
Gives me a little boost
to know that
you're not perfect.

1420
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:15,333
(CHUCKLES)

1421
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:16,750
Feeling better?

1422
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:18,500
Yeah, I'm fine.

1423
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,166
Chaz told me it was
your sister on the phone.

1424
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:23,959
Why does it upset you so much?

1425
01:13:29,625 --> 01:13:33,500
Remember talking about
getting naked? (CHUCKLES)

1426
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,625
Naked with Sara Deever.
I think that's a good time

1427
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:36,750
for that right now. Come on.

1428
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,875
Don't dodge me. Talk to me.
Come. No.

1429
01:13:38,875 --> 01:13:41,333
Come on. Come get naked
with me.
What happened?

1430
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,500
That's not fair.

1431
01:13:46,708 --> 01:13:48,166
You expect me to be
so honest,

1432
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:50,542
so forthcoming.

1433
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:54,500
I do.

1434
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:57,792
Because it's your month,
Nelson.

1435
01:13:58,542 --> 01:13:59,667
Not mine.

1436
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,625
Come on, you don't
want to hear about

1437
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:05,041
stupid family stuff.

1438
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,667
Don't be mad.

1439
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:10,834
Please.

1440
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,542
Please.

1441
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:15,000
Please.

1442
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,041
You're not feeling well,
are you?

1443
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:45,834
Maybe tomorrow
we'll get naked.

1444
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:47,583
And tonight,

1445
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:50,417
we'll wear PJs.

1446
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:53,375
(LAUGHS)

1447
01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:03,083
NELSON: Every woman I know
spends $200 on a haircut.

1448
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,417
You use a vacuum cleaner.

1449
01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:09,250
Quit trying
to change the subject.

1450
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:13,583
You made a commitment,
Nelson.

1451
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:14,959
Our time isn't over.

1452
01:15:15,917 --> 01:15:16,917
It's one meeting.

1453
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:21,458
Why is going to some pow-wow

1454
01:15:21,458 --> 01:15:24,333
with this slicko guy Vince
such a big deal?

1455
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:26,417
Because it's probably
the chance of a lifetime,

1456
01:15:26,417 --> 01:15:28,500
that's why.

1457
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,875
Well, if it's
a whole lifetime,

1458
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:32,625
why don't you just postpone it
for one more week.

1459
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:35,750
Sara, when Edgar Price
says he'll meet you,

1460
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:37,917
you don't say, "Wait,
how about next month?"

1461
01:15:37,917 --> 01:15:40,250
You say, "Thank you.
I'll be there."

1462
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,583
He's one of the greats.

1463
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:43,375
Where's my phone?

1464
01:15:44,917 --> 01:15:45,959
I hate it.

1465
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:49,417
SARA: Nelson!

1466
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:53,291
Nelson!

1467
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:57,375
Damn it!

1468
01:15:57,375 --> 01:15:59,333
VINCE: We can take
anything and just...

1469
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:01,125
Sell it, make it work.
Exactly.

1470
01:16:01,125 --> 01:16:03,625
I mean, we've done
very well with, uh,

1471
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:06,500
Pelican Beer.
Actually, I'm sure
you're aware of the ad...

1472
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,917
No, I wasn't.

1473
01:16:07,917 --> 01:16:10,834
It just actually won
the Ad Age award for that...
Oh, did you?

1474
01:16:10,834 --> 01:16:12,959
I think that was
last year's spot.

1475
01:16:12,959 --> 01:16:16,500
So, we have a symbiosis,
the two of us, as a team...

1476
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,333
We know a lot of guys

1477
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:20,333
who do this for the awards,
Mr. Price.

1478
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:22,291
Yeah, but that's not to say
that we don't get the awards.

1479
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:23,333
But still...

1480
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:26,458
We're not about the acclaim.

1481
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:29,333
Hand-holding
and dinners, or...

1482
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:31,000
Sending prostitutes
to the client.

1483
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,500
Prostitutes?

1484
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,041
Who, uh, who sends
prostitutes?

1485
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:35,458
Who doesn't?

1486
01:16:36,542 --> 01:16:37,792
We're about the work.

1487
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,375
If the work is great,

1488
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:41,625
it speaks for itself.

1489
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,000
That's all I need to know.

1490
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,125
But are you married?
Any kids?

1491
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:50,083
Oh, no, we've avoided
the family thing

1492
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:51,417
for quite some time.

1493
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:53,542
Uh, you know.
Most of our lives.

1494
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,375
Good. Because if you're
worried about

1495
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:57,542
quality of life
or paternity leave

1496
01:16:57,542 --> 01:16:59,959
or any of that other
New Age crap,

1497
01:16:59,959 --> 01:17:02,792
much as I like you,
we can stop right here.

1498
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:04,625
I want to be your
full-time commitment.

1499
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:07,500
I can do that.

1500
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,208
(SIGHS) We still had a whole
two weeks to go, you know?

1501
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,458
What's two weeks?

1502
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:13,083
You're gonna kick him out
in the end anyway. Good shot.

1503
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:14,083
Thanks.

1504
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:16,875
You know what
I should have done?

1505
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,166
I should have
locked him in there.

1506
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:20,708
I should have
tied him to the bed,

1507
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:21,750
that's what
I should have done.

1508
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:22,875
You mean, you didn't?

1509
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:26,667
Wouldn't have stopped him.

1510
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:27,583
You know, you can't
force people

1511
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:29,542
to do things they
don't want to do.

1512
01:17:29,542 --> 01:17:33,000
That's the whole point
of this thing, isn't it?

1513
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,875
Besides, I know guys
like Nelson.

1514
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,708
You might have bitten off
more than you can chew
this time.

1515
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:40,750
Oh!

1516
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:44,417
That's what I like about him.

1517
01:17:47,041 --> 01:17:49,750
It's also what scares
the living hell out of me.

1518
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:51,333
VINCE: Yeah,
just so you know,

1519
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,959
um, we've got a couple
of great clients

1520
01:17:53,959 --> 01:17:56,417
in our hip pockets,
plus some leads
on some new accounts.

1521
01:17:56,417 --> 01:17:58,750
So we come to you
fully loaded.

1522
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:01,041
You're not selling me
a car, Holland.

1523
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:03,208
And frankly, I'm not overly
impressed with you anyway,

1524
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:05,750
but your reputation
precedes you.

1525
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,542
And if I have
to take him to get you,

1526
01:18:07,917 --> 01:18:09,417
I will.

1527
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:12,000
So, here's my offer.

1528
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,083
It's good as long
as we're at this table.

1529
01:18:14,083 --> 01:18:15,250
Ow!
(CLATTERING)

1530
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:17,417
Oh, my, I'm so...

1531
01:18:17,417 --> 01:18:19,250
Sorry.
Excuse me.

1532
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:20,875
That's okay.

1533
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:21,959
Stop it.

1534
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:26,583
You know, sweetie...

1535
01:18:26,583 --> 01:18:28,417
We are what we do
in this world,

1536
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:30,250
and you're a waitress.

1537
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:32,792
All that requires
is that you bring the food

1538
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:35,291
and the drink
to and from the table

1539
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:36,667
without making a mess.

1540
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:37,667
That's it.

1541
01:18:38,417 --> 01:18:40,625
So, when you screw up

1542
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:43,250
something as incredibly
simple as that,

1543
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:45,458
it doesn't say a whole
hell of a lot about you,
does it?

1544
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:47,917
I'm... I'm sorry.

1545
01:18:49,959 --> 01:18:51,375
If you gave her
a penny for her thoughts,

1546
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:52,667
you'd get change.

1547
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:54,834
They ought to fire her.

1548
01:18:55,417 --> 01:18:57,667
I always say, a bad hire

1549
01:18:57,667 --> 01:19:00,291
strengthens
the competition's hand.

1550
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:03,542
A good general
feeds off his enemy.

1551
01:19:03,542 --> 01:19:05,959
Actually Sun Tzu
said that last line

1552
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:08,125
in The Art of War.

1553
01:19:09,125 --> 01:19:10,125
You're right, Nelson.

1554
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:12,500
You're very smart.

1555
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:27,166
Nelson...

1556
01:19:27,166 --> 01:19:28,291
Take a look, buddy.

1557
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:32,834
(CLEARS THROAT)

1558
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:38,959
Not interested.

1559
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:42,792
You don't like my offer?

1560
01:19:44,667 --> 01:19:46,458
It's not the offer
I don't like.

1561
01:19:47,834 --> 01:19:49,667
(SIGHS) It's you.

1562
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:52,667
(SCOFFS)

1563
01:19:54,417 --> 01:19:56,625
Nelson, wait... Nelson!

1564
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,250
You know what, I'm...
This is not...

1565
01:19:58,250 --> 01:19:59,500
I hope you can afford this.

1566
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,708
Uh...

1567
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:03,875
Shit.

1568
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,375
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1569
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:09,750
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1570
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:11,750
You just shit in God's face.
Do you realize that?

1571
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:13,375
If that's your God,
you're in big trouble.

1572
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:14,834
The guy's not for me.

1573
01:20:14,834 --> 01:20:16,583
He's not for you?
Well, he is you, man!

1574
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:17,917
You're cloned
from the same DNA.
What're you

1575
01:20:17,917 --> 01:20:19,166
talking about?
I am nothing like that man.

1576
01:20:19,166 --> 01:20:20,875
If I am, shoot me!
Well, where's the gun?
Shoot me!

1577
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:22,083
This is my career, too,
Nelson!

1578
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:23,542
You just blew it
in there!

1579
01:20:23,542 --> 01:20:26,208
What is going on, man?

1580
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:27,875
I know, I know what it is.
It's the girl, isn't it?

1581
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:29,166
Your mystery date.
The new mystery woman.

1582
01:20:29,166 --> 01:20:30,417
What's her name?

1583
01:20:30,417 --> 01:20:32,208
What's her...

treatments a year ago?

1765
01:30:52,708 --> 01:30:54,333
What about the pills?

1766
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:56,500
Ah. That just gets her
through the day.

1767
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:58,333
She's still trying
to beat it, you know.

1768
01:30:58,333 --> 01:30:59,917
She did it all
for a year.

1769
01:30:59,917 --> 01:31:02,083
No, nothin' worked.

Wouldn't that...
Yeah.

1773
01:31:09,041 --> 01:31:10,166
It's spread everywhere.

1774
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:19,417
How could she
get involved with me

1775
01:31:19,417 --> 01:31:20,875
and not tell me
she was sick?

She was thinking

1779
01:31:28,291 --> 01:31:29,417
you'd be the same
as all the others.

1780
01:31:30,542 --> 01:31:31,875
She'd dumped me
after a month.

1781
01:31:34,458 --> 01:31:35,834
You got to understand
something, Nelson.

1782
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:39,375
She's completely powerless.

1783
01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:40,875
But these rules,
you know, they...

1784
01:31:42,083 --> 01:31:43,708
They give her the illusion,

1785
01:31:43,708 --> 01:31:45,708
and dignity, of control.

1786
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,417
It's kept her alive.

1787
01:31:51,417 --> 01:31:53,542
The rift with her family.
That's what
it's about, then.

1788
01:31:54,291 --> 01:31:55,458
These rules.

1789
01:31:57,083 --> 01:31:58,250
Yeah.

1790
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:01,417
They couldn't handle it,
her family.

1791
01:32:01,417 --> 01:32:02,959
They wouldn't let go,
you know.

1792
01:32:02,959 --> 01:32:04,542
They kept tryin'
to run her disease.

1793
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:06,125
So she took off.

1794
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:07,792

if she couldn't
live a normal life,

1798
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:16,542
she was determined
to live an abnormal one

1799

just give up?

Are you listening
to anything I'm tellin' you?

She's not givin' up.
