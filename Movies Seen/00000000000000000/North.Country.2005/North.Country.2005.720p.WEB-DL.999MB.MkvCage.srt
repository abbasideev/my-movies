1
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:51,369
- <i>Lady, you sit in your nice house...</i>
- Karen.

2
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:56,706
<i>...clean floors, your bottled water,</i>
<i>your flowers on Valentine's Day...</i>

3
00:00:58,344 --> 00:00:59,968
<i>...and you think you're tough?</i>

4
00:01:02,181 --> 00:01:05,764
Wear my shoes. Tell me tough.

5
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:07,892
Work a day in the pit, tell me tough.

6
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:10,600
I'm sure we're all sufficiently impressed,
Mrs. Aimes.

7
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:12,101
There is no "Mrs." here.

8
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:39,835
- No. I didn't go to the police.
- What did you do?

9
00:01:40,386 --> 00:01:41,928
What I had to.

10
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:45,973
Karen, stop crying.
Sammy, let's go!

11
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:48,015
It's just gonna piss him off some more.

12
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:50,103
Look at my face.

13
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:54,849
Don't toss shoulders at me!
Sammy, goddamn it!

14
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:02,442
It's okay, it's okay. Okay, come on.

15
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:08,113
Come on, come on.
You can do it, baby.

16
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,124
There you go. Good girl.

17
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:14,292
Who's a good girl, huh?

18
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,496
We're not coming back, right?

19
00:05:02,796 --> 00:05:04,504
Come on.

20
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:14,298
Hey, Mom.

21
00:05:15,684 --> 00:05:17,807
- Oh, dear God.
- I'm fine, I'm okay.

22
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:19,259
Say hi to your grandkids.

23
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:23,305
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Look at you beauties.

24
00:05:23,484 --> 00:05:25,026
Hi, Grandma.

25
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:34,988
You working nights?

26
00:05:48,717 --> 00:05:50,295
So...

27
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,548
...he catch you with another man?

28
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:57,220
Is that why he laid hands on you?

29
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:00,803
You're really asking me that?

30
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:08,358
This wasn't the first time
you'd disappointed your father, was it?

31
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,316
Wasn't the first time
he disappointed me either.

32
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:16,197
How old were you
when you had your first child?

33
00:06:28,632 --> 00:06:29,960
Here you go.

34
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:35,717
Bobby Sharp!
I'm gonna beat you good.

35
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:37,763
Come on,
you wanna blow out of here?

36
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:43,224
Who is Sammy's father?

37
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:47,065
<i>I don't know who Sammy's father is.</i>

38
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:50,647
<i>Is that because you've had</i>
<i>so many sexual partners?</i>

39
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,676
The body of Christ.

40
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,805
The body of Christ.

41
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:06,134
The body of Christ.

42
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:42,049
Always was a beauty, your girl.

43
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:49,602
Boys, cut it out!

44
00:08:56,863 --> 00:09:00,363
Poor Alice. That girl has been nothing
but trouble for her since day one.

45
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:03,025
Got two kids with two
different fathers already.

46
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:05,112
- Heck of a shame.
- Those kids are just...

47
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:06,664
...gobbling up my crispy bars.

48
00:09:06,832 --> 00:09:08,374
Nobody makes them better.

49
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:11,792
I don't know what you put in those
things, but it just can't be legal.

50
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:15,083
Oh, yeah.
Everybody seems to like them.

51
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:22,506
Ah, probably on a bender
when he did it.

52
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:24,009
What I figured.

53
00:09:24,182 --> 00:09:29,140
So you take him out to the shed,
give him a talking to. They'll work it out.

54
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:33,771
I mean, hell, Beth left me a dozen times
before we worked out the kinks.

55
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:35,317
Did she?

56
00:09:38,155 --> 00:09:41,488
How did you first hear that Pearson
Taconite and Steel was hiring women?

57
00:09:41,908 --> 00:09:44,281
- Wanna lean back there?
- Okay.

58
00:09:47,998 --> 00:09:49,741
Oh, my... Glory?

59
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,624
Yeah?

60
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:56,420
No way. Josey? No way!

61
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:00,172
Look at you, all grown up.

62
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:02,751
Yeah, all grown up, washing hair.

63
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:04,887
And married? Who's the lucky?

64
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:06,883
Oh, jeez.

65
00:10:07,392 --> 00:10:09,219
Okay. Who's the unlucky?

66
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:11,268
Me, I suppose.

67
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:16,556
You're a crap storyteller.

68
00:10:16,735 --> 00:10:20,567
You left out the part where you tell all
his friends he likes to wear your panties.

69
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:24,737
How about I tell them the truth?
Beats his wife. Bad enough, ain't it?

70
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:30,039
- You weren't kidding. You're good.
- So I'm back living with my folks.

71
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:32,116
Only now I got
two more mouths to feed.

72
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:33,917
The mine's hiring, you know.

73
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:37,786
What do you even
do up there? You a secretary?

74
00:10:37,964 --> 00:10:40,040
No. I drive truck.

75
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:47,299
- You drive truck?
- Yours truly, first woman ever.

76
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,010
Now, isn't that a heck of a..?

77
00:10:50,227 --> 00:10:52,219
That's weird.

78
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:56,106
Money isn't weird,
I'll tell you that much.

79
00:10:57,609 --> 00:10:59,483
Going for gold.

80
00:11:02,364 --> 00:11:03,395
Oh!

81
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:08,528
Shouldn't have put down the beer.

82
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:12,784
Balance. Everybody knows, can't throw
darts without a beer in the other hand.

83
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:16,121
Would a soda work?

84
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:18,334
Nope. Dart knows.

85
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:21,253
That's why it's never
gonna be an Olympic event.

86
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:22,753
They don't allow drinking.

87
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:26,637
Why don't we buy the girls
another round and test the theory?

88
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:29,426
Maybe later. Okay?

89
00:11:31,685 --> 00:11:32,930
Jeez, Glory.

90
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:36,397
You come working up at the mine,
you gotta ignore that crap.

91
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,107
Who says I'm working at the mine?

92
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:41,192
Wouldn't you like to make the same
kind of money your dad does?

93
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:45,147
You wanna be a lesbian now?

94
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:48,361
I wanna be a lesbian.

95
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:53,495
How come I have to eat
if I'm not hungry?

96
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:56,038
Because people are starving in China.

97
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:57,620
People are starving right here.

98
00:11:58,378 --> 00:12:00,536
Clean plates, both of you.

99
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:08,176
I haven't made a decision yet.

100
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:10,553
But the mine pays six times
what I'm making now.

101
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:14,057
You have any idea how many accidents
there've been since this started?

102
00:12:14,227 --> 00:12:16,386
Somebody's gonna get killed
because of them women.

103
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:19,979
- I can't afford a place by washing hair.
- So you stay here.

104
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:24,563
She's a grown woman with kids.
She's not gonna be living with her folks.

105
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:34,491
All clear.

106
00:12:35,665 --> 00:12:38,370
- Clear of what?
- You're not pregnant.

107
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:39,919
I already told you that.

108
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:44,036
Well, company just wants to be sure
before they hire you.

109
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:45,626
It's to clean yourself with.

110
00:12:58,396 --> 00:13:01,848
You submitted to
the exam willingly, correct?

111
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:07,110
Yeah. I submitted.

112
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:11,605
Before your law firm hired you, they put
your feet up and look around your insides?

113
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,289
- I got you.
- You got me?

114
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:20,162
I'm gonna get you then.
I'm gonna get you then.

115
00:13:22,712 --> 00:13:24,788
Come here, baby.

116
00:13:30,053 --> 00:13:31,844
Hey, Jo.

117
00:13:32,806 --> 00:13:34,964
What are you doing here, Wayne?

118
00:13:35,976 --> 00:13:38,301
Come to bring you back home.

119
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:41,304
Karen. In the house.

120
00:13:41,481 --> 00:13:43,604
Can't talk anymore.
Get in the... Come here!

121
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:45,690
Come by here
and think everything is okay?

122
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,271
- You know what?
- It's not okay.

123
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:49,023
- Get in the car!
- It's over!

124
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:51,569
So how about we let your
mom and dad talk in private?

125
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:55,110
- Get out of here!
- He's not my father.

126
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:07,914
He is your husband, you know.

127
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:14,007
He beat me, Mom.
More than once, more than lightly.

128
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:17,512
A man needs a job.

129
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:22,602
Wayne beat me because he was out
of work? That's what you're saying?

130
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:25,809
I'm just saying,
everyone needs a purpose.

131
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:28,439
Your purpose is those kids.

132
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:31,103
Your father's is that mine.

133
00:14:31,698 --> 00:14:33,987
And if you take a job up there...

134
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:37,658
Well, it'll shame him.

135
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,452
You should think about that.

136
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:59,007
Sammy, open the glove box. There's
a piece of paper on top of the pile.

137
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:04,267
Hold it on the dash, would you?

138
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:43,926
- Hey!
- Hey! Sorry about this.

139
00:15:44,104 --> 00:15:45,562
That's what guest rooms are for.

140
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,937
Come on, honey,
I'll show you where your room is.

141
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:49,732
- Hiya.
- This is Kyle.

142
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:51,443
Hiya.

143
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:54,440
Wow, look at this.

144
00:15:54,614 --> 00:15:58,065
All right. So all right, there's...
We're doing a little work.

145
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,076
- How long are they staying?
- I don't know. Just a little while.

146
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:04,038
No such thing, and you know it.

147
00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:05,998
Oh, come on.

148
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,827
She's kind of girlie to be a miner.

149
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,139
Okay, now, what are you?
Cowboy or a cowgirl?

150
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,726
- I'm a cowgirl.
- No, not up there, you're not.

151
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:30,139
Gotta get your cowboy on.

152
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:35,567
What's that all about?
I thought it was just your hand.

153
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:38,942
Yeah. That's the thing about arthritis.
It spreads like a nasty rumor.

154
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:45,820
You know they don't want us
up there. Right?

155
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,077
Yeah, I got that.

156
00:16:58,178 --> 00:17:00,170
<i>The mine is a shit pit.</i>

157
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:05,554
Dirt everywhere. Loud as all get-out.

158
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:08,185
You'll be hauling, lifting...

159
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:11,770
...driving and all sorts of other things
a woman shouldn't be doing...

160
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:16,484
...if you ask me, but Supreme Court
didn't ask me, did they?

161
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:21,274
You must be Hank's daughter.

162
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:23,990
You're late. Got your paperwork?

163
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:27,032
Yeah. Yes, sir. I got my consent form.

164
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:31,204
Yeah. The doc says you look darn good
under those clothes.

165
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:36,088
Sense of humor, ladies.

166
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:39,092
Rule-o <i>numero uno.</i>

167
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:43,379
Okay, grab your gear
and meet me outside.

168
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:44,967
We're gonna take a tour.

169
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:54,983
- What?
- What a homo!

170
00:17:57,904 --> 00:17:59,279
You know they do.

171
00:18:07,747 --> 00:18:09,574
Cunts.

172
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:12,245
Ear protection, ladies!

173
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,699
<i>Hank, I need a five-minute break.</i>

174
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:09,867
<i>You took a coffee break an hour ago.</i>

175
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:15,204
That's the point, Hank. She's been
drinking coffee like everyone else.

176
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,996
<i>Hey, Glory, are you talking</i>
<i>as a union rep...</i>

177
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:21,289
<i>...or just butting into anybody's</i>
<i>business as usual?</i>

178
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:24,465
All I'm saying is that you can
whip it out anytime, Hank.

179
00:20:24,634 --> 00:20:27,469
We gotta pull the coveralls
all the way down, you know?

180
00:20:27,637 --> 00:20:29,261
<i>We start peeing in our seats...</i>

181
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,301
<i>...I don't think the next shift's</i>
<i>gonna be too happy about it.</i>

182
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:36,259
You got another load to get.
So pull them up and go get it.

183
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:54,403
This down here is taconite.
That's what pays bills.

184
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:59,407
We've taken to calling this area
the Powder Room.

185
00:20:59,877 --> 00:21:01,206
Catchy, don't you think?

186
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:04,415
Especially since you girls
will be the ones cleaning it.

187
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:11,421
So. So, Arlen, which one of these girls
is gonna be my bitch?

188
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:14,221
Ladies, meet Bobby Sharp.

189
00:21:14,392 --> 00:21:17,179
He runs the Powder Room,
where they're short one body.

190
00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:20,930
And we want a nice body. No fatties.

191
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:27,109
Give me the one on the right.

192
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:34,443
Ladies.

193
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:48,800
Cock tease.

194
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:50,878
Fuck you.

195
00:21:59,145 --> 00:22:02,348
Fuck! You don't have to eat my face.

196
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:07,145
It's cool.

197
00:22:08,404 --> 00:22:10,776
Just take it easy.

198
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,493
Shit.

199
00:22:22,835 --> 00:22:25,505
You two just bought yourselves
a Saturday in my classroom.

200
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:27,583
Let's go.

201
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:31,050
Let's go, guys.

202
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,725
At least they spelled it right this time.

203
00:22:46,526 --> 00:22:47,806
So how'd it go?

204
00:22:47,985 --> 00:22:50,108
Good. Yeah.

205
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:53,648
Heard you were in the Powder Room
with that Bobby Sharp.

206
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:56,612
Weren't you two friends
in high school or something?

207
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:01,785
We were never friends.

208
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:05,377
You should get that checked out.

209
00:23:05,545 --> 00:23:08,878
My mom's got arthritis
and she never tapes her wrist up.

210
00:23:09,048 --> 00:23:11,124
You should look in that first.

211
00:23:16,722 --> 00:23:18,003
Ham and cheese.

212
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,472
What were you expecting?

213
00:23:21,644 --> 00:23:23,387
You never know in this place.

214
00:23:47,378 --> 00:23:49,038
Come on, let's sit with the girls.

215
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:04,010
Meet the ladies.

216
00:24:04,186 --> 00:24:06,594
Ladies, ladies. Josey Aimes.

217
00:24:06,772 --> 00:24:09,098
Oh, hey. Big Betty.
Pleased to meet you.

218
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:11,683
- Nice to meet you.
- There used to be two Bettys.

219
00:24:11,861 --> 00:24:13,521
- Big and Little. Little quit.
- Why?

220
00:24:13,696 --> 00:24:14,811
Too little.

221
00:24:16,782 --> 00:24:18,360
- I'm Peg.
- Hey, nice to meet you.

222
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:19,993
- Hey, you too.
- Hey.

223
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:21,785
- Guys.
- How you doing?

224
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:38,676
Hey! No getting off
in the lunchroom, ladies.

225
00:24:47,146 --> 00:24:51,607
Well, it won't leave the toilet seat up.
It won't fart in bed. I might just marry it.

226
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,779
Right?

227
00:24:55,947 --> 00:24:57,357
You don't mind, do you?

228
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:02,361
Okay, if there's nothing else,
I move to adjourn.

229
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:04,328
- There's one more thing.
- What's that?

230
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:06,536
- Porta-Johns.
- Here we go again.

231
00:25:07,124 --> 00:25:10,624
I got one girl with a bladder infection
from holding it in all day.

232
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:14,170
Maybe Pete over there likes sitting
in his own pee, but I don't.

233
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,634
Like it or not, I represent members
of this union who happen to be female.

234
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:21,757
All right.
Well, if we do get management...

235
00:25:21,931 --> 00:25:24,007
...to give you girls Porta-Johns...

236
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,393
...what are you gonna do for us?

237
00:25:27,895 --> 00:25:29,603
Didn't you hear, Pete?

238
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:33,564
Discount blowjobs,
for everybody but you.

239
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:43,659
Down here.

240
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:52,991
Found your way back?

241
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:55,702
I'm not retarded.

242
00:25:57,508 --> 00:25:59,133
Come on in.

243
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:03,546
Take a look at this.

244
00:26:03,723 --> 00:26:05,347
See that?

245
00:26:05,516 --> 00:26:10,558
It's a Hamilton.
It's about 60 years old.

246
00:26:12,064 --> 00:26:13,772
You mind if I go watch your TV?

247
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:16,896
No.

248
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:34,576
He's always in the basement with
his stupid watches. He's weird.

249
00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:37,079
He's not weird. He's nice.

250
00:26:37,256 --> 00:26:40,292
He used to work at Pearson
till he hurt his back or something.

251
00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:44,425
- Good morning.
- Morning. Table for four, please.

252
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:46,008
Right this way.

253
00:26:46,182 --> 00:26:47,640
Have you talked to Wayne yet?

254
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:52,427
No, Sammy,
I haven't talked to Wayne yet.

255
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:56,609
Maybe he'll call us tonight.

256
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:58,359
I don't think so, sweetheart.

257
00:26:58,527 --> 00:26:59,808
Why not?

258
00:26:59,987 --> 00:27:01,896
He's a little busy right now.

259
00:27:07,244 --> 00:27:11,408
I think you're one of my girls, right?

260
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:16,791
Pardon me, I'm Donald Pearson.
I believe you work for me.

261
00:27:17,213 --> 00:27:21,756
Wow. Yeah. Josey Aimes.
Nice to meet you.

262
00:27:21,926 --> 00:27:24,796
These are my kids, Sammy, Karen.

263
00:27:25,304 --> 00:27:30,262
Hi. I was down to the plant this week
and I remembered your face.

264
00:27:30,434 --> 00:27:31,632
Welcome aboard.

265
00:27:31,811 --> 00:27:34,895
If you have any problems,
you make sure you come and see me.

266
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:36,809
Thank you.

267
00:27:36,982 --> 00:27:38,393
Enjoy your meal.

268
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:40,477
Thanks.

269
00:27:42,446 --> 00:27:44,320
Oh, jeez, that's my boss.

270
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:48,568
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

271
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:54,497
Before we eat,
I wanna say something.

272
00:27:55,835 --> 00:27:59,667
This is our first time in a nice restaurant.
And I just think...

273
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,330
- Are you gonna cry?
- Can you mind your mouth?

274
00:28:07,346 --> 00:28:09,671
I know things have been hard.

275
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:12,472
But they're gonna get better, all right?

276
00:28:12,643 --> 00:28:15,644
- They're gonna change.
- I knew you were gonna cry.

277
00:28:18,274 --> 00:28:20,943
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you two, right?

278
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:43,664
Nice. She can put her hands
on the hose.

279
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,515
Come on, ladies!
Gotta appreciate the talent.

280
00:28:53,184 --> 00:28:55,057
It's a pretty good likeness, I'd say.

281
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:58,808
Hi, I'm Earl.
I don't think we've met yet.

282
00:29:00,107 --> 00:29:01,388
How about a cigarette, then?

283
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:05,399
- Go fuck yourself.
- Oh, be nice now, darling.

284
00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:07,564
Come on, how about the smoke?

285
00:29:08,824 --> 00:29:11,825
No, it's okay. I'll get it myself.

286
00:29:14,496 --> 00:29:17,070
- Come on, Earl.
- All right, fun's over.

287
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:21,742
Just trying to see if she's got
a full pack. She don't.

288
00:29:22,922 --> 00:29:24,250
You're okay.

289
00:29:24,423 --> 00:29:27,590
All right, back to work,
slacker, come on.

290
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,468
Boy Scout.

291
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,839
- You okay?
- Yeah.

292
00:29:36,727 --> 00:29:38,767
Do you even know
what's going on out there?

293
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:41,680
Sweetheart, this country's
elected a president...

294
00:29:41,857 --> 00:29:44,644
...who's letting the world flood
our market with cheap steel.

295
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:48,519
We're knee-deep in layoffs.
Mines are closing left and right.

296
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:52,606
What's this got to do with Earl
laying hands on Sherry like that?

297
00:29:52,785 --> 00:29:55,358
Are you hearing a word
of what I'm saying?

298
00:29:55,746 --> 00:29:57,988
You're taking jobs
where there aren't any to take.

299
00:29:58,457 --> 00:30:02,621
These boys aren't your friends.
I'm not your friend.

300
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,791
You got no business being here
and you damn well know it.

301
00:30:05,965 --> 00:30:08,420
But you're not hearing that, are you?

302
00:30:08,592 --> 00:30:10,799
So let's try something new.

303
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:16,426
How about: Work hard, keep your
mouth shut and take it like a man.

304
00:30:19,728 --> 00:30:21,638
All right.

305
00:30:22,273 --> 00:30:25,688
Maybe I'll go see Mr. Pearson.
He said come to him if I had a problem.

306
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:28,979
No, you don't see Pearson.
I see Pearson.

307
00:30:29,154 --> 00:30:32,155
You know? When you've got a real
problem, take it up with me...

308
00:30:32,324 --> 00:30:33,783
...and I'll be happy to help.

309
00:30:33,951 --> 00:30:35,659
All right?

310
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:54,220
You know, it's a shame that
this stuff is toxic as hell.

311
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:56,262
Otherwise, it would be good
to put a little...

312
00:30:58,183 --> 00:30:59,678
You know?

313
00:30:59,852 --> 00:31:02,390
You like a little Boy Scout love,
don't you?

314
00:31:03,939 --> 00:31:05,481
You know, the key is in the lube.

315
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:08,271
Otherwise, it's just a bunch
of squealing and moaning...

316
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:11,689
You should see your face, Josey.

317
00:31:11,864 --> 00:31:14,022
Why, you..?
Why, you think I'm serious?

318
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,400
I'm just fucking with you.
Where's your sense of humor?

319
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:25,043
Honey, you gotta
get a gator's skin on...

320
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,832
...you're gonna work in this stinkhole.

321
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:32,592
Just promise me something,
do not go to Arlen with this one.

322
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:35,170
Keep whining and moaning.

323
00:31:35,346 --> 00:31:37,552
We're doing the exact thing
they want us to do.

324
00:31:37,723 --> 00:31:42,136
Screw that. We can take
any crap they dish out, can't we?

325
00:31:46,231 --> 00:31:50,359
I just don't want them to have
any reason to get rid of you, is all.

326
00:31:52,321 --> 00:31:53,566
Glory?

327
00:31:55,949 --> 00:31:57,859
I don't know how
I'm ever gonna thank you.

328
00:31:58,077 --> 00:32:01,410
- Oh, what for?
- For this.

329
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:05,745
First time in my life
I'm making my own money.

330
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:08,244
I can feed my kids.

331
00:32:08,504 --> 00:32:10,710
I'm gonna get us our own place.

332
00:32:15,094 --> 00:32:18,379
I just feel like for the first time
in my life, like I'm...

333
00:32:18,555 --> 00:32:20,133
You're living?

334
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:25,469
Yeah. Living.

335
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:34,445
She asking for alimony?

336
00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:37,733
No. She's offering to pay me alimony.

337
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,778
You taking it?

338
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,538
Hey, I already feel like half a man,
I should wear a miniskirt too?

339
00:32:54,883 --> 00:32:56,128
Come on!

340
00:32:58,762 --> 00:33:00,671
Hey, don't drink them all yourself, huh?

341
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:03,303
Ah, don't dare me.
Ready to meet my girl yet?

342
00:33:03,475 --> 00:33:06,476
- She's that one, blond, skinny one.
- One more time!

343
00:33:06,645 --> 00:33:07,926
What do you think?

344
00:33:08,105 --> 00:33:11,022
I'm taking a break
from women for a while.

345
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:13,765
"Taking a break."
What is that, New York talk?

346
00:33:13,944 --> 00:33:15,984
- It's like, regroup.
- Re-what?

347
00:33:16,655 --> 00:33:20,024
That's what old Bill here says
he's doing back in town. Regrouping.

348
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:22,948
They must have a whole
other language in New York.

349
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,571
Oh, yeah, I brought you
something back from New York.

350
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:29,158
Well, now we're having
a conversation.

351
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:34,170
Shooters.

352
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:38,168
- No, I didn't order these.
- No, it's okay. Hal bought them.

353
00:33:38,343 --> 00:33:41,179
- Why are we the only ones dancing?
- You call that dancing?

354
00:33:41,346 --> 00:33:44,347
Last time I danced like that
I ended up with twins.

355
00:33:44,975 --> 00:33:48,474
Here's to broad shoulders, leather skin,
and a belly I can rest my drink on.

356
00:33:48,645 --> 00:33:50,519
Yeah!

357
00:34:06,288 --> 00:34:09,408
Hey, I heard Glory's new friend
is living with you.

358
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:12,121
You got a three-way going or what?

359
00:34:12,794 --> 00:34:16,662
Bitch is on my crew. If you ask me,
this shit's out of control.

360
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,216
Funny thing, I didn't ask you.

361
00:34:18,717 --> 00:34:20,211
Come on. Let's go, come on.

362
00:34:20,552 --> 00:34:22,094
Please, take it easy.

363
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:24,932
What are you gonna do? My taxes?
Huh?

364
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:26,972
You shouldn't have done that, Earl.

365
00:34:27,976 --> 00:34:29,554
Come on.

366
00:34:31,313 --> 00:34:32,724
Hey!

367
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:34,642
Come on.

368
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,359
Take it easy.

369
00:34:39,696 --> 00:34:41,654
Welcome home, pal.

370
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:45,362
- Thanks.
- What a fucking asshole.

371
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:48,240
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

372
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:52,075
Welcome back to the range.

373
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:54,459
Okay, come on, now.

374
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:59,124
Give me the bunny, give me the bunny,
give me the bunny.

375
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:02,300
Yes! I got a bunny!

376
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:09,515
I got a bunny, everyone!

377
00:35:24,366 --> 00:35:26,608
Why haven't you asked me to dance?

378
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,572
Not much of a dancer.

379
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:34,952
Sherry.

380
00:35:35,127 --> 00:35:36,502
Bill.

381
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:42,549
So I hear you're some kind
of hockey star up in Carlson.

382
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:47,632
High school. Long, long time ago.

383
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:51,969
So you wanna dance?

384
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:58,641
Sherry, you got a lot of guys
to choose from in this place.

385
00:36:00,861 --> 00:36:03,316
I know you're not a homo.

386
00:36:05,824 --> 00:36:07,283
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

387
00:36:07,576 --> 00:36:08,607
Oh.

388
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:12,034
So you wanna dance or not?

389
00:36:13,165 --> 00:36:17,743
I don't think you do.
I'm wearing underwear older than you.

390
00:36:22,424 --> 00:36:24,666
You really are a homo.

391
00:37:50,929 --> 00:37:52,922
Evening, ladies.

392
00:37:54,808 --> 00:37:56,088
Evening, man.

393
00:37:59,813 --> 00:38:02,600
Just one dance? Your friends here
will keep an eye on us.

394
00:38:02,774 --> 00:38:04,601
All right, sure.

395
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:18,448
Are you nice, Ricky?

396
00:38:22,294 --> 00:38:24,085
You seem nice.

397
00:38:44,649 --> 00:38:47,900
Hurry. Get out, get out, get out.

398
00:38:50,781 --> 00:38:53,947
You fucking suck.
You told me to have fun.

399
00:38:54,451 --> 00:38:56,989
I didn't say do it till you puke.

400
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:04,616
Ah, great, where is Sammy?

401
00:39:04,795 --> 00:39:07,499
Oh, found him.

402
00:39:13,845 --> 00:39:15,637
Where are your clothes?

403
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,513
Barfed on them.

404
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,725
Runs in the family.

405
00:39:22,187 --> 00:39:24,808
All right, let's go. No more.

406
00:39:29,027 --> 00:39:30,058
All right.

407
00:39:31,446 --> 00:39:33,190
Stop singing that song, Sammy.

408
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,982
- Why not? It's a cool song.
- It's not a cool song.

409
00:39:40,205 --> 00:39:44,368
- Will I get my own bedroom?
- Karen, please, no screaming.

410
00:39:44,543 --> 00:39:47,709
- Seriously.
- Hey, nobody's talking to you.

411
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:51,794
- Then why am I even here?
- Because you're still a part of this family.

412
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:54,208
Oh, so now we're a family?

413
00:39:54,636 --> 00:39:56,925
What the hell's the matter with you?

414
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:05,979
Karen, honey.

415
00:40:12,988 --> 00:40:14,565
- It's pink, isn't it?
- Yeah.

416
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:15,937
Yeah.

417
00:40:17,075 --> 00:40:18,450
It's great.

418
00:40:18,618 --> 00:40:21,405
I just don't know if I can come up
with 20 percent down.

419
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,323
Can you do 10?

420
00:40:23,498 --> 00:40:26,914
- How about 5?
- We can work something out.

421
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:30,330
How about that, huh?
What do you guys think?

422
00:40:30,505 --> 00:40:34,004
- Definitely. Take it.
- I think it sucks.

423
00:40:35,594 --> 00:40:37,633
Someday you're gonna
beg me to forgive you...

424
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:42,098
...for being such a horse's ass on the
biggest day of my life. And I won't.

425
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:01,651
Holy crap.

426
00:41:02,746 --> 00:41:05,118
Oh, look at that long face.

427
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:09,370
Somebody thought I forgot
about her, huh? But I didn't.

428
00:41:09,544 --> 00:41:11,537
There's a surprise outside.
Cover your eyes.

429
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:13,124
- You ready?
- Yeah.

430
00:41:13,298 --> 00:41:15,041
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

431
00:41:15,216 --> 00:41:16,794
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

432
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,590
There it is.

433
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:24,632
Well, I'm sure the neighbors heard.

434
00:41:26,144 --> 00:41:28,386
- Come on, Sammy.
- Get on there.

435
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:36,476
Now you're gonna bounce really high.

436
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:43,490
Come on. Come on, Karen.

437
00:41:53,505 --> 00:41:57,170
So, Josey, I know I've been
giving you a hard time.

438
00:41:57,342 --> 00:42:01,007
But I want you to know that
I had a talk with the guys.

439
00:42:01,262 --> 00:42:03,504
And I'm gonna give it a shot, okay?

440
00:42:03,682 --> 00:42:05,508
Give what a shot?

441
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:09,180
You know, being cool
with you and whatnot.

442
00:42:10,438 --> 00:42:13,392
Okay. All right.

443
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:17,232
As you can see, the conveyor's down.

444
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:21,271
So I need someone to get up there,
see if something's clogging the works.

445
00:42:22,575 --> 00:42:25,363
If all's smooth in the tube,
you just come on home.

446
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,280
Think you can do it?

447
00:42:29,249 --> 00:42:30,826
All right.

448
00:42:49,102 --> 00:42:51,723
Go on. Nothing to be scared of.

449
00:43:20,258 --> 00:43:25,086
All clear on number four.
I repeat, all clear on number four.

450
00:44:13,228 --> 00:44:14,888
Oh, God.

451
00:44:15,563 --> 00:44:18,054
Can you imagine falling down there?

452
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:20,149
Nobody would ever find you.

453
00:44:20,693 --> 00:44:23,813
Two minutes, five ton of rock
would be on top of you.

454
00:44:25,615 --> 00:44:28,153
Hello!

455
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:37,748
Oh, man. I remember the first
few times I came out here.

456
00:44:38,294 --> 00:44:39,575
Oh, I hated it.

457
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,006
Then I realized, you know,
I could just stand out here, you know...

458
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:47,839
...and smoke a joint
and what have you...

459
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:50,172
...nobody'd be the wiser.

460
00:44:50,682 --> 00:44:53,351
I mean, we're totally fucking alone.

461
00:44:55,812 --> 00:44:59,477
So, what do you say, Josey,
you wanna, I don't know...

462
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,191
...kiss and make up?

463
00:45:04,112 --> 00:45:07,196
- Come on, just one kiss.
- I'm going back.

464
00:45:07,824 --> 00:45:09,982
Hey, come on, what's the matter
with you, Josey?

465
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,986
It's not like... Am I hurting you?

466
00:45:12,162 --> 00:45:14,487
I ain't hurting you, am I?

467
00:45:18,543 --> 00:45:20,037
All right, fine then.

468
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,413
Go on.

469
00:45:39,063 --> 00:45:42,682
No, that was pretty typical
behavior, you wanna know the truth.

470
00:45:42,859 --> 00:45:44,401
What do you mean, "typical"?

471
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:48,275
Josey made a lot
of mountains from molehills.

472
00:45:48,448 --> 00:45:53,240
Always misconstruing things,
you know, paranoid stuff.

473
00:45:53,411 --> 00:45:54,656
She was pretty emotional.

474
00:45:54,829 --> 00:45:58,661
When she told you what happened in the
number four conveyor, what did you do?

475
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:01,870
I yanked Bobby into my office
for a sit-down.

476
00:46:02,045 --> 00:46:04,370
- He said she...
- Objection. Hearsay.

477
00:46:04,547 --> 00:46:05,745
- Sustained.
- Mr. Pavich...

478
00:46:06,466 --> 00:46:10,131
...how do you know who to believe
in a situation like that?

479
00:46:10,303 --> 00:46:12,426
Your Honor, is she kidding
with that question?

480
00:46:12,597 --> 00:46:15,633
Maybe she could ask if he likes
piña coladas and walks in the rain.

481
00:46:15,808 --> 00:46:18,015
Are you kidding with that objection,
Mr. White?

482
00:46:18,186 --> 00:46:20,759
Because it's denied.
The witness may answer.

483
00:46:23,274 --> 00:46:26,857
Look, men will always walk the line.

484
00:46:27,028 --> 00:46:28,439
It's when they cross over it...

485
00:46:28,613 --> 00:46:31,151
...is when most gals
give them a slap on the hand...

486
00:46:31,324 --> 00:46:33,945
...get them back on their side
of that line.

487
00:46:34,118 --> 00:46:38,116
That's how men and women have been
handling problems since Adam and Eve.

488
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:01,761
Okay, guys, that's it.

489
00:47:07,151 --> 00:47:08,811
I'm out of here.

490
00:47:09,988 --> 00:47:11,019
Hey, you want a ride?

491
00:47:11,197 --> 00:47:15,111
Josey, stay a moment, would you?
I'd like to have a word with you.

492
00:47:15,326 --> 00:47:16,986
Later.

493
00:47:25,336 --> 00:47:27,661
Don't stick me.

494
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,666
That looks great.

495
00:47:30,091 --> 00:47:33,840
Okay. We'll get it straight this time.

496
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:40,224
Stand up straight.

497
00:47:49,277 --> 00:47:50,771
Was that my dress?

498
00:47:56,492 --> 00:47:59,861
- A little young for Communion, no?
- No, never too young to be with God.

499
00:48:06,544 --> 00:48:08,371
You been watching this?

500
00:48:10,048 --> 00:48:12,124
<i>- He referred to the size</i>
<i>of his own penis...</i>

501
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,421
- Oh, dear God. Turn it off.
<i>- ...as being larger than norm...</i>

502
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,888
That poor man's family.

503
00:48:19,057 --> 00:48:20,551
- Alice?
- Here.

504
00:48:20,725 --> 00:48:23,512
Great. I'm not staying long.

505
00:48:23,811 --> 00:48:27,097
Just wanna let you know Sammy's
got a game on Sunday.

506
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,266
Uh, we're busy Sunday.

507
00:48:31,611 --> 00:48:33,402
Don't do this to him.

508
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:36,645
You're doing it to him.
You can quit anytime.

509
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:44,413
Pop. We got a house.

510
00:48:44,582 --> 00:48:47,702
- We got the loan and everything.
- You want me to congratulate you?

511
00:48:47,877 --> 00:48:51,661
You act like I'm stealing. I work
damn hard every day, same as you.

512
00:48:53,841 --> 00:48:57,791
- Now you're the same as me.
- Oh, no. There's a few differences.

513
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:00,758
You don't go to work scared of
what they write about you on walls...

514
00:49:00,932 --> 00:49:04,265
...or what kind of disgusting thing
you might find in your locker.

515
00:49:04,894 --> 00:49:08,974
You don't gotta be scared that one day
you'll come to work and get raped.

516
00:49:12,652 --> 00:49:14,312
You done?

517
00:49:20,326 --> 00:49:21,701
Yeah, I'm done.

518
00:49:28,376 --> 00:49:29,787
Come on!

519
00:49:35,133 --> 00:49:36,959
Faster!

520
00:49:50,565 --> 00:49:52,771
Glory!

521
00:49:56,779 --> 00:49:58,736
What are you doing bringing him?

522
00:49:58,906 --> 00:50:02,275
- I'll see you over there.
- If at first you don't succeed...

523
00:50:03,411 --> 00:50:04,988
- Thanks, Bill.
- Thanks.

524
00:50:05,997 --> 00:50:08,322
- What's that all about?
- He's famous.

525
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:11,536
They got a picture of him
in the Hockey Hall of Fame.

526
00:50:12,962 --> 00:50:17,838
Bill. Bill. Josey, I don't think
you and Bill have met, have you?

527
00:50:18,593 --> 00:50:19,838
No, we haven't.

528
00:50:20,011 --> 00:50:21,505
- Hi.
- Hi.

529
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:30,603
Hi.

530
00:50:30,855 --> 00:50:33,180
- Which one's yours?
- There he is, number 12.

531
00:50:34,525 --> 00:50:36,185
Tell me he's not 0-for-cute.

532
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,104
Get a new project. I'm fine.

533
00:50:44,118 --> 00:50:46,027
Well, look at that.

534
00:50:48,706 --> 00:50:50,699
Good for him.

535
00:50:54,504 --> 00:50:56,211
Oh, God..!

536
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,165
- Inside, Sammy!
- Get off the board!

537
00:51:01,552 --> 00:51:03,711
Oh, Jesus, I hate this game.

538
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,303
Kid's pretty quick on the ice.

539
00:51:08,518 --> 00:51:10,557
Go, go, go.

540
00:51:10,728 --> 00:51:14,560
- Pass it out! Pass it out!
- I'm open!

541
00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:18,567
What?

542
00:51:33,459 --> 00:51:35,831
Nobody passes anymore.

543
00:51:37,046 --> 00:51:38,161
Why didn't you pass?

544
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:40,628
My dad would kill me
if I passed the puck to you.

545
00:51:42,593 --> 00:51:44,550
You want some chili?

546
00:51:46,097 --> 00:51:47,508
Yeah, I'll go with you.

547
00:51:47,682 --> 00:51:49,888
But you said you weren't hungry.

548
00:52:02,947 --> 00:52:05,438
Gotta be smart to be a lawyer, right?

549
00:52:06,075 --> 00:52:08,364
You have a high opinion of lawyers.

550
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,623
Man, I love the sounds, you know?

551
00:52:21,132 --> 00:52:25,176
Wood knocking on the ice.
The slush of the blades.

552
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,339
Figured hockey wouldn't
take care of me forever.

553
00:52:30,516 --> 00:52:32,473
Thought a law degree might.

554
00:52:34,729 --> 00:52:36,472
- What happened?
- Don't listen to me.

555
00:52:36,647 --> 00:52:41,475
I'm in a bitter phase. What about you?
What do you do?

556
00:52:41,652 --> 00:52:43,526
I work at Pearson's.

557
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,488
- In the mine?
- Yep.

558
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,566
You don't smell like a miner.

559
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,985
- You Josey Aimes?
- Yeah.

560
00:52:52,163 --> 00:52:54,832
Stay the hell away from my husband.

561
00:52:54,999 --> 00:52:57,371
Goddamn mining whores.

562
00:52:58,169 --> 00:53:00,494
You keep away from Bobby,
you know what's good for you!

563
00:53:00,671 --> 00:53:02,047
Bobby? Bobby Sharp?

564
00:53:02,214 --> 00:53:04,207
Tossing your ass around
lost your marriage.

565
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,839
Don't think I'm gonna
let you mess with mine.

566
00:53:07,678 --> 00:53:09,137
You hear that?

567
00:53:11,307 --> 00:53:12,766
Is it true?

568
00:53:19,649 --> 00:53:21,641
Jesus Christ.

569
00:53:22,234 --> 00:53:26,398
Everybody heard. My father, my kids.

570
00:53:27,281 --> 00:53:30,864
I mean, can somebody say things like
that? You know, legally or whatever?

571
00:53:31,035 --> 00:53:34,155
- In front of the whole goddamn world?
- Only if it's true.

572
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,737
Well, it's not. He came on to me.

573
00:53:36,916 --> 00:53:37,947
Then it's slander.

574
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:40,035
What are you gonna do, sue him?

575
00:53:40,294 --> 00:53:41,954
Well, could I?

576
00:53:42,129 --> 00:53:45,794
Best thing you could do
is just let it go.

577
00:53:47,426 --> 00:53:50,712
Miss Aimes? Hi, I'm Stacey.

578
00:53:51,097 --> 00:53:55,046
- Sammy's girlfriend?
- Sammy's got a girlfriend?

579
00:53:55,226 --> 00:53:58,725
Sammy says to tell you that
he's gonna stay at my house tonight.

580
00:53:58,896 --> 00:54:01,268
Is that so? And where is Sammy?

581
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,058
He's over there in my mom's car,
and she said it's fine.

582
00:54:07,029 --> 00:54:11,738
- Really? Sammy's mom says it's not.
- Hey, Josey, come on.

583
00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:14,075
Great job today.

584
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,251
Sammy. Get out of the car now!

585
00:54:24,672 --> 00:54:27,163
- He's very upset, maybe...
- Don't tell me about my son.

586
00:54:27,341 --> 00:54:28,586
- Get out.
- No!

587
00:54:28,759 --> 00:54:31,333
- I said, get out of the car, now!
- Let go!

588
00:54:31,512 --> 00:54:34,347
Get out of the car! Go to the truck.

589
00:54:34,515 --> 00:54:37,966
- You're a whore, just like everyone says.
- Don't ever talk to me like that!

590
00:54:38,769 --> 00:54:41,521
Hey, hey! Josey, stop it, now!

591
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,107
You're gonna tell me
how to be a parent now?

592
00:54:46,277 --> 00:54:48,946
Glory, with all your
personal experience?

593
00:54:49,113 --> 00:54:52,612
Karen, get in the truck.
Now, get in the truck!

594
00:54:58,372 --> 00:55:02,584
You want a show? Huh?
Is that what you want?

595
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,083
You can all go to hell!

596
00:56:15,491 --> 00:56:17,530
<i>After that she kind of lost it.</i>

597
00:56:17,701 --> 00:56:19,860
When you say "lost it"?

598
00:56:20,037 --> 00:56:24,201
Ranting all the time about
how we shouldn't take it anymore...

599
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:28,622
...how the company wasn't protecting
us, the union wasn't protecting us.

600
00:56:28,796 --> 00:56:31,713
What did she think
you needed protection from?

601
00:56:34,718 --> 00:56:36,711
- Don't know.
- Did you have any problems...

602
00:56:36,887 --> 00:56:39,129
...getting along
with the men at the mine?

603
00:56:39,306 --> 00:56:41,548
I didn't bother them...

604
00:56:42,393 --> 00:56:44,220
...they didn't bother me.

605
00:56:48,566 --> 00:56:52,231
Hey, Peg! Three for a dollar.
Got change for a dollar?

606
00:56:58,617 --> 00:57:00,361
You kill me. She was like:

607
00:57:07,334 --> 00:57:11,083
It's what they've been talking about on
the news every day, sexual harassment.

608
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:12,630
- Hey, Sherry?
- Yeah?

609
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:13,829
What's this one do?

610
00:57:15,217 --> 00:57:16,711
- Exfoliator, 11.99.
- Oh, gee.

611
00:57:16,886 --> 00:57:17,917
All right.

612
00:57:18,095 --> 00:57:20,882
- Hello?
- It's me.

613
00:57:21,056 --> 00:57:23,594
Glory can't make it. She's got a bad flu.

614
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:26,519
- Oh, no, I need her here.
- I told you, Josey, she's sick.

615
00:57:26,896 --> 00:57:28,141
<i>Well, can I talk to her?</i>

616
00:57:28,314 --> 00:57:31,564
Josey, she's not coming, all right?

617
00:57:35,946 --> 00:57:38,022
What are you doing?

618
00:58:02,139 --> 00:58:04,760
What I was saying was
I think we should go to Pearson.

619
00:58:04,934 --> 00:58:08,137
- You know? Tell him what's going on.
- What do you get out of this?

620
00:58:08,312 --> 00:58:10,933
Jeez, Peg, I'm just trying
to make things better.

621
00:58:11,106 --> 00:58:15,768
Not you. I'm talking to Sherry. How
much do you get paid to sell this stuff?

622
00:58:15,945 --> 00:58:17,143
Five percent of each sale.

623
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:19,563
Don't expect to get
rich from me. I'm not buying.

624
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,824
- What about what happened to you..?
- That's my business.

625
00:58:24,995 --> 00:58:27,154
Actually, it's all of our business.

626
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:31,121
- It's happening to all of us.
- Tell you one thing...

627
00:58:31,293 --> 00:58:34,164
...I'm sick of having my ass grabbed
by a bunch of old men.

628
00:58:34,338 --> 00:58:35,880
Maybe you've been asking for it.

629
00:58:36,048 --> 00:58:37,839
- Ever think of that?
- Up yours, Peg.

630
00:58:38,008 --> 00:58:41,342
Hey, you could quit tomorrow.
Go sell your face cream.

631
00:58:41,512 --> 00:58:44,513
- I need my job.
- You don't know shit about me.

632
00:58:45,015 --> 00:58:46,640
I need this job just as much as you.

633
00:58:46,809 --> 00:58:49,679
Okay, okay. Now, what would you
even say to Pearson?

634
00:58:49,853 --> 00:58:52,724
That we've been sexually harassed?

635
00:58:52,898 --> 00:58:54,689
Honey, he'd laugh
you out of his office.

636
00:58:54,858 --> 00:58:56,816
Not to mention what
the guys would do to us.

637
00:58:56,986 --> 00:59:00,152
- All that "never rat on a brother" crap.
- Yeah?

638
00:59:00,322 --> 00:59:03,857
Union oath says, "Respect fellow
members." Where's our respect?

639
00:59:05,077 --> 00:59:06,322
Huh?

640
00:59:07,037 --> 00:59:08,697
Where is it?

641
00:59:10,582 --> 00:59:12,658
Come on, who's coming with me?

642
00:59:16,755 --> 00:59:18,878
- What else you got there?
- A lot.

643
00:59:19,049 --> 00:59:21,125
Will it get all the soot off my hands?

644
00:59:36,942 --> 00:59:38,520
<i>Sherry, Sherry, quite contrary</i>

645
00:59:38,694 --> 00:59:40,236
<i>Kiss my ass, it's really hairy</i>

646
00:59:40,404 --> 00:59:42,646
Oh, a real funny guy.

647
00:59:42,823 --> 00:59:44,483
What are you doing in the pit?

648
00:59:44,658 --> 00:59:48,738
- Filling in for Glory while she's out.
- Just in time to use the new Porta-Jane?

649
00:59:48,912 --> 00:59:51,748
You don't mind, we took
a big dump in that this morning.

650
00:59:51,915 --> 00:59:54,489
Oh, how charming.

651
01:00:09,683 --> 01:00:11,261
Sherry!

652
01:00:11,435 --> 01:00:14,602
Hey, cut it out! Stop it!

653
01:00:16,732 --> 01:00:18,392
Cut it out!

654
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:21,272
- What the hell's going on?
- They got Sherry in the crapper!

655
01:00:21,445 --> 01:00:24,648
Stop it, guys!
Cut it out, it's not funny!

656
01:00:24,823 --> 01:00:26,780
- Somebody's gonna get hurt.
- Knock it off!

657
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,231
Let her out! That's enough.

658
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:30,284
Turn this fucker over!

659
01:00:36,376 --> 01:00:38,286
What the hell?

660
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:03,663
Send her in, please.

661
01:02:09,845 --> 01:02:14,554
Miss Aimes. Sorry to keep you
waiting so long. Please, sit.

662
01:02:14,725 --> 01:02:16,385
Gentlemen.

663
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:19,478
I asked some of my colleagues
to sit in, if you don't mind.

664
01:02:20,063 --> 01:02:22,222
- No.
- I believe you know Mr. Pavich?

665
01:02:22,733 --> 01:02:26,944
Yes, I do. Mr. Pavich was the one who
told me I had to take a day off work...

666
01:02:27,112 --> 01:02:28,393
...to come and see you.

667
01:02:28,906 --> 01:02:31,906
- I didn't want to waste your time, sir.
- Well, I appreciate that.

668
01:02:32,075 --> 01:02:33,985
But it's not a waste at all.

669
01:02:34,161 --> 01:02:36,652
Miss Aimes has a problem,
and we're gonna solve it.

670
01:02:37,206 --> 01:02:39,163
Thank you, Mr. Pearson.

671
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:42,250
That's... That's really great.

672
01:02:42,419 --> 01:02:45,870
I didn't want to forget anything,
so I wrote a couple of things down...

673
01:02:46,048 --> 01:02:48,087
...on a piece of paper here.

674
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:53,426
Excuse me, Josey...
Do you mind if I call you Josey?

675
01:02:53,805 --> 01:02:57,257
- No.
- I'd like to make this easier for you...

676
01:02:57,434 --> 01:02:58,762
...if you don't mind.

677
01:02:58,936 --> 01:03:01,723
I know what you're going to tell me.
I've been well-briefed.

678
01:03:02,439 --> 01:03:04,432
Great. I just thought
that a few of these...

679
01:03:04,608 --> 01:03:07,277
Please, I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

680
01:03:14,117 --> 01:03:15,446
Okay.

681
01:03:15,786 --> 01:03:18,028
Well, the current
union contract requires...

682
01:03:18,205 --> 01:03:20,778
...that an employee provide us
with two weeks' notice...

683
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:22,749
...before leaving his position.

684
01:03:22,918 --> 01:03:26,536
However, given how obviously
emotional this has been for you...

685
01:03:26,713 --> 01:03:29,251
...we're willing to do something
special in this case.

686
01:03:30,634 --> 01:03:32,876
We've decided to waive
the two-week requirement...

687
01:03:33,053 --> 01:03:36,422
...and allow you to tender your
resignation effective immediately.

688
01:03:39,726 --> 01:03:43,309
No. I'm sorry, I'm not resigning.

689
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,149
- Mr. Pavich will take care of the details.
- Happy to.

690
01:03:46,316 --> 01:03:47,894
No.

691
01:03:48,652 --> 01:03:50,479
I'm not quitting.

692
01:03:51,405 --> 01:03:52,650
I need this job.

693
01:03:54,408 --> 01:03:59,200
Well, then I suggest you spend less time
stirring up your female co-workers...

694
01:03:59,371 --> 01:04:03,582
...and less time in the beds
of your married male co-workers...

695
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:08,128
...and more time trying to find ways
to improve your job performance.

696
01:04:15,012 --> 01:04:17,503
Does anyone else
have anything to add?

697
01:04:18,307 --> 01:04:19,587
That says it.

698
01:04:19,933 --> 01:04:23,468
Josey, thank you again
for making the drive down here.

699
01:04:23,645 --> 01:04:26,848
Now, if you don't mind,
we have other business.

700
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:42,157
<i>...to teach at</i>
<i>Oral Roberts University opened up.</i>

701
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:45,746
<i>When I informed him</i>
<i>that I was leaving in July...</i>

702
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:50,202
<i>...I recall that his response</i>
<i>was that now I would no longer...</i>

703
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:53,880
<i>...have an excuse</i>
<i>for not going out with him.</i>

704
01:04:54,551 --> 01:04:57,089
<i>- I told him that I still preferred not to.</i>
- Hey.

705
01:04:57,262 --> 01:04:58,637
Where have you been?

706
01:04:59,264 --> 01:05:02,550
<i>He made a comment</i>
<i>that I will vividly remember.</i>

707
01:05:03,143 --> 01:05:08,220
<i>He said that if I ever told anyone of</i>
<i>his behavior that it would ruin his career.</i>

708
01:05:08,815 --> 01:05:10,725
<i>This was not an apology...</i>

709
01:05:14,488 --> 01:05:18,735
- Sammy, can I come in?
- Why?

710
01:05:22,537 --> 01:05:24,577
I was only 20 minutes late.

711
01:05:24,748 --> 01:05:27,500
- Don't freak.
- You know, I'm still the mom here.

712
01:05:27,793 --> 01:05:29,536
Yeah, right.

713
01:05:29,836 --> 01:05:31,995
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

714
01:05:32,547 --> 01:05:35,418
Just most people's mothers
cook and clean.

715
01:05:35,592 --> 01:05:37,383
They don't work at the mine.

716
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:45,677
Do you remember
you used to tell me...

717
01:05:45,852 --> 01:05:47,596
...you want to be a doctor
when you grew up?

718
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:50,096
- So?
- So.

719
01:05:50,565 --> 01:05:53,270
I used to tell you
you could be anything you want.

720
01:05:54,403 --> 01:05:56,063
Isn't it the same for me?

721
01:05:56,279 --> 01:05:58,153
Aren't I allowed to be
anything I want?

722
01:05:58,323 --> 01:06:01,194
Not when you're doing
someone else's job.

723
01:06:02,869 --> 01:06:05,906
Bill White's signing some autographs
down at the rink on Saturday.

724
01:06:06,081 --> 01:06:08,073
- We could go...
- I don't want an autograph...

725
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:11,167
...from one of your loser boyfriends.
- He's not my boyfriend.

726
01:06:11,336 --> 01:06:13,127
And he's not a loser.

727
01:06:13,797 --> 01:06:16,003
He broke some record
in high school or something.

728
01:06:16,174 --> 01:06:20,124
- Yeah. A million years ago.
- Jesus, I'm just trying here, you know.

729
01:06:20,303 --> 01:06:22,047
It was something
we could do together.

730
01:06:22,222 --> 01:06:24,131
- You love hockey...
- I quit the team, all right.

731
01:06:26,601 --> 01:06:28,012
You quit?

732
01:06:28,645 --> 01:06:29,973
When?

733
01:06:30,188 --> 01:06:31,469
Who cares?

734
01:06:31,648 --> 01:06:33,356
I care.

735
01:06:34,317 --> 01:06:36,987
You love that team.
Why didn't you talk to me about it?

736
01:06:37,154 --> 01:06:39,479
Because I don't want to talk to you.

737
01:06:40,323 --> 01:06:42,150
Don't you get it?

738
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,293
I'll get her to call you.

739
01:06:52,461 --> 01:06:54,500
I'm not leaving till I see her.

740
01:06:57,549 --> 01:06:59,874
She doesn't have the flu, Josey.

741
01:07:01,928 --> 01:07:03,423
God.

742
01:07:23,533 --> 01:07:25,442
Guess he told you, huh?

743
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:31,286
- How you feeling?
- Great.

744
01:07:36,004 --> 01:07:40,049
I never heard of...
I mean, I've heard of Lou Gehrig.

745
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:42,875
- I just never knew about the disease.
- I know.

746
01:07:43,345 --> 01:07:44,543
It's...

747
01:07:44,721 --> 01:07:47,888
It's kind of like piece by piece,
your body quits listening to you.

748
01:07:48,058 --> 01:07:51,142
Like a bullheaded teenager.

749
01:07:54,105 --> 01:07:55,730
So how's Sammy doing?

750
01:07:55,899 --> 01:07:57,477
Hates me.

751
01:07:57,651 --> 01:08:00,605
I'd like to say time heals all, but...

752
01:08:00,779 --> 01:08:02,321
Uh-uh.

753
01:08:05,575 --> 01:08:07,200
Sure you should be
drinking that stuff?

754
01:08:07,369 --> 01:08:12,196
Well, sooner or later, my liver's gonna
crash and burn on me, so until then...

755
01:08:12,749 --> 01:08:14,409
...I'm still in the driver's seat.

756
01:08:16,545 --> 01:08:18,454
You never could keep a
secret, now could you?

757
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:22,758
Me? The whole town knows
I only have one ball because of you.

758
01:08:22,926 --> 01:08:26,461
- You only got one what?
- Now the whole town knows.

759
01:08:26,638 --> 01:08:27,918
Jeez.

760
01:08:28,348 --> 01:08:32,677
- Does it..? I mean, can you..?
- Works great.

761
01:08:32,852 --> 01:08:35,426
You only need one. A big one.

762
01:08:36,815 --> 01:08:38,095
Oh, God.

763
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:45,281
Watch out.

764
01:08:47,784 --> 01:08:49,444
- Okay?
- Yeah.

765
01:08:57,961 --> 01:09:00,369
- Hey, you mind if I use your bathroom?
- No, go ahead.

766
01:09:00,547 --> 01:09:05,541
But come back smiling, or I'll describe to
you what's gonna happen to my asshole.

767
01:09:46,343 --> 01:09:49,178
- God, what's that smell?
- Toilets overflowed again.

768
01:09:52,515 --> 01:09:54,923
I suggest you ladies
get some sponges and buckets...

769
01:09:55,101 --> 01:09:57,853
...and get that room cleaned
before somebody gets sick.

770
01:09:58,897 --> 01:10:00,854
- What's going on?
- Go in.

771
01:10:01,024 --> 01:10:02,815
Look for yourself.

772
01:10:06,696 --> 01:10:08,321
Oh, my God.

773
01:10:16,665 --> 01:10:18,787
They can't do this to us.

774
01:10:19,793 --> 01:10:21,038
Sure, they can.

775
01:10:21,211 --> 01:10:24,746
They're gonna keep on doing it worse,
as long as you keep opening your mouth.

776
01:10:25,715 --> 01:10:28,171
- Sherry, what they did to you...
- You didn't help any.

777
01:10:28,343 --> 01:10:30,086
That's for sure.

778
01:10:32,764 --> 01:10:36,714
Don't look at me.
This is our lives you're screwing with.

779
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,226
Your mess, start cleaning.

780
01:10:52,575 --> 01:10:57,570
Hey, Josey, how you like
your new scratch-and-sniff wallpaper?

781
01:10:59,874 --> 01:11:02,875
Was it him? Was it?

782
01:11:03,211 --> 01:11:06,046
I give a piece of my check
to that union, like everyone else.

783
01:11:06,631 --> 01:11:09,205
You fucked up.
What do you want me to say?

784
01:11:09,384 --> 01:11:14,378
Hey, lovebirds, wanna get to work?
Or should I dim the lights for you?

785
01:11:14,889 --> 01:11:18,590
Josey, get your ass down here.
I got a job for you in the Powder Room.

786
01:11:32,949 --> 01:11:35,618
You're one crazy bitch,
you know that?

787
01:11:37,162 --> 01:11:38,953
- You said you had a job for me.
- Yeah.

788
01:11:44,627 --> 01:11:46,086
You like that, don't you?

789
01:11:46,254 --> 01:11:49,290
You like that.
To grab your pussy like that, don't you?

790
01:11:50,091 --> 01:11:52,878
Forgot you like it a little rough.

791
01:11:57,307 --> 01:12:01,636
You're gonna learn the goddamn rules
if I have to beat them into you myself.

792
01:12:08,151 --> 01:12:09,775
Damn you, Josey.

793
01:12:39,808 --> 01:12:41,088
He attacked me.

794
01:12:42,101 --> 01:12:45,850
- Who attacked you?
- Bobby, in the Powder Room, just now.

795
01:12:46,689 --> 01:12:49,940
- Bobby, you lay a hand on her?
- Sure you wanna ask that, Rick?

796
01:12:56,366 --> 01:12:59,117
The answer's no.
I wasn't in the Powder Room all day.

797
01:12:59,285 --> 01:13:02,203
He was working the concentrator
with me all afternoon.

798
01:13:02,372 --> 01:13:07,034
See? You gonna call me and Earl
liars now? Come on.

799
01:13:09,295 --> 01:13:10,837
Ricky.

800
01:13:36,656 --> 01:13:39,112
Can somebody drive me home, please?

801
01:13:39,284 --> 01:13:42,653
- Where's your dad?
- He's on nights.

802
01:13:44,205 --> 01:13:46,696
- Just take my keys from my locker.
- Betty.

803
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:48,666
Don't.

804
01:14:04,017 --> 01:14:06,009
Where do you think you're going?

805
01:14:06,311 --> 01:14:07,721
I quit.

806
01:14:08,771 --> 01:14:11,856
The rules are clear. Go around the union,
you broke your oath.

807
01:14:12,025 --> 01:14:14,350
Period, the end.

808
01:14:15,612 --> 01:14:17,770
Glory.

809
01:14:18,531 --> 01:14:20,607
- What you doing here?
- What's it look like?

810
01:14:20,783 --> 01:14:22,278
I'm here for the meeting.

811
01:14:22,452 --> 01:14:28,870
Well, you're not an employee anymore.
You're not required to be here.

812
01:14:29,292 --> 01:14:33,290
Yeah, well. Thought maybe
I could help you out.

813
01:14:33,838 --> 01:14:36,294
Kind of out of control up there,
isn't it?

814
01:14:40,887 --> 01:14:43,425
I'm not saying Josey should've
gone to management or anything...

815
01:14:43,598 --> 01:14:44,629
Glory.

816
01:14:46,726 --> 01:14:50,344
We were all sorry to hear you're sick.

817
01:15:20,635 --> 01:15:23,042
- Glory...
- Don't. Don't help me.

818
01:15:23,221 --> 01:15:26,175
I mean, if you help me, I'll cry.
Please don't.

819
01:16:02,385 --> 01:16:04,710
Need an autographed hockey puck?

820
01:16:04,887 --> 01:16:08,553
- Got a hundred of them out here.
- I need a lawyer.

821
01:16:09,475 --> 01:16:11,966
I wanna sue the mine.
The company. All of them.

822
01:16:12,145 --> 01:16:15,395
Well, good luck with that.

823
01:16:17,734 --> 01:16:19,892
I'm saying I wanna hire you.

824
01:16:20,361 --> 01:16:23,896
Sorry, don't do that anymore.

825
01:16:25,783 --> 01:16:28,405
That sucks, because you're
the only lawyer I ever met.

826
01:16:28,578 --> 01:16:32,955
Well, the good news is,
all roads lead to lawyers.

827
01:16:34,417 --> 01:16:37,371
Tell you what.
I will buy you a beer, though.

828
01:16:37,795 --> 01:16:39,835
I don't need a beer.

829
01:16:40,006 --> 01:16:42,045
I need a lawyer.

830
01:16:42,216 --> 01:16:48,171
Look, Josey, the illusion is that all
your problems are solved in a courtroom.

831
01:16:48,347 --> 01:16:51,716
The reality is that even
when you win, you don't win.

832
01:16:51,893 --> 01:16:53,601
I know that I'm right.

833
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:57,933
I'm sure you are, but right
has nothing to do with the real world.

834
01:16:58,107 --> 01:17:00,812
Look at Anita Hill. Because she's you.

835
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:04,894
You think you're outgunned at the mine,
wait till you get to a courtroom.

836
01:17:05,073 --> 01:17:06,946
It's called the
"nuts and sluts defense."

837
01:17:07,116 --> 01:17:10,616
You're either nuts and you imagined it,
or a slut and you asked for it.

838
01:17:10,787 --> 01:17:13,574
Either way, it's not pleasant.

839
01:17:14,874 --> 01:17:20,414
Take my advice. Find another job.
Start over.

840
01:17:23,132 --> 01:17:25,291
I don't have any start-over left.

841
01:17:26,177 --> 01:17:31,337
- Look, you're a beautiful girl...
- Yeah, I'm a beautiful girl.

842
01:17:31,516 --> 01:17:34,185
I could find a guy to take care of me.

843
01:17:35,812 --> 01:17:37,935
I'm done looking to be taken care of.

844
01:17:38,314 --> 01:17:41,564
I wanna take care of myself.
Take care of my kids.

845
01:17:45,154 --> 01:17:47,396
You know it's happening to all of us.

846
01:17:47,573 --> 01:17:49,981
Every woman up there.

847
01:17:55,248 --> 01:17:57,655
But you don't give a shit, do you?

848
01:18:15,685 --> 01:18:19,848
If somebody like her came to see me back
in New York with this dogshit case...

849
01:18:20,022 --> 01:18:22,311
...you know what I'd do?

850
01:18:22,483 --> 01:18:24,392
I'd take it.

851
01:18:24,735 --> 01:18:26,609
Settle quick, pocket the contingency...

852
01:18:26,779 --> 01:18:29,863
...make more money than her,
never see a courtroom.

853
01:18:30,074 --> 01:18:31,983
Pearson would never settle.

854
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,282
- Sure he would.
- No.

855
01:18:34,537 --> 01:18:36,862
It would be her word
against everybody else.

856
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:41,452
All the guys up there can't be bad,
which makes some of them witnesses.

857
01:18:43,337 --> 01:18:45,875
That mine is bread and butter
for people around here.

858
01:18:46,048 --> 01:18:48,884
Nobody wants to shit where they eat.

859
01:18:53,389 --> 01:18:56,805
What is this place?
Like a pet cemetery or something?

860
01:18:57,727 --> 01:19:01,143
Why, you got a lot
of pet elk at home?

861
01:19:02,732 --> 01:19:06,065
So they never picked on Glory, why?

862
01:19:06,235 --> 01:19:09,236
Would you wanna
pick a fight with Glory?

863
01:19:11,574 --> 01:19:16,734
No, Glory became a union rep early on.
She did some good things.

864
01:19:16,913 --> 01:19:18,573
Got their respect.

865
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:22,076
Plus, she doesn't wanna
run with the herd.

866
01:19:22,251 --> 01:19:25,751
- Keeps her head above the fray.
- Safety in numbers.

867
01:19:27,298 --> 01:19:28,413
Hmm?

868
01:19:28,591 --> 01:19:31,343
Herds. They stay together,
they have a chance.

869
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:36,303
They separate, they're easy prey.

870
01:19:49,987 --> 01:19:52,276
Can you get the other women?

871
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:57,114
You know what a class action is?

872
01:19:57,286 --> 01:20:00,821
It's when a bunch of plaintiffs
have the same issue.

873
01:20:00,998 --> 01:20:04,248
File a claim on behalf
of the whole group, the class.

874
01:20:04,752 --> 01:20:07,421
It's tough for the company
to argue that you're all lying.

875
01:20:07,588 --> 01:20:12,001
You're all crazy.
It's why you have to get the others.

876
01:20:15,805 --> 01:20:18,343
Why'd you change your mind?

877
01:20:22,561 --> 01:20:24,388
It's never been done before.

878
01:20:24,563 --> 01:20:26,473
Sexual harassment class action.

879
01:20:32,071 --> 01:20:35,736
So you'd be doing this
just because it's never been done.

880
01:20:38,661 --> 01:20:40,369
Yeah.

881
01:20:41,247 --> 01:20:43,121
Can you live with that?

882
01:20:46,168 --> 01:20:48,078
Sue them?

883
01:20:48,254 --> 01:20:50,661
- Are you kidding?
- You know what's going on up there.

884
01:20:50,923 --> 01:20:53,497
Life is too short, trust me.

885
01:20:53,968 --> 01:20:56,126
Not too short
to do something good with it.

886
01:20:56,387 --> 01:20:58,676
How do you know? You're still alive.

887
01:21:01,142 --> 01:21:05,186
- So are you, you know.
- You call this alive?

888
01:21:10,401 --> 01:21:12,025
Get out of here.

889
01:21:13,154 --> 01:21:15,360
- I didn't...
- Get the hell...

890
01:21:16,198 --> 01:21:17,906
...out of here.

891
01:21:31,047 --> 01:21:33,205
<i>It's not just one or two bad guys.</i>

892
01:21:33,382 --> 01:21:37,047
It takes a village
to do what's being done here.

893
01:21:37,428 --> 01:21:39,302
I'm not saying all of them.

894
01:21:39,472 --> 01:21:41,345
But enough of them.

895
01:21:41,515 --> 01:21:45,560
In the plant, out in the pit,
and even up in the offices...

896
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:50,686
...all with the foot on the throat
of every woman in that mine.

897
01:21:50,858 --> 01:21:54,144
It's not just my client who needs relief
from this court, Your Honor.

898
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,356
We are asking for an injunction
to protect all the women.

899
01:21:57,907 --> 01:22:00,314
Further, we ask the court
to certify a class.

900
01:22:00,493 --> 01:22:02,984
A class made up of every woman
working at Pearson...

901
01:22:03,162 --> 01:22:06,578
...because every one of them
deserves protection under the law.

902
01:22:06,749 --> 01:22:09,785
Doesn't a class actually require
more than one plaintiff?

903
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,748
This complaint was filed
on behalf of one Josey Aimes.

904
01:22:13,005 --> 01:22:14,547
The key word being "one."

905
01:22:14,715 --> 01:22:18,084
By comparison, we have affidavits
from 13 women...

906
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:20,633
...all stating there have been
no incidents of abuse...

907
01:22:20,805 --> 01:22:23,011
That is not true.

908
01:22:23,182 --> 01:22:24,427
Hey.

909
01:22:25,226 --> 01:22:26,636
Sit down.

910
01:22:27,269 --> 01:22:29,013
- It's not true.
- Sit down.

911
01:22:35,945 --> 01:22:39,693
Your Honor, are you as confused
as we are?

912
01:22:39,865 --> 01:22:44,823
I don't think Miss Conlin is supposed
to be waving around a pile of paper...

913
01:22:44,995 --> 01:22:47,569
...without letting us see it first,
is she?

914
01:22:47,748 --> 01:22:49,077
No, she's not. Miss Conlin.

915
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:52,204
They'll be submitted to the court today.

916
01:22:52,378 --> 01:22:56,126
It doesn't matter what kind of document
they've been intimidated into signing...

917
01:22:56,298 --> 01:22:58,789
- Give me a break.
- Please.

918
01:22:58,968 --> 01:23:01,459
- Get me three plaintiffs.
- Your Honor, please.

919
01:23:01,637 --> 01:23:05,504
If those affidavits are legitimate,
you shouldn't have an objection.

920
01:23:05,683 --> 01:23:08,637
I'll continue to hear evidence
on <i>Aimes v. Pearson, et al.</i>

921
01:23:08,811 --> 01:23:13,769
If you find three plaintiffs with similar
grievances, I'll give you your class action.

922
01:23:17,319 --> 01:23:18,979
Thank you, Your Honor.

923
01:23:22,324 --> 01:23:24,400
Okay, then, here we go.

924
01:23:27,246 --> 01:23:30,200
We'll just hold it against your throat.

925
01:23:30,374 --> 01:23:31,952
Push the button.
Push the button.

926
01:23:33,335 --> 01:23:35,162
- There you go. Give it a try now.
- Glory.

927
01:23:36,589 --> 01:23:37,787
Ms. Dodge?

928
01:23:39,258 --> 01:23:43,256
My name is Leslie Conlin. I'm an attorney.
I represent Pearson Taconite and Steel.

929
01:23:43,429 --> 01:23:44,923
We know who you are.

930
01:23:45,097 --> 01:23:46,639
What do you want?

931
01:23:46,891 --> 01:23:49,845
The other women have signed
these affidavits on behalf of the mine.

932
01:23:50,186 --> 01:23:52,344
I brought one for you to look at.

933
01:23:52,855 --> 01:23:54,764
Get the hell out of here.

934
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:58,025
- I said, get out.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

935
01:23:58,194 --> 01:24:00,519
She's not represented by counsel.
I have the right...

936
01:24:00,696 --> 01:24:02,274
She's represented by me.

937
01:24:02,448 --> 01:24:04,524
I'll have to ask you to leave.

938
01:24:05,242 --> 01:24:07,698
As long as you're alive,
you can be subpoenaed.

939
01:24:07,995 --> 01:24:09,655
- Why, you..!
- Fuck you.

940
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:11,372
Bitch.

941
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:15,537
You keep this crap away from us,
you understand?

942
01:24:19,924 --> 01:24:21,466
Glory.

943
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,505
The reason I'm here
is to ask you to reconsider.

944
01:24:24,678 --> 01:24:26,754
Jesus, are you fucking kidding?

945
01:24:26,931 --> 01:24:30,097
It's not your decision, Kyle. It's hers.

946
01:24:32,728 --> 01:24:36,975
Glory, you know all this is not just
about Josey. This affects everybody.

947
01:24:43,948 --> 01:24:45,739
She already decided.

948
01:24:49,787 --> 01:24:52,360
You think I don't want to
stick it up their asses?

949
01:24:53,082 --> 01:24:56,415
- Then why don't you do it?
- And what if we lost?

950
01:24:56,585 --> 01:25:00,168
And I had to go back to that mine every
day and face those sons of bitches?

951
01:25:00,339 --> 01:25:02,130
No way.

952
01:25:04,468 --> 01:25:06,377
Who else you got so far?

953
01:25:09,807 --> 01:25:12,049
It'd just be you and me.

954
01:25:12,226 --> 01:25:14,135
Are you crazy?

955
01:25:18,274 --> 01:25:20,266
You know what they did to me.

956
01:25:21,777 --> 01:25:23,355
No way, man.

957
01:25:24,655 --> 01:25:26,980
I got my own problems.

958
01:25:28,242 --> 01:25:31,278
Hey, Mama. You okay?

959
01:25:58,731 --> 01:26:00,225
<i>If she gets any other women...</i>

960
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:03,151
<i>...they'll get their class</i>
<i>and you'll lose this case.</i>

961
01:26:03,319 --> 01:26:05,644
Leslie, why do you think I hired you?

962
01:26:05,821 --> 01:26:08,359
Because you're the smartest lawyer
I could find?

963
01:26:08,532 --> 01:26:13,657
No. I hired you because you were
the smartest woman lawyer I could find.

964
01:26:13,829 --> 01:26:16,035
But if you're getting soft,
I need to know now.

965
01:26:16,206 --> 01:26:17,831
I'm not soft.

966
01:26:18,417 --> 01:26:20,659
- But I am pragmatic.
- Do the Minnesota Vikings...

967
01:26:20,836 --> 01:26:24,086
...have to put a girl in at quarterback?
Of course not.

968
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:27,174
Some things are for men
and some things are for women.

969
01:26:27,384 --> 01:26:30,171
- Mining is men's work.
- Like lawyering.

970
01:26:31,013 --> 01:26:34,014
See, a man would never
say something like that.

971
01:26:34,183 --> 01:26:36,140
Women take everything
too personally.

972
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:38,682
You're gonna take it personally
if she wins.

973
01:26:38,854 --> 01:26:42,140
First of all, you're not insured
for punitive damages.

974
01:26:42,524 --> 01:26:45,525
Plus, a loss here will change
the way you run your business.

975
01:26:45,694 --> 01:26:47,687
Porta-Johns will be a blip on the radar.

976
01:26:47,863 --> 01:26:49,737
There'll be paid leave for pregnancies...

977
01:26:49,907 --> 01:26:52,694
...and more lawyers to draft
a sexual-harassment policy.

978
01:26:52,868 --> 01:26:55,703
Not to mention
that you will have helped establish...

979
01:26:55,871 --> 01:26:59,703
...a legal precedent that will affect
every single company in America...

980
01:26:59,875 --> 01:27:04,204
...including the Minnesota Vikings.
- Except she's not going to win.

981
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:08,164
This woman is a single welfare mother
with two kids out of wedlock...

982
01:27:08,342 --> 01:27:11,378
...a sordid sexual history...
- We don't know if that's true.

983
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:15,222
Send him in, please.

984
01:27:18,602 --> 01:27:20,725
Mr. Sharp.

985
01:27:20,896 --> 01:27:24,561
Would you share with Miss Conlin
what you told me today?

986
01:27:32,157 --> 01:27:33,865
Mom?

987
01:27:37,204 --> 01:27:38,663
Everything all right?

988
01:27:45,379 --> 01:27:48,748
How are you and the kids supposed
to eat if you don't have a job?

989
01:27:50,926 --> 01:27:52,586
I'm your mother, Josey.

990
01:27:54,221 --> 01:27:56,926
I haven't always been
the best at it, I know.

991
01:27:57,224 --> 01:27:58,967
But I'm here.

992
01:28:00,436 --> 01:28:03,769
You give away my hard-earned money,
then you toss your shoulders at me?

993
01:28:03,939 --> 01:28:05,481
I didn't give it away.

994
01:28:05,649 --> 01:28:08,401
- I gave it to Josey.
- I work hard for that money, Alice.

995
01:28:08,569 --> 01:28:10,442
Oh, and I don't?

996
01:28:10,612 --> 01:28:13,779
Maybe I should charge you
for every load of laundry.

997
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:17,785
She said Bobby Sharp
attacked her at the mine.

998
01:28:20,289 --> 01:28:23,290
- Not the story I heard.
- There's only one story, Hank.

999
01:28:23,459 --> 01:28:26,625
- Your daughter's.
- Those girls are just asking for trouble.

1000
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:31,547
Oh, are you saying Josey asked for it?

1001
01:28:31,717 --> 01:28:35,216
I'm saying I had to find some sandpaper
for the bathroom wall the other day.

1002
01:28:35,387 --> 01:28:37,795
Stuff was scratched
right into the metal.

1003
01:28:37,973 --> 01:28:40,345
- What's going on up there?
- They don't belong in that mine.

1004
01:28:40,517 --> 01:28:43,139
- They never did, and you know it.
- I know she's our daughter.

1005
01:28:43,312 --> 01:28:46,099
Our daughter's brought nothing
but shame on this family.

1006
01:28:53,947 --> 01:28:56,901
And I'm so goddamn sick of her!

1007
01:29:00,037 --> 01:29:02,160
She had a baby, Henry.

1008
01:29:02,331 --> 01:29:03,991
She didn't rob a bank.

1009
01:29:34,196 --> 01:29:35,856
Alice.

1010
01:29:37,908 --> 01:29:40,031
- Is Hank with you?
- No.

1011
01:29:40,702 --> 01:29:42,161
He's not.

1012
01:29:46,542 --> 01:29:49,033
I need a room, Tom.

1013
01:30:23,245 --> 01:30:26,032
You know, I can't help it
if she wants to get into my pants.

1014
01:30:34,298 --> 01:30:35,840
Oh, Jesus.

1015
01:30:37,259 --> 01:30:39,050
You okay?

1016
01:30:41,763 --> 01:30:43,258
I never did anything to this bitch.

1017
01:30:44,641 --> 01:30:46,100
That's right.

1018
01:30:46,977 --> 01:30:48,555
Now she wants to sue all of us?

1019
01:30:49,771 --> 01:30:52,938
You know what a class action is,
don't you?

1020
01:30:53,108 --> 01:30:56,975
It means it's all of them
against all of us!

1021
01:30:57,404 --> 01:30:59,527
That's right,
this bitch wants to take...

1022
01:30:59,698 --> 01:31:02,450
...every single swinging dick
in this room to court.

1023
01:31:03,201 --> 01:31:06,701
Now, the other women have shown us
something here in the past few months.

1024
01:31:06,872 --> 01:31:08,496
Telling the truth for a change.

1025
01:31:08,665 --> 01:31:11,287
How about you? How about that, huh?

1026
01:31:11,501 --> 01:31:14,586
Who knew? Who knew?

1027
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:17,207
How about you, ladies?

1028
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:22,798
I just hope nobody's thinking
of breaking the ranks.

1029
01:31:23,347 --> 01:31:25,635
Okay, that's it, let's go.

1030
01:31:32,856 --> 01:31:34,979
Okay.

1031
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:39,978
We all thank Mr. Sharp and the others
for their enthusiastic comments.

1032
01:31:40,155 --> 01:31:45,150
Before we take the oath, are there other
brothers who want a turn at the gavel?

1033
01:31:45,661 --> 01:31:47,653
Yeah, I'd like a turn at the gavel.

1034
01:31:49,665 --> 01:31:51,823
Oh, she's really lost it now.

1035
01:31:55,712 --> 01:31:57,835
Get the fuck out of here!

1036
01:31:58,340 --> 01:31:59,715
Get your ass home!

1037
01:31:59,883 --> 01:32:02,339
I asked if any brothers
would like to speak.

1038
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:10,184
Bylaws say no meeting can adjourn if a
member wants to speak his or her mind.

1039
01:32:10,352 --> 01:32:12,475
I got your gavel right here, bitch!

1040
01:32:19,653 --> 01:32:21,028
I am s...

1041
01:32:23,281 --> 01:32:25,191
I'm still a member of this union.

1042
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,454
- Come on. Come on!
- Well?

1043
01:32:36,628 --> 01:32:38,704
- Say it!
- Yeah!

1044
01:32:40,966 --> 01:32:43,539
- My... My name is Josey Aimes, and...
- Hey, Josey!

1045
01:32:43,719 --> 01:32:45,676
Show us your tits!

1046
01:32:53,895 --> 01:32:57,311
Don't look at me, Hank!
I'm not the one can't control his family.

1047
01:32:57,482 --> 01:33:00,400
Listen... No. Rules say she gets to talk.

1048
01:33:00,569 --> 01:33:03,274
You can have the gavel next,
but right now she's got it.

1049
01:33:03,447 --> 01:33:06,151
- I'll take it next and...
- All right, but she's got it!

1050
01:33:06,783 --> 01:33:08,443
She's got it.

1051
01:33:17,544 --> 01:33:20,249
- Can't hear you.
- I can't hear you.

1052
01:33:21,006 --> 01:33:23,711
My father never wanted me
to work here.

1053
01:33:23,884 --> 01:33:25,876
- That's right.
- Sit on this and talk.

1054
01:33:26,053 --> 01:33:28,045
Pretty much stopped talking to me
because of it.

1055
01:33:32,267 --> 01:33:34,888
I know some of you here think
I wanna shut down the mine.

1056
01:33:35,062 --> 01:33:37,434
Don't worry, sweetheart,
we won't let it happen!

1057
01:33:42,444 --> 01:33:44,935
I don't wanna shut down the mine.

1058
01:33:45,363 --> 01:33:48,732
I just wanna go to work
like everyone else.

1059
01:33:48,909 --> 01:33:51,482
Get paid end of the week,
feed my kids, and hell...

1060
01:33:51,661 --> 01:33:55,113
...maybe now and then have enough
for a beer at Tee-Gees Saturday night.

1061
01:33:55,290 --> 01:33:58,955
And not a woman in that back row
don't know what I'm talking about.

1062
01:34:01,296 --> 01:34:03,289
You all know what's been done.

1063
01:34:03,465 --> 01:34:06,798
- Time's up!
- We need these jobs.

1064
01:34:06,968 --> 01:34:10,135
And it's not gonna stop
until we say stop!

1065
01:34:10,305 --> 01:34:12,594
- Three-minute rule!
- There's no three-minute rule!

1066
01:34:12,766 --> 01:34:15,138
You heard the man! Get the fuck out!

1067
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:18,560
It's not gonna stop until we say stop!

1068
01:34:20,357 --> 01:34:23,642
- I have a right to say...
- Give me that, please.

1069
01:34:26,655 --> 01:34:29,821
- Three-minute rule.
- There's no three-minute rule!

1070
01:34:30,242 --> 01:34:32,946
- May I have it, please?
- Pop.

1071
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,911
- I'm not done.
- I know. Please.

1072
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,823
- Come on, Hank.
- Please.

1073
01:34:46,174 --> 01:34:48,001
Come here, baby.

1074
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:50,291
Stay with me.

1075
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:52,795
- Let her go, Hank.
- Come on, let her go.

1076
01:35:01,189 --> 01:35:03,597
My name is Hank Aimes.

1077
01:35:04,526 --> 01:35:08,773
- And I been a ranger all of my life.
- So have I!

1078
01:35:10,782 --> 01:35:13,273
But I ain't never
been ashamed of it till now.

1079
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:22,994
When we take our wives and daughters
to the company barbecue...

1080
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:26,087
...I don't ever hear anybody
calling them those names...

1081
01:35:26,256 --> 01:35:29,043
...like "bitches" and "whores"
and worse.

1082
01:35:29,634 --> 01:35:33,050
I don't ever see nobody grabbing them
by their privates or, you know...

1083
01:35:33,221 --> 01:35:37,219
...drawing pictures of them on
the bathroom walls doing unspeakables.

1084
01:35:38,101 --> 01:35:39,845
Unspeakables.

1085
01:35:46,401 --> 01:35:48,559
So, what's changed?

1086
01:35:50,238 --> 01:35:52,610
She's still my daughter.

1087
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:56,487
Isn't she?

1088
01:36:00,916 --> 01:36:02,908
It's a heck of a thing...

1089
01:36:03,084 --> 01:36:06,536
...watch one of your own
get treated that way, you know.

1090
01:36:13,178 --> 01:36:15,217
You're all supposed to be my friends.

1091
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,881
My brothers. Well...

1092
01:36:22,312 --> 01:36:25,229
Right now, I don't have a friend
in this room.

1093
01:36:32,364 --> 01:36:34,937
Fact, the only one here
that I'm not ashamed of...

1094
01:36:35,116 --> 01:36:37,156
...is my daughter.

1095
01:37:36,011 --> 01:37:39,462
Oh, it's tough stuff, getting up
in front of all those sons of bitches.

1096
01:37:39,639 --> 01:37:42,557
No. "Tough" is sticking this shit out
day after day...

1097
01:37:42,726 --> 01:37:44,599
...without bitching and moaning.

1098
01:37:48,398 --> 01:37:49,726
What are you doing in here?

1099
01:37:49,899 --> 01:37:52,687
That stuff really gets the soot
off your hands.

1100
01:37:52,861 --> 01:37:54,485
Doesn't it?

1101
01:37:56,823 --> 01:37:58,021
All I'm saying...

1102
01:37:58,742 --> 01:38:02,490
...it's easy for her to get up and say
what she wants when she already quit.

1103
01:38:02,662 --> 01:38:06,114
- The rest of us still gotta work here.
- Easy? I'd like to see you do it.

1104
01:38:06,291 --> 01:38:07,833
It's easy when you're crazy.

1105
01:38:08,209 --> 01:38:10,617
She's definitely crazy.

1106
01:38:12,589 --> 01:38:15,340
- Hey, let me borrow some of that cream.
- Buy your own.

1107
01:38:15,508 --> 01:38:19,553
- Creep took half of mine.
- So you're okay getting on that stand...

1108
01:38:19,721 --> 01:38:21,963
...and saying she's lying, right?

1109
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:23,634
I'm gonna do what I gotta do.

1110
01:38:23,808 --> 01:38:26,180
Plus, we all signed
those affidavits already...

1111
01:38:26,353 --> 01:38:28,890
...which means we don't have
a choice anymore, right?

1112
01:38:29,564 --> 01:38:31,058
Right, Betty?

1113
01:38:41,743 --> 01:38:43,486
Oh, God.

1114
01:38:45,413 --> 01:38:47,620
Oh, fuck.

1115
01:38:49,709 --> 01:38:51,085
Who is Sammy's father?

1116
01:38:53,922 --> 01:38:56,460
I don't know who Sammy's father is.

1117
01:38:57,550 --> 01:38:59,923
Because you've had so many
sexual partners?

1118
01:39:00,095 --> 01:39:03,760
Objection. Plaintiff's sexual history
is irrelevant, Your Honor.

1119
01:39:03,932 --> 01:39:05,426
Overruled.

1120
01:39:12,357 --> 01:39:15,560
Miss Conlin, who is the gentleman
entering the courtroom?

1121
01:39:16,069 --> 01:39:20,019
Mr. Paul Lattavansky, Your
Honor, Miss Aimes' high school teacher.

1122
01:39:20,198 --> 01:39:22,356
We've subpoenaed him
as an impeachment witness.

1123
01:39:22,534 --> 01:39:25,950
I have so many objections,
I don't know where to start.

1124
01:39:26,121 --> 01:39:28,279
- Witness will answer.
- Again:

1125
01:39:28,456 --> 01:39:33,035
- Miss Aimes, who is Sammy's father..?
- My son...

1126
01:39:33,211 --> 01:39:35,963
...has got nothing to do
with any of this.

1127
01:39:36,464 --> 01:39:38,504
Is it true that you and your teacher...

1128
01:39:38,675 --> 01:39:41,592
...Mr. Lattavansky, had a sexual
relationship at one time?

1129
01:39:41,761 --> 01:39:42,959
A "relationship"?

1130
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:47,633
What the hell you been
telling them, Bobby?

1131
01:39:49,686 --> 01:39:53,600
Miss Aimes, did you not, at the age
of 16, engage in a sexual relationship...

1132
01:39:53,773 --> 01:39:56,098
...with your high school teacher?

1133
01:40:00,113 --> 01:40:02,152
<i>Oh, Josey, stay a moment, would you?</i>

1134
01:40:02,323 --> 01:40:03,818
I'd like to have a word with you.

1135
01:40:03,992 --> 01:40:05,367
Later.

1136
01:40:07,162 --> 01:40:08,739
Okay.

1137
01:40:13,793 --> 01:40:17,708
What are you doing hanging around
a boy like Bobby Sharp, huh?

1138
01:40:18,673 --> 01:40:20,998
You have so much more going for you...

1139
01:40:21,468 --> 01:40:24,338
...than a kid like that'll ever have.

1140
01:40:28,349 --> 01:40:29,678
Do you like me, Josey?

1141
01:40:31,478 --> 01:40:34,811
- Far as teachers go.
- Yeah.

1142
01:40:36,691 --> 01:40:38,814
You're my favorite student.

1143
01:40:40,236 --> 01:40:41,778
Did I ever tell you that?

1144
01:40:42,197 --> 01:40:45,032
- No.
- Yeah.

1145
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,991
Frankly...

1146
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:49,199
- Josey?
- Yeah?

1147
01:40:50,788 --> 01:40:53,458
I'd like to think of you
as more than that.

1148
01:40:56,836 --> 01:40:58,912
No, no, it's okay.

1149
01:41:00,590 --> 01:41:02,333
Maybe even as a friend.

1150
01:41:37,919 --> 01:41:39,461
- What are you doing?
- It's okay.

1151
01:41:39,629 --> 01:41:41,538
- What are you doing?
- No, it's okay.

1152
01:41:41,714 --> 01:41:45,415
- Please don't do this, Mr. L.
- No, it's okay.

1153
01:41:45,593 --> 01:41:48,049
It'll be our little secret, okay?

1154
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:53,845
No, no, no!

1155
01:41:54,727 --> 01:41:56,270
No!

1156
01:41:56,437 --> 01:41:59,225
<i>No! No, stop! Stop!</i>

1157
01:41:59,399 --> 01:42:02,768
<i>Stop it! I don't wanna do this! Stop it!</i>

1158
01:42:03,444 --> 01:42:06,280
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Stop!

1159
01:42:09,284 --> 01:42:10,694
Stop!

1160
01:42:56,831 --> 01:42:59,951
Are there any other witnesses
to this alleged rape?

1161
01:43:01,336 --> 01:43:04,669
Anybody besides Mr. Sharp
that can corroborate your testimony?

1162
01:43:09,344 --> 01:43:11,004
No.

1163
01:43:21,397 --> 01:43:24,980
Isn't it true that there was no rape?
In fact, you have a long history...

1164
01:43:25,151 --> 01:43:27,724
...of inappropriate sexual relationships...
- Objection.

1165
01:43:27,904 --> 01:43:30,525
At the very least,
we're talking statutory rape.

1166
01:43:30,698 --> 01:43:32,691
- It's outrageous.
- You raped my daughter...

1167
01:43:32,867 --> 01:43:34,148
- Hank!
- Order! Bailiff!

1168
01:43:35,161 --> 01:43:37,035
- Help!
- Remove that man!

1169
01:43:40,416 --> 01:43:43,536
- Remove that man! Remove him.
- Let go! Let go of me.

1170
01:43:43,711 --> 01:43:45,538
Everybody take your seats.

1171
01:43:46,047 --> 01:43:48,882
Miss Aimes? Miss Aimes,
return to the stand, please.

1172
01:43:49,550 --> 01:43:52,006
Return to the stand, Miss Aimes!

1173
01:43:52,178 --> 01:43:55,132
Your Honor, move for recess? Please.

1174
01:43:55,306 --> 01:43:58,640
- Josey, wait. Slow down.
- I can't. I've gotta get home to Sammy.

1175
01:44:14,826 --> 01:44:17,233
We're gonna stay here tonight.

1176
01:44:17,412 --> 01:44:19,488
That's crazy, Mom.

1177
01:44:20,248 --> 01:44:22,157
He's gonna come home.

1178
01:44:23,334 --> 01:44:25,126
All the same.

1179
01:44:26,254 --> 01:44:27,831
We're gonna stay here.

1180
01:45:23,269 --> 01:45:25,475
I'd rather give you money...

1181
01:45:26,189 --> 01:45:27,980
...if that's all right with you.

1182
01:45:28,316 --> 01:45:31,151
That's a pretty old watch.

1183
01:45:31,486 --> 01:45:33,811
Was just looking at it.

1184
01:45:41,162 --> 01:45:45,658
She's lying, you know.
She didn't get raped by that teacher.

1185
01:45:46,584 --> 01:45:49,289
She was just saying that
so she'll win her lawsuit.

1186
01:45:50,338 --> 01:45:52,829
It's illegal for her to say that
if it's not true.

1187
01:45:53,007 --> 01:45:55,213
She should go to jail.

1188
01:45:55,384 --> 01:45:57,009
I don't care.

1189
01:45:57,929 --> 01:46:01,013
She's a whore, just like everybody says.

1190
01:46:03,017 --> 01:46:06,018
I wonder if it's illegal to call
your own mother a whore.

1191
01:46:06,187 --> 01:46:09,686
- Sure sounds bad enough to be.
- She's a liar.

1192
01:46:10,233 --> 01:46:12,937
My father didn't die in the Army.

1193
01:46:13,528 --> 01:46:15,853
He's a scumbag raper.

1194
01:46:16,989 --> 01:46:20,193
- It's a hard truth to tell, Sammy.
- That's crap.

1195
01:46:20,368 --> 01:46:23,488
- I got a right.
- Yeah, you got a lot of rights...

1196
01:46:23,663 --> 01:46:26,699
...starting with the right
to be pissed off.

1197
01:46:27,792 --> 01:46:31,042
In fact, you got a right to hate
the whole world right now.

1198
01:46:33,965 --> 01:46:36,456
I don't hate the whole world.

1199
01:46:36,634 --> 01:46:39,042
I just hate her.

1200
01:46:40,388 --> 01:46:43,009
Takes a lot of work to hate someone.

1201
01:46:43,891 --> 01:46:46,050
You ready to put in that kind of time?

1202
01:46:48,771 --> 01:46:50,894
To really hate your mom...

1203
01:46:51,065 --> 01:46:54,730
...you gotta think over and over again
about all the things you hate about her.

1204
01:46:56,028 --> 01:46:57,523
She's mean to you.

1205
01:46:57,697 --> 01:46:59,321
Never proud of you.

1206
01:46:59,949 --> 01:47:02,866
Never comes to watch
your hockey games.

1207
01:47:03,578 --> 01:47:05,903
Leaves you hungry,
never buys you clothes.

1208
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:07,907
I'm not stupid.

1209
01:47:08,082 --> 01:47:11,914
- I know what you're doing.
- What's that?

1210
01:47:15,256 --> 01:47:17,379
I know she does all those things.

1211
01:47:19,927 --> 01:47:21,303
Yeah.

1212
01:47:21,470 --> 01:47:23,759
But you hate her anyway.

1213
01:47:23,931 --> 01:47:25,212
Yeah.

1214
01:47:25,391 --> 01:47:27,467
I hate her guts.

1215
01:47:27,643 --> 01:47:29,683
Well, you're lucky.

1216
01:47:29,854 --> 01:47:33,852
She never gave up on you
as quick as you're giving up on her.

1217
01:47:34,734 --> 01:47:37,022
When she was a bit older
than you are now...

1218
01:47:37,194 --> 01:47:40,195
...she got pregnant in a way
nobody should get pregnant.

1219
01:47:41,949 --> 01:47:44,108
Would've been a lot easier...

1220
01:47:44,285 --> 01:47:45,945
...to give you up to someone else.

1221
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:50,449
Nobody would've blamed her if she did,
but she didn't. She stuck by you.

1222
01:47:50,625 --> 01:47:52,783
And she's still sticking by you...

1223
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,582
...even though she knows you hate her.

1224
01:47:55,755 --> 01:47:57,628
She's still there waiting...

1225
01:47:58,799 --> 01:48:01,207
...hoping you'll get your ass home.

1226
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:08,631
- Take it.
- What?

1227
01:48:09,435 --> 01:48:12,769
Well, if you wanna run off,
you can sell it and use the money.

1228
01:48:12,939 --> 01:48:15,939
Or just put it on your wrist.

1229
01:48:16,108 --> 01:48:18,315
Either way, it's yours.

1230
01:48:19,779 --> 01:48:21,855
One friend to another.

1231
01:48:34,543 --> 01:48:36,916
Karen, go to bed.

1232
01:48:37,505 --> 01:48:39,581
I'll wake you when he comes back.

1233
01:48:40,132 --> 01:48:41,924
It's me.

1234
01:49:11,872 --> 01:49:14,245
I didn't want you, Sammy.

1235
01:49:17,294 --> 01:49:21,458
Something bad had happened to me,
and I just wanted it to be over.

1236
01:49:23,968 --> 01:49:28,096
But every day my belly grew,
and it just reminded me of it.

1237
01:49:31,892 --> 01:49:35,676
Never even occurred to me
that there was a baby in there.

1238
01:49:38,149 --> 01:49:40,307
That you were in there.

1239
01:49:46,532 --> 01:49:49,486
That day, what that man did to me...

1240
01:49:52,788 --> 01:49:55,114
...it made me into something different.

1241
01:49:55,291 --> 01:49:56,915
And I guess...

1242
01:49:59,754 --> 01:50:02,245
I guess I thought...

1243
01:50:02,423 --> 01:50:05,673
...it said something about
who you were too.

1244
01:50:07,553 --> 01:50:10,756
I was a girl who was raped,
and you were this...

1245
01:50:10,931 --> 01:50:12,426
...thing...

1246
01:50:13,267 --> 01:50:15,758
...that just kept reminding me of it.

1247
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:24,104
Oh, God, I've dreaded this conversation
since the day you were born.

1248
01:50:27,073 --> 01:50:29,943
I don't want any more secrets
between us.

1249
01:50:38,292 --> 01:50:40,035
This one night...

1250
01:50:41,378 --> 01:50:43,704
...I was lying in bed...

1251
01:50:44,548 --> 01:50:46,755
...and you moved inside me...

1252
01:50:47,134 --> 01:50:52,010
...like this tiny little butterfly,
just fluttering around in there.

1253
01:50:54,308 --> 01:50:56,716
And all of a sudden, I realized...

1254
01:50:57,645 --> 01:50:59,637
I just knew...

1255
01:51:00,648 --> 01:51:03,055
I knew you weren't his.

1256
01:51:04,485 --> 01:51:06,643
You were mine.

1257
01:51:06,821 --> 01:51:09,312
You were my baby.

1258
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:11,817
And we were gonna be in it together.

1259
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:14,818
Just the two of us.

1260
01:51:19,917 --> 01:51:23,416
You had nothing to do with that
ugliness, you hear me? Nothing.

1261
01:51:27,842 --> 01:51:31,756
And there's nothing in this world
I wouldn't do to be your mom.

1262
01:52:00,374 --> 01:52:02,201
I should've told you.

1263
01:52:07,548 --> 01:52:09,256
It's over, isn't it?

1264
01:52:12,386 --> 01:52:13,928
Not yet.

1265
01:52:23,856 --> 01:52:27,688
Mr. Sharp, do you know the difference
between consensual sex and rape?

1266
01:52:27,860 --> 01:52:29,402
Oh, yeah.

1267
01:52:29,570 --> 01:52:32,108
But when you're having a good time
like she was...

1268
01:52:32,281 --> 01:52:34,487
...ain't no rape. That's for damn sure.

1269
01:52:36,619 --> 01:52:38,658
Are you a virgin?

1270
01:52:38,829 --> 01:52:41,451
- No. I ain't a virgin.
- Objection, Your Honor. Relevance?

1271
01:52:41,624 --> 01:52:46,084
She can ask about my client's sexual
history, but I can't ask this witness?

1272
01:52:46,253 --> 01:52:48,210
No, you can't. Sustained.

1273
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:50,373
- Why didn't you help her?
- Objection.

1274
01:52:50,549 --> 01:52:52,008
You saw Josey being attacked.

1275
01:52:52,176 --> 01:52:54,583
Miss Aimes' testimony has not been
corroborated by evidence.

1276
01:52:54,762 --> 01:52:58,131
Neither has his. And my client
would like to prove that he's lying.

1277
01:52:58,307 --> 01:53:00,098
I'm allowing it. For now.

1278
01:53:01,894 --> 01:53:03,305
Bobby?

1279
01:53:03,479 --> 01:53:07,179
When you saw Josey being attacked,
why didn't you help her?

1280
01:53:07,358 --> 01:53:10,809
You know, you can use
all the lawyer mumbo-jumbo you want...

1281
01:53:10,986 --> 01:53:14,604
...this still was no attack.
- I asked around about you, Bobby.

1282
01:53:14,782 --> 01:53:16,110
Folks say you're kind of soft.

1283
01:53:16,283 --> 01:53:19,070
Anyone that said that ain't man
enough to say it to my face.

1284
01:53:19,245 --> 01:53:21,071
Are you a red-ice player, then?

1285
01:53:22,456 --> 01:53:24,283
- How's that?
- I had a coach used to say:

1286
01:53:24,458 --> 01:53:27,293
"Win or lose,
leave your blood on the ice."

1287
01:53:27,795 --> 01:53:29,253
Good coach.

1288
01:53:29,421 --> 01:53:30,666
Yeah.

1289
01:53:30,839 --> 01:53:32,962
You're what coach would call...

1290
01:53:33,133 --> 01:53:34,628
...a yellow-ice player.

1291
01:53:34,802 --> 01:53:37,127
The kind that wets his pants
when things get rough.

1292
01:53:37,304 --> 01:53:39,380
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Denied.

1293
01:53:39,556 --> 01:53:43,471
She was your friend. You watched
him put his filthy hands on her...

1294
01:53:43,644 --> 01:53:45,802
...and you ran away.

1295
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:47,640
- It wasn't like that.
- Your Honor.

1296
01:53:47,815 --> 01:53:49,688
- Sustained. Mr. White...
- What was it like then?

1297
01:53:49,858 --> 01:53:51,353
He held her down,
spread her legs...

1298
01:53:51,527 --> 01:53:54,148
...jammed himself up inside her..?
- Mr. White!

1299
01:53:56,156 --> 01:53:58,944
Rangers are hard as steel, huh?

1300
01:54:00,035 --> 01:54:01,660
Not this one.

1301
01:54:01,829 --> 01:54:03,656
This one's made of butter.

1302
01:54:04,707 --> 01:54:08,455
You gonna keep lying about your friend,
or you gonna stand up and be a man?

1303
01:54:08,627 --> 01:54:10,086
- Objection.
- I'm not lying.

1304
01:54:10,254 --> 01:54:12,412
- You wanna run right now, don't you?
- Fuck you.

1305
01:54:12,589 --> 01:54:14,249
- All right. That's enough.
- You wanna run?

1306
01:54:14,425 --> 01:54:18,209
- I didn't run.
- Or you gonna put your guts on the ice?

1307
01:54:18,387 --> 01:54:20,593
What's it gonna be? Yellow?

1308
01:54:21,015 --> 01:54:22,592
Or red?

1309
01:54:23,017 --> 01:54:24,843
Yellow or red?

1310
01:54:25,936 --> 01:54:29,471
- Yellow or red?!
- What was I supposed to do?!

1311
01:54:37,656 --> 01:54:39,316
He was raping her, wasn't he?

1312
01:54:44,413 --> 01:54:45,872
Yeah.

1313
01:54:49,710 --> 01:54:51,370
And you ran.

1314
01:54:54,423 --> 01:54:56,214
What was I supposed to do?

1315
01:55:03,891 --> 01:55:05,800
What are you supposed to do...

1316
01:55:05,976 --> 01:55:11,267
...when the ones with all the power
are hurting those with none?

1317
01:55:14,568 --> 01:55:17,059
Well, for starters, you stand up.

1318
01:55:18,530 --> 01:55:21,104
You stand up and tell the truth.

1319
01:55:21,825 --> 01:55:23,533
You stand up...

1320
01:55:24,078 --> 01:55:25,572
...for your friends.

1321
01:55:25,746 --> 01:55:28,782
- Objection, Your Honor.
- You stand up...

1322
01:55:28,957 --> 01:55:30,831
...even when you're all alone.

1323
01:55:33,087 --> 01:55:35,126
- You stand up.
- All right.

1324
01:55:35,297 --> 01:55:37,539
- Mr. White, if you are through...
- Excuse me.

1325
01:55:37,716 --> 01:55:39,341
What is going on back there?

1326
01:55:40,594 --> 01:55:42,919
This is Glory.

1327
01:55:44,223 --> 01:55:46,892
She worked at Pearson's.

1328
01:55:47,601 --> 01:55:49,309
She wants to say:

1329
01:55:51,563 --> 01:55:54,849
"My name is Glory Dodge.

1330
01:55:55,901 --> 01:55:58,107
And I'm not fucking dead yet.

1331
01:55:58,946 --> 01:56:01,188
I stand with Josey."

1332
01:56:13,877 --> 01:56:14,909
Your Honor?

1333
01:56:15,087 --> 01:56:16,961
Your Honor said
we need three plaintiffs.

1334
01:56:17,131 --> 01:56:18,210
It's still only two.

1335
01:58:13,205 --> 01:58:14,664
Ready?

1336
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:17,827
Yeah!

1337
01:58:18,001 --> 01:58:19,246
Nice.

1338
01:58:22,839 --> 01:58:25,247
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

1339
01:58:30,430 --> 01:58:33,052
Hey, your son was just telling me
how rich you guys are now.

1340
01:58:34,434 --> 01:58:36,474
- Oh, really?
- You gonna buy me a car?

1341
01:58:36,645 --> 01:58:39,931
- No. You're not old enough to drive yet.
- So?

1342
01:58:58,417 --> 01:59:00,409
Why are we stopping?

1343
01:59:00,586 --> 01:59:03,919
Well, if you want a car someday,
you gotta know how to drive it, right?

1344
01:59:04,089 --> 01:59:05,500
First lesson:

1345
01:59:05,674 --> 01:59:08,046
Driver sits behind the wheel.

1346
01:59:08,802 --> 01:59:10,629
Come on, move your butt.

1347
01:59:12,723 --> 01:59:14,300
Seat belt.

1348
01:59:15,058 --> 01:59:16,850
All right.

1349
01:59:17,019 --> 01:59:18,561
- What do I do?
- Okay.

1350
01:59:18,729 --> 01:59:21,895
Put your foot on the accelerator.
Gently, okay?

1351
01:59:22,065 --> 01:59:24,639
And stay on the road if you can.

1352
01:59:25,819 --> 01:59:27,313
Go on, go on.

1353
01:59:30,157 --> 01:59:34,154
All right. Let's take a tiny
little bit at a time. Okay.

1354
01:59:34,328 --> 01:59:35,988
Slow down.

1355
01:59:36,163 --> 01:59:38,868
Slow down, racecar driver.

1356
01:59:39,666 --> 01:59:42,833
There you go. You're a natural.
