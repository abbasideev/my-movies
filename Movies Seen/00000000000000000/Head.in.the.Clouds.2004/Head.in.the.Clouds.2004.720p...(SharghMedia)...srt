Really.

177
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,665
But How Have You Been?

178
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,790
Practicing My Billiards.

179
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:39,290
l Wanted To see You,
To Tell You That l'm Leaving England.

180
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,624
Why?

181
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,332
The Wanderlust Has Got Me.
l Want To Travel.

182
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,332
Where Will You Go?

183
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,290
l Loved The Arabian Nights When l Was Younger.
Maybe l'll start There.

184
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:55,082
Would You Like
A Traveling companion?

185
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,957
You Have To Finish
Your Degree.

186
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,957
Does Julian Know?

187
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,124
l'll Leave Him A Nice Letter.

188
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,082
You're The One Friend From This chapter
l'd Like To Keep.

189
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,915
3 Weeks Later, Gilda Left England

190
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,124
And so Began
Our One-sided correspondence.

191
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,249
For she Was Never ln One Place Long Enough For My Letters
To catch Up With Her.

192
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,790
AfterAYear,
she stopped Writing.

193
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,207
By The Time l Graduated, And Began Teaching
ln The East End Of London,

194
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,957
l'd Managed To Finally
Put Her Behind Me.

195
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,082
Aid For spain
civil War Had Broken Out ln spain,

196
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,124
And l Was campaigning
ForThe Republican side

197
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,915
ln lts lncreasingly
Desperate FightAgainst The Fascists.

198
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,540
Tiberius ls ln A Bad Mood!

199
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,332
Where Are Those slaves?

200
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,832
We'll see How Brave You Are
ln The coliseum.

201
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,415
Take Away
Their Drinking Water.

202
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,165
l Hadn't Had A Letter
From Her ForAlmostAYear.

203
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:30,249
But Gilda Always Had
An Uncanny sense OfTiming.

204
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,874
she Was Back ln Paris,

205
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:37,374
Telling Me AWhole
New chapter Of Her Life Was Beginning,And Demanding l visit Her.

206
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:49,124
Once More, Nothing Else
ln The World Existed For Me.

207
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,957
Bonjour.

208
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,082
Guy! You came! And so soon!

209
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,040
Well, You Finally
sent Me An Address.

210
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,707
LookAtYou.
suddenlyYou're A Man.

211
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,499
l Even shave Now.

212
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,415
How Long can You stay?

213
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,707
Only Till Tomorrow.
l Have To Work.

214
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,624
That's Ridiculous.
You Have To stay ForAt LeastA Month.

215
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,332
You'll Be Able
To see My show.

216
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,207
What sort Of show?

217
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,665
You'll see Tonight.

218
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,665
l saw You ln A Film
As A slave ln Ancient Rome.

219
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,207
Wasn't lt Ludicrous?

220
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,499
How Did You Get The Part?

221
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:33,082
l MetAn American cameraman And Went Back To, Uh,
Hollywood With Him.

222
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,374
At First l Wanted
To Be An Actress,

223
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,874
But Then l--l Got More
lnterested ln cameras.

224
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,999
l'd Pick His Brains
ln Bed Every Night.

225
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,082
Are You Married Yet?

226
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,665
Not Quite. Good.

227
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:58,540
l'm sure You Have
A Menagerie OfAdmirers.

228
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,707
so What Do You Do
AfterWork?

229
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,249
l Raise Money
For Republican spain.

230
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,249
l Forgot
You Had A conscience.

231
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,707
Max! This ls Guy.

232
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,874
He JustArrived From London.

233
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,999
Welcome To Paris.

234
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,457
Are You Here
ForThe Opening?

235
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,999
He Doesn't Know Anything About lt, so He'll Be
completely Objective.

236
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,624
Right.

237
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,790
Where Are You staying?

238
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,082
There's A Hotel One Of My Friends Like,
JustAround The corner.

239
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,124
He's staying Here.

240
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,915
He And Mia can sing
Each OtherTo sleep.

241
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,374
Good.

242
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,082
This ls Going To Be
lncredibly Glamorous, lsn't lt?

243
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,624
And l'm Going To Be
lncredibly Dowdy.

244
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,165
You're British.
People Expect lt.

245
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,624
Do You Mind?

246
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,249
so Max ls A Lover?

247
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,624
He Owns The Gallery.

248
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,082
Actually,
He's Good company,

249
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,332
But He's Become Extremely
Proprietorial Lately.

250
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,707
He's On very Thin lce.

251
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,207
Then l Hope
lt Melts

252
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:22,499
Don't sulk.l Didn't Know
You Were coming so soon.

253
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,665
And Anyway,

254
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,832
l'm sure You're Not sleeping Alone
ln London Every Night.

255
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,832
Moments OfYearning.

256
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,165
Lust, Vanity, And Joy.

257
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:17,540
Loves Won And Lost.

258
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:21,915
lt's An HonorTo Be The First To Host The Work
OfThis Gifted New Photographer.

259
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:27,540
Finally, As A Bonus, May l Present
A Living sculpture

260
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,624
created Especially
ForTonight?

261
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,915
The Pictures Were Good OfTheir Kind.
But The sculptures Were something Else.

262
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,749
The Trouble ls Now
We're Never Going To see Them Again.

263
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,874
You should Film Them, Gilda.

264
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,540
Record Them For Posterity.

265
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:38,290
They Need To Be Live,so People can Lean Over,
And smell The skin OfThe Models.

266
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,374
Mmm, Does ThatWorryYou, Mia?

267
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,207
Having People sniffing
Around You Like Dogs?

268
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,832
l'm A sculpture,
so l lgnore Them.

269
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:49,707
WhatAboutYou, Guy?

270
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,374
Have You seen Anything
Like That ln England?

271
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,540
No, l Haven't.

272
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,540
Guy Thinks
Art should Be Political.

273
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,915
ln London, He spends Most Of His Time campaigning
For Republican spain.

274
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:06,540
German Artists spent The Last 15 Years Lampooning The Nazis,
And Had No EffectAtAll.

275
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,207
At Least They Tried.

276
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:12,249
Rather Pointless lfAll TheyAchieve ls A Ticket
To One OfThose camps.

277
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,415
And The satisfaction
Of Knowing They Had The courage OfTheir convictions.

278
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,665
Well, Here's
To Judicious cowardice.

279
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:29,540
No, No, No, No, No. Here's To Mia,
Whose Beauty lnspired Us All.

280
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:34,332
You should Model
For coco chanel.l could lntroduce You.

281
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,165
Mia's Training
To Be A Nurse.

282
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,374
she Only Models
ln Her spare Time

283
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:39,874
And l Have
An Exclusive contract.

284
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,624
But l Do Feel
l've seen You Before.

285
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,957
l Never ForgetA Face.

286
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:47,499
Perhaps You saw Me
At Le Grand Jeu.

287
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,915
so How Do You carry On
Your crusade For spain?

288
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:57,665
Do You sit On A committee And Hand Out Pamphlets
ln The street?

289
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:01,790
And lfYou Really Feel so strongly,
Why Don'tYou Enlist ln The lnternational Brigades?

290
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:03,707
l Plan To
At The End Of school Term.

291
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,249
Are You serious?

292
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:06,499
-Yeah, l Am.

293
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:08,957
Well, The Line Must Be Drawn.

294
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:11,624
Fascism Must Be stopped
Before lt Engulfs Us All.

295
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:13,874
Good Night.

296
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,874
You've Become so serious.

297
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:19,665
The World Has Become serious.

298
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:22,540
We'll All Die
Of Gravity.

299
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,832
l'm sorry
l can't Be With You Tonight.

300
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,749
Do You Even Like Him?

301
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,499
Occasionally.

302
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:35,707
But l Admit, He's Trying A Little
Too Hard At The Moment.

303
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,874
Mia, Get Out
OfThe Bath! You'll Turn lnto A Prune!

304
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,540
l Take lt Le Grand Jeu

305
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,874
Burlesque. striptease.

306
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:49,415
she came Here
With Nothing. she's My Protege.

307
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:52,040
l Want The 3 Of Us
To Be Friends.

308
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,499
Gilda, Are You coming?

309
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,749
l'll see You
ln The Morning.

310
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:25,790
This One's comfortable.

311
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:28,790
l Used To sleep Here
When l First came.

312
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,165
How Long
Have You Been Here?

313
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:32,832
HalfAYear.

314
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,082
Whereabouts ln spain
Are You From?

315
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:36,832
Asturias.

316
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,249
ln The North.

317
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,290
Don't Be Jealous.
He's Not special To Her.

318
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,124
None OfThem Are.

319
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,540
He Wants You To Hear.

320
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,624
He's Afraid
Of Her Feelings ForYou.

321
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,749
Yeah, Well,
l'm Afraid Of Mine For Her.

322
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,915
Who ls lt?

323
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,707
lt's Me.

324
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,499
so Pathetically Melodramatic Walking Out On Me Like That?

325
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:46,790
How Dare You Be

326
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:49,249
What's There To Drink?
l'm Bone Dry.

327
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,957
Hello.

328
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,749

l Got seasick On The Boat,
And Then l Tried To Eat something To settle My stomach,

332
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,499
But The Food
ln This country ls Awful.

333
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:16,624
ls This A Bad Time?

334
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,624
What Do You Think?

335
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,165
Does Max Know You're Here?

336
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:27,540
Max Was Being very Boring AboutYou,
so l Expelled Him.

337
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:31,665
l'm Not Going To LetYou Go
And GetYourself Killed.

338
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:35,790
You'd Probably come BackWith Your Brain shot Out.
conversations Would Be lncredibly One-sided.

339
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,499
Now, Get Me A Blanket
And You can Go Back To Bed.

340
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:48,832
WhatAre You Doin'?

341
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,374

Well, she's sleepin' ln There. l'm Just Getting Her

Guy, l Was With You
At The cinema.

344
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,665
AfterYou saw Her,
You Hardly spoke The Rest OfThe Evening.

345
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:03,124
And When You Got Her Letter,
You couldn't Get On A Train Fast Enough.

346
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:06,165
l'm Off.

347
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:07,457
There's No Need.

348

ln The Morning.

349
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,874
And Besides, l Think

350
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:28,499
You Didn'tAsk Her
To Leave, Did You?

351
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:29,832
No.

352
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:33,374
seeing As she Has,
l suppose l Don't Have To sleep Rough.

353
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:05,290
You've no idea how iadored you at cambridge.

354
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:09,207

355
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:11,374

356
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,832

358
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:24,832
You choose People,
Don'tYou?

359
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:27,457
"come lnto My Life."

360
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:31,665
sometimes You see complete strangers
But There's something special About Them,

361
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:35,457
And You Think,"l should Really TryAnd Talk To Them
Because l'll Never see Them Again," ButYou Don't,

362
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:38,707
Because lt's Not Done.

363
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:40,999
But lt's All Fated, Anyway.

364
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,999

00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,999
lt Probably Reminded You
Of some Place You've Been Before.

368
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,415
We Just Think
We've Dreamt Things.

369
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,749
You're so complacent!

370
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,415
Maybe lt can Jump
Forward ln Dreams.

371
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,707
Maybe lt Doesn't Have
To Obey Physical Laws.

372
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:10,540
But lf My Room Was Already There,
Then ThatWould Mean Everything Was Fixed ln Advance.

373
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:17,957
You Think
l Was Being spontaneous,

374
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,582
But l Was Always
Going To Do That.

375
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,290

And End Up ln A cell?

520
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,957
He Has Powerful Friends.

521
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:56,707

00:45:57,666 --> 00:45:58,999
Gilda Besse.

523
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:02,249
Mia Doesn't Know

00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:05,124
Oh, she GotA Little

532
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:25,999
Do You Mind?

533
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:27,749
No, Of course Not.

534
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,749
You should Take Mia
To A Film Or something.

535
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:32,249
she Needs To Get Out.
hat's A Good ldea.

536
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:33,749
Maybe A comedy.

537
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:53,207
l ThoughtYou Might
change Your Mind.

538
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:56,082
My English Friend Tells Me
l'm very stubborn.

539
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:58,624
l Assume He Doesn't Know
Where You Are?

540
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,540
No One Does.

541
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:02,915
Perhaps l should
Lock The Door.

542
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:12,790
Why Did You Decide
To Become A Nurse?

543
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:16,124
l Wanted To Be A Dancer.

544
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:20,707
My FatherWas A coal Miner.
An Anarchist.

545
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:23,957
Our House Was Full Of Politics
All The Time,

546
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:26,957
But l Would Always Be
Running Away To Dance.

547
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:33,582
2 Years Ago, They Declared
A socialist Republic ln Asturias.

548
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:37,957
A House ln Our street
Became A Hospital.

549
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:40,874
l Tried To Help,
But l Didn't Know Anything.

550
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:45,874
And People Were Dying ln MyArms.

551
00:48:47,666 --> 00:48:49,874
And Then The soldiers came.

552
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:55,290
l Tried To stop Them From Taking My Brother,
And That's When They Hurt My Leg.

553
00:48:57,208 --> 00:49:00,207
AfterThat, l Knew
l couldn't Be A Dancer.

554
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:04,499
And l Wanted To Help People.

555
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:09,790
so That's Why
l Am Becoming A Nurse,

556
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,832
And Why l Need
To Go Back To My country.

557
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:31,040
Hello.

558
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:32,374
How Did lt Go?

559
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,915

560
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,665
so You're Doing
Another Exhibition?

561
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:38,832
We Played Around
With A Few Different ldeas.

562
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:40,749
l Did Most OfThe Talking.

563
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:43,790
WhyAre You Two
Looking so Miserable?

564
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:45,540
Trois
cognacs.

565
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:47,665
We saw A Newsreel
On spain.

566
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:49,290
You Were supposed To Be
cheering Her Up.

567
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:51,124
ltWas My ldea.

568
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,832
We Wanted To see What Else
Was Going On ln The World.

569
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:58,999
There Will Always Be Wars
While There Are People Dying To Be Martyrs.

570
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:03,790
Go On. say How Guilty
You Feel.

571
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,915
Afterwards, We sat Out
ln The Gardens.

572
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:10,749
l'm serious. You Need To Get lt
Out OfYour system.

573
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:14,124
Because You Feel Guilty
That Life ls Good Here,

574
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:15,874
While Terrible Things
Are Happening There.

575
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:19,832
And AfterYou've Talked About lt,
You'll Feel Better,Because You've shown You care.

576
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:26,957
To You,For Getting Rid
OfYour Guilt.

577
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:33,290
And You,For Getting Rid
OfYour Guilt.

578
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:37,124
To Us.

579
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,957
You Live ln A cocoon.You Don't Think
About The World Outside.

580
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:45,040
l Give MyAllegiance
To Those Around Me.

581
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:48,040
We share The World,
WhetherWe Like lt Or Not.

582
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:53,332
And You can share My Bed As Long
As You Don't Bring Your Newsreels Or Newspapers lnto lt.

583
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:57,457

584
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:03,332

585
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,332

586
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:18,582
lf l Woke One Morning And You'd Turned
lnto A Husband, l'd Flee.

587
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:20,749
How Would lt Be
Any Different?

588
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:23,957
Once People Get Married,
They stop Trying.

589
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:27,499
Anyway, You Would
Want To Have children.

590
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,124

00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:42,665
lf l Had A child,

595

My MotherWas Mad.
You've Met My Father.l Have Doomed Genes.

596
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,249
You Talk such Nonsense.

601
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:32,749

00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:35,249

603
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:36,749
As lf ltWas Happening Here.

604
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:42,957
We All share The same World.

607
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:27,499

615
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:55,582
You Didn't see Much Point
ln Talking About Throwing AwayYour Life?

616
00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:57,374
And Taking Mia With You?

617
00:55:57,833 --> 00:55:59,374
Gilda.

618
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,582
l Was Always Going To Go Back
Once l Became A Nurse.

619
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:05,999
You Would Just Never Listen.

00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:13,665
Of course. l should Have

621
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:19,124
You Feed Each Other's Guilt.
lt's Like A Disease.

622
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:25,499
Thank God
lt Hasn't lnfected Me.

623
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:47,957
Gilda's FatherWas
Traveling ln America,

624
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,624
And As A Kind Of Farewell,
We spent The LastWeekAt The chateau.

625
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:59,665
The sense Of Our Departure Hung Over Every Moment,
Though ltWas Never Mentioned

626
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,374

627
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:10,082

628
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:12,374
Yes, You can.

We're Drinking ForAll Those Times
We Won't Be Able To Drink TogetherAgain

630
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:27,874
There'll Be Periods
Of Leave When l can come Back To Paris.

631
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:33,540
l Wouldn'tWant To see You lfYou came Back
With some Hideous lnjury.

632

00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,290
Gilda, You're Drunk.

636
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:03,207
Why Do You Have To Go
As Well?

637
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:32,332
Traitor.

638
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:57,040
Wait. Wait.

639
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,124

641
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,624
Poor Bastards.
They Didn't stand A chance.

642
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:11,249
My Dear Gilda,

643
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:16,999
Yesterday, ln An Ambush Behind The Enemy Lines,
l Killed AYoung Nationalist soldier.

644
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:20,790
How lnadequate
Those Words seem.

645
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:25,124
He Was clutching A Locket
When He Died,

646
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:28,249
With A Photograph
OfAYoung Woman.

647
01:01:29,375 --> 01:01:36,415
l suppose, As l Write This,she's Waiting For News Of Him,
Hoping Against Hope He ls safe.

648
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:43,040
Dearest Gilda,still No Word From You,
Which Breaks My Heart.

649
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:46,040
l Know That To You
All Wars Are Useless,

650
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:52,624
And For Us To Risk Our Lives ls A Betrayal
Of Ourselves And OfYou.

651
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,124
But My country's A Part Of Me.

652
01:01:56,541 --> 01:02:02,790
And lf l Was Not Here,
l Would Be Betraying Myself,And Even More, My Brother.

653
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:08,915
Believe Me,My Being Here Does Not Mean
l Love You Any Less.

654
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,540

01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,124
But l Do Beg You,
At Least, To Write To Guy.

658
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:25,124

Where The Fighting ls Especially Bitter

659
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:29,457
And Made Worse
By The lntense cold.

01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,999

You're Always The Quiet One
ln The center OfThe storm.

668
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:29,124
lf l Am, lt's Because
l'm Too Tired To Be Frightened.

669
01:03:31,791 --> 01:03:33,707
When Do You

670
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,457

But None From Her.

681
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,707

l've Been Asking Myself lfAny OfThis ls Worth lt.

686
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:58,540
Perhaps she Was Right. The World should Be Left
To LookAfter ltself

687
01:05:59,041 --> 01:06:00,040
You Know
You Don't Believe That.

688
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,374
ButWhatAre We Achieving?

689
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,082
With The Germans And The ltalians
On Their side,lt's OnlyA Matter OfTime.

690
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:09,374
But ln That Time,Maybe The Rest OfThe World
Will Begin To Realize What's Happening.

691
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:15,040
You Were Always
The sensible One.

692
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:16,332
Was l?

693
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:19,040
Not ln My choice Of Men,
Remember?

694
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:27,415
We should Try To sleep.

695
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:49,332
You Know, Gilda Once said
We Two should Have A child.

696
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,124
You Know she And l
Were Lovers?

697
01:06:58,208 --> 01:06:59,999
l Knew Underneath.

698
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:06,832
l Wanted To Tell You,
But she Always said You Were Too British.

699
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:14,207
she Was Probably Right.

700
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:25,957
Those Were The Happiest Times Of My Life,
The 3 Of Us Together.

701
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:31,790
And You And l came Here.

702
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:34,040
We Had No choice.

703
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:41,999
How can l Be so Tired
And still Feel Jealous?

704
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:48,249
l Was Jealous OfYou
All The Time.

705
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:13,332
she'd Be Pleased.

706
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:17,790
Everything Needs
Her Blessing.

707
01:08:38,541 --> 01:08:39,999
Here's Your Lift.

708
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:42,707
My Doctor Friend.

709
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:46,790
He's convinced
l'm some Kind Of saint Because l Never Go With Anyone.

710
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:50,124
He Was so Relieved
When l said l Wanted To come And see You

711
01:08:50,583 --> 01:08:52,457
He lnsisted On
Giving Me A Lift Himself.

712
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:56,957
l Finally Got Rid Of My Halo.

713
01:10:05,041 --> 01:10:07,749
There ls No 2nd sight.

714
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:13,124
We Grope Towards
Our Future Blind.lt's KinderThatWay.

715
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:20,832
On The Morning Of Her Final Day,
she came To Her Death clear-Eyed,Brave, Unknowing.

716
01:10:23,291 --> 01:10:29,832
And When The snow Melts,
spring Has come. There ls An End To War.

717
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:38,040
One small Flower,Blessed, Unique,

718
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:42,582
Will Flower No More.

719
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:48,124
Gilda,

720
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:52,832
l Have To Tell You
That Our Dear Friend ls Dead.

721
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:55,749
l saw Her
Just Before lt Happened.

722
01:11:56,125 --> 01:12:01,999
she Was so Beautiful And Had Become so Wise.
Far strongerThan Me

723
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,999
A Few Months Later, As The Forces OfThe Republic
Began To Disintegrate,

724
01:13:04,416 --> 01:13:06,499
l crossed Back lnto France
With The Remnants Of My Unit.

725
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:10,499
All Our Efforts
Had come To Nothing.

726
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:14,874
The War ln spain Was Lost.

727
01:14:56,083 --> 01:15:01,999
l Am speaking To You From The cabinet Room
At 10 Downing street.

728
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:07,249
This Morning, The British
Ambassador ln Berlin

729
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:11,457
Handed The German Government
A Final Note

730
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:17,457
stating That Unless We Heard
From Them By 11:00,

731
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:22,374
That TheyWere Prepared
At Once To Withdraw TheirTroops From Poland,

732
01:15:22,833 --> 01:15:26,540
A state OfWar
Would Exist Between Us.

733
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:33,332
l Have To Tell You Now
That No such Undertaking Has Been Received

734
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:40,457
And That consequently
This country ls AtWarWith Germany.

735
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:44,915
The WarAgainst The Fascists
ln spain Was OnlyA Rehearsal.

736
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:48,457
The Greater struggle
Was About To Begin.

737
01:15:56,708 --> 01:16:01,832
Less Than AYear Later, Poland, Norway, Holland,
Belgium, And France Were Overrun,

738
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,874
And The Germans
Entered Paris.

739
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:12,915
l Doubted l Would Ever
see HerAgain.

740
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:19,332

With Resistance Fighters

742
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:25,415
Based ln The countryside
Near La Manche.

743
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:39,374
ln The Late spring,l Was Transferred To Paris.
6 Long Years Had Passed since l Was Last There.

744

Did she see Me? l Wasn't sure.

761
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:20,540
ButAfterThe lnitial shock,
How could l Be surprised?

762
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:25,832
Gilda Didn't see The World
As Others Did.

763
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:28,582
she Was Looking After Herself,

764
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:48,999

And You Don't care?

771
01:22:47,125 --> 01:22:50,082
Did l Ever care
What People Thought Of Me?

772
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:52,582
l'd Like To Believe That
Once You cared What l Thought.

773
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:59,749
Why, Gilda? Why This?

774
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:05,874

You Know That.

775
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:08,040
Yeah, ButWith One OfThem?

776

01:35:44,708 --> 01:35:45,415
What Happened?

856
01:35:45,833 --> 01:35:47,124
BisquetWas Picked Up
Last Night.

857
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:52,707
We Just Found Out. Who Tipped You Off?
The Woman l Went To see.

858
01:35:57,125 --> 01:36:05,540
(speaking French)

859
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:23,749
This ls A surprise. l ThoughtYou Were On Alert.

860
01:36:24,541 --> 01:36:28,207
We've Been stood Down.There's A storm
ln The channel.

861
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:30,124
No lnvasion
ln This Weather.

862
01:36:32,416 --> 01:36:33,207
How Was Your Day?

863
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:41,832
Puzzling. Frustrating.
But NotAnymore.

864
01:36:44,875 --> 01:36:48,915
l Was Elated. ln some Way,
somehow, she Was On Our side.

865
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:55,332
Before l could Even Think Of Finding AWay To see Her,
Before l could Even Think Of Finding AWay To see Her,

866
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:58,457
D-Day.

867
01:37:05,625 --> 01:37:06,749
(Lisette speaking French)

868
01:37:08,666 --> 01:37:09,457
(speaking French)

869
01:37:09,916 --> 01:37:11,207
(Lisette speaking French)

870
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:15,457
(speaking French)

871
01:42:16,291 --> 01:42:20,207
ForA Few Days l Was Looked After By The Priest.
And Then l Was Flown Back To Hospital ln England

872
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:25,290
l still Had No clear ldea
Of Gilda's lnvolvement ln The Resistance.

873
01:42:25,875 --> 01:42:32,415
All l Knew Was That ln spite Of Everything,
When The WarWas Over, We Would Be TogetherAgain,

874
01:42:32,833 --> 01:42:34,457
As Mia Had Foretold.

875
01:42:35,333 --> 01:42:36,749
The MajorWill
see You Now, sir.

876
01:42:41,125 --> 01:42:42,582
JustWait Here
ForA Moment, Please.

877
01:42:53,208 --> 01:42:54,332
Long Time, Guy. -lt ls, sir.

878
01:42:54,916 --> 01:42:55,874
lt ls, sir.

879
01:42:57,916 --> 01:43:02,082
The First contact Didn't
come From Our side. she Approached Us.

880
01:43:02,583 --> 01:43:08,124
ln Fact, ltWas More Than AYear Before l Discovered
Who she Was.

881
01:43:08,625 --> 01:43:10,207
When l Realized ltWas Gilda,
l Was As surprised As l'm sure You Were.

882
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:15,749
Although l suppose
You Knew Her BetterThan l Ever Did.

883
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:23,457
Her First LoverWorked
ln stulpnagel's Offices.

884
01:43:23,875 --> 01:43:27,957
she copied Documents From His Briefcase
With A Miniature camera. she's Good With cameras.

885
01:43:28,333 --> 01:43:30,915
Then Passed Them On Through Her contact
ln A Beauty salon.

886
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:39,249
The lntelligence Officer she's With Now ls Much More circumspect.
But One Tip-Off she Gave Us

887
01:43:40,083 --> 01:43:42,915
And When You Went To see Her,
You Were Putting All ThatAt Risk.

888
01:43:43,083 --> 01:43:44,540
Why Didn't she Tell Me?

889
01:43:45,666 --> 01:43:53,874
You Know Why. lfYou Were caught
And Tortured... ltWasn't Just ForYour Own Good

890
01:43:55,666 --> 01:44:00,082
Paris ls ln chaos.The Resistance ls Trying To Liberate
The city Themselves,

891
01:44:00,583 --> 01:44:03,415
And There's No Possible Justification
For sending You Back There.

892
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:08,874
But she ls very Resourceful,As We Both Know.
l Wouldn'tWorryAbout HerToo Much.

893
01:44:09,333 --> 01:44:11,249
lt's Not The Germans
l'm Worried About.

894
01:44:14,041 --> 01:44:19,749
Of course, lfYou Were To Go OfYour Own Accord,
l Wouldn't Do Anything To stop You.

895
01:45:37,208 --> 01:45:38,790
You Got My Message? l'm Not coming With You

896
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:43,665
Gilda, Have You seen The People Out There?
l'll Be All Right lf l stay Here. When The Allies come

897
01:45:44,083 --> 01:45:47,749
WhyWill You Not
come With Me?l can Take You To Germany.

898
01:45:48,458 --> 01:45:50,915
l Know ltWon't Be Easy,
ButAt LeastYou'll Be safe.

899
01:45:52,416 --> 01:45:54,499
l Don't Love You, Frans.

900
01:46:03,583 --> 01:46:09,499
Oh, God!

901
01:46:15,041 --> 01:46:16,624
No!

902
01:47:32,416 --> 01:52:13,582
Well, My Love, l'm Trying To Make sense OfThings
Of How l Was, And How l Am Now.

903
01:52:15,916 --> 01:52:20,540
l Have Always Believed
Our First Duty ls To Ourselves, To Live Life To The Full.

904
01:52:23,208 --> 01:52:27,832
But l Have Also Been Haunted
ByAnother conviction,

905
01:52:28,333 --> 01:52:30,749
That Everything
ls Preordained, Lying ln Wait,

906
01:52:31,583 --> 01:52:34,207
And Time ls Running Out.

907
01:52:34,833 --> 01:52:39,832
l seem To Have
charged Through My Life ln A Kind Of Panic.And Looking Back,

908
01:52:40,833 --> 01:52:45,624
l Feel l Have Achieved
Little OfWorth Beyond Our Friendship

909
01:52:46,041 --> 01:52:49,332
Yours And Mine, And Mia's.

910
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:52,332
Then One Day l Woke

911
01:52:53,250 --> 01:52:56,874
And Found l Had Lost The 2 People
l cared For Most.

912
01:52:58,583 --> 01:53:04,082
Only Then Did l Begin To Realize
ThatWe cannot Live Alone Aloof From The World,

913
01:53:04,583 --> 01:53:07,499
And That To Believe We cannot Fight
Against Fate ls An Act Of surrender.

914
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:15,874
You Were RightWhen You said That Once l cared
ForYour Opinion Of Me,

915
01:53:16,416 --> 01:53:19,415
ButWrong ln Thinking
l Ever stopped caring.

916
01:53:21,666 --> 01:53:23,540
l Love You.
