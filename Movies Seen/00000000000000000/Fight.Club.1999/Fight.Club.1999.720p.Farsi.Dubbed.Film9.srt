1
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,759
People are always asking me

2
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,419
if I know Tyler Durden.

3
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,196
3 minutes.

4
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,892
Ground zero.

5
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,060
Would you like to say a few
words to mark the occasion?

6
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,101
With a gun barrel between your teeth,

7
00:02:18,173 --> 00:02:20,231
you speak only in vowels.

8
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,569
I can't think of anything.

9
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,235
For a second I totally forget

10
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,836
about Tyler's whole
controlled demolition thing,

11
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:28,075
and I wonder how clean that gun is.

12
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,913
Getting exciting now.

13
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:31,009
That old saying,

14
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:33,247
how you always hurt the one you love?

15
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:35,510
Well, it works both ways.

16
00:02:36,277 --> 00:02:37,710
We have front row seats

17
00:02:37,778 --> 00:02:39,804
for this theater of mass destruction.

18
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:42,212
The demolitions committee
of Project Mayhem

19
00:02:42,283 --> 00:02:44,720
wrapped the foundation
columns of a dozen buildings

20
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:47,722
with blasting gelatin. In 2 minutes,

21
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,725
primary charges will blow base charges

22
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:51,055
and a few square blocks

23
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:53,823
will be reduced to smoldering rubble.

24
00:02:53,896 --> 00:02:54,955
I know this...

25
00:02:55,032 --> 00:02:56,727
because Tyler knows this.

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,392
2 1/2.

27
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:00,368
Think of everything we've accomplished.

28
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:03,429
And suddenly, I realize
that all of this:

29
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:05,999
The gun, the bombs, the revolution...

30
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:09,535
has got something to do with
a girl named Marla Singer.

31
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:14,108
Bob. Bob had bitch-tits.

32
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:18,178
This was a support group for
men with testicular cancer.

33
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:20,690
The big moosey slobbering all over me,

34
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:21,748
that was Bob.

35
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,987
We're still men.

36
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:26,053
Yes, we're men.

37
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,564
Men is what we are.

38
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,692
8 months ago, Bob's
testicles were removed.

39
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:34,260
Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch-tits

40
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,330
because his testosterone was too high,

41
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:38,205
and his body upped the estrogen.

42
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:39,538
And that was where I fit...

43
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:41,545
They're gonna have to
open up my pecks again

44
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:42,638
and drain the fluid.

45
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:44,546
Between those huge, sweating tits

46
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:47,985
that hung enormous the way
you'd think of God’s as big.

47
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:51,147
OK. You cry now.

48
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:54,716
No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.

49
00:03:54,961 --> 00:03:57,793
For 6 months, I couldn't sleep.

50
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,424
I couldn't sleep. I couldn't sleep.

51
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,660
With insomnia, nothing's real.

52
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:05,332
Everything's far away.

53
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:10,208
Everything's a copy of a copy of a copy.

54
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:15,345
When deep space exploration ramps up,

55
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,113
it'll be the corporations
that names everything:

56
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:20,677
The I.B.M. Stellar sphere,

57
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:22,690
the Microsoft Galaxy,

58
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:25,319
Planet Starbucks.

59
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,022
Gonna need you out of town
a little more this week.

60
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:28,529
We got some red flags to cover.

61
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:29,998
It must've been Tuesday.

62
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:32,193
He was wearing his cornflower-blue tie.

63
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:34,361
You want me to deprioritize
my current reports

64
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:36,837
until you advise of a status upgrade?

65
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:38,703
Make these your primary action items.

66
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:39,867
Here's your flight coupons.

67
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:41,501
Call me from the road
if there's any snags.

68
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:43,044
He was full of pep.

69
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:46,310
Must have had his grandee latte enema.

70
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:50,211
Like so many others,
I had become a slave

71
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:52,551
to the IKEA nesting instinct.

72
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:56,525
Uh, yes. I'd like to order
the Erica Pekkary dust ruffles.

73
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:57,560
Please hold.

74
00:04:57,628 --> 00:04:58,890
If I saw something clever

75
00:04:58,962 --> 00:05:01,954
Like a little coffee table
in the shape of a yin-yang,

76
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:03,829
I had to have it.

77
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:06,734
The Klipske personal office unit,

78
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:09,273
the Hovetrekke home exert-bike,

79
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,000
or the Johannshamn sofa

80
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:13,340
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.

81
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:15,345
Even the Rizlampa wire lamps

82
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:18,507
of environmentally
friendly unbleached paper.

83
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,414
I'd flip through catalogs and wonder:

84
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:24,512
What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?

85
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:25,956
I had it all.

86
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,220
Even the glass dishes

87
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,194
with tiny bubbles and imperfections.

88
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,356
Proof that they were crafted
by the honest, simple,

89
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,195
hard-working
indigenous peoples of -

90
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,199
Please hold.

91
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,200
Wherever.

92
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,566
I was holding.

93
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,231
We used to read pornography.

94
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,366
Now it was the Horchow collection.

95
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,435
No, you can't die from insomnia.

96
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:46,605
What about narcolepsy?

97
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:49,617
I nod off. I wake up in strange places.

98
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:51,242
I have no idea how I got there.

99
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,048
You need to lighten up.

100
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:55,386
Can you please just get me something?

101
00:05:55,457 --> 00:05:58,653
Red and blue Tuenois,
lipstick-red Seconais.

102
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:03,356
No. You need healthy natural sleep.

103
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:06,993
Chew some Valerian root
and get more exercise.

104
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:12,169
Hey, come on. I'm in pain.

105
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:14,003
You wanna see pain?

106
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:15,805
Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.

107
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:18,972
See the guys with testicular cancer.

108
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:20,673
That's pain.

109
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,464
I always wanted 3 kids,

110
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:40,469
2 boys and a girl.

111
00:06:40,537 --> 00:06:44,439
Mindy wanted 2 girls and a boy.

112
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:47,444
We never could agree on anything.

113
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:49,480
Well, uh, you know, she-

114
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:52,108
She had her first child last week, a...

115
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:53,914
a girl.

116
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:57,546
With-With her, uh,
with her new husband.

117
00:06:57,622 --> 00:06:59,988
Fuck.

118
00:07:00,058 --> 00:07:04,155
Hey-Hey, thank God, you know.

119
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,596
I'm-I'm glad for her.

120
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:11,036
Because she deserves it.

121
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:17,300
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

122
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:19,675
Thank you, Thomas.

123
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:23,010
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage,

124
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:25,176
and that gives me strength.

125
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:27,618
We give each other strength.

126
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:29,621
It's time for
the one-on-ones.

127
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:32,488
So let's all of us here
follow Thomas' good example

128
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:34,992
and really open ourselves up.

129
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:37,360
Would you find a partner?

130
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,864
And this is how I met the big moosey...

131
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:44,062
Come on. Let's go over here.

132
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:47,369
His eyes already
shrink-wrapped in tears...

133
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,046
knees together, those
awkward little steps.

134
00:07:57,952 --> 00:07:59,044
My name is Bob.

135
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,553
Bob.

136
00:08:00,622 --> 00:08:03,147
Bob had been a champion body-builder.

137
00:08:03,224 --> 00:08:05,158
You know that chest-expansion program

138
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:08,323
you see on late-night
TV? That was his idea.

139
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,161
I was a juicer.

140
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:13,829
You know, using steroids.

141
00:08:13,905 --> 00:08:16,634
Diabonal and...

142
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:19,175
Wistrol. Oh, they use that

143
00:08:19,243 --> 00:08:22,507
on racehorses, for Christ sakes.

144
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:25,344
And now I'm bankrupt.

145
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,509
I'm divorced.

146
00:08:27,585 --> 00:08:31,022
My 2 grown kids...

147
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:34,889
won't even return my phone calls.

148
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,655
Strangers with this kind of honesty

149
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:39,253
make me go a big rubbery one.

150
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,034
Go ahead, Cornelius.

151
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:45,330
You can cry.

152
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:03,821
And then, something happened.

153
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:05,323
I let go.

154
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:06,858
That's really good.

155
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:08,917
Lost in oblivion...

156
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:12,158
dark and silent and complete.

157
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,663
I found freedom.

158
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:19,501
Losing all hope was freedom.

159
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:21,507
It's OK.

160
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:27,009
Babies don't sleep this well.

161
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:33,183
I became addicted.

162
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:46,698
Come on.

163
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:49,136
If I didn't say anything...

164
00:09:49,206 --> 00:09:51,037
people always assumed the worst.

165
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:52,039
Welcome, Travis.

166
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,974
Welcome, Travis.

167
00:09:55,612 --> 00:09:57,875
They cried harder...

168
00:09:57,947 --> 00:10:00,178
then I cried harder.

169
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:10,498
Now we're going to open the green door,

170
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,162
the heart chakra.

171
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:14,503
I wasn't really dying.

172
00:10:14,575 --> 00:10:17,509
I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.

173
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:19,671
I was the warm little center

174
00:10:19,747 --> 00:10:21,359
that the life of this
world crowded around.

175
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,346
Imagine your pain

176
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,818
as a white ball of healing light.

177
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:30,255
It moves over your body, healing you.

178
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:34,021
Now, keep this going.
Remember to breathe,

179
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:35,688
and step forward

180
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:38,357
through the back door of the room.

181
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:40,867
Where does it lead?

182
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:43,530
To your cave.

183
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:46,872
Step forward into your cave.

184
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:48,138
That's right.

185
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:52,740
You're going deeper into your cave,

186
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:57,583
and you're going to
find your power animal.

187
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:01,121
Slide.

188
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:15,373
Every evening, I died...

189
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,466
and every evening, I was born again.

190
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:20,204
Resurrected.

191
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:24,306
Bob loved me because he thought

192
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:25,974
my testicles were removed, too.

193
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,612
Being there...

194
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,551
pressed against his tits,

195
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:32,249
ready to cry.

196
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:34,224
This was my vacation.

197
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:41,963
And she ruined everything.

198
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,466
This is cancer, right?

199
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,038
This chick Marla Singer

200
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,577
did not have testicular cancer.

201
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,339
She was a liar.

202
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,007
She had no diseases at all.

203
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,744
I had seen her at Free and Clear

204
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:00,082
my blood parasites group Thursdays.

205
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,850
Then at Hope, my bimonthly
sickle cell circle.

206
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,188
And again at Seize the Day,

207
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,819
my tuberculosis Friday night.

208
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,727
Marla, the big tourist.

209
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:17,033
Her lie reflected my lie,

210
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:19,802
and suddenly, I felt nothing.

211
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,502
I couldn't cry.

212
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:24,546
So once again, I couldn't sleep.

213
00:12:36,593 --> 00:12:39,858
Next group, after guided meditation,

214
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:41,658
after we open our heart chakras,

215
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:42,994
when it's time to hug,

216
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,158
I'm gonna grab that little bitch

217
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:45,496
Marla Singer and scream...

218
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:48,265
Marla, you liar! You big tourist!

219
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:49,533
I need this! Now get out!

220
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:54,075
I hadn't slept in 4 days.

221
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:55,839
Absolutely. We'll just let that dry.

222
00:12:55,912 --> 00:12:56,844
When you have insomnia,

223
00:12:56,913 --> 00:12:59,405
you're never really asleep...

224
00:12:59,483 --> 00:13:01,473
and you're never really awake.

225
00:13:04,388 --> 00:13:05,787
To begin tonight's communion,

226
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:09,657
Chloe would like to say a few words.

227
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:12,390
Oh, yeah... Chloe.

228
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:13,863
Chloe looked the way

229
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:15,456
Meryl Streep's skeleton would look

230
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:17,502
if you made it smile
and walk around the party

231
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:19,969
being extra nice to everybody.

232
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:22,165
Well, I'm still here,

233
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,141
but I don't know for how long.

234
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,873
That's as much certainty

235
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:28,676
as anyone can give me.

236
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:31,946
But I've got some good news.

237
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,008
I no longer have

238
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:35,112
any fear of death.

239
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,861
But I am in a pretty lonely place.

240
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,455
No one will have sex with me.

241
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,865
I'm so close to the end,

242
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:50,234
and all I want is to get
laid for the last time.

243
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:55,007
I have pornographic
movies in my apartment,

244
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:57,238
and lubricants and amyl nitrate.

245
00:13:57,313 --> 00:13:58,904
Chloe...

246
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,848
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

247
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:08,850
Now, let's... ready ourselves

248
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:11,551
for guided meditation.

249
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:15,222
You're standing at the
entrance of your cave.

250
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:19,165
You step inside your cave, and you walk.

251
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:20,998
If I did have a tumor...

252
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,630
I'd name it Marla.

253
00:14:23,706 --> 00:14:25,298
Marla...

254
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:27,206
the little scratch on
the roof of your mouth

255
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:29,905
that would heal if only
you could stop tonguing it,

256
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,174
but you can't.

257
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:32,772
...deeper into your cave

258
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:35,409
as you walk.

259
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:37,783
You feel the healing
energy of this place

260
00:14:37,854 --> 00:14:40,982
all around you.

261
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:43,048
Now find your power animal.

262
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:48,992
Slide.

263
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:55,931
OK. Now let's partner up.

264
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:58,272
Pick someone special to you tonight.

265
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:06,317
Hey.

266
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:08,319
We need to talk.

267
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:09,320
Sure.

268
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:15,194
I'm onto you.

269
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:16,194
What?

270
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:17,821
Yeah. You're a faker.

271
00:15:17,898 --> 00:15:19,228
You're not dying.

272
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:20,596
Sorry?

273
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,933
In the Tibetan philosophy,
Sylvia Plath sense of the word,

274
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:25,664
I know we're all
- we're all dying, all right?

275
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:28,207
But you're not dying the way
Chloe back there is dying.

276
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,399
So?

277
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:33,275
So you're a tourist.

278
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:35,281
OK? I've seen you. I saw you-

279
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:36,645
saw you at melanoma,

280
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,014
saw you at tuberculosis,

281
00:15:38,085 --> 00:15:40,019
I saw you at testicular cancer.

282
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:41,782
I saw you practicing this.

283
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:43,152
Practicing what?

284
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:44,281
Telling me off.

285
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:47,020
Is it going as well as you hoped...

286
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:48,187
"RUPERT"?

287
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:49,594
I'll expose you.

288
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:51,655
Go ahead. I'll expose you.

289
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:52,928
All right, come together.

290
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:55,231
Let yourselves cry.

291
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:04,541
Oh, God, why are you doing this?

292
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:07,137
It's cheaper than a movie,
and there's free coffee.

293
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:08,206
No, look...

294
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:10,186
this is important, OK?

295
00:16:10,254 --> 00:16:11,220
These are my groups.

296
00:16:11,288 --> 00:16:12,880
I've been coming here for over a year.

297
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:15,050
Why do you do it?

298
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:16,184
I don't know.

299
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,692
When people think you're dying,

300
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:19,354
man, they really, really listen to you

301
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,556
instead of just...

302
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:24,157
Instead of just waiting
for their turn to speak.

303
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,169
Yeah.

304
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:27,830
Yeah.

305
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:30,374
Share yourself... completely.

306
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,975
OK, you don't want to get into this.

307
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:34,602
It becomes an addiction.

308
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,669
Really?

309
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:36,908
I'm not kidding.

310
00:16:36,982 --> 00:16:39,075
I can't cry if there's
another faker present,

311
00:16:39,151 --> 00:16:40,242
and I need this.

312
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:42,184
So you got to find somewhere else to go.

313
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:44,586
Candy stripe a cancer ward.

314
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:46,521
It's not my problem.

315
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:50,451
Wait, wait, wait.

316
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:52,053
Whoa. Hold on. I'll tell you.

317
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:53,689
We're gonna split up the week, OK?

318
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:55,734
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis-

319
00:16:55,801 --> 00:16:56,927
You take tuberculosis.

320
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:58,560
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

321
00:16:58,637 --> 00:17:00,070
OK. Good. Fine.

322
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:02,233
Testicular cancer should
be no contest, I think.

323
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:03,274
Well, technically,

324
00:17:03,342 --> 00:17:05,071
I have more right to be there than you.

325
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:06,202
You still have your bails.

326
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:07,211
You're kidding.

327
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,077
I don't know. Am I?

328
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:10,707
No. No.

329
00:17:10,784 --> 00:17:11,773
What do you want?

330
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:13,376
I'll take the parasites.

331
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:14,920
You can't have both the parasites,

332
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:16,319
but why don't you take
the blood parasites-

333
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:17,618
I want brain parasites.

334
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:19,318
I'll take the blood parasites,

335
00:17:19,393 --> 00:17:21,121
but I'm gonna take the
organic brain dementia-

336
00:17:21,194 --> 00:17:22,126
I want that.

337
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:23,493
You can't have the whole brain.

338
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:26,157
So far you have 4. I only have 2.

339
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:27,426
OK.

340
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,199
Take both the parasites. They're yours.

341
00:17:30,273 --> 00:17:32,069
Now we both have 3.

342
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:38,569
Hey, you left half your clothes!

343
00:17:54,765 --> 00:17:56,585
What, are you selling those?

344
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:58,448
Yes! I'm selling some clothes.

345
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,578
So,

346
00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:00,986
we each have 3. That's 6.

347
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:03,286
What about the seventh day?
I want ascending bowel cancer.

348
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,792
The girl had done her homework.

349
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,792
Thank you.

350
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:06,793
No. No, I...

351
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:09,092
I want bowel cancer.

352
00:18:09,164 --> 00:18:10,894
That's your favorite, too?

353
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:13,196
Try to slip it by me, eh?

354
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:14,735
Look, we're gonna split it, OK?

355
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,567
Take the first and third
Sunday of the month.

356
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:20,910
Deal.

357
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:25,413
Looks like this is good-bye.

358
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:27,609
Well, let's not make a
big thing out of it, OK?

359
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:29,549
How's this for not making a big thing?

360
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,421
Hey, Marla!

361
00:18:36,493 --> 00:18:37,426
Marla!

362
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:41,088
May-Maybe we should exchange numbers.

363
00:18:41,164 --> 00:18:42,598
Should we?

364
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,635
W-We might want to switch nights.

365
00:18:46,202 --> 00:18:47,191
OK.

366
00:18:52,712 --> 00:18:54,703
This is how I met Marla Singer.

367
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:58,080
Marla's philosophy of life

368
00:18:58,151 --> 00:19:00,210
was that she might die at any moment.

369
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:02,981
The tragedy, she said,
was that she didn't.

370
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:04,216
It doesn't have your name.

371
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,314
Who are you,

372
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,450
Cornelius, Rupert,

373
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:08,859
Travis,

374
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:10,123
any of the stupid names

375
00:19:10,197 --> 00:19:11,357
you give each night?

376
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:17,435
You wake up at SeaTac.

377
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:18,698
S.F.O...

378
00:19:18,772 --> 00:19:20,797
L.A.X...

379
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:22,705
You wake up at O'Hare...

380
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:24,266
Dallas-Fort Worth...

381
00:19:24,345 --> 00:19:26,312
B.W.I...

382
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,610
Pacific, mountain, central...

383
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:30,241
Lose an hour, gain an hour...

384
00:19:30,318 --> 00:19:31,841
Check-in for that flight doesn't begin

385
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,409
for another 2 hours, sir.

386
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:37,514
This is your life, and it's
ending one minute at a time.

387
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:39,991
You wake up at Air
Harbor international...

388
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,995
...the aircraft has
come to a complete stop.

389
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:43,723
If you wake up at a different time,

390
00:19:43,797 --> 00:19:45,766
in a different place,

391
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:47,927
could you wake up as a different person?

392
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:51,138
Everywhere I travel,

393
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,640
tiny life...

394
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,538
single-serving sugar...

395
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:55,735
single-serving cream...

396
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,642
single pat of butter...

397
00:19:57,713 --> 00:20:00,545
a microwave cordon-bleu hobby kit.

398
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:02,584
Shampoo-conditioner combos.

399
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:05,882
Sample package mouthwash,
tiny bars of soap.

400
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,517
The people I meet on each flight,

401
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:13,655
they're single-serving friends.

402
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:16,529
Between takeoff and landing,
we have our time together,

403
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:18,865
but that's all we get.

404
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:20,801
Welcome!

405
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,998
On a long enough timeline,

406
00:20:24,075 --> 00:20:26,600
the survival rate for
everyone drops to zero.

407
00:20:26,677 --> 00:20:28,738
I was a recall coordinator.

408
00:20:28,815 --> 00:20:30,873
My job was to apply the formula.

409
00:20:30,949 --> 00:20:31,881
Here's where the infant

410
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,248
went through the windshield.

411
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,308
3 points.

412
00:20:34,387 --> 00:20:35,717
A new car built by my company

413
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:38,154
leaves somewhere traveling
at 60 miles per hour.

414
00:20:38,223 --> 00:20:40,714
The rear differential locks up.

415
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:41,782
The teenager's braces

416
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,384
are wrapped around
the back seat ashtray.

417
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:45,727
Might make a good antismoking ad.

418
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,231
The car crashes and burns

419
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:48,891
with everyone trapped inside.

420
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:51,459
Now, should we initiate a recall?

421
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:52,731
The father must've been huge.

422
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:53,965
You see where the fat

423
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,200
has burned to the seat,

424
00:20:55,275 --> 00:20:56,765
the polyester shirt?

425
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:58,901
- Very modern art.
- Ha ha ha!

426
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:01,947
Take the number of
vehicles in the field, "A,"

427
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:04,642
multiply it by the probable
rate of failure, "B,"

428
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:05,741
then multiply the result

429
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:08,117
by the average out-of
- court settlement, "C."

430
00:21:08,188 --> 00:21:10,919
"A" times "B" times "C"

431
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:12,458
equals "X."

432
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:15,460
If "X" is less than
the cost of a recall,

433
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:17,724
we don't do one.

434
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:19,026
Are there a lot

435
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:20,999
of these kinds of accidents?

436
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:22,933
You wouldn't believe.

437
00:21:24,738 --> 00:21:26,968
Which car company do you work for?

438
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:29,705
A major one.

439
00:21:31,682 --> 00:21:33,672
Every time the plane banked too sharply

440
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:35,580
on takeoff or landing,

441
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:37,517
I prayed for a crash

442
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,077
or a midair collision.

443
00:21:39,155 --> 00:21:41,123
Anything.

444
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:51,798
Life insurance pays off triple

445
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:53,360
if you die on a business trip.

446
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:59,241
"If you are seated in
an emergency exit row..."

447
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,504
Yeah...

448
00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:02,169
"And you feel you would be unable

449
00:22:02,246 --> 00:22:03,646
or unwilling to perform the duties

450
00:22:03,715 --> 00:22:05,444
Listed on the safety card,

451
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:07,107
please ask a flight attendant

452
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:08,116
to reseat you."

453
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:12,016
It's a lot of responsibility.

454
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,320
Wanna switch seats?

455
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:15,950
No. I'm not sure I'm the man

456
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:17,858
for that particular job.

457
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:20,830
An exit-door procedure at 30,000 feet.

458
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:22,457
Mm-hmm.

459
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,467
The illusion of safety.

460
00:22:24,535 --> 00:22:27,265
Yeah. I guess so.

461
00:22:27,338 --> 00:22:29,830
You know why they put
oxygen masks on planes?

462
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:31,638
So you can breathe.

463
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,577
Oxygen gets you high.

464
00:22:34,647 --> 00:22:36,080
In a catastrophic emergency,

465
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:39,140
you're taking giant panicked breaths.

466
00:22:39,218 --> 00:22:41,778
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.

467
00:22:41,854 --> 00:22:44,084
You accept your fate.

468
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,750
It's all right here.

469
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,554
Emergency water landing-

470
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:50,096
600 miles an hour.

471
00:22:50,164 --> 00:22:51,189
Blank faces,

472
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:52,926
calm as Hindu cows.

473
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,025
That's, um...

474
00:22:55,102 --> 00:22:58,128
That's an interesting theory.

475
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:02,073
What do you do?

476
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,577
What do you mean?

477
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:04,906
What do you do for a living?

478
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:08,108
Why? So you can pretend
like you're interested?

479
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:11,979
OK.

480
00:23:12,055 --> 00:23:13,886
You have a kind of sick desperation

481
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:15,185
in your laugh.

482
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:20,521
We have the exact same briefcase.

483
00:23:21,797 --> 00:23:23,425
Soap.

484
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:24,431
Sorry?

485
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,229
I make and I sell soap-

486
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:30,136
the yard stick of civilization.

487
00:23:30,206 --> 00:23:31,935
And this is how I met...

488
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:33,703
"Tyler Durden."

489
00:23:33,776 --> 00:23:35,607
Did you know, if you mixed equal parts

490
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:37,578
of gasoline and frozen
or angejuice concentrate,

491
00:23:37,647 --> 00:23:39,444
you can make napalm?

492
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:41,346
No, I did not know that. Is that true?

493
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:42,475
That's right.

494
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:44,144
One can make all kinds of explosives

495
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,017
using simple household items.

496
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:47,181
Really?

497
00:23:47,256 --> 00:23:48,883
If one were so inclined.

498
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,326
Tyler, you are, by far,
the most interesting

499
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,925
"single-serving" friend I've ever met.

500
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:00,801
See, obviously,

501
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,736
everything on a plane
is single-serving, even-

502
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:05,002
Oh, I get it. It's very clever.

503
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,634
Thank you.

504
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:09,476
How's that working out for you?

505
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,481
What?

506
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,676
Being clever.

507
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:14,151
Great.

508
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,155
Keep it up, then.

509
00:24:16,223 --> 00:24:17,155
Right up.

510
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,492
Now a question of etiquette.

511
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,652
As I pass,

512
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:23,161
do I give you the ass or the crotch?

513
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,497
How I came to live with Tyler is...

514
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:36,565
airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.

515
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:45,751
Was-Was it ticking?

516
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,186
Actually, throwers don't
worry about ticking,

517
00:24:48,256 --> 00:24:49,723
'cause modern bombs don't tick.

518
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,122
Sorry. "Throwers"?

519
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:52,352
Baggage handlers.

520
00:24:52,427 --> 00:24:55,624
But when a suitcase vibrates,

521
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:58,131
then the thrower's
gotta call the police.

522
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,827
My suitcase... was vibrating?

523
00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:02,927
9 times out of 10,
it's an electric razor,

524
00:25:03,004 --> 00:25:06,064
but every once in a while...

525
00:25:08,544 --> 00:25:10,136
it's a dildo.

526
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:13,304
Of course, it's company policy

527
00:25:13,382 --> 00:25:14,907
never to imply ownership

528
00:25:14,984 --> 00:25:16,314
in the event of a dildo.

529
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:17,579
We have to use the indefinite article

530
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:18,642
a dildo.

531
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,053
Never your dildo.

532
00:25:22,124 --> 00:25:23,148
I don't own a-

533
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:28,726
I had everything in that suitcase-

534
00:25:28,797 --> 00:25:30,007
my CK shirts,

535
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:31,768
my DKNY shoes,

536
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:33,138
my AX ties.

537
00:25:35,012 --> 00:25:36,104
Never mind.

538
00:25:37,715 --> 00:25:41,481
Hey! That's my car!

539
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:50,493
Home was a condo on the 15th floor

540
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:53,224
of a filing cabinet for
widows and young professionals.

541
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:55,960
The walls were solid concrete.

542
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:57,831
A foot of concrete's important

543
00:25:57,903 --> 00:25:59,564
when your next-door neighbor
lets her hearing aid go

544
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:02,072
and has to watch game
shows at full volume...

545
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,937
Or when a volcanic blast

546
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:06,740
and debris that used to be your
furniture and personal effects

547
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:08,609
blows out of your
floor-to-ceiling windows

548
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,443
and sails flaming into the night.

549
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:19,053
I suppose these things happen.

550
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:34,104
There's nothing up there.

551
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:36,471
You can't go into the unit.

552
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:37,839
Police orders.

553
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,519
Do you have somebody you can call?

554
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:51,123
How embarrassing.

555
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,025
A house full of condiments and no food.

556
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,473
The police would later tell me

557
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,270
that the pilot light
might have gone out,

558
00:27:07,343 --> 00:27:11,280
Letting out just a little bit of gas.

559
00:27:11,348 --> 00:27:13,612
That gas could have
slowly filled the condo-

560
00:27:13,683 --> 00:27:16,209
1,700 square feet of high ceilings

561
00:27:16,287 --> 00:27:18,049
for days and days.

562
00:27:25,328 --> 00:27:27,922
Then the refrigerator's
compressor could've clicked on.

563
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:32,293
Yeah?

564
00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:37,065
I can hear you breathing, you-

565
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:48,447
If you asked me now,

566
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,351
I couldn't tell you why I called him.

567
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,495
Hello?

568
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:35,537
Who's this?

569
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:38,804
Tyler?

570
00:28:38,873 --> 00:28:40,432
Who is this?

571
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:43,238
Um, ahem, we met on the airplane.

572
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:45,245
We had the same suitcase.

573
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:48,542
Uh, the clever guy.

574
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:52,714
Oh, yeah. Right. OK?

575
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:54,584
I called a second ago.

576
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,648
There was no answer. I'm at a pay phone.

577
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:58,284
Yeah. I star-69ed you.

578
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,055
I never pick up my phone.

579
00:29:01,664 --> 00:29:03,461
So, what's up, man?

580
00:29:03,532 --> 00:29:06,729
Uh, well...

581
00:29:06,802 --> 00:29:09,236
you're not gonna believe this.

582
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:13,166
You know, man, it could be worse.

583
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:14,574
A woman could cut off your penis

584
00:29:14,645 --> 00:29:15,737
while you're sleeping

585
00:29:15,812 --> 00:29:17,073
and toss it out the window

586
00:29:17,147 --> 00:29:18,273
of a moving car.

587
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:19,872
There's always that.

588
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,611
I don't know, it’s just...

589
00:29:21,685 --> 00:29:23,118
when you buy furniture,

590
00:29:23,186 --> 00:29:24,585
you tell yourself, that's it.

591
00:29:24,655 --> 00:29:26,418
That's the last sofa I'm gonna need.

592
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,753
Whatever else happens,

593
00:29:27,825 --> 00:29:29,883
I've got that sofa problem handled.

594
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,395
I had it all.

595
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:33,261
I had a stereo that was very decent,

596
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,926
a wardrobe that was
getting very respectable.

597
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:39,301
I was close to being complete.

598
00:29:39,372 --> 00:29:40,770
Shit, man. Now it's all gone.

599
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,931
All gone.

600
00:29:42,007 --> 00:29:44,704
Hmm. All gone.

601
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:48,068
Do you know what a duvet is?

602
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:49,274
Comforter.

603
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:51,045
It's a blanket.

604
00:29:51,118 --> 00:29:52,175
Just a blanket.

605
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:54,083
Why do guys like you and I

606
00:29:54,154 --> 00:29:55,122
know what a duvet is?

607
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:57,656
Is this essential to our survival

608
00:29:57,724 --> 00:29:59,282
in the hunter-gatherer
sense of the word?

609
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,657
No.

610
00:30:00,728 --> 00:30:03,161
What are we, then?

611
00:30:03,229 --> 00:30:06,097
We're, uh, you know, consumers...

612
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:07,930
Right. We're consumers.

613
00:30:08,002 --> 00:30:11,403
We are by-products of
a lifestyle obsession.

614
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:13,770
Murder, crime, poverty-

615
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:15,570
these things don't concern me.

616
00:30:15,643 --> 00:30:18,874
What concerns me are
celebrity magazines,

617
00:30:18,946 --> 00:30:21,073
television with 500 channels,

618
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:23,082
some guy's name on my underwear.

619
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,811
Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra.

620
00:30:25,885 --> 00:30:26,818
Martha Stewart.

621
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:28,013
Fuck Martha Stewart.

622
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:30,854
Martha's polishing the
brass on the Titanic.

623
00:30:30,926 --> 00:30:32,325
It's all going down, man.

624
00:30:32,394 --> 00:30:34,828
So fuck off with your sofa units

625
00:30:34,896 --> 00:30:37,194
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

626
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:39,699
I say, never be complete.

627
00:30:39,768 --> 00:30:41,360
I say, stop being perfect.

628
00:30:41,436 --> 00:30:43,961
I say, let's... let's evolve.

629
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,904
Let the chips fall where they may.

630
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:50,640
But that's me, and I could be wrong.

631
00:30:50,714 --> 00:30:52,774
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

632
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,284
No. It’s just stuff.

633
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,340
It's not a tragedy, but...

634
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:56,511
Well, you did lose

635
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:59,182
a lot of versatile
solutions for modern living.

636
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,245
Fuck. You're right.

637
00:31:00,324 --> 00:31:01,689
No. I don't smoke.

638
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,927
My insurance is probably
gonna cover it, so...

639
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:13,563
What?

640
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:17,768
The things you own end up owning you.

641
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:21,374
But do what you like, man.

642
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:24,974
Oh, it's late.

643
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,847
Hey, thanks for the beer.

644
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,181
Yeah, man.

645
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:31,121
I should find a hotel.

646
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,122
Oh.

647
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:33,157
What?

648
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:34,124
What?

649
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:35,125
A hotel.

650
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:36,126
Yeah.

651
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,822
Just ask, man.

652
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:40,230
What are you talking about?

653
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,323
Oh, God.

654
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,833
3 pitchers of beer,

655
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,494
and you still can't ask.

656
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,197
What?

657
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:49,036
You called me 'cause you
needed a place to stay.

658
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:50,907
Oh, hey, no, no, no.

659
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:52,945
Yes, you did. So just ask.

660
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:55,311
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

661
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:59,347
Would that be a problem?

662
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,513
Is it a problem for you to ask?

663
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:04,422
Can I stay at your place?

664
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:05,423
Yeah.

665
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:07,893
Thanks.

666
00:32:11,868 --> 00:32:14,098
I want you to do me a favor.

667
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,295
Yeah, sure.

668
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,204
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

669
00:32:18,274 --> 00:32:20,242
What?

670
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,110
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

671
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,647
Let me tell you a little bit

672
00:32:25,715 --> 00:32:27,147
about Tyler Durden.

673
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:29,718
Tyler was a night person.

674
00:32:29,786 --> 00:32:30,981
While the rest of us were sleeping,

675
00:32:31,055 --> 00:32:32,078
he worked.

676
00:32:32,155 --> 00:32:35,284
He had one part-time
job as a projectionist.

677
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,156
See, a movie doesn't
come all on one big reel.

678
00:32:37,228 --> 00:32:38,388
It comes on a few.

679
00:32:38,462 --> 00:32:40,953
So someone has to be there
to switch the projectors

680
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:43,261
at the exact moment that one reel ends

681
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:44,596
and the next one begins.

682
00:32:44,668 --> 00:32:46,659
If you look for it, you
can see these little dots

683
00:32:46,737 --> 00:32:48,762
come into the upper right-hand
corner of the screen.

684
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,898
In the industry,

685
00:32:50,975 --> 00:32:52,272
we call them "cigarette burns."

686
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:54,403
That's the cue for a changeover.

687
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:55,911
He flips the projectors,

688
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,845
the movie keeps right on going,

689
00:32:57,915 --> 00:32:59,382
and nobody in the audience has any idea.

690
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:01,941
Why would anyone want this shit-job?

691
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:04,918
Because it affords him other
interesting opportunities.

692
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:07,019
Like splicing single
frames of pornography

693
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,485
into family films.

694
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:10,648
So when the snoot y cat
and the courageous dog

695
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:12,157
with the celebrity voices

696
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:14,216
meet for the first time in reel 3,

697
00:33:14,294 --> 00:33:15,523
that's when you'll catch a flash

698
00:33:15,596 --> 00:33:17,893
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

699
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:26,263
Nobody knows that they saw it,

700
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:27,399
but they did.

701
00:33:27,475 --> 00:33:29,942
A nice big cock.

702
00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:37,548
Even a hummingbird couldn't
catch Tyler at work.

703
00:33:42,325 --> 00:33:45,488
Tyler also works sometimes
as a banquet waiter

704
00:33:45,562 --> 00:33:47,894
at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.

705
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,367
He was the guerilla terrorist

706
00:33:54,438 --> 00:33:56,770
of the food service industry.

707
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:57,900
Do not watch.

708
00:33:57,976 --> 00:33:59,465
I cannot go when you watch.

709
00:33:59,543 --> 00:34:01,101
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,

710
00:34:01,178 --> 00:34:02,611
he farted on meringues,

711
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,113
sneezed on braised endive.

712
00:34:04,181 --> 00:34:05,739
And as for the cream of mushroom soup,

713
00:34:05,816 --> 00:34:06,908
well...

714
00:34:06,984 --> 00:34:08,418
Go ahead, tell them.

715
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:10,386
You get the idea.

716
00:34:10,488 --> 00:34:12,149
What do you want me to do?
You just want me to hit you?

717
00:34:12,223 --> 00:34:13,816
Come on. Do me this one favor.

718
00:34:13,892 --> 00:34:14,881
Why?

719
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,256
Why? I don't know why. I don't know.

720
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:17,294
I've never been in a fight. Have you?

721
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:18,794
No, but that's a good thing.

722
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:19,922
No, it is not.

723
00:34:19,998 --> 00:34:20,930
How much can you know about yourself

724
00:34:20,998 --> 00:34:22,431
if you’ve never been in a fight?

725
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,797
I don't wanna die without any scars.

726
00:34:23,868 --> 00:34:25,734
So, come on, hit me
before I lose my nerve.

727
00:34:25,804 --> 00:34:28,499
God, this is crazy.

728
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:30,165
So go crazy. Let 'er rip.

729
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:32,074
Hey, I don't know about this.

730
00:34:32,145 --> 00:34:34,374
I don't, either, but who gives a shit?

731
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:36,142
No one's watching. What do you care?

732
00:34:36,215 --> 00:34:38,444
Wait. This is crazy.
You want me to hit you?

733
00:34:38,517 --> 00:34:40,452
That's right.

734
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,954
What, like, in the face?

735
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:44,386
Surprise me.

736
00:34:46,325 --> 00:34:48,657
This is so fucking stupid.

737
00:34:57,705 --> 00:34:59,036
Ohh!

738
00:34:59,107 --> 00:35:01,940
Motherfucker!

739
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,944
You hit me in the ear.

740
00:35:04,012 --> 00:35:05,240
Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.

741
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:07,178
Ow! Christ!

742
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:08,943
Why the ear, man?

743
00:35:09,017 --> 00:35:10,075
Aw, I fucked it up.

744
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:11,175
No. That was perfect.

745
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:12,948
Ohh! Uhh!

746
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,224
Nah, it's all right.

747
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:28,861
That really hurts.

748
00:35:28,939 --> 00:35:31,771
Right.

749
00:35:31,841 --> 00:35:33,104
Hit me again.

750
00:35:34,344 --> 00:35:35,276
No. You hit me.

751
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:36,368
Come on.

752
00:35:52,996 --> 00:35:55,397
We should do this again sometime.

753
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:09,637
Where's your car?

754
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:10,738
What car?

755
00:36:21,395 --> 00:36:23,658
I don't know how Tyler found that house,

756
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,858
but he said he'd been there for a year.

757
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,992
It looked like it was
waiting to be torn down.

758
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:31,299
Most of the windows were boarded up.

759
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:33,636
There was no lock on the front door

760
00:36:33,707 --> 00:36:37,007
from when the police
or whoever kicked it in.

761
00:36:37,078 --> 00:36:38,772
The stairs were ready to collapse.

762
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:41,816
I didn't know if he owned
it or if he was squatting.

763
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:43,748
Neither would have surprised me.

764
00:36:44,985 --> 00:36:46,418
Yeah. That's you.

765
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:47,614
That's me.

766
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:49,486
That's the toilet.

767
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:50,489
Good?

768
00:36:50,558 --> 00:36:51,490
Yeah. Thanks.

769
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:54,456
What a shit-hole.

770
00:36:56,263 --> 00:36:57,959
Nothing worked.

771
00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:00,831
Turning on one light

772
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:03,837
meant another light
in the house went out.

773
00:37:03,905 --> 00:37:05,338
There were no neighbors,

774
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:07,431
just some warehouses and a paper mill-

775
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:09,306
that fart smell of steam,

776
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:11,709
the hamster cage smell of wood chips.

777
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,806
After work tomorrow, we'll be-

778
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:15,851
Hey. What have we here?

779
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:31,798
Hey, guys.

780
00:37:31,867 --> 00:37:32,961
Hey.

781
00:37:33,037 --> 00:37:34,197
It's cool.

782
00:37:34,272 --> 00:37:35,262
Ohh!

783
00:37:44,048 --> 00:37:47,677
Every time it rained,
we had to kill the power.

784
00:37:47,752 --> 00:37:49,276
By the end of the first month,

785
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:51,050
I didn't miss TV.

786
00:37:51,123 --> 00:37:55,423
I didn't even mind the
warm, stale refrigerator.

787
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:09,905
Can I be next?

788
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:15,305
All right, man.

789
00:38:15,382 --> 00:38:17,577
Lose the tie.

790
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:22,418
Ooh!

791
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:24,081
At night, Tyler and I were alone

792
00:38:24,157 --> 00:38:26,421
for a half a mile in every direction.

793
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,834
Rain trickled down through the plaster

794
00:38:34,902 --> 00:38:36,335
and the light fixtures.

795
00:38:36,404 --> 00:38:38,236
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.

796
00:38:38,307 --> 00:38:42,242
Everywhere were rusted
nails to snag your elbow on.

797
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,609
The previous occupant had
been a bit of a shut-in.

798
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,409
Hey, man, what are you reading?

799
00:38:47,481 --> 00:38:48,539
Listen to this.

800
00:38:48,616 --> 00:38:50,517
It's an article written by an organ

801
00:38:50,585 --> 00:38:52,017
in the first person.

802
00:38:52,086 --> 00:38:54,649
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata.

803
00:38:54,725 --> 00:38:56,352
Without me, Jack could not regulate

804
00:38:56,426 --> 00:38:58,587
his heart rate, blood
pressure, or breathing."

805
00:38:58,661 --> 00:39:01,062
There's a whole series of these.

806
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:02,495
"I am Jill's nipples."

807
00:39:03,933 --> 00:39:06,027
"I am Jack's colon."

808
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:08,502
Yeah. "I get cancer. I kill Jack."

809
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,769
Whoa-Ohh!

810
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:13,105
After fighting,

811
00:39:13,178 --> 00:39:15,408
everything else in your life
got the volume turned down.

812
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:19,914
What?

813
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,417
You could deal with anything.

814
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:22,919
Have you finished those reports?

815
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:28,922
If you could fight anyone,

816
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:30,221
who would you fight?

817
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:32,729
I'd fight my boss, probably.

818
00:39:32,797 --> 00:39:34,162
Really?

819
00:39:34,232 --> 00:39:36,792
Yeah. Why, who would you fight?

820
00:39:36,868 --> 00:39:38,028
I'd fight my dad.

821
00:39:38,103 --> 00:39:39,900
I don't know my dad.

822
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:41,769
I mean, I know him,

823
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:44,673
but he left when I
was, like, 6 years old,

824
00:39:44,743 --> 00:39:47,178
married this other woman
and had some other kids.

825
00:39:47,246 --> 00:39:48,906
He, like, did this every 6 years.

826
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,847
He goes to a new city
and starts a new family.

827
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:54,044
Fucker should open up franchises.

828
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:57,113
My dad never went to college,

829
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:59,623
so it was real important that I go.

830
00:39:59,692 --> 00:40:00,750
That sounds familiar.

831
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:02,954
So I graduate, I call
him up long distance.

832
00:40:03,029 --> 00:40:06,464
I say, "Dad, now what?"
He says, "Get a job."

833
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:07,464
Same here.

834
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:08,558
Now I'm 25.

835
00:40:08,635 --> 00:40:09,966
I make my yearly call again.

836
00:40:10,036 --> 00:40:12,265
I say, "Dad, now what?"

837
00:40:12,338 --> 00:40:14,741
He says, "I don't know. Get married."

838
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,743
Eh, I mean...

839
00:40:16,811 --> 00:40:18,039
I can't get married.

840
00:40:19,214 --> 00:40:20,875
I'm a
30-year-old boy.

841
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:22,472
We're a generation of men

842
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,710
raised by women.

843
00:40:23,785 --> 00:40:26,152
I'm wondering if another woman

844
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:28,018
is really the answer we need.

845
00:40:33,496 --> 00:40:36,693
Most of the week, we
were Ozzie and Harriet.

846
00:40:38,234 --> 00:40:39,435
But every Saturday night,

847
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:42,803
we were finding something out.

848
00:40:42,872 --> 00:40:45,033
We were finding out more and more

849
00:40:45,107 --> 00:40:46,199
that we were not alone.

850
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:50,073
Who turned the lights off?

851
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:51,408
It used to be

852
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:53,142
that when I came home
angry or depressed,

853
00:40:53,216 --> 00:40:54,877
l’d just clean my condo,

854
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:56,919
polish my Scandinavian furniture.

855
00:40:56,986 --> 00:40:59,386
I should've been
looking for a new condo.

856
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:02,186
I should've been haggling
with my insurance company.

857
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:06,058
I should've been upset about my
nice, neat flaming little shit.

858
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:07,619
But I wasn't.

859
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,096
The basic premise

860
00:41:09,165 --> 00:41:10,962
of cyber-netting any office

861
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:12,126
is make things more efficient.

862
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:13,465
Monday mornings, all I could do

863
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:14,595
was think about next week.

864
00:41:14,671 --> 00:41:17,835
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

865
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,069
Absolutely.

866
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,442
Efficiency is priority
number one, people,

867
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:25,312
because waste is a thief.

868
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:27,043
I showed this already to my man, here.

869
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,449
You liked it, didn't you?

870
00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:34,154
You can swallow a pint of blood

871
00:41:34,227 --> 00:41:35,660
before you get sick.

872
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,521
It was right in everyone's face.

873
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,726
Tyler and I just made it visible.

874
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:44,031
It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.

875
00:41:44,104 --> 00:41:46,004
Tyler and I just gave it a name.

876
00:41:57,618 --> 00:42:00,451
Come on, people, you gotta go home.

877
00:42:21,043 --> 00:42:23,977
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

878
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:48,270
Every week, Tyler gave the rules

879
00:42:48,338 --> 00:42:49,635
that he and I decided.

880
00:42:49,706 --> 00:42:53,235
Gentlemen, welcome to Fight Club.

881
00:42:56,181 --> 00:42:58,046
The first rule of Fight Club is...

882
00:42:58,116 --> 00:43:00,584
you do not talk about Fight Club.

883
00:43:00,652 --> 00:43:03,450
The second rule of Fight Club is...

884
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:07,116
you do not talk about Fight Club.

885
00:43:07,192 --> 00:43:08,626
Third rule of Fight Club-

886
00:43:08,694 --> 00:43:12,390
Someone yells "Stop!"
Goes limp, taps out,

887
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,990
the fight is over.

888
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:15,226
Fourth rule-

889
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,633
Only 2 guys to a fight.

890
00:43:17,703 --> 00:43:18,693
Fifth rule-

891
00:43:18,772 --> 00:43:21,239
One fight at a time, fellas.

892
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,936
Sixth rule
- No shirts, no shoes.

893
00:43:25,012 --> 00:43:26,103
Seventh rule-

894
00:43:26,178 --> 00:43:28,874
Fights will go on as
long as they have to.

895
00:43:30,884 --> 00:43:33,317
And the eighth and final rule-

896
00:43:33,386 --> 00:43:37,846
If this is your first
night at Fight Club...

897
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:39,481
you have to fight.

898
00:43:44,063 --> 00:43:45,998
This kid from work, Rick y,

899
00:43:46,066 --> 00:43:47,897
couldn't remember
whether you ordered pens

900
00:43:47,968 --> 00:43:49,127
with blue ink or black...

901
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:51,729
Come on, man!

902
00:43:51,805 --> 00:43:53,501
But Ricky was a god for 10 minutes

903
00:43:53,574 --> 00:43:56,168
when the trounced the maitre
d' of a local food court.

904
00:43:58,379 --> 00:44:00,176
Sometimes, all you could hear

905
00:44:00,248 --> 00:44:02,478
were the flat, hard packing sounds

906
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:03,642
over the yelling...

907
00:44:07,088 --> 00:44:10,057
or the wet choke when
someone caught their breath

908
00:44:10,124 --> 00:44:11,056
and sprayed...

909
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:12,285
Stop!

910
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,297
You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.

911
00:44:15,365 --> 00:44:16,730
But Fight Club only exists

912
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,030
in the hours between
when Fight Club starts

913
00:44:19,102 --> 00:44:20,933
and when Fight Club ends.

914
00:44:21,004 --> 00:44:24,098
Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,

915
00:44:24,174 --> 00:44:26,074
I wouldn't be talking to the same man.

916
00:44:26,142 --> 00:44:27,701
Who you were in Fight Club

917
00:44:27,778 --> 00:44:29,870
is not who you were in
the rest of the world.

918
00:44:29,946 --> 00:44:32,814
The guy who came to Fight
Club for the first time,

919
00:44:32,883 --> 00:44:34,875
his ass was a wad of cookie dough.

920
00:44:34,952 --> 00:44:36,249
After a few weeks,

921
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,878
he was carved out of wood.

922
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:39,981
If you could fight any celebrity,

923
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:41,490
who would you fight?

924
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:42,617
Alive or dead?

925
00:44:42,693 --> 00:44:45,162
It doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

926
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,060
Hemingway.

927
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:49,657
You?

928
00:44:49,735 --> 00:44:50,827
Shatner.

929
00:44:50,902 --> 00:44:53,096
I'd fight William Shatner.

930
00:44:54,606 --> 00:44:57,166
We all started seeing
things differently.

931
00:44:57,242 --> 00:44:59,004
Everywhere we went,

932
00:44:59,076 --> 00:45:01,238
we were sizing things up.

933
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,041
I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,

934
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,554
trying to look like how Calvin Klein

935
00:45:10,622 --> 00:45:12,487
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.

936
00:45:12,557 --> 00:45:14,048
Is that what a man looks like?

937
00:45:15,194 --> 00:45:18,129
Ahh. Self-improvement is masturbation.

938
00:45:18,197 --> 00:45:20,598
And self-destruction.

939
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:22,190
Excuse me.

940
00:45:33,346 --> 00:45:34,781
Kick his ass!

941
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:36,317
Hit him again, man! Come on! Hit him!

942
00:45:56,438 --> 00:45:59,806
Fight Club wasn't
about winning or losing.

943
00:45:59,876 --> 00:46:01,866
It wasn't about words.

944
00:46:04,748 --> 00:46:07,147
The hysterical shouting was in tongues,

945
00:46:07,216 --> 00:46:09,378
Like in a Pentecostal church.

946
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:15,758
- Is that it?
- Stop!

947
00:46:15,826 --> 00:46:17,817
When the fight was over,

948
00:46:17,894 --> 00:46:19,828
nothing was solved,

949
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:21,386
but nothing mattered.

950
00:46:21,464 --> 00:46:22,897
Hey, cool.

951
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:28,630
Afterwards, we all felt saved.

952
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:30,798
Hey, man, how about next week?

953
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:32,307
How about next month?

954
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:33,569
I hear you.

955
00:46:33,643 --> 00:46:34,805
Irwin, you're in the middle.

956
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,211
New guy. You, too.

957
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:41,079
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.

958
00:46:41,153 --> 00:46:43,120
He fell down some stairs.

959
00:46:43,187 --> 00:46:45,748
I fell down some stairs.

960
00:46:47,925 --> 00:46:50,257
Fight Club became the
reason to cut your hair short

961
00:46:50,328 --> 00:46:52,660
or trim your fingernails.

962
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:55,200
OK. Any historical figure.

963
00:46:55,268 --> 00:46:57,100
I'd fight Gandhi.

964
00:46:58,705 --> 00:46:59,637
Good answer.

965
00:46:59,706 --> 00:47:00,764
How about you?

966
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,967
Lincoln.

967
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:03,441
Lincoln?

968
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,635
Mm.

969
00:47:04,711 --> 00:47:06,110
Big guy, big reach.

970
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:08,410
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

971
00:47:08,482 --> 00:47:09,880
Fuck.

972
00:47:12,052 --> 00:47:14,817
Hey. Even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

973
00:47:23,598 --> 00:47:25,190
Hello.

974
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:26,256
Where have you been

975
00:47:26,334 --> 00:47:28,165
the last 8 weeks?

976
00:47:28,236 --> 00:47:29,533
Marla?

977
00:47:32,742 --> 00:47:34,174
How'd you find me?

978
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:35,675
You left that forwarding number.

979
00:47:35,744 --> 00:47:38,577
I haven't seen you
in any support groups.

980
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,080
We split them up.

981
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,116
That was the idea, remember?

982
00:47:42,183 --> 00:47:44,981
Yeah, but you haven't
been going to yours.

983
00:47:45,053 --> 00:47:46,748
How do you know?

984
00:47:46,821 --> 00:47:48,550
I cheated.

985
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:50,420
I found a new one.

986
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,255
Really?

987
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,316
It's for men only.

988
00:47:53,395 --> 00:47:54,989
Like the testicle thing?

989
00:47:55,065 --> 00:47:56,190
Waaah!

990
00:47:59,436 --> 00:48:00,767
Look, this is a bad time.

991
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:03,327
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

992
00:48:03,406 --> 00:48:05,500
You wanna see some
really fucked up people?

993
00:48:05,575 --> 00:48:06,940
I'm just on my way out.

994
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:07,941
Me, too.

995
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,999
I've got a stomach-full of Xanax.

996
00:48:09,078 --> 00:48:11,809
I took what was left of a bottle.

997
00:48:11,882 --> 00:48:13,940
It might have been too much.

998
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,782
Just picture watching Marla Singer

999
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:17,736
throw herself around
her crummy apartment.

1000
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:19,860
But this isn't a
for-real suicide thing.

1001
00:48:19,937 --> 00:48:22,270
This is probably one of
those cry-for-help things.

1002
00:48:22,341 --> 00:48:23,774
This could go on for hours.

1003
00:48:23,842 --> 00:48:25,274
So you're staying in tonight, then?

1004
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,777
Do you wanna wait

1005
00:48:26,845 --> 00:48:28,210
and hear me describe death?

1006
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,713
Do you wanna listen

1007
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:33,115
and see if my spirit can use a phone?

1008
00:48:34,687 --> 00:48:37,622
Have you ever heard
a death rattle before?

1009
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:05,541
Tyler's door was closed.

1010
00:49:05,618 --> 00:49:07,142
I'd been living here for 2 months,

1011
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,745
and Tyler's door was never closed.

1012
00:49:14,996 --> 00:49:17,156
You won't believe this
dream I had last night.

1013
00:49:17,231 --> 00:49:20,224
Yeah, I can hardly believe
anything about last night.

1014
00:49:30,078 --> 00:49:31,978
What-What are you doing here?

1015
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:36,845
What?

1016
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,319
This is my house. What
are you doing in my house?

1017
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:42,826
Fuck you.

1018
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:58,335
Ha ha! Ohh...

1019
00:49:58,409 --> 00:50:01,777
Oh, you got some fucked-up
friends, I'm tellin' you.

1020
00:50:02,847 --> 00:50:04,474
Limber, though...

1021
00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:05,846
silly coos.

1022
00:50:07,553 --> 00:50:09,986
So, I come in last night.
Phone's off the hook.

1023
00:50:10,054 --> 00:50:11,886
Guess who's on the other end.

1024
00:50:11,957 --> 00:50:14,117
I already knew the story
before he told it to me.

1025
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:20,061
Have you ever heard
a death rattle before?

1026
00:50:20,131 --> 00:50:22,999
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

1027
00:50:23,068 --> 00:50:27,060
Or will it just be a death... hairball?

1028
00:50:30,276 --> 00:50:34,042
Prepare... to evacuate soul.

1029
00:50:36,016 --> 00:50:37,642
9...

1030
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:38,684
8...

1031
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:41,084
Now, how could Tyler, of all people,

1032
00:50:41,154 --> 00:50:45,284
think it was a bad thing that
Marla Singer was about to die?

1033
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:47,258
5...

1034
00:50:47,327 --> 00:50:49,227
4...

1035
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,059
3... Oh, hang on.

1036
00:50:56,838 --> 00:50:58,897
You got here fast.

1037
00:51:00,509 --> 00:51:02,636
Did I call you?

1038
00:51:04,313 --> 00:51:05,245
Huh?

1039
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:07,313
Hey.

1040
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:16,386
The mattress is all
sealed in slippery plastic.

1041
00:51:19,662 --> 00:51:22,893
Oh, don't worry. It's
not a threat to you.

1042
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:26,767
Oh, fuck.

1043
00:51:26,837 --> 00:51:29,066
Somebody called the cops.

1044
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,582
Hey, where's 513?

1045
00:51:42,653 --> 00:51:45,087
End of the hall.

1046
00:51:45,155 --> 00:51:46,644
You know, the girl who lives there

1047
00:51:46,723 --> 00:51:49,056
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

1048
00:51:49,126 --> 00:51:51,320
She's lost faith in herself.

1049
00:51:51,394 --> 00:51:52,327
Miss Singer!

1050
00:51:52,396 --> 00:51:54,227
She's a monster.

1051
00:51:54,298 --> 00:51:55,926
You have every reason to live!

1052
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:58,435
She's infectious human waste!

1053
00:51:58,503 --> 00:51:59,435
Miss Singer!

1054
00:51:59,504 --> 00:52:01,472
Good luck trying to save her!

1055
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,574
If I fall asleep, I'm done for.

1056
00:52:13,018 --> 00:52:15,921
You're gonna have to keep me up...

1057
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:17,980
all... night.

1058
00:52:18,058 --> 00:52:20,424
Un-fucking-believable.

1059
00:52:20,494 --> 00:52:22,655
He was obviously able to handle it.

1060
00:52:22,729 --> 00:52:23,890
You know what I mean. You fucked her.

1061
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:26,460
No, I didn't.

1062
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:28,023
Never?

1063
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:29,033
No.

1064
00:52:30,405 --> 00:52:31,666
You're not into her, are you?

1065
00:52:31,738 --> 00:52:34,138
No! God, not at all.

1066
00:52:34,207 --> 00:52:36,541
I am Jack’s raging bile duct.

1067
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,602
Are you sure? You can tell me.

1068
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:40,170
Believe me, I'm sure.

1069
00:52:40,249 --> 00:52:41,216
Put a gun to my head

1070
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,147
and paint the walls with my brains.

1071
00:52:43,217 --> 00:52:44,411
That's good, 'cause she's a predator

1072
00:52:44,485 --> 00:52:45,885
posing as a house pet.

1073
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,979
Stay away from that one.

1074
00:52:49,957 --> 00:52:51,391
And the shit that came
out of this woman's mouth

1075
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,392
I ain't never heard.

1076
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:53,655
My God.

1077
00:52:53,729 --> 00:52:56,596
I haven't been fucked like
that since grade school.

1078
00:52:57,699 --> 00:52:58,723
Uhh!

1079
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,597
How could Tyler not go for that?

1080
00:53:00,668 --> 00:53:02,136
The night before last, he was splicing

1081
00:53:02,204 --> 00:53:04,001
sex organs into Cinderella.

1082
00:53:04,073 --> 00:53:05,131
Marla doesn't need a lover.

1083
00:53:05,207 --> 00:53:06,674
She needs a fucking case worker.

1084
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:09,370
She needs a wash. And she's
in love with sport fuckin'.

1085
00:53:09,445 --> 00:53:11,572
She invaded my support groups.

1086
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,080
Now she'd invaded my home.

1087
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,082
Hey, hey. Sit down.

1088
00:53:19,389 --> 00:53:22,017
Now, listen. Can't have
you talking to her about me.

1089
00:53:22,093 --> 00:53:23,423
Why would I talk to her-

1090
00:53:23,493 --> 00:53:25,484
You say anything about me
or what goes on in this house

1091
00:53:25,562 --> 00:53:28,895
to her or to anybody, we're done.

1092
00:53:28,965 --> 00:53:30,159
Now, promise me.

1093
00:53:30,233 --> 00:53:31,165
OK.

1094
00:53:31,234 --> 00:53:32,166
You promise?

1095
00:53:32,235 --> 00:53:34,101
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise.

1096
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:35,662
I just said I promise.

1097
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,332
That's 3 times you promised.

1098
00:53:39,745 --> 00:53:41,644
If only I had wasted a couple of minutes

1099
00:53:41,713 --> 00:53:43,875
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,

1100
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,508
none of this would've happened.

1101
00:53:45,585 --> 00:53:48,451
Unhh! Unhh! Unhh!

1102
00:53:48,521 --> 00:53:49,453
Unhh!

1103
00:53:50,523 --> 00:53:52,990
Yeah! Oh! Harder! Harder!

1104
00:53:53,058 --> 00:53:55,027
Yeah! Ooh! Aah!

1105
00:53:55,094 --> 00:53:57,722
Aah! Ohh! Aah!

1106
00:54:01,034 --> 00:54:03,467
I could've moved to another room...

1107
00:54:03,536 --> 00:54:06,404
on the third floor, where
I might not have heard them.

1108
00:54:06,473 --> 00:54:07,405
Oh, baby!

1109
00:54:07,474 --> 00:54:09,100
But I didn't.

1110
00:54:17,885 --> 00:54:18,817
Ohh!

1111
00:54:18,886 --> 00:54:22,287
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1112
00:54:22,356 --> 00:54:24,517
Ohh! Ohh! Aaahh!

1113
00:54:24,591 --> 00:54:26,582
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1114
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:30,725
- Aah! Ohhh! Ohh!
- Ow!

1115
00:54:31,832 --> 00:54:32,764
Ohh!

1116
00:54:33,834 --> 00:54:35,461
What are you doin'?

1117
00:54:35,536 --> 00:54:37,903
Just goin' to bed.

1118
00:54:38,973 --> 00:54:40,406
Want to finish her off?

1119
00:54:40,475 --> 00:54:41,407
Uhh... oh!

1120
00:54:42,578 --> 00:54:43,509
No.

1121
00:54:43,578 --> 00:54:44,510
No, thank you.

1122
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:46,513
I found the cigarettes.

1123
00:54:46,581 --> 00:54:48,846
Who are you talking to?

1124
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:49,975
Shut up.

1125
00:54:50,051 --> 00:54:53,021
I became the calm little
center of the world.

1126
00:54:54,423 --> 00:54:56,016
I was the Zen master.

1127
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:57,788
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1128
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:03,963
I wrote little haiku poems.

1129
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:05,764
I e-mailed them to everyone.

1130
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,266
Is that your blood?

1131
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,106
Some of it, yeah.

1132
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:13,700
You can't smoke in here.

1133
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:17,177
Take the rest of the day off.

1134
00:55:17,249 --> 00:55:19,809
Come back Monday with
some clean clothes.

1135
00:55:19,885 --> 00:55:21,318
Get yourself together.

1136
00:55:21,386 --> 00:55:24,480
I got right in everyone's
hostile little face.

1137
00:55:24,556 --> 00:55:26,820
Yes, these are bruises from fighting.

1138
00:55:26,892 --> 00:55:28,985
Yes, I'm comfortable with that.

1139
00:55:29,061 --> 00:55:30,528
I... am enlightened.

1140
00:55:33,232 --> 00:55:34,927
You give up the condo life...

1141
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,833
give up all your flaming
worldly possessions...

1142
00:55:37,903 --> 00:55:39,598
go live in a dilapidated house

1143
00:55:39,672 --> 00:55:41,798
in a toxic waste part of town...

1144
00:55:41,873 --> 00:55:44,171
and you have to come home to this.

1145
00:55:44,243 --> 00:55:45,506
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1146
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:53,409
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1147
00:55:56,156 --> 00:55:57,088
Hello?

1148
00:55:57,157 --> 00:55:58,521
Yes. This is Detective Stern

1149
00:55:58,591 --> 00:56:00,422
with the Arson Unit.

1150
00:56:00,493 --> 00:56:01,688
We have some new information

1151
00:56:01,762 --> 00:56:04,127
about the incident at your former condo.

1152
00:56:04,197 --> 00:56:05,221
Yes?

1153
00:56:05,298 --> 00:56:06,459
I don't know if you’re aware,

1154
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:08,865
but it seems that someone sprayed Freon

1155
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:10,232
into your front door lock,

1156
00:56:10,303 --> 00:56:13,603
then tapped it with a chisel
to shatter the cylinder.

1157
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:15,265
No, I wasn't aware of that at all.

1158
00:56:15,341 --> 00:56:17,174
I am Jack’s cold sweat.

1159
00:56:17,308 --> 00:56:19,435
Does this sound strange to you?

1160
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,409
Uh, yes, sir. Strange. Very strange.

1161
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:22,410
The dynamite-

1162
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,411
Dynamite?

1163
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,538
Left a residue

1164
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:27,743
of ammonium oxalate potassium chloride.

1165
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:29,786
Do you know what this means?

1166
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,320
No. What does it mean?

1167
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,288
It means it was homemade.

1168
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:36,015
I'm sorry. This is just coming

1169
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:37,652
as quite a shock to me, sir.

1170
00:56:37,729 --> 00:56:39,697
See, whoever set this homemade dynamite

1171
00:56:39,764 --> 00:56:41,322
could've blown out your pilot light

1172
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,265
days before the actual explosion.

1173
00:56:43,336 --> 00:56:45,166
The gas was just the detonator.

1174
00:56:45,237 --> 00:56:46,636
Who would go and do such a thing?

1175
00:56:46,705 --> 00:56:47,967
I'll ask the questions.

1176
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:50,303
Tell him. Tell him the liberator

1177
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:53,105
who destroyed my property
has realigned my perception.

1178
00:56:53,178 --> 00:56:54,840
Excuse me. Are you there?

1179
00:56:54,914 --> 00:56:56,847
No, I am listening. It's
a little hard to know

1180
00:56:56,915 --> 00:56:58,280
what to make of all this.

1181
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,478
Have you recently made
enemies with anyone

1182
00:57:00,553 --> 00:57:02,850
who might have access
to homemade dynamite?

1183
00:57:02,921 --> 00:57:04,013
- Enemies?
- Reject the basic

1184
00:57:04,089 --> 00:57:05,523
assumption of civilization,

1185
00:57:05,591 --> 00:57:07,387
especially the importance
of material possessions.

1186
00:57:07,459 --> 00:57:08,892
Son, this is serious.

1187
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,326
Yes, I know it's serious.

1188
00:57:10,396 --> 00:57:11,328
I mean that.

1189
00:57:11,397 --> 00:57:12,988
Yes, it's very serious.

1190
00:57:13,064 --> 00:57:16,000
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.

1191
00:57:16,068 --> 00:57:18,366
That condo was my life.

1192
00:57:18,437 --> 00:57:22,397
OK? I loved every stick
of furniture in that place.

1193
00:57:22,476 --> 00:57:24,375
That was not just a bunch of stuff

1194
00:57:24,443 --> 00:57:25,536
that got destroyed.

1195
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:26,636
It was me!

1196
00:57:26,713 --> 00:57:28,146
I'd like to thank the Academy.

1197
00:57:28,215 --> 00:57:29,875
Is this not a good time for you?

1198
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:31,713
Just tell him you fuckin' did it.

1199
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:32,717
Shhh!

1200
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:34,310
Tell him you blew it all up.

1201
00:57:34,388 --> 00:57:36,950
That's what he wants to hear.

1202
00:57:37,026 --> 00:57:38,288
Are you still there?

1203
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,954
Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?

1204
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:43,624
No, no. I may need to talk
to you a little further,

1205
00:57:43,699 --> 00:57:45,633
so how about you just lettin' me
know if you’re gonna leave town?

1206
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:46,794
OK?

1207
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:47,961
OK.

1208
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:52,734
Except for their humping,

1209
00:57:52,808 --> 00:57:55,572
Tyler and Marla were
never in the same room.

1210
00:57:55,644 --> 00:57:58,671
My parents pulled this
exact same act for years.

1211
00:57:58,748 --> 00:58:02,583
The condom is the glass
slipper of our generation.

1212
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:05,587
You slip one on when
you meet a stranger.

1213
00:58:05,655 --> 00:58:08,056
You... dance all night.

1214
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:10,285
Then you throw it away.

1215
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,760
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

1216
00:58:14,165 --> 00:58:15,631
What?

1217
00:58:20,504 --> 00:58:23,301
I got this dress at a
thrift store for $1.00.

1218
00:58:23,373 --> 00:58:25,274
It was worth every penny.

1219
00:58:25,343 --> 00:58:27,242
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

1220
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,771
Someone loved it... intensely

1221
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:34,282
for one day...

1222
00:58:34,352 --> 00:58:35,819
then tossed it.

1223
00:58:37,923 --> 00:58:40,118
Like a Christmas tree...

1224
00:58:40,192 --> 00:58:41,682
so special...

1225
00:58:42,928 --> 00:58:45,488
then... bam...

1226
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,124
it's on the side of the road...

1227
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,464
tinsel still clinging to it...

1228
00:58:52,371 --> 00:58:55,272
Like a sex crime victim...

1229
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,867
underwear inside out...

1230
00:58:57,945 --> 00:58:59,776
bound with electrical tape.

1231
00:58:59,847 --> 00:59:01,110
Well, then it suits you.

1232
00:59:02,349 --> 00:59:04,180
You can borrow it sometime.

1233
00:59:11,659 --> 00:59:12,920
Get rid of her.

1234
00:59:14,161 --> 00:59:15,423
Why can't you get rid of her?

1235
00:59:15,496 --> 00:59:16,657
Don't mention me.

1236
00:59:16,731 --> 00:59:18,256
I'm 6 years old again,

1237
00:59:18,334 --> 00:59:20,563
passing messages between parents.

1238
00:59:24,506 --> 00:59:26,098
I really think it's
time you got out of here.

1239
00:59:26,174 --> 00:59:27,403
Don't worry. I'm leaving.

1240
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:28,408
Not that we don't love
your little visits.

1241
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:29,876
You are such a nut case.

1242
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:31,468
I can't even begin to keep up.

1243
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:36,279
<i>Gotta get off</i>

1244
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:37,443
Thanks. Bye.

1245
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:43,356
<i>Gotta get off
this merry-go-round</i>

1246
00:59:48,464 --> 00:59:50,523
<i>Gotta get on where</i>

1247
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:54,100
You kids.

1248
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:57,402
Wh... Why do you still
waste time with her?

1249
00:59:59,709 --> 01:00:01,199
I'll say this about Marla-

1250
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:03,405
at least she's tryin' to hit bottom.

1251
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,811
What, and I'm not?

1252
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:05,973
Stickin' feathers up your butt

1253
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:07,073
does not make you a chicken.

1254
01:00:08,552 --> 01:00:09,884
What are we doin' tonight?

1255
01:00:09,954 --> 01:00:11,648
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

1256
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:13,712
We make soap.

1257
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:14,883
Really.

1258
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:16,016
To make soap, first we render fat.

1259
01:00:36,575 --> 01:00:38,441
The salt balance has to be just right,

1260
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:41,206
so the best fat for making
soap comes from humans.

1261
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:43,543
Wait. What is this place?

1262
01:00:43,617 --> 01:00:45,083
A liposuction clinic.

1263
01:00:53,426 --> 01:00:54,484
Aha! Pay dirt.

1264
01:00:55,595 --> 01:00:58,723
The richest, creamiest fat in the world.

1265
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:00,197
Fat of the land.

1266
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,573
Come on.

1267
01:01:13,147 --> 01:01:14,670
Oh, God! Oh!

1268
01:01:14,748 --> 01:01:16,375
Get another one. Unhh!

1269
01:01:22,957 --> 01:01:25,050
As the fat renders, the
tallows float to the surface.

1270
01:01:25,126 --> 01:01:26,889
Like in Boy Scouts.

1271
01:01:26,961 --> 01:01:29,362
I can imagine you as a Boy Scout.

1272
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:30,420
Keep stirrin'.

1273
01:01:33,401 --> 01:01:34,699
Once the tallow hardens,

1274
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:36,964
we skim off a layer of glycerin.

1275
01:01:37,038 --> 01:01:39,372
If you were to add nitric
acid, you got nitroglycerin.

1276
01:01:39,442 --> 01:01:40,705
If you were then to add sodium nitrate

1277
01:01:40,778 --> 01:01:43,405
and a dash of sawdust, you got dynamite.

1278
01:01:43,479 --> 01:01:45,277
Yeah, with enough soap,

1279
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:47,647
we could blow up just about anything.

1280
01:01:47,718 --> 01:01:49,651
Tyler was full of useful information.

1281
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:52,120
Now, ancient peoples found
that clothes got cleaner

1282
01:01:52,189 --> 01:01:53,985
when they washed them at a
certain point in the river.

1283
01:01:54,057 --> 01:01:55,616
- You know why?
- No.

1284
01:01:59,296 --> 01:02:00,855
Human sacrifices were once made

1285
01:02:00,932 --> 01:02:02,297
on the hills above this river.

1286
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:04,528
Bodies burned. Water seeped
into the wood and ashes

1287
01:02:04,602 --> 01:02:06,263
to create lye.

1288
01:02:06,337 --> 01:02:08,635
This is lye, the crucial ingredient.

1289
01:02:08,707 --> 01:02:10,436
Once it mixed with the
melted fat of bodies,

1290
01:02:10,508 --> 01:02:11,975
a thick, white, soapy discharge

1291
01:02:12,043 --> 01:02:14,443
crept into the river. May
I see your hand, please?

1292
01:02:22,587 --> 01:02:23,781
What is this?

1293
01:02:23,855 --> 01:02:25,288
This... is chemical burn.

1294
01:02:25,356 --> 01:02:26,448
Uh-Aah! Aah!

1295
01:02:26,524 --> 01:02:28,389
It'll hurt more than
you've ever been burned,

1296
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,018
and you will have a scar.

1297
01:02:30,095 --> 01:02:33,497
If meditation worked for
cancer, it could work for this.

1298
01:02:33,566 --> 01:02:35,328
Stay with the pain.
Don't shove to center.

1299
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,027
No, no! Oh, God!

1300
01:02:37,102 --> 01:02:38,503
Look at your hand.

1301
01:02:38,572 --> 01:02:39,936
The first soap was made
from the ashes of heroes,

1302
01:02:40,005 --> 01:02:41,563
Like the first monkey shot into space.

1303
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,302
Without pain, without sacrifice,

1304
01:02:43,376 --> 01:02:44,673
we would have nothin'.

1305
01:02:44,745 --> 01:02:47,679
I tried not to think of the
the words "sear" or "flesh."

1306
01:02:47,747 --> 01:02:49,272
Stop it! This is your pain.

1307
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:50,907
This is your burning
hand. It's right here.

1308
01:02:50,983 --> 01:02:52,041
I'm going to my cave.

1309
01:02:52,118 --> 01:02:53,677
I'm going to my cave
and find my power animal.

1310
01:02:53,754 --> 01:02:56,813
No! Don't deal with it the
way those dead people do!

1311
01:02:56,889 --> 01:02:57,823
Come on!

1312
01:02:57,892 --> 01:02:59,053
I get the point! OK! Please!

1313
01:02:59,128 --> 01:03:00,720
No. What you're feeling
is premature enlightenment.

1314
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,265
This is the greatest
moment of your life, man,

1315
01:03:07,336 --> 01:03:10,362
and you're off somewhere-

1316
01:03:10,439 --> 01:03:11,906
Shut up.

1317
01:03:11,974 --> 01:03:13,441
Our fathers were our models for God.

1318
01:03:13,509 --> 01:03:14,770
If our fathers bailed,

1319
01:03:14,843 --> 01:03:16,640
what does that tell you about God?

1320
01:03:16,712 --> 01:03:17,645
No, no.

1321
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:19,409
Listen to me.

1322
01:03:19,482 --> 01:03:21,416
You have to consider the possibility

1323
01:03:21,484 --> 01:03:23,543
that God does not like you,

1324
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:24,678
He never wanted you.

1325
01:03:24,754 --> 01:03:27,120
In all probability, He hates you.

1326
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:29,021
This is not the worst
thing that can happen.

1327
01:03:29,092 --> 01:03:30,788
We don't need Him.

1328
01:03:30,861 --> 01:03:31,884
We don't! I agree!

1329
01:03:31,961 --> 01:03:33,758
Fuck damnation, man. Fuck redemption.

1330
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:35,263
We are God's unwanted children?

1331
01:03:35,331 --> 01:03:36,424
So be it!

1332
01:03:37,867 --> 01:03:39,698
Listen! You can run water over your hand

1333
01:03:39,769 --> 01:03:42,068
to make it worse,
or- Look at me-

1334
01:03:42,139 --> 01:03:44,402
or you can use vinegar
to neutralize the burn.

1335
01:03:44,474 --> 01:03:45,702
Please let me have some! Please!

1336
01:03:45,775 --> 01:03:47,403
First you have to give up.

1337
01:03:47,478 --> 01:03:50,776
First you have to know, not fear,

1338
01:03:50,847 --> 01:03:53,749
know that someday you're gonna die.

1339
01:03:53,818 --> 01:03:55,580
You don't know how this feels!

1340
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:02,118
It's only after we've lost everything

1341
01:04:02,193 --> 01:04:04,219
that we're free to do anything.

1342
01:04:06,197 --> 01:04:07,129
OK.

1343
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:23,678
Congratulations.

1344
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:26,617
You're one step closer
to hitting bottom.

1345
01:04:29,089 --> 01:04:31,216
Tyler sold his soap to department stores

1346
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:33,054
at $20 a bar.

1347
01:04:33,126 --> 01:04:34,491
God knows what they charged.

1348
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:37,223
This is the best soap.

1349
01:04:37,297 --> 01:04:38,822
Why, thank you, Suzie.

1350
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,390
It was beautiful.

1351
01:04:40,468 --> 01:04:41,867
We were selling rich women

1352
01:04:41,936 --> 01:04:44,234
their own fat asses back to them.

1353
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:47,367
He was wearing his yellow tie.

1354
01:04:47,442 --> 01:04:50,036
I didn't even wear a
tie to work anymore.

1355
01:04:50,112 --> 01:04:51,703
"The first rule of Fight Club

1356
01:04:51,779 --> 01:04:53,474
is you don't talk about Fight Club"?

1357
01:04:53,548 --> 01:04:55,209
I'm half asleep again.

1358
01:04:55,283 --> 01:04:57,115
I must've left the original
in the copy machine.

1359
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,676
"The second rule of Fight Club
- " is this yours?

1360
01:04:59,754 --> 01:05:01,484
Huh?

1361
01:05:01,557 --> 01:05:03,046
Pretend you're me.

1362
01:05:03,124 --> 01:05:04,887
Make a managerial decision.

1363
01:05:04,959 --> 01:05:07,588
You find this. What would you do?

1364
01:05:12,301 --> 01:05:14,235
Well, I gotta tell ya...

1365
01:05:14,303 --> 01:05:17,830
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

1366
01:05:17,907 --> 01:05:19,603
Because the person who wrote that...

1367
01:05:19,676 --> 01:05:21,404
is dangerous.

1368
01:05:21,477 --> 01:05:24,379
And this buttoned-down,
oxford-cloth psycho

1369
01:05:24,447 --> 01:05:26,004
might just snap

1370
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:28,676
and then stalk from office to office

1371
01:05:28,752 --> 01:05:32,449
with an Armilade AR-10
carbine gas-powered

1372
01:05:32,522 --> 01:05:34,080
semi-automatic weapon,

1373
01:05:34,157 --> 01:05:36,022
pumping round after round

1374
01:05:36,092 --> 01:05:37,992
into colleagues and coworkers.

1375
01:05:39,298 --> 01:05:42,699
This might be someone
you've known for years...

1376
01:05:42,768 --> 01:05:46,135
someone very... very... close to you.

1377
01:05:46,204 --> 01:05:49,298
Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.

1378
01:05:51,076 --> 01:05:52,839
And I used to be such a nice guy.

1379
01:05:52,911 --> 01:05:55,175
Maybe you shouldn't bring me
every little piece of trash

1380
01:05:55,247 --> 01:05:56,874
you happen to pick up.

1381
01:05:59,687 --> 01:06:01,551
Liability.

1382
01:06:01,621 --> 01:06:03,316
My tit's gonna rot off.

1383
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:06,815
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

1384
01:06:13,132 --> 01:06:14,531
What're you talking about?

1385
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,796
I need you to check and see
if there's a lump in my breast.

1386
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,496
Go to a hospital.

1387
01:06:18,571 --> 01:06:20,767
I can't afford to throw
money away on a doctor.

1388
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:24,037
I don't know about this, Marla.

1389
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:25,806
Please?

1390
01:06:25,879 --> 01:06:27,608
She didn't call Tyler.

1391
01:06:27,681 --> 01:06:29,841
I'm neutral in her book.

1392
01:06:32,086 --> 01:06:33,178
That's nice.

1393
01:06:33,253 --> 01:06:34,810
Taking food to Mrs...

1394
01:06:34,887 --> 01:06:36,253
Hanna burr, Mrs. Raines?

1395
01:06:36,323 --> 01:06:37,688
Who are they... exactly?

1396
01:06:37,758 --> 01:06:39,522
Tragically, they're dead.

1397
01:06:39,594 --> 01:06:41,391
I'm alive, and I'm in poverty.

1398
01:06:41,463 --> 01:06:42,395
You want any?

1399
01:06:42,464 --> 01:06:43,396
No. No.

1400
01:06:43,465 --> 01:06:44,762
I got one for you.

1401
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:46,197
Thanks for the thought.

1402
01:06:48,103 --> 01:06:50,367
What happened to your hand?

1403
01:06:50,438 --> 01:06:51,598
Uh... nothin'.

1404
01:06:52,707 --> 01:06:53,639
Right there.

1405
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:54,640
Uhh.

1406
01:06:55,944 --> 01:06:57,378
Feel anything?

1407
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:58,377
No.

1408
01:06:58,448 --> 01:06:59,710
Well, make sure.

1409
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:03,711
Ok, I'm
- I'm pretty sure.

1410
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:04,845
You feel nothing.

1411
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:06,946
No. Nothing.

1412
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,893
Well, that's a relief.

1413
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:12,223
Thank you.

1414
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:14,230
Uh, um... no problem.

1415
01:07:14,298 --> 01:07:16,424
I wish I could return the favor.

1416
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,595
There's not a lot of breast
cancer in the men in my family.

1417
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:20,103
Could check your prostate.

1418
01:07:20,172 --> 01:07:22,162
I think I'm OK.

1419
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,175
Well, thanks, anyway.

1420
01:07:29,248 --> 01:07:30,476
Are we done?

1421
01:07:30,549 --> 01:07:33,915
Yeah, we're done. See you... around.

1422
01:07:51,256 --> 01:07:52,188
Cornelius?

1423
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:54,290
Cornelius!

1424
01:07:55,761 --> 01:07:57,058
It's me...

1425
01:07:57,129 --> 01:07:58,494
Bob!

1426
01:07:58,564 --> 01:07:59,964
Hey... Bob.

1427
01:08:01,868 --> 01:08:03,529
Hey. Uhh!

1428
01:08:03,603 --> 01:08:04,797
We all thought you were dead.

1429
01:08:04,871 --> 01:08:07,032
No, no. Still here.

1430
01:08:07,106 --> 01:08:09,040
How are you, Bob?

1431
01:08:09,108 --> 01:08:10,939
Better than I've ever
been in my whole life.

1432
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:13,706
Really. You still
remaining men together?

1433
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:15,873
No, no. I got somethin'
so much better now.

1434
01:08:15,949 --> 01:08:17,440
Really. What is it?

1435
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,649
Well...

1436
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:22,816
first rule is...

1437
01:08:22,892 --> 01:08:24,722
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

1438
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:27,226
And the second rule is,

1439
01:08:27,296 --> 01:08:29,025
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

1440
01:08:29,098 --> 01:08:30,689
And the third rule is...

1441
01:08:30,765 --> 01:08:33,166
Bob. Bob. I'm a member.

1442
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:35,759
Look at my face, Bob.

1443
01:08:37,907 --> 01:08:40,069
That's fuckin'
- That's fuckin' great.

1444
01:08:40,143 --> 01:08:42,076
I've... l’ve never seen you there.

1445
01:08:42,144 --> 01:08:43,874
I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

1446
01:08:43,947 --> 01:08:45,915
I go Saturday.

1447
01:08:45,983 --> 01:08:47,244
Congratulations.

1448
01:08:48,385 --> 01:08:50,410
Yeah. Hey, to both of us, right?

1449
01:08:50,487 --> 01:08:52,216
Have you heard about the
guy that invented this thing?

1450
01:08:52,289 --> 01:08:53,916
Well, uh, yeah, actually. I-

1451
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:56,186
I hear all kinds of things.

1452
01:08:56,259 --> 01:09:00,525
Supposedly... he was born
in a mental institution.

1453
01:09:00,597 --> 01:09:04,192
And he sleeps only one hour a night.

1454
01:09:04,267 --> 01:09:05,598
He's a great man.

1455
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:06,601
Oh...

1456
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:08,934
do you know about Tyler Durden?

1457
01:09:17,981 --> 01:09:19,506
Ha ha ha!

1458
01:09:24,555 --> 01:09:26,080
Take him down!

1459
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:27,784
Take him down!

1460
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:29,224
Take him down!

1461
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,664
I didn't hurt you, did I?

1462
01:09:36,735 --> 01:09:39,330
Actually, you did.

1463
01:09:39,406 --> 01:09:40,998
Thank you for this.

1464
01:09:41,074 --> 01:09:43,202
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1465
01:09:43,277 --> 01:09:44,208
Fight Club.

1466
01:09:44,277 --> 01:09:46,177
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

1467
01:09:46,246 --> 01:09:47,839
This was mine and Tyler's gift...

1468
01:09:47,982 --> 01:09:50,108
our gift to the world.

1469
01:09:50,183 --> 01:09:52,015
Look around. Look around.

1470
01:09:52,086 --> 01:09:53,986
I see a lot of new faces.

1471
01:09:54,055 --> 01:09:54,987
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

1472
01:09:55,056 --> 01:09:56,044
Shut up!

1473
01:09:57,358 --> 01:09:59,190
Which means a lot of you

1474
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:02,161
have been breaking the
first 2 rules of Fight Club.

1475
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:11,701
Man, I see in Fight Club

1476
01:10:11,773 --> 01:10:14,640
the strongest and smartest
men who've ever lived.

1477
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,201
I see all this potential.

1478
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:18,576
And I see squandering.

1479
01:10:19,948 --> 01:10:21,040
God damn it.

1480
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:24,052
An entire generation pumping gas...

1481
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,609
waiting tables...

1482
01:10:25,687 --> 01:10:27,621
slaves with white collars.

1483
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:33,519
Advertising has its taste
in cars and clothes...

1484
01:10:33,595 --> 01:10:36,826
working jobs we hate so we
can buy shit we don't need.

1485
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:43,230
We're the middle
children of history, man.

1486
01:10:43,306 --> 01:10:45,741
No purpose or place.

1487
01:10:45,809 --> 01:10:49,244
We have no Great War...
no Great Depression.

1488
01:10:51,815 --> 01:10:54,578
Our Great War's a spiritual war.

1489
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:57,882
Our Great Depression is our lives.

1490
01:11:01,827 --> 01:11:03,260
We've all been raised on television

1491
01:11:03,329 --> 01:11:05,262
to believe that one day
we'd all be millionaires

1492
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:07,799
and movie gods and rock stars.

1493
01:11:07,867 --> 01:11:09,596
But we won't.

1494
01:11:09,668 --> 01:11:11,568
We're slowly learning that fact.

1495
01:11:12,905 --> 01:11:15,533
And we're very, very pissed off.

1496
01:11:15,608 --> 01:11:16,540
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1497
01:11:20,547 --> 01:11:23,914
First rule of Fight Club
is you do not talk about-

1498
01:11:29,422 --> 01:11:30,650
Who are you?

1499
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:33,021
Who am I?

1500
01:11:33,093 --> 01:11:34,151
Yeah.

1501
01:11:35,662 --> 01:11:36,686
There's a sign in the front

1502
01:11:36,763 --> 01:11:37,822
that says "Lou's Tavern."

1503
01:11:38,965 --> 01:11:41,160
I'm fuckin' Lou.

1504
01:11:41,234 --> 01:11:42,861
Who the fuck are you?

1505
01:11:42,937 --> 01:11:44,927
Tyler Durden.

1506
01:11:48,309 --> 01:11:50,936
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?

1507
01:11:51,011 --> 01:11:52,979
We have a deal worked out with Irvin.

1508
01:11:53,046 --> 01:11:54,071
Irvin?

1509
01:11:54,148 --> 01:11:56,672
Irvin's at home with
a broken collarbone.

1510
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,377
He don't own this place.

1511
01:11:58,451 --> 01:11:59,384
I do.

1512
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:03,480
How much money is he gettin' for this?

1513
01:12:03,558 --> 01:12:04,821
There is no money.

1514
01:12:04,893 --> 01:12:07,487
- Really. Ain't that somethin'?
- Free to all.

1515
01:12:07,562 --> 01:12:09,428
It is, actually.

1516
01:12:09,498 --> 01:12:11,966
Look, stupid fuck...

1517
01:12:12,034 --> 01:12:13,523
I want everybody outta here right now.

1518
01:12:13,601 --> 01:12:16,833
Hey. You should join our club.

1519
01:12:18,173 --> 01:12:19,607
Did you hear what I just said?

1520
01:12:19,676 --> 01:12:21,440
You and your friend.

1521
01:12:21,512 --> 01:12:23,309
Oomph!

1522
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,438
Uhh!

1523
01:12:24,515 --> 01:12:26,415
You hear me now?!

1524
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:30,113
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

1525
01:12:30,187 --> 01:12:31,245
Ooh!

1526
01:12:31,322 --> 01:12:32,254
Pfft!

1527
01:12:33,991 --> 01:12:34,923
Ohhh...

1528
01:12:36,493 --> 01:12:38,256
Still not gettin' it.

1529
01:12:39,463 --> 01:12:41,125
Aah! OK, OK, OK. I got it.

1530
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,633
I got it. I got it. Shit, I lost it.

1531
01:12:43,702 --> 01:12:45,294
Ooh!

1532
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:46,497
Back! All of you!

1533
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:49,631
Everybody back.

1534
01:12:51,878 --> 01:12:53,742
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1535
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,911
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1536
01:12:57,984 --> 01:13:00,008
Aw, Lou...

1537
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:02,076
Come on, man.

1538
01:13:02,153 --> 01:13:03,678
We really like this place.

1539
01:13:05,123 --> 01:13:06,556
Ohh!

1540
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:12,722
Ohhh...

1541
01:13:12,797 --> 01:13:15,790
- That's right, Lou, get
it- - Shut the fuck up!

1542
01:13:15,868 --> 01:13:17,630
Oh, yeah!

1543
01:13:17,702 --> 01:13:20,229
Yeah! Ha ha ha ha ha!

1544
01:13:20,307 --> 01:13:22,536
Ho ho ho ha ha ha!

1545
01:13:22,608 --> 01:13:23,871
Think that's fuckin' funny?!

1546
01:13:23,944 --> 01:13:25,912
Ho ho, ho! Ha ha ha ha!

1547
01:13:25,979 --> 01:13:28,971
Ha ha ha ha
- Ohh! Ho ho ho!

1548
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:35,485
Fuckin' guys are loony, I'm tellin' ya.

1549
01:13:37,724 --> 01:13:39,715
Unbelievable. Aah!

1550
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:44,827
You don't know where I've been, Lou.

1551
01:13:44,901 --> 01:13:46,595
- Oh, my God!
- Ha ha ha!

1552
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:49,536
You don't know where I've been! Ha ha!

1553
01:13:49,605 --> 01:13:51,903
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1554
01:13:51,974 --> 01:13:54,204
Lou! Please let us keep it, Lou!

1555
01:13:54,276 --> 01:13:55,744
Please, Lou!

1556
01:13:55,812 --> 01:13:58,279
Fuckin' use the basement! Christ!

1557
01:13:58,347 --> 01:14:01,250
I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

1558
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:03,252
On my mother's honor.

1559
01:14:04,988 --> 01:14:05,921
Uhh!

1560
01:14:07,658 --> 01:14:09,454
Lou!

1561
01:14:09,526 --> 01:14:11,154
Aaahhh!

1562
01:14:12,463 --> 01:14:13,555
Thanks, Lou.

1563
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:17,561
You, too, big guy.

1564
01:14:21,939 --> 01:14:23,463
See you next week.

1565
01:14:39,724 --> 01:14:42,057
This week... each one of you...

1566
01:14:42,127 --> 01:14:44,220
has a homework assignment.

1567
01:14:44,296 --> 01:14:45,558
You're gonna go out.

1568
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:48,030
You're gonna start a fight
with a total stranger.

1569
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:52,994
You're gonna start a fight.

1570
01:14:54,139 --> 01:14:55,572
And you're gonna lose.

1571
01:14:58,643 --> 01:15:00,306
Excellent choice, sir.

1572
01:15:02,316 --> 01:15:04,011
Hey! Watch out, jackass!

1573
01:15:04,085 --> 01:15:05,177
Come on!

1574
01:15:05,253 --> 01:15:07,846
Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.

1575
01:15:09,802 --> 01:15:11,632
I'm thinkin' you really-What?!

1576
01:15:11,703 --> 01:15:13,136
Son of a bitch!

1577
01:15:13,204 --> 01:15:16,106
Most people... normal people...

1578
01:15:16,175 --> 01:15:18,233
do just about anything to avoid a fight.

1579
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:22,077
Excuse me. You sprayed
me with your hose.

1580
01:15:22,148 --> 01:15:23,341
Like that?

1581
01:15:23,415 --> 01:15:24,780
That's not necessary.

1582
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:26,716
Dave! Go call 911!

1583
01:15:28,487 --> 01:15:29,419
Aaaahhh!

1584
01:15:31,424 --> 01:15:32,686
Stop it!

1585
01:15:32,759 --> 01:15:33,691
Stop it!

1586
01:15:36,329 --> 01:15:37,261
Sorry.

1587
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:39,195
What did
- Come here!

1588
01:15:39,265 --> 01:15:41,426
Leave me alone! You crazy?

1589
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:42,468
Uhh!

1590
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:44,862
Unhh! Uhh!

1591
01:15:46,071 --> 01:15:47,004
Bastard!

1592
01:15:52,779 --> 01:15:54,246
We need to talk.

1593
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:57,882
OK.

1594
01:16:00,454 --> 01:16:01,716
Where to begin?

1595
01:16:01,789 --> 01:16:04,223
With your constant absenteeism?

1596
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:07,385
With your unpresentable appearance?

1597
01:16:07,461 --> 01:16:08,826
You're up for review.

1598
01:16:08,896 --> 01:16:12,127
I am Jack’s... complete
lack of surprise.

1599
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:13,132
What?

1600
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:14,168
Let's pretend.

1601
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,066
You're the Department of Transportation.

1602
01:16:16,137 --> 01:16:17,104
OK?

1603
01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:20,836
Someone informs you that this company

1604
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,901
installs front seat mounting brackets

1605
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:25,005
that never pass collision tests...

1606
01:16:25,082 --> 01:16:28,517
brake linings that fail
after a thousand miles,

1607
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,746
and fuel injectors that explode

1608
01:16:30,821 --> 01:16:32,583
and burn people alive.

1609
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:34,983
What then?

1610
01:16:35,058 --> 01:16:37,355
Are you threatening me?

1611
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,393
No...

1612
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:40,225
Get the fuck outta here. You're fired.

1613
01:16:40,297 --> 01:16:41,993
I have a better solution.

1614
01:16:42,066 --> 01:16:45,558
You keep me on the payroll
as an outside consultant.

1615
01:16:45,637 --> 01:16:47,366
And in exchange for my salary,

1616
01:16:47,438 --> 01:16:49,234
my job will be never to tell people

1617
01:16:49,306 --> 01:16:51,537
these things that I know.

1618
01:16:51,609 --> 01:16:53,600
I don't even have to
come into the office.

1619
01:16:53,678 --> 01:16:55,144
I can do this job from home.

1620
01:16:56,948 --> 01:16:58,882
Who-Who the fuck do you think you are,

1621
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:01,680
you crazy little shit?

1622
01:17:05,858 --> 01:17:07,324
Security?

1623
01:17:07,392 --> 01:17:09,383
I am Jack's smirking revenge.

1624
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:10,654
Ohh!

1625
01:17:15,466 --> 01:17:16,593
Ohh!

1626
01:17:16,669 --> 01:17:17,999
Ahh... ahh...

1627
01:17:18,069 --> 01:17:20,435
What the hell are you doing?

1628
01:17:28,682 --> 01:17:30,911
Ohh... that hurt.

1629
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:35,881
Why would you do that?

1630
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:37,217
Oh, my God.

1631
01:17:37,289 --> 01:17:38,951
No! Please stop!

1632
01:17:41,696 --> 01:17:44,097
Uhh! Uh... uhh!

1633
01:17:49,104 --> 01:17:50,366
What are you doing?

1634
01:17:51,506 --> 01:17:53,565
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1635
01:17:53,642 --> 01:17:56,304
For some reason, I
thought of my first fight

1636
01:17:56,378 --> 01:17:57,742
with Tyler.

1637
01:17:57,812 --> 01:17:58,745
No!

1638
01:18:23,873 --> 01:18:26,104
Under and behind and inside,

1639
01:18:26,176 --> 01:18:28,370
everything this man took for granted...

1640
01:18:28,444 --> 01:18:30,811
something horrible had been growing.

1641
01:18:32,015 --> 01:18:33,107
Now, look.

1642
01:18:33,182 --> 01:18:35,514
Give me the paychecks like I asked,

1643
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:37,917
and you won't ever see me again.

1644
01:18:37,987 --> 01:18:41,447
And right then, at our most
excellent moment together...

1645
01:18:43,794 --> 01:18:45,921
Oh... thank God.

1646
01:18:45,996 --> 01:18:47,862
Please don't hit me again. Please...

1647
01:18:47,933 --> 01:18:50,093
Telephone, computer, fax machine,

1648
01:18:50,167 --> 01:18:54,400
52 weekly paychecks, and
48 airline flight coupons.

1649
01:18:54,472 --> 01:18:56,871
We now had corporate sponsorship.

1650
01:18:56,942 --> 01:18:59,172
This is how Tyler and I
were able to have Fight Club

1651
01:18:59,244 --> 01:19:00,710
every night of the week.

1652
01:19:03,450 --> 01:19:05,941
Now nobody was the center of Fight Club

1653
01:19:06,019 --> 01:19:08,010
except the 2 men fighting.

1654
01:19:08,088 --> 01:19:12,081
The leader walked through the
crowd, out in the darkness.

1655
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,227
Tyler was now involved
in a class-action lawsuit

1656
01:19:16,296 --> 01:19:18,821
with the Pressman Hotel over
the urine content of their soup.

1657
01:19:25,406 --> 01:19:27,670
I am Jack’s wasted life.

1658
01:19:32,246 --> 01:19:35,272
Yeah! Yeah! Ha ha! Yeah!

1659
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:36,747
There you are, sir.

1660
01:19:40,089 --> 01:19:42,682
Tyler dreamed up new
homework assignments.

1661
01:19:42,757 --> 01:19:45,386
He handed them out in sealed envelopes.

1662
01:20:24,536 --> 01:20:26,128
Did you know there's a Fight Club

1663
01:20:26,204 --> 01:20:27,136
up in Delaware City?

1664
01:20:27,205 --> 01:20:28,137
Yeah, I heard.

1665
01:20:29,307 --> 01:20:31,935
There's one in Penn's Grove, too.

1666
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:34,240
Bob even found one up in Newcastle.

1667
01:20:34,312 --> 01:20:36,246
Yeah. Did you start that one?

1668
01:20:36,314 --> 01:20:37,748
No. I thought you did.

1669
01:20:37,817 --> 01:20:39,078
Nah.

1670
01:20:39,151 --> 01:20:40,083
Pff!

1671
01:21:29,037 --> 01:21:30,401
Stop for a second.

1672
01:21:30,472 --> 01:21:31,905
Hey, what are we doing?

1673
01:21:31,973 --> 01:21:32,905
Turn around.

1674
01:21:32,974 --> 01:21:34,407
What are we doing?

1675
01:21:34,476 --> 01:21:35,408
Homework assignment.

1676
01:21:35,477 --> 01:21:36,739
What kind of homework assignment?

1677
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:38,073
Human sacrifice.

1678
01:21:38,146 --> 01:21:39,238
Hey, is that a gun?

1679
01:21:39,314 --> 01:21:40,747
Please. Please tell me that's not a gun.

1680
01:21:40,815 --> 01:21:41,749
It's a gun.

1681
01:21:41,818 --> 01:21:42,750
What are you doing?

1682
01:21:42,819 --> 01:21:43,751
Meet me in the back.

1683
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:45,253
Hey, don't fuck around.

1684
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:46,551
Meet me in the back.

1685
01:21:46,624 --> 01:21:48,750
On a long enough time line,

1686
01:21:48,825 --> 01:21:51,191
the survival rate for
everyone drops to zero.

1687
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:54,297
What are you doing? Come on.

1688
01:21:54,364 --> 01:21:55,729
Hands behind your back.

1689
01:21:55,799 --> 01:21:56,731
God.

1690
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,893
Give me your wallet.

1691
01:21:59,169 --> 01:22:00,500
Raymond K. Hessel,

1692
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:03,564
1320 Southeast Banning, apartment A.

1693
01:22:03,642 --> 01:22:04,972
Small, cramped basement
apartment, Raymond?

1694
01:22:05,042 --> 01:22:06,066
How did you know?

1695
01:22:06,144 --> 01:22:07,772
Because they give shitty
basement apartments

1696
01:22:07,846 --> 01:22:09,780
Letters instead of numbers.

1697
01:22:09,848 --> 01:22:11,280
Raymond...

1698
01:22:11,349 --> 01:22:12,783
you're going to die.

1699
01:22:12,851 --> 01:22:14,318
Oh, my God, no...

1700
01:22:14,386 --> 01:22:15,580
Is that your mom and dad?

1701
01:22:15,654 --> 01:22:17,143
Mom and dad are going to have to call up

1702
01:22:17,221 --> 01:22:18,211
kindly Dr.
So-And-So

1703
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:19,689
to pick up your dental records.

1704
01:22:19,758 --> 01:22:20,952
You want to know why?

1705
01:22:21,026 --> 01:22:22,754
Because there's going to be
nothing left of your face.

1706
01:22:22,827 --> 01:22:24,591
Aw, come on.

1707
01:22:24,663 --> 01:22:27,097
An expired community
college student I.D.

1708
01:22:27,166 --> 01:22:28,598
What'd you study, Raymond?

1709
01:22:28,667 --> 01:22:30,225
S-S-S-Stuff.

1710
01:22:30,302 --> 01:22:31,701
Stuff?

1711
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:33,896
Were the midterms hard?

1712
01:22:35,007 --> 01:22:36,372
I asked you what you studied.

1713
01:22:36,441 --> 01:22:37,567
Biology, mostly.

1714
01:22:37,643 --> 01:22:38,768
Why?

1715
01:22:38,843 --> 01:22:40,744
I-I don't know.

1716
01:22:40,812 --> 01:22:44,214
What did you want to
be, Raymond K. Hessel?

1717
01:22:45,685 --> 01:22:47,812
The question, Raymond,

1718
01:22:47,887 --> 01:22:51,277
was what did you want to be?

1719
01:22:51,411 --> 01:22:53,242
Answer him, Raymond! Jesus!

1720
01:22:53,313 --> 01:22:54,712
Veterinarian! Veterinarian!

1721
01:22:54,781 --> 01:22:55,840
Animals.

1722
01:22:55,916 --> 01:22:57,849
Yeah,
animal s-s-s-

1723
01:22:57,917 --> 01:22:58,941
Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

1724
01:22:59,018 --> 01:23:00,076
That means you have
to get more schooling.

1725
01:23:00,153 --> 01:23:01,587
Too much school.

1726
01:23:01,655 --> 01:23:03,021
Would you rather be dead?

1727
01:23:03,091 --> 01:23:04,023
No...

1728
01:23:04,092 --> 01:23:05,320
Would you rather die, here,

1729
01:23:05,393 --> 01:23:06,827
on your knees,

1730
01:23:06,896 --> 01:23:08,692
in the back of a convenience store?

1731
01:23:08,763 --> 01:23:10,321
No... No, please...

1732
01:23:10,398 --> 01:23:11,661
no...

1733
01:23:14,936 --> 01:23:16,495
I'm keeping your license.

1734
01:23:17,773 --> 01:23:19,330
Gonna check in on you.

1735
01:23:19,407 --> 01:23:21,341
I know where you live.

1736
01:23:21,409 --> 01:23:24,346
If you’re not on your way
to becoming a veterinarian

1737
01:23:24,414 --> 01:23:26,040
in 6 weeks, you will be dead.

1738
01:23:27,918 --> 01:23:29,749
Now run on home.

1739
01:23:34,524 --> 01:23:36,821
Run, Forrest, run!

1740
01:23:38,462 --> 01:23:39,827
I feel ill.

1741
01:23:41,665 --> 01:23:43,098
Imagine how he feels.

1742
01:23:43,166 --> 01:23:45,100
Come on, this isn't funny!

1743
01:23:45,168 --> 01:23:46,601
That wasn't funny.

1744
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:48,695
What the fuck was the point of that?

1745
01:23:48,772 --> 01:23:50,205
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day

1746
01:23:50,273 --> 01:23:51,706
of Raymond K. Hessel's life.

1747
01:23:51,775 --> 01:23:53,208
His breakfast will taste better

1748
01:23:53,276 --> 01:23:56,177
than any meal you and
I have ever tasted.

1749
01:23:57,714 --> 01:24:00,308
You had to give it to him.

1750
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,715
Come on.

1751
01:24:01,785 --> 01:24:02,753
He had a plan.

1752
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:04,755
And it started to make sense

1753
01:24:04,822 --> 01:24:06,187
in a Tyler sort of way.

1754
01:24:06,257 --> 01:24:07,246
No fear.

1755
01:24:07,325 --> 01:24:09,260
No distractions.

1756
01:24:09,328 --> 01:24:12,694
The ability to let that
which does not matter

1757
01:24:12,764 --> 01:24:14,733
truly slide.

1758
01:24:26,881 --> 01:24:28,507
You're not your job.

1759
01:24:30,751 --> 01:24:34,015
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1760
01:24:35,756 --> 01:24:38,520
You're not the car you drive.

1761
01:24:38,592 --> 01:24:41,186
You're not the contents of your wallet.

1762
01:24:42,664 --> 01:24:44,689
You're not your fuckin' khakis.

1763
01:24:46,902 --> 01:24:50,338
You're the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1764
01:24:59,381 --> 01:25:02,316
I'll be out of your way in a sec.

1765
01:25:02,384 --> 01:25:03,851
You don't have to go.

1766
01:25:05,954 --> 01:25:07,046
Whatever.

1767
01:25:08,123 --> 01:25:11,058
No, I mean, uh...

1768
01:25:11,126 --> 01:25:12,354
It's OK.

1769
01:25:21,803 --> 01:25:24,672
Are you still going to groups?

1770
01:25:24,741 --> 01:25:25,832
Yeah.

1771
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:29,842
Chloe's dead.

1772
01:25:29,913 --> 01:25:32,608
Ah, Chloe.

1773
01:25:32,682 --> 01:25:34,844
When did that happen?

1774
01:25:34,918 --> 01:25:37,317
Do you care?

1775
01:25:37,386 --> 01:25:38,683
I don't know.

1776
01:25:38,754 --> 01:25:40,950
I haven't thought about it in a while.

1777
01:25:41,024 --> 01:25:43,289
Yeah, well...

1778
01:25:43,361 --> 01:25:46,490
I think it was a smart move on her part.

1779
01:25:47,633 --> 01:25:48,963
Hey, listen, uh...

1780
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:52,697
what are you getting out of all this?

1781
01:25:52,771 --> 01:25:53,930
What?

1782
01:25:55,174 --> 01:25:56,607
I mean, all this.

1783
01:25:56,675 --> 01:25:58,108
Why do you keep...

1784
01:25:58,177 --> 01:26:00,645
Is this making you happy?

1785
01:26:02,314 --> 01:26:04,340
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1786
01:26:05,785 --> 01:26:08,219
I don't know. I don't understand.

1787
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:10,222
Why does a weaker person

1788
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:12,724
need to latch on to a strong person?

1789
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,054
What is that?

1790
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:16,255
Well, what do you get out of it?

1791
01:26:18,198 --> 01:26:20,132
No-It's-It's not the
same thing at all.

1792
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,066
I mean, we're... it's
totally different with us.

1793
01:26:22,136 --> 01:26:23,227
We're-We're-

1794
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:24,361
Us?

1795
01:26:24,437 --> 01:26:26,234
What do you mean by "us"?

1796
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:28,036
I'm sorry, do you hear this?

1797
01:26:28,109 --> 01:26:29,132
Hear what?

1798
01:26:29,209 --> 01:26:31,177
You're not hearing all that noise?

1799
01:26:31,244 --> 01:26:32,177
Just-Hold on a second.

1800
01:26:32,246 --> 01:26:33,406
No, wait. What were you saying?

1801
01:26:33,481 --> 01:26:35,141
Don't change the subject.
I want to talk about this.

1802
01:26:35,215 --> 01:26:36,910
You're not talking about me, are you?

1803
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:38,815
No. What?

1804
01:26:38,886 --> 01:26:40,682
That day you came over to
my place to play doctor-

1805
01:26:40,754 --> 01:26:42,346
what was going on there?

1806
01:26:42,422 --> 01:26:43,391
What are you talking about?

1807
01:26:43,458 --> 01:26:44,891
Nothing. Nothing.

1808
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,017
I don't think so.

1809
01:26:46,093 --> 01:26:47,355
Come on, what do you want?

1810
01:26:47,428 --> 01:26:48,691
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1811
01:26:48,764 --> 01:26:50,527
Look at me.

1812
01:26:50,599 --> 01:26:52,031
What is that?

1813
01:26:52,099 --> 01:26:53,692
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

1814
01:26:53,769 --> 01:26:54,701
Oh, my God.

1815
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:55,794
Who did this?

1816
01:26:55,871 --> 01:26:56,803
A person.

1817
01:26:56,872 --> 01:26:57,860
Guy or girl?

1818
01:26:57,939 --> 01:26:59,931
What do you care if
it’s a guy or a girl?

1819
01:27:00,008 --> 01:27:01,066
What do you care if I ask?

1820
01:27:01,143 --> 01:27:02,303
This is none of your
business. Leave me alone.

1821
01:27:02,377 --> 01:27:03,310
You're afraid to say it.

1822
01:27:03,379 --> 01:27:04,312
I am not afraid to say. Let me go.

1823
01:27:04,381 --> 01:27:05,439
No! Talk to me.

1824
01:27:05,516 --> 01:27:06,710
- No!
- Let go of me. Leave me alone.

1825
01:27:06,784 --> 01:27:08,274
This conversation...

1826
01:27:08,352 --> 01:27:09,478
This conversation...

1827
01:27:09,553 --> 01:27:11,350
is over.

1828
01:27:11,422 --> 01:27:12,855
Is over.

1829
01:27:14,024 --> 01:27:16,390
I just can't win with you, can I?

1830
01:27:24,202 --> 01:27:27,137
Hey, this is getting a little old.

1831
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:30,936
What is-What is all this?

1832
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:32,442
What do you think?

1833
01:27:33,878 --> 01:27:36,939
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

1834
01:27:37,016 --> 01:27:37,947
Hey.

1835
01:27:45,056 --> 01:27:46,615
Too young.

1836
01:27:46,692 --> 01:27:48,250
Sorry.

1837
01:27:48,327 --> 01:27:50,556
What's all that?

1838
01:27:50,629 --> 01:27:53,155
If the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.

1839
01:27:53,232 --> 01:27:54,698
Old, too old. Fat, too fat.

1840
01:27:54,766 --> 01:27:55,733
Applicant?

1841
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,666
If the applicant then waits for 3 days

1842
01:27:57,737 --> 01:27:59,671
without food, shelter or encouragement,

1843
01:27:59,739 --> 01:28:02,173
he may then enter and
begin his training.

1844
01:28:02,241 --> 01:28:03,800
Training for what?

1845
01:28:08,949 --> 01:28:10,883
You think this is a game?

1846
01:28:10,951 --> 01:28:12,885
You're too young to train here.

1847
01:28:12,953 --> 01:28:14,887
End of story. Quit wasting our time.

1848
01:28:14,955 --> 01:28:16,388
Get the fuck out of here.

1849
01:28:20,994 --> 01:28:22,393
Bad news, friend.

1850
01:28:23,565 --> 01:28:25,499
It's not gonna happen.

1851
01:28:25,567 --> 01:28:28,502
I'm sorry if there
was a misunderstanding.

1852
01:28:28,571 --> 01:28:30,538
It's not the end of the world.

1853
01:28:30,606 --> 01:28:32,039
Just go away.

1854
01:28:33,175 --> 01:28:35,006
Go.

1855
01:28:35,077 --> 01:28:36,669
You're trespassing,

1856
01:28:36,745 --> 01:28:38,679
and I will have to call the police.

1857
01:28:42,151 --> 01:28:43,949
Don't you look at me.

1858
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:45,784
Do you think you're ever
getting in this house?

1859
01:28:45,856 --> 01:28:47,288
You're never getting
in this fucking house.

1860
01:28:47,357 --> 01:28:49,188
Never. Now get the fuck off the porch.

1861
01:28:49,259 --> 01:28:50,727
Get off the porch!

1862
01:28:50,795 --> 01:28:52,227
Sooner or later,

1863
01:28:52,295 --> 01:28:54,354
we all became what
Tyler wanted us to be.

1864
01:28:54,431 --> 01:28:57,230
I'm gonna go inside and
I'm gonna get a shovel.

1865
01:29:04,274 --> 01:29:05,708
You got 2 black shirts?

1866
01:29:05,776 --> 01:29:06,708
Sir.

1867
01:29:06,777 --> 01:29:08,210
2 pair of black pants?

1868
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:09,210
Yes, sir.

1869
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:10,211
One pair of black boots?

1870
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,213
Sir.

1871
01:29:11,282 --> 01:29:12,214
2 pair of black socks?

1872
01:29:12,283 --> 01:29:13,215
Sir.

1873
01:29:13,284 --> 01:29:14,216
One black jacket?

1874
01:29:14,285 --> 01:29:15,216
Sir.

1875
01:29:15,285 --> 01:29:16,412
$300 personal burial money?

1876
01:29:16,487 --> 01:29:17,545
Yes, sir.

1877
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:21,016
All right.

1878
01:29:31,236 --> 01:29:34,399
You're too old, fat man.

1879
01:29:34,473 --> 01:29:36,031
Your tits are too big.

1880
01:29:36,108 --> 01:29:38,542
Get the fuck off my porch.

1881
01:29:45,052 --> 01:29:47,543
Bob. Bob.

1882
01:30:02,703 --> 01:30:04,138
Like a monkey

1883
01:30:04,206 --> 01:30:06,265
ready to be shot into space.

1884
01:30:06,341 --> 01:30:07,865
Space monkey.

1885
01:30:07,942 --> 01:30:12,140
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1886
01:30:17,052 --> 01:30:20,988
You are too fucking old, fatty!

1887
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,717
And you.

1888
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:24,383
You're too fucking...

1889
01:30:24,459 --> 01:30:25,757
blond!

1890
01:30:25,828 --> 01:30:28,220
Get out of here, the both of you!

1891
01:30:29,188 --> 01:30:30,621
And so it went.

1892
01:30:30,689 --> 01:30:32,623
Listen up, maggots.

1893
01:30:32,691 --> 01:30:35,158
You are not special.

1894
01:30:35,226 --> 01:30:38,594
You are not a beautiful
or unique snowflake.

1895
01:30:38,664 --> 01:30:41,098
You are the same decaying organic matter

1896
01:30:41,166 --> 01:30:42,793
as everything else.

1897
01:30:42,868 --> 01:30:45,201
Tyler built himself an army.

1898
01:30:45,272 --> 01:30:49,208
We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1899
01:30:49,276 --> 01:30:52,905
We are all part of
the same compost heap.

1900
01:30:54,581 --> 01:30:57,982
Why was Tyler Durden building an army?

1901
01:30:58,051 --> 01:30:59,712
To what purpose?

1902
01:30:59,786 --> 01:31:01,549
For what greater good?

1903
01:31:04,993 --> 01:31:06,790
In Tyler we trusted.

1904
01:31:10,666 --> 01:31:16,434
No, when he was like, "You are
not your job," I was like...

1905
01:31:16,505 --> 01:31:17,973
Yeah!

1906
01:31:19,709 --> 01:31:21,369
Hey, what's all this?

1907
01:31:24,315 --> 01:31:26,078
OK!

1908
01:31:26,150 --> 01:31:28,174
Go on in and celebrate.

1909
01:31:28,251 --> 01:31:29,685
What are we celebrating?

1910
01:31:29,753 --> 01:31:30,720
Go on.

1911
01:31:35,259 --> 01:31:36,191
Hey.

1912
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:37,693
Let me get that for you.

1913
01:31:48,906 --> 01:31:51,340
Investigators are on
the scene right now.

1914
01:31:51,408 --> 01:31:53,706
Hold on. Police Commissioner
Jacobs has just arrived.

1915
01:31:53,777 --> 01:31:56,769
Commissioner, Commissioner,
could you please tell us

1916
01:31:56,847 --> 01:31:58,474
what you think has happened here?

1917
01:31:58,549 --> 01:31:59,982
We believe this is one of many

1918
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:02,211
recent acts of vandalism around the city

1919
01:32:02,286 --> 01:32:05,256
somehow related to
underground boxing clubs.

1920
01:32:05,323 --> 01:32:09,453
We'll be coordinating a
rigorous investigation.

1921
01:32:09,527 --> 01:32:11,962
That was Police Commissioner
Jacobs, who just arrived

1922
01:32:12,031 --> 01:32:13,895
on the scene here of a 4-alarm fire

1923
01:32:13,965 --> 01:32:15,626
that broke out about an hour ago.

1924
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:16,690
She's hot.

1925
01:32:16,769 --> 01:32:18,236
Live from the Parker Morris Building,

1926
01:32:18,303 --> 01:32:20,168
Lauren Sanchez. Back
to you in the studio.

1927
01:32:20,238 --> 01:32:21,866
Yeah!

1928
01:32:21,941 --> 01:32:23,499
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Yeah.

1929
01:32:23,576 --> 01:32:25,169
Holy shit.

1930
01:32:25,245 --> 01:32:26,177
Yeah!

1931
01:32:29,883 --> 01:32:31,009
- Yeah!
- Ha ha ha!

1932
01:32:31,084 --> 01:32:32,347
Hoo hoo hoo!

1933
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:34,012
What the fuck did you guys do?

1934
01:32:34,088 --> 01:32:35,453
...how the blaze started,

1935
01:32:35,522 --> 01:32:38,219
but arson investigators
are on the premises...

1936
01:32:43,398 --> 01:32:46,334
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem

1937
01:32:46,402 --> 01:32:48,802
is you do not ask questions, sir.

1938
01:32:54,176 --> 01:32:56,701
The victory in the war against crime

1939
01:32:56,779 --> 01:32:58,804
will not come overnight.

1940
01:32:58,881 --> 01:33:01,008
It will take dedication and commitment,

1941
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:03,517
and most of all, cooperation.

1942
01:33:03,585 --> 01:33:05,109
The streets are safer now.

1943
01:33:05,187 --> 01:33:07,451
There is hope in the inner city.

1944
01:33:07,523 --> 01:33:09,549
However, this is only the beginning.

1945
01:33:09,626 --> 01:33:10,592
I gotta take a piss.

1946
01:33:10,659 --> 01:33:13,093
These are the first steps

1947
01:33:13,162 --> 01:33:14,721
in a long journey.

1948
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:17,095
That is why we have
created Project Hope...

1949
01:33:17,166 --> 01:33:18,292
Bob.

1950
01:33:18,367 --> 01:33:21,303
"Helping others with
prevention and enforcement."

1951
01:33:21,371 --> 01:33:24,134
Project Hope will be a joint effort

1952
01:33:24,207 --> 01:33:26,904
between the police
and community leaders.

1953
01:33:26,977 --> 01:33:29,604
It will be a powerful new weapon

1954
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:31,477
in the war against crime.

1955
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:09,047
Haahhhh!

1956
01:34:16,697 --> 01:34:19,359
Wrap it around the top
of his hacky sack, Bob.

1957
01:34:19,433 --> 01:34:20,832
Yeah. His bails are ice cold.

1958
01:34:22,202 --> 01:34:23,636
Hi.

1959
01:34:23,705 --> 01:34:26,195
You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1960
01:34:26,273 --> 01:34:27,297
You're gonna publicly state

1961
01:34:27,374 --> 01:34:30,173
that there is no
underground group, or...

1962
01:34:30,245 --> 01:34:32,007
these guys are gonna take your bails.

1963
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:34,207
They're gonna send one
to the New York Times,

1964
01:34:34,282 --> 01:34:37,216
one to the L.A. Times
press release style.

1965
01:34:37,284 --> 01:34:38,546
Look...

1966
01:34:38,619 --> 01:34:40,053
the people you are after

1967
01:34:40,121 --> 01:34:42,054
are the people you depend on.

1968
01:34:42,122 --> 01:34:44,181
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.

1969
01:34:44,258 --> 01:34:45,386
We connect your calls.

1970
01:34:45,461 --> 01:34:46,985
We drive your ambulances.

1971
01:34:47,062 --> 01:34:50,429
We guard you while you sleep.

1972
01:34:53,434 --> 01:34:56,302
Do not fuck with us.

1973
01:35:04,981 --> 01:35:05,949
Fooled ya.

1974
01:35:21,567 --> 01:35:23,431
Bob, you're on this one.

1975
01:35:23,501 --> 01:35:25,868
Let's go.

1976
01:35:25,938 --> 01:35:30,136
I am Jack’s inflamed sense of rejection.

1977
01:35:30,208 --> 01:35:31,140
Hey!

1978
01:35:46,792 --> 01:35:48,055
Yeah!

1979
01:36:20,828 --> 01:36:23,626
I felt like putting a
bullet between the eyes

1980
01:36:23,697 --> 01:36:26,361
of every panda that wouldn't
screw to save its species.

1981
01:36:28,804 --> 01:36:31,272
I wanted to open the dump valves

1982
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:33,740
on oil tankers and smother
all those French beaches

1983
01:36:33,809 --> 01:36:35,401
I'd never see.

1984
01:36:38,714 --> 01:36:42,082
I wanted to breathe smoke.

1985
01:36:58,302 --> 01:37:01,999
Where'd you go, psycho boy?

1986
01:37:02,073 --> 01:37:05,065
I felt like destroying
something beautiful.

1987
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,143
Get him to a fuckin' hospital.

1988
01:37:11,214 --> 01:37:12,146
Yeah.

1989
01:37:23,394 --> 01:37:25,124
Don't worry, Mr. Durden.

1990
01:37:25,197 --> 01:37:26,926
Airport parking, long term.

1991
01:37:28,067 --> 01:37:29,898
After you, Mr. Durden.

1992
01:37:31,236 --> 01:37:32,965
After you.

1993
01:37:51,392 --> 01:37:52,825
Something on your mind, dear?

1994
01:37:52,893 --> 01:37:53,985
No.

1995
01:37:54,061 --> 01:37:55,188
All right, yeah.

1996
01:37:55,263 --> 01:37:57,321
Why wasn't I told about Project Mayhem?

1997
01:37:57,398 --> 01:37:58,660
First rule of Project Mayhem

1998
01:37:58,733 --> 01:38:00,495
is you do not ask questions.

1999
01:38:00,629 --> 01:38:01,527
What are you talking about?

2000
01:38:01,596 --> 01:38:02,823
Why didn't you include
me in the beginning?

2001
01:38:02,897 --> 01:38:04,421
Fight Club was the beginning.

2002
01:38:04,498 --> 01:38:06,127
Now it's moved out of the basement,

2003
01:38:06,202 --> 01:38:07,635
it's called Project Mayhem.

2004
01:38:07,703 --> 01:38:09,169
You and I started Fight Club together.

2005
01:38:09,237 --> 01:38:10,534
Do you remember that?

2006
01:38:10,605 --> 01:38:12,574
It's as much mine as
it is yours, you know.

2007
01:38:12,642 --> 01:38:13,870
Is this about you and me?

2008
01:38:13,943 --> 01:38:15,671
Yeah. I thought we were
doing this together.

2009
01:38:15,744 --> 01:38:16,905
You're missing the point.

2010
01:38:16,979 --> 01:38:19,106
This does not belong to us.

2011
01:38:19,181 --> 01:38:20,408
We are not special.

2012
01:38:20,482 --> 01:38:21,711
Fuck that. You should've told me.

2013
01:38:23,786 --> 01:38:24,912
Hey, Tyler!

2014
01:38:27,623 --> 01:38:29,420
Goddamn it, Tyler!

2015
01:38:29,492 --> 01:38:31,153
What do you want?! Statement of purpose?

2016
01:38:31,227 --> 01:38:32,251
Should I e-mail you?

2017
01:38:32,328 --> 01:38:33,852
Should I put this on
your action item list?

2018
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:35,420
You decide your own
level of involvement!

2019
01:38:35,498 --> 01:38:38,194
I will! I want to know
certain things first.

2020
01:38:38,267 --> 01:38:39,894
The first rule of Project Mayhem-

2021
01:38:39,969 --> 01:38:40,901
Shut up!

2022
01:38:40,970 --> 01:38:43,097
I want to know what you're thinking.

2023
01:38:43,172 --> 01:38:44,139
Fuck what you know.

2024
01:38:44,206 --> 01:38:45,435
You need to forget about what you know.

2025
01:38:45,509 --> 01:38:46,441
That's your problem.

2026
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:47,772
Forget about what you think you know

2027
01:38:47,845 --> 01:38:49,641
about life, about friendship,

2028
01:38:49,713 --> 01:38:52,079
and especially about you and me.

2029
01:38:52,149 --> 01:38:53,117
What?

2030
01:38:53,184 --> 01:38:55,447
What is that supposed to mean? What...

2031
01:38:58,790 --> 01:38:59,722
What are you doing?

2032
01:39:01,925 --> 01:39:04,622
Guys, what do you wish
you'd done before you die?

2033
01:39:04,696 --> 01:39:05,721
Paint a self-portrait.

2034
01:39:05,798 --> 01:39:06,730
Build a house.

2035
01:39:06,799 --> 01:39:08,266
And you?

2036
01:39:08,334 --> 01:39:10,895
I don't know. Get in the right lane.

2037
01:39:10,971 --> 01:39:12,562
I have to know the
answer to this question.

2038
01:39:12,638 --> 01:39:13,696
If you were to die right now,

2039
01:39:13,772 --> 01:39:15,707
how would you feel about your life?

2040
01:39:15,775 --> 01:39:16,799
I don't know!

2041
01:39:16,876 --> 01:39:18,069
I wouldn't feel anything
good about my life.

2042
01:39:18,143 --> 01:39:19,440
Is that what you want
to hear me say? Fine.

2043
01:39:19,511 --> 01:39:21,104
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

2044
01:39:21,181 --> 01:39:22,977
Stop fucking around!

2045
01:39:23,048 --> 01:39:24,310
Tyler!

2046
01:39:26,487 --> 01:39:28,546
Jesus Christ!

2047
01:39:28,623 --> 01:39:29,748
Goddamn it!

2048
01:39:29,823 --> 01:39:31,382
Goddamn it! Fuck you!

2049
01:39:31,459 --> 01:39:32,824
Fuck Fight Club.

2050
01:39:32,893 --> 01:39:35,555
Fuck Marla. I'm sick of all your shit.

2051
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:37,598
OK.

2052
01:39:37,665 --> 01:39:39,326
OK.

2053
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:40,958
Quit screwing around. Take the wheel.

2054
01:39:41,035 --> 01:39:41,967
Look at you.

2055
01:39:42,036 --> 01:39:42,968
Take the wheel!

2056
01:39:43,037 --> 01:39:44,800
Look at you! You're fuckin' pathetic!

2057
01:39:44,872 --> 01:39:46,430
Why? Why? What are you talking about?

2058
01:39:46,507 --> 01:39:49,965
Why do you think I blew up your condo?

2059
01:39:51,078 --> 01:39:52,170
What?

2060
01:39:52,246 --> 01:39:54,271
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.

2061
01:39:54,348 --> 01:39:56,179
It's not a goddamn seminar.

2062
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:58,184
Stop trying to control everything

2063
01:39:58,252 --> 01:39:59,844
and just let go.

2064
01:40:01,689 --> 01:40:03,589
Let go!

2065
01:40:03,658 --> 01:40:05,387
All right. Fine.

2066
01:40:06,595 --> 01:40:08,496
Fine.

2067
01:41:06,392 --> 01:41:09,725
I'd never been in a car accident.

2068
01:41:09,795 --> 01:41:12,730
This must have been what
all those people felt like

2069
01:41:12,798 --> 01:41:16,735
before I filed them as
statistics in my reports.

2070
01:41:16,803 --> 01:41:18,099
Goddamn.

2071
01:41:18,170 --> 01:41:19,603
Huh?

2072
01:41:19,672 --> 01:41:21,664
Ha ha ha ha ha hahh!

2073
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:24,437
We just had a near-life experience.

2074
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:32,185
In the world I see,

2075
01:41:32,253 --> 01:41:35,016
you're stalking elk through
the damp canyon forest,

2076
01:41:35,088 --> 01:41:37,614
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

2077
01:41:39,827 --> 01:41:41,691
You'll wear leather clothes

2078
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:44,698
that will last you
the rest of your life.

2079
01:41:44,766 --> 01:41:48,204
You'll climb the vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

2080
01:41:49,672 --> 01:41:51,606
And when you look down,

2081
01:41:51,674 --> 01:41:54,609
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,

2082
01:41:54,677 --> 01:41:58,112
Laying strips of venison
on the empty carpool lane

2083
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:00,115
of some abandoned superhighway.

2084
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:14,498
Feel better, champ.

2085
01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:34,675
And then...

2086
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:36,186
Tyler?

2087
01:42:36,254 --> 01:42:37,778
Tyler was gone.

2088
01:42:45,596 --> 01:42:47,828
Was I asleep?

2089
01:42:49,501 --> 01:42:50,798
Had I slept?

2090
01:42:50,869 --> 01:42:52,303
You are not a beautiful

2091
01:42:52,371 --> 01:42:53,804
unique snowflake, do you understand me?

2092
01:42:53,873 --> 01:42:56,808
The house had become a living thing,

2093
01:42:56,876 --> 01:42:59,310
wet inside from so many people

2094
01:42:59,378 --> 01:43:00,709
sweating and breathing.

2095
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:02,714
We are all from the same compost.

2096
01:43:02,782 --> 01:43:04,977
So many people moving, the house moved.

2097
01:43:07,288 --> 01:43:08,721
Planet Tyler.

2098
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:10,724
I had to hug the walls.

2099
01:43:10,792 --> 01:43:14,353
Trapped inside this clock
work of space monkeys.

2100
01:43:14,429 --> 01:43:15,862
You can't be smoking in here.

2101
01:43:15,930 --> 01:43:18,660
Do you know how much ether
we have in this fucking house?

2102
01:43:18,733 --> 01:43:21,065
Cooking, working, and sleeping in teams.

2103
01:43:23,639 --> 01:43:25,367
Hang on a second.

2104
01:43:44,294 --> 01:43:46,955
It's under control, sir.

2105
01:43:49,465 --> 01:43:51,331
Where is Tyler?

2106
01:43:51,401 --> 01:43:54,392
Sir, the first rule of
Project Mayhem is you do not-

2107
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:56,405
Right, uh... OK.

2108
01:43:58,841 --> 01:44:01,208
I'm all alone.

2109
01:44:01,278 --> 01:44:03,212
My father dumped me.

2110
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:04,712
Tyler dumped me.

2111
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:07,979
I am Jack’s broken heart.

2112
01:44:11,255 --> 01:44:14,190
What comes next in Project Mayhem,

2113
01:44:14,258 --> 01:44:15,724
only Tyler knows.

2114
01:44:15,792 --> 01:44:19,251
The second rule is you
do not ask questions.

2115
01:44:21,732 --> 01:44:23,165
Get the fuck away from me.

2116
01:44:23,234 --> 01:44:24,724
Get the fuck away from me!

2117
01:44:24,802 --> 01:44:27,204
Who are all these people?

2118
01:44:32,479 --> 01:44:34,605
Paper Street Soap Company.

2119
01:44:36,849 --> 01:44:38,908
Can I come in?

2120
01:44:41,955 --> 01:44:43,617
He's not here.

2121
01:44:43,691 --> 01:44:45,851
What?

2122
01:44:47,127 --> 01:44:50,528
Tyler isn't here.

2123
01:44:50,597 --> 01:44:53,066
Tyler went away.

2124
01:44:53,134 --> 01:44:54,431
Tyler's gone.

2125
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:26,192
Lay him down!

2126
01:45:26,267 --> 01:45:27,599
Gunshot wounds comin' through!

2127
01:45:27,670 --> 01:45:30,052
Clear some fucking room!

2128
01:45:30,185 --> 01:45:32,449
What happened?! What happened?!

2129
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,078
We were on assignment.
We were supposed to kill

2130
01:45:34,155 --> 01:45:36,623
2 birds with one stone.

2131
01:45:36,691 --> 01:45:38,784
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

2132
01:45:38,860 --> 01:45:41,421
Operation Latte Thunder, go.

2133
01:45:43,331 --> 01:45:45,196
And trash a franchise coffee bar.

2134
01:45:51,676 --> 01:45:52,973
We had it all worked out, sir.

2135
01:46:02,186 --> 01:46:03,175
It went smooth until...

2136
01:46:03,254 --> 01:46:05,483
Police! Freeze!

2137
01:46:05,555 --> 01:46:07,149
Until what?

2138
01:46:07,226 --> 01:46:08,250
They shot Bob.

2139
01:46:09,828 --> 01:46:11,124
They shot him in the head.

2140
01:46:11,195 --> 01:46:12,184
Those fuckin' pigs!

2141
01:46:15,701 --> 01:46:16,632
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

2142
01:46:16,701 --> 01:46:18,693
- Oh, God.
- Son of a-

2143
01:46:19,771 --> 01:46:21,863
Those motherfuckers!

2144
01:46:21,939 --> 01:46:23,703
You morons.

2145
01:46:23,775 --> 01:46:26,039
You're running around in ski masks,

2146
01:46:26,111 --> 01:46:27,237
trying to blow things up.

2147
01:46:27,312 --> 01:46:28,574
What did you think was gonna happen?!

2148
01:46:32,651 --> 01:46:33,618
OK, quick,

2149
01:46:33,685 --> 01:46:35,050
we gotta get rid of the evidence.

2150
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:36,052
We gotta get rid of this body!

2151
01:46:36,121 --> 01:46:37,110
Bury him.

2152
01:46:37,189 --> 01:46:38,622
What?

2153
01:46:38,690 --> 01:46:39,622
Take him to the garden

2154
01:46:39,691 --> 01:46:40,817
and bury him.

2155
01:46:41,927 --> 01:46:42,859
Come on, people!

2156
01:46:42,928 --> 01:46:43,860
Let's go!

2157
01:46:43,929 --> 01:46:45,089
Hey, get the fuck off!

2158
01:46:45,164 --> 01:46:46,096
Get away from him!

2159
01:46:46,165 --> 01:46:47,724
What are you talking about?

2160
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:49,131
This isn't a fucking piece of evidence,

2161
01:46:49,202 --> 01:46:50,465
this is a person!

2162
01:46:50,537 --> 01:46:51,469
He's a friend of mine,

2163
01:46:51,538 --> 01:46:52,630
and you're not gonna bury him

2164
01:46:52,705 --> 01:46:53,694
in the fucking garden.

2165
01:46:53,773 --> 01:46:56,765
He was killed serving
Project Mayhem, sir.

2166
01:46:56,843 --> 01:46:57,969
This is Bob.

2167
01:46:58,044 --> 01:47:00,479
But sir, in-in Project Mayhem

2168
01:47:00,548 --> 01:47:02,105
we have no names.

2169
01:47:02,182 --> 01:47:03,149
No, you listen to me.

2170
01:47:03,216 --> 01:47:05,081
This is a man, and he has a name.

2171
01:47:05,151 --> 01:47:07,781
And it's Robert Paulson, OK?

2172
01:47:07,856 --> 01:47:09,221
Robert Paulson?

2173
01:47:09,291 --> 01:47:10,884
He's a man and he's dead now

2174
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:11,984
because of us, all right?

2175
01:47:12,061 --> 01:47:13,255
Do you understand that?

2176
01:47:13,329 --> 01:47:15,558
I understand.

2177
01:47:18,134 --> 01:47:19,430
In death,

2178
01:47:19,501 --> 01:47:21,265
a member of Project Mayhem

2179
01:47:21,337 --> 01:47:22,964
has a name.

2180
01:47:24,207 --> 01:47:26,401
His name is Robert Paulson.

2181
01:47:27,477 --> 01:47:29,308
His name is Robert Paulson.

2182
01:47:29,379 --> 01:47:33,475
His name is Robert Paulson.

2183
01:47:33,550 --> 01:47:36,575
His name is Robert Paulson.

2184
01:47:36,652 --> 01:47:37,984
Come on, guys, please, stop it.

2185
01:47:38,055 --> 01:47:39,522
His name is Robert Paulson.

2186
01:47:39,590 --> 01:47:42,217
His name is Robert Paulson.

2187
01:47:42,291 --> 01:47:44,317
Shut up!

2188
01:47:44,394 --> 01:47:45,383
This is all over with!

2189
01:47:45,462 --> 01:47:47,225
His name is Robert Paulson.

2190
01:47:47,297 --> 01:47:49,424
His name is Robert Paulson.

2191
01:47:49,499 --> 01:47:52,059
His name is Robert Paulson.

2192
01:47:52,135 --> 01:47:54,660
His name is Robert Paulson.

2193
01:47:54,738 --> 01:47:57,036
His name is Robert Paulson...

2194
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:21,989
Tyler?

2195
01:48:22,067 --> 01:48:23,328
No, this is Detective Stern

2196
01:48:23,401 --> 01:48:24,333
at the Arson Unit.

2197
01:48:24,402 --> 01:48:25,495
I need to see you in my office-

2198
01:48:30,478 --> 01:48:31,570
I went to all the cities

2199
01:48:31,646 --> 01:48:33,477
on Tyler's used ticket stubs,

2200
01:48:33,547 --> 01:48:34,478
barhopping.

2201
01:48:35,549 --> 01:48:36,846
I didn't know how or why,

2202
01:48:36,917 --> 01:48:38,544
but I could look at 50 different bars

2203
01:48:38,619 --> 01:48:40,210
and somehow I just knew.

2204
01:48:40,287 --> 01:48:41,255
I'm looking for Tyler Durden.

2205
01:48:41,322 --> 01:48:44,052
It's very important that I talk to him.

2206
01:48:44,125 --> 01:48:45,716
I wish I could help you.

2207
01:48:46,794 --> 01:48:47,727
Sir.

2208
01:48:53,769 --> 01:48:55,498
Every city I went to...

2209
01:48:57,205 --> 01:48:59,537
as soon as I set foot off the plane,

2210
01:48:59,608 --> 01:49:01,839
I knew a Fight Club was close.

2211
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:04,640
Hey! Hey!

2212
01:49:04,713 --> 01:49:06,305
Taxi!

2213
01:49:06,381 --> 01:49:07,849
Look at my face. I'm a member.

2214
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:09,076
Now, I just need to know

2215
01:49:09,151 --> 01:49:11,119
if you’ve seen Tyler.

2216
01:49:11,186 --> 01:49:13,314
I'm not exposed to...

2217
01:49:13,389 --> 01:49:14,946
speak any such information to you,

2218
01:49:15,023 --> 01:49:16,752
nor would I, even if
I had said information

2219
01:49:16,825 --> 01:49:19,658
you want at this juncture, be able.

2220
01:49:21,330 --> 01:49:22,592
You're a moron.

2221
01:49:22,664 --> 01:49:24,030
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

2222
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:27,595
Tyler had been busy.

2223
01:49:27,670 --> 01:49:30,401
Setting up franchises
all over the country.

2224
01:49:33,209 --> 01:49:34,677
Was I asleep?

2225
01:49:36,146 --> 01:49:37,669
Had I slept?

2226
01:49:37,747 --> 01:49:39,306
Is Tyler my bad dream,

2227
01:49:39,383 --> 01:49:41,317
or am I Tyler's?

2228
01:49:41,385 --> 01:49:42,783
We’ve just heard the stories.

2229
01:49:42,852 --> 01:49:44,080
What kind of stories?

2230
01:49:44,154 --> 01:49:45,644
Like, nobody knows what he looks like.

2231
01:49:45,723 --> 01:49:46,655
He has facial

2232
01:49:46,724 --> 01:49:47,656
reconstructive surgery

2233
01:49:47,727 --> 01:49:48,818
every 3 years.

2234
01:49:48,893 --> 01:49:51,192
That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

2235
01:49:51,263 --> 01:49:53,697
Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?

2236
01:49:53,766 --> 01:49:56,098
Is Mr. Durden building an army?

2237
01:49:56,168 --> 01:49:57,795
I was living in a state

2238
01:49:57,870 --> 01:50:00,031
of perpetual déjà vu.

2239
01:50:00,106 --> 01:50:01,698
Everywhere I went,

2240
01:50:01,774 --> 01:50:04,174
I felt I'd already been there.

2241
01:50:04,243 --> 01:50:08,180
It was like following an invisible man.

2242
01:50:08,248 --> 01:50:10,341
The smell of dried blood,

2243
01:50:10,417 --> 01:50:14,717
dirty, bare footprints
circling each other,

2244
01:50:14,788 --> 01:50:18,189
that aroma of old sweat,
like fried chicken.

2245
01:50:18,258 --> 01:50:19,987
The feel of a floor still warm

2246
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:21,653
from the fight the night before.

2247
01:50:21,729 --> 01:50:25,664
I was always just one step behind Tyler.

2248
01:50:28,202 --> 01:50:30,192
His name is Robert Paulson.

2249
01:50:30,270 --> 01:50:32,637
His name is Robert Paulson.

2250
01:50:32,707 --> 01:50:33,639
His-

2251
01:50:36,476 --> 01:50:37,808
Welcome back, sir.

2252
01:50:39,380 --> 01:50:40,539
How have you been?

2253
01:50:42,282 --> 01:50:43,443
Do you know me?

2254
01:50:44,519 --> 01:50:46,008
Is this a test, sir?

2255
01:50:46,086 --> 01:50:47,988
No, this is not a test.

2256
01:50:48,056 --> 01:50:51,786
You were in here last Thursday.

2257
01:50:51,859 --> 01:50:53,259
Thursday?

2258
01:50:53,328 --> 01:50:54,260
You were standing

2259
01:50:54,329 --> 01:50:55,694
exactly where you are now,

2260
01:50:55,764 --> 01:50:58,494
asking how good security is.

2261
01:50:58,567 --> 01:50:59,864
It's tight as a drum, sir.

2262
01:51:02,404 --> 01:51:04,770
Who do you think I am?

2263
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:07,400
Are you sure this isn't a test?

2264
01:51:07,476 --> 01:51:09,412
No, this is not a test.

2265
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:12,881
You're Mr. Durden.

2266
01:51:12,950 --> 01:51:15,510
You're the one who gave me this.

2267
01:51:16,654 --> 01:51:17,882
Please return your seat backs

2268
01:51:17,955 --> 01:51:20,617
to their full, upright
and locked position.

2269
01:51:31,471 --> 01:51:32,402
Yeah?

2270
01:51:32,471 --> 01:51:33,403
Marla, it's me.

2271
01:51:33,472 --> 01:51:34,700
Have we ever done it?

2272
01:51:34,773 --> 01:51:35,706
Done what?

2273
01:51:35,775 --> 01:51:36,901
Have we ever had sex?

2274
01:51:36,976 --> 01:51:39,136
What kind of stupid question is that?

2275
01:51:39,211 --> 01:51:40,577
Is it stupid because the answer's yes,

2276
01:51:40,646 --> 01:51:41,613
or because the answer's no?

2277
01:51:41,681 --> 01:51:43,147
Is this a trick?

2278
01:51:43,215 --> 01:51:44,477
No, Marla, I need to know-

2279
01:51:44,549 --> 01:51:45,709
You mean you want to know if I think

2280
01:51:45,784 --> 01:51:48,253
we were just having sex or making love?

2281
01:51:48,321 --> 01:51:50,481
We did make love.

2282
01:51:50,555 --> 01:51:51,716
Is that what you're calling it?

2283
01:51:51,791 --> 01:51:53,053
Just answer the question,

2284
01:51:53,125 --> 01:51:54,057
Marla, please!

2285
01:51:54,126 --> 01:51:55,114
Did we do it or not?

2286
01:51:55,193 --> 01:51:56,718
You fuck me, then snub me.

2287
01:51:56,796 --> 01:51:57,820
You love me, you hate me.

2288
01:51:57,897 --> 01:51:59,296
You show me a sensitive side,

2289
01:51:59,365 --> 01:52:00,854
then you turn into a total asshole.

2290
01:52:00,932 --> 01:52:01,957
Is that a pretty accurate description

2291
01:52:02,034 --> 01:52:03,399
of our relationship, Tyler?

2292
01:52:03,469 --> 01:52:06,130
We have just lost cabin pressure.

2293
01:52:06,204 --> 01:52:07,137
What did you just say?

2294
01:52:07,206 --> 01:52:08,231
What is wrong with you?

2295
01:52:08,308 --> 01:52:09,570
What did you call me? Say my name!

2296
01:52:09,643 --> 01:52:11,611
Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden,

2297
01:52:11,678 --> 01:52:13,305
you fucking freak. What's going on?

2298
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:14,312
I'm coming over.

2299
01:52:14,381 --> 01:52:15,370
No, wait, Marla, I'm not there-

2300
01:52:17,584 --> 01:52:19,347
You broke your promise.

2301
01:52:19,419 --> 01:52:20,408
Jesus, Tyler.

2302
01:52:20,487 --> 01:52:22,148
You fuckin' talked to her about me.

2303
01:52:22,222 --> 01:52:23,951
Tyler, what the fuck is going on here?

2304
01:52:24,024 --> 01:52:25,719
I asked you for one thing,

2305
01:52:25,792 --> 01:52:27,487
one simple thing.

2306
01:52:27,561 --> 01:52:28,758
Why do people think that I'm you?

2307
01:52:30,432 --> 01:52:31,626
Answer me!

2308
01:52:35,371 --> 01:52:36,303
Sit.

2309
01:52:39,709 --> 01:52:40,640
Now answer me.

2310
01:52:40,709 --> 01:52:42,199
Why do people think that I'm you?

2311
01:52:43,512 --> 01:52:44,502
I think you know.

2312
01:52:44,581 --> 01:52:46,105
No, I don't.

2313
01:52:46,182 --> 01:52:47,239
Yes, you do.

2314
01:52:47,316 --> 01:52:49,980
Why would anyone possibly
confuse you with me?

2315
01:52:51,155 --> 01:52:53,884
Uh... I... I don't know.

2316
01:52:57,695 --> 01:52:59,059
You got it.

2317
01:52:59,129 --> 01:53:00,563
No.

2318
01:53:00,631 --> 01:53:01,598
Do not fuck with us.

2319
01:53:01,666 --> 01:53:02,855
Say it.

2320
01:53:04,356 --> 01:53:06,120
Because...

2321
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:08,618
Say it.

2322
01:53:10,529 --> 01:53:12,394
Because we're the same person.

2323
01:53:12,465 --> 01:53:14,626
That's right.

2324
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:16,861
We are the all-singing,
all dancing-

2325
01:53:16,936 --> 01:53:18,460
I don't understand this.

2326
01:53:18,537 --> 01:53:19,469
You were looking for a way

2327
01:53:19,538 --> 01:53:20,663
to change your life.

2328
01:53:20,739 --> 01:53:23,038
You could not do this on your own.

2329
01:53:23,109 --> 01:53:25,009
All the ways you wish you could be,

2330
01:53:25,077 --> 01:53:26,635
that's me.

2331
01:53:27,713 --> 01:53:28,976
I look like you wanna look,

2332
01:53:29,049 --> 01:53:30,209
I fuck like you wanna fuck,

2333
01:53:30,284 --> 01:53:31,649
I am smart, capable,

2334
01:53:31,719 --> 01:53:33,879
and most importantly, I am free

2335
01:53:33,954 --> 01:53:35,478
in all the ways that you are not.

2336
01:53:35,555 --> 01:53:36,544
Oh, no.

2337
01:53:36,623 --> 01:53:37,556
Tyler's not here.

2338
01:53:37,625 --> 01:53:38,556
Tyler went away.

2339
01:53:38,625 --> 01:53:39,557
- Tyler's gone.
- What?

2340
01:53:39,626 --> 01:53:41,059
This is impossible.

2341
01:53:41,128 --> 01:53:42,687
- No.
- This is crazy.

2342
01:53:42,764 --> 01:53:44,094
People do it every day.

2343
01:53:44,164 --> 01:53:45,495
They talk to themselves.

2344
01:53:45,565 --> 01:53:47,727
They see themselves
as they'd like to be.

2345
01:53:47,802 --> 01:53:49,737
They don't have the courage you have,

2346
01:53:49,805 --> 01:53:50,999
to just run with it.

2347
01:53:54,844 --> 01:53:56,708
Naturally, you're
still wrestling with it,

2348
01:53:56,779 --> 01:53:58,247
so sometimes you're still you.

2349
01:53:58,315 --> 01:54:00,112
We should do this again sometime.

2350
01:54:00,183 --> 01:54:03,049
Other times, you imagine
yourself watching me.

2351
01:54:03,118 --> 01:54:04,450
If this is your first
night at Fight Club,

2352
01:54:04,521 --> 01:54:05,613
you have to fight.

2353
01:54:05,689 --> 01:54:07,019
Little by little,

2354
01:54:07,089 --> 01:54:10,390
you’re just letting yourself become...

2355
01:54:10,461 --> 01:54:12,860
Tyler Durden.

2356
01:54:12,929 --> 01:54:13,953
You are not your job,

2357
01:54:14,031 --> 01:54:15,726
or how much money you have in the bank!

2358
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:16,960
No, you have a house.

2359
01:54:17,034 --> 01:54:18,227
Rented in your name.

2360
01:54:18,301 --> 01:54:20,236
You have jobs, you have a whole life.

2361
01:54:20,304 --> 01:54:21,896
You have night jobs
because you can't sleep.

2362
01:54:21,973 --> 01:54:23,803
Or you stay up and make soap.

2363
01:54:23,873 --> 01:54:25,398
Marla-You're fucking Marla, Tyler.

2364
01:54:25,476 --> 01:54:27,444
Uh, technically, you're fucking Marla.

2365
01:54:27,511 --> 01:54:28,808
But it's all the same to her.

2366
01:54:31,148 --> 01:54:32,638
Oh, my God.

2367
01:54:33,718 --> 01:54:35,709
Now you see our dilemma.

2368
01:54:35,786 --> 01:54:37,811
She knows too much.

2369
01:54:38,956 --> 01:54:40,014
I think we're going to have to talk

2370
01:54:40,091 --> 01:54:43,288
about how this might
compromise our goals.

2371
01:54:43,361 --> 01:54:46,388
Wh-What are you saying?

2372
01:54:46,465 --> 01:54:48,125
This is
- This is bullshit.

2373
01:54:48,199 --> 01:54:49,690
This is bullshit.

2374
01:54:49,768 --> 01:54:50,735
I'm not listening to this.

2375
01:54:50,802 --> 01:54:51,735
You are insane.

2376
01:54:51,804 --> 01:54:53,634
No, you're insane.

2377
01:54:53,705 --> 01:54:56,230
And we simply do not
have time for this crap.

2378
01:54:58,810 --> 01:55:00,675
It's called a changeover.

2379
01:55:00,746 --> 01:55:02,271
The movie goes on,

2380
01:55:02,348 --> 01:55:03,781
and nobody in the audience

2381
01:55:03,850 --> 01:55:05,407
has any idea.

2382
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,332
Sir!

2383
01:55:19,401 --> 01:55:20,732
Are you checking out?

2384
01:55:20,802 --> 01:55:21,995
Yeah, uh, b-bill me.

2385
01:55:22,069 --> 01:55:23,731
I need you to initial this list

2386
01:55:23,805 --> 01:55:24,897
of phone calls, please.

2387
01:55:28,910 --> 01:55:30,071
When were these made?

2388
01:55:30,146 --> 01:55:31,340
It says right there, sir,

2389
01:55:31,414 --> 01:55:32,971
between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.

2390
01:55:33,048 --> 01:55:34,380
No, I w-

2391
01:55:38,287 --> 01:55:39,345
Have I been going to bed

2392
01:55:39,422 --> 01:55:40,684
earlier every night?

2393
01:55:40,756 --> 01:55:42,781
Have I been sleeping later?

2394
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:47,786
Have I been Tyler longer and longer?

2395
01:55:51,333 --> 01:55:52,265
Is anybody here?

2396
01:55:55,338 --> 01:55:58,170
Déjà vu all over again.

2397
01:55:59,241 --> 01:56:00,174
Yeah, with enough soap,

2398
01:56:00,243 --> 01:56:01,641
we could blow up just about anything.

2399
01:56:04,814 --> 01:56:06,840
Oh, my God.

2400
01:56:09,953 --> 01:56:10,921
1888.

2401
01:56:10,988 --> 01:56:12,250
I'm sorry, who am I calling?

2402
01:56:12,323 --> 01:56:14,290
1888 Franklin. This is Maintenance.

2403
01:56:16,394 --> 01:56:17,827
Hello?

2404
01:56:17,895 --> 01:56:18,826
Hello?

2405
01:56:18,895 --> 01:56:20,760
1888 Franklin Street?

2406
01:56:20,831 --> 01:56:23,926
Yes. Can I help you?

2407
01:56:26,236 --> 01:56:27,864
Hello?

2408
01:56:27,939 --> 01:56:29,065
Yeah, yeah.

2409
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:30,403
Uh, I need to talk to your supervisor

2410
01:56:30,476 --> 01:56:31,408
right away.

2411
01:56:31,477 --> 01:56:32,410
Speaking.

2412
01:56:32,479 --> 01:56:33,411
OK, listen to me.

2413
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:34,674
I think something really terrible

2414
01:56:34,747 --> 01:56:35,714
is about to happen at your building.

2415
01:56:35,781 --> 01:56:36,770
You have got-

2416
01:56:36,849 --> 01:56:38,078
It's under control, sir.

2417
01:56:39,452 --> 01:56:40,419
Excuse me?

2418
01:56:40,487 --> 01:56:42,044
Don't worry about us, sir.

2419
01:56:42,121 --> 01:56:43,521
We're solid.

2420
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:48,457
2160.

2421
01:56:56,403 --> 01:56:57,427
Marla! Marla!

2422
01:56:57,505 --> 01:56:59,496
Hey! Fuck! Wait!

2423
01:57:00,574 --> 01:57:02,269
Wait, I gotta talk to you!

2424
01:57:02,343 --> 01:57:03,504
Marla, Marla!

2425
01:57:03,578 --> 01:57:04,669
Your whacked-out bald freaks

2426
01:57:04,745 --> 01:57:06,212
hit me with a fucking broom!

2427
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:07,941
They almost broke my arm!

2428
01:57:08,015 --> 01:57:09,643
They were burning their
fingertips with lye,

2429
01:57:09,718 --> 01:57:10,706
the stink was unbelievable.

2430
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:11,716
Look-Look, listen,

2431
01:57:11,785 --> 01:57:12,717
it's gonna take a tremendous act

2432
01:57:12,786 --> 01:57:13,718
of faith on your part,

2433
01:57:13,787 --> 01:57:14,755
but you've got to hear me out.

2434
01:57:14,823 --> 01:57:16,722
Oh, here comes an avalanche of bullshit.

2435
01:57:16,790 --> 01:57:18,257
A little more faith than that.

2436
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:23,562
No, listen, I don't want to hear

2437
01:57:23,631 --> 01:57:24,564
anything you have to say.

2438
01:57:24,633 --> 01:57:26,692
You have every right to be...

2439
01:57:26,768 --> 01:57:28,826
Um, I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

2440
01:57:28,903 --> 01:57:31,840
Sir, anything you order
is free of charge, sir.

2441
01:57:31,908 --> 01:57:33,966
Why is it free of charge?

2442
01:57:34,042 --> 01:57:35,134
Don't-Don't ask.

2443
01:57:35,211 --> 01:57:36,269
Whatever.

2444
01:57:36,345 --> 01:57:38,972
I'll have the clam
chowder, the fried chicken

2445
01:57:39,047 --> 01:57:40,139
with the baked potato with everything,

2446
01:57:40,215 --> 01:57:41,683
and a chocolate chiffon pie.

2447
01:57:41,751 --> 01:57:43,844
Clean food, please.

2448
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:45,682
In that case, sir, may I advise against

2449
01:57:45,755 --> 01:57:46,983
the lady eating the clam chowder?

2450
01:57:47,056 --> 01:57:49,047
No clam chowder, thank you.

2451
01:57:51,262 --> 01:57:52,786
You've got about 30 seconds.

2452
01:57:55,533 --> 01:57:56,465
Marla, I know that I've been acting

2453
01:57:56,534 --> 01:57:57,728
very, very strange.

2454
01:57:57,802 --> 01:57:59,963
OK, I know that it's got to seem

2455
01:58:00,038 --> 01:58:01,096
Like there's 2 sides to me-

2456
01:58:01,172 --> 01:58:02,104
2 sides?

2457
01:58:02,173 --> 01:58:03,470
You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.

2458
01:58:03,541 --> 01:58:04,473
I deserve that, but-

2459
01:58:04,542 --> 01:58:05,702
I've come to realize something

2460
01:58:05,777 --> 01:58:06,709
very, very important.

2461
01:58:06,778 --> 01:58:07,836
What?

2462
01:58:07,912 --> 01:58:09,345
The full extent of our relationship

2463
01:58:09,414 --> 01:58:11,474
wasn't really clear to me up until now,

2464
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:12,745
for reasons I'm not going to go into,

2465
01:58:12,819 --> 01:58:14,251
but the important thing is, I know

2466
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:15,514
that I haven't been
treating you so nice.

2467
01:58:15,588 --> 01:58:16,520
Yeah, whatever.

2468
01:58:16,589 --> 01:58:17,557
No, no
- 15 seconds.

2469
01:58:17,624 --> 01:58:18,818
15 seconds, please, please.

2470
01:58:18,892 --> 01:58:20,722
15 seconds, don't open your mouth.

2471
01:58:20,793 --> 01:58:23,354
I'm trying to tell you that I'm sorry.

2472
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:24,624
Because what I've come to realize

2473
01:58:24,698 --> 01:58:27,461
is that I really like you, Marla.

2474
01:58:28,668 --> 01:58:29,965
You do?

2475
01:58:30,036 --> 01:58:31,559
I really do.

2476
01:58:31,637 --> 01:58:32,604
I care about you

2477
01:58:32,671 --> 01:58:33,696
and I don't want anything bad

2478
01:58:33,773 --> 01:58:36,332
to happen to you because of me.

2479
01:58:36,408 --> 01:58:39,105
Marla, your life is in danger.

2480
01:58:40,247 --> 01:58:41,179
What?

2481
01:58:41,248 --> 01:58:43,647
You need to leave town for a while.

2482
01:58:43,716 --> 01:58:44,979
Get out of any major city

2483
01:58:45,051 --> 01:58:46,177
and just go camping or something.

2484
01:58:46,253 --> 01:58:47,311
You're an insane person.

2485
01:58:47,387 --> 01:58:48,478
No, no, I've involved you

2486
01:58:48,554 --> 01:58:50,353
in something terrible
that's about to happen.

2487
01:58:50,424 --> 01:58:51,857
No. Shut up,

2488
01:58:51,926 --> 01:58:53,086
shut up!

2489
01:58:56,297 --> 01:58:58,026
Listen, I tried, Tyler.

2490
01:58:58,099 --> 01:58:59,258
I really tried.

2491
01:58:59,332 --> 01:59:00,265
I know you did.

2492
01:59:00,334 --> 01:59:02,302
There are things about you I like.

2493
01:59:02,370 --> 01:59:03,860
You're smart, you're funny,

2494
01:59:03,938 --> 01:59:06,304
you're spectacular in bed.

2495
01:59:06,374 --> 01:59:09,537
But you're intolerable.

2496
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:12,513
You have very serious
emotional problems.

2497
01:59:12,582 --> 01:59:14,345
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek

2498
01:59:14,417 --> 01:59:15,749
professional help.

2499
01:59:15,819 --> 01:59:17,217
I know, and I'm sorry.

2500
01:59:17,287 --> 01:59:18,151
Yeah, you're sorry, I'm sorry,

2501
01:59:18,221 --> 01:59:19,347
everyone's sorry. But...

2502
01:59:20,890 --> 01:59:22,585
I can't do this anymore.

2503
01:59:23,693 --> 01:59:25,217
I can't.

2504
01:59:25,295 --> 01:59:26,285
And I won't.

2505
01:59:27,865 --> 01:59:28,888
I'm gone.

2506
01:59:30,601 --> 01:59:31,533
You can't leave, Marla,

2507
01:59:31,603 --> 01:59:33,272
you're not safe!

2508
01:59:37,176 --> 01:59:38,108
No! Leave me alone!

2509
01:59:38,177 --> 01:59:40,041
Marla, I'm trying to protect you.

2510
01:59:40,111 --> 01:59:41,635
I don't ever want to see you again!

2511
01:59:41,713 --> 01:59:43,375
That's fine, if that's what it takes...

2512
01:59:43,449 --> 01:59:44,780
You wait. Wait right here.

2513
01:59:49,455 --> 01:59:50,387
Hold it right there.

2514
01:59:50,456 --> 01:59:51,387
Shut up!

2515
01:59:51,456 --> 01:59:52,480
Shut up!

2516
01:59:52,557 --> 01:59:54,389
Take this money and get on this bus.

2517
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:55,392
And I promise you

2518
01:59:55,461 --> 01:59:56,450
I will never bother you again

2519
01:59:56,529 --> 01:59:57,460
if that's what you want.

2520
01:59:57,529 --> 01:59:58,758
Shut up!

2521
01:59:58,831 --> 02:00:00,162
Please get on the bus.

2522
02:00:00,232 --> 02:00:01,631
Please get on the bus!

2523
02:00:03,402 --> 02:00:04,562
Why are you doing this?

2524
02:00:04,637 --> 02:00:06,229
Because they think you're
some kind of a threat.

2525
02:00:06,305 --> 02:00:07,397
I-I can't explain it right now,

2526
02:00:07,473 --> 02:00:08,404
just trust me.

2527
02:00:08,473 --> 02:00:09,406
If I see where you're going,

2528
02:00:09,475 --> 02:00:10,408
you will not be safe.

2529
02:00:10,477 --> 02:00:11,671
I'm not paying this back.

2530
02:00:11,745 --> 02:00:13,212
I consider it asshole tax.

2531
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,373
That's fine. Remember,
stay out of major cities

2532
02:00:15,449 --> 02:00:16,575
for at least a couple of days, OK?

2533
02:00:16,650 --> 02:00:17,582
Tyler.

2534
02:00:19,186 --> 02:00:20,517
You're the worst thing

2535
02:00:20,587 --> 02:00:21,986
that ever happened to me.

2536
02:00:37,072 --> 02:00:38,437
Hello.

2537
02:00:38,507 --> 02:00:40,099
I need you to arrest me.

2538
02:00:40,175 --> 02:00:42,474
I am the leader of a
terrorist organization

2539
02:00:42,544 --> 02:00:44,842
responsible for numerous
acts of vandalism,

2540
02:00:44,913 --> 02:00:46,609
and assault all over this city.

2541
02:00:47,684 --> 02:00:48,911
...in the metropolitan area,

2542
02:00:48,984 --> 02:00:51,511
with probably a couple hundred members.

2543
02:00:51,589 --> 02:00:52,681
Chapters have sprung up

2544
02:00:52,757 --> 02:00:55,520
in 5 or 6 other major cities already.

2545
02:00:55,592 --> 02:00:58,653
This is a tightly
regimented organization,

2546
02:00:58,729 --> 02:01:00,821
with many cells capable of operating

2547
02:01:00,897 --> 02:01:03,924
completely independent
of central leadership.

2548
02:01:04,001 --> 02:01:06,127
Look, look, go to that house, OK?

2549
02:01:06,202 --> 02:01:08,330
1537 Paper Street.

2550
02:01:08,406 --> 02:01:10,340
That's our headquarters.

2551
02:01:10,408 --> 02:01:12,933
In the back, buried in the garden,

2552
02:01:13,010 --> 02:01:16,104
you'll find the body of Robert Paulson.

2553
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:18,114
In the basement,

2554
02:01:18,182 --> 02:01:19,376
you're gonna find some bathtubs

2555
02:01:19,450 --> 02:01:20,974
that have been used very recently

2556
02:01:21,051 --> 02:01:25,078
to make large quantities
of nitroglycerin.

2557
02:01:25,156 --> 02:01:26,214
I believe the plan

2558
02:01:26,290 --> 02:01:28,054
is to blow up the headquarters

2559
02:01:28,126 --> 02:01:29,717
of these credit card companies,

2560
02:01:29,794 --> 02:01:31,660
and the T.R.W. Building.

2561
02:01:33,399 --> 02:01:34,626
Why these buildings?

2562
02:01:34,699 --> 02:01:36,724
Why credit card companies?

2563
02:01:36,802 --> 02:01:38,634
If you erase the debt record,

2564
02:01:38,704 --> 02:01:41,194
then we all go back to zero.

2565
02:01:41,273 --> 02:01:43,298
It'll create total chaos.

2566
02:01:46,077 --> 02:01:47,066
Keep him talking.

2567
02:01:47,145 --> 02:01:48,134
I need to make a phone call.

2568
02:01:59,026 --> 02:02:00,961
I really admire what you're doing.

2569
02:02:02,630 --> 02:02:03,561
What?

2570
02:02:03,630 --> 02:02:05,826
You're a brave man to order this.

2571
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:07,561
You're a genius, sir.

2572
02:02:07,635 --> 02:02:10,571
You said, if anyone ever interferes

2573
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:12,402
with Project
Mayhem- even you-

2574
02:02:12,475 --> 02:02:14,772
we gotta get his bails.

2575
02:02:16,245 --> 02:02:17,212
It's useless to fight.

2576
02:02:17,279 --> 02:02:18,405
This is really a powerful gesture,

2577
02:02:18,481 --> 02:02:19,413
Mr. Durden.

2578
02:02:19,482 --> 02:02:20,743
It'll set quite an example.

2579
02:02:20,815 --> 02:02:22,909
You're making a big mistake, fellas.

2580
02:02:22,985 --> 02:02:23,917
You said you'd say that.

2581
02:02:23,986 --> 02:02:25,453
I'm not Tyler Durden!

2582
02:02:25,521 --> 02:02:27,045
You told us you'd say that, too.

2583
02:02:27,122 --> 02:02:29,955
All right, I am Tyler Durden.

2584
02:02:30,025 --> 02:02:31,219
Listen to me,

2585
02:02:31,293 --> 02:02:32,851
I'm giving you a direct order.

2586
02:02:32,928 --> 02:02:34,919
We are aborting this mission, right now.

2587
02:02:34,997 --> 02:02:36,396
You said you would definitely say that.

2588
02:02:42,606 --> 02:02:43,629
Are you fucking out of your minds?

2589
02:02:43,706 --> 02:02:45,003
You're police officers!

2590
02:02:48,011 --> 02:02:49,136
Somebody timing this?

2591
02:02:49,211 --> 02:02:50,143
No! No!

2592
02:02:50,212 --> 02:02:51,737
Keep your mouth shut!

2593
02:02:52,817 --> 02:02:53,749
Shit.

2594
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:57,487
Yeah?

2595
02:02:57,554 --> 02:02:58,579
Hey, you know, some of this information

2596
02:02:58,656 --> 02:02:59,918
checks out.

2597
02:02:59,991 --> 02:03:01,548
Let's go over to that house

2598
02:03:01,625 --> 02:03:02,683
on Paper Street.

2599
02:03:02,759 --> 02:03:03,818
Be right there.

2600
02:03:04,896 --> 02:03:06,260
Hey! Wait!

2601
02:03:06,329 --> 02:03:07,557
I got him.

2602
02:03:07,631 --> 02:03:08,894
Sir, we have to do this, sir.

2603
02:03:08,966 --> 02:03:10,092
Stop fighting.

2604
02:03:10,167 --> 02:03:11,466
Where's the rubber band?

2605
02:03:11,538 --> 02:03:12,629
Get away from me!

2606
02:03:12,704 --> 02:03:13,636
Drop that fucking knife!

2607
02:03:13,705 --> 02:03:14,638
Drop it!

2608
02:03:17,876 --> 02:03:18,808
Back up.

2609
02:03:18,877 --> 02:03:19,936
Face down on the floor,

2610
02:03:20,013 --> 02:03:20,945
both of you, right now!

2611
02:03:23,515 --> 02:03:25,108
Get down on the floor!

2612
02:03:29,721 --> 02:03:31,691
First person comes out this fucking door

2613
02:03:31,759 --> 02:03:33,920
gets a-gets a lead
salad, you understand?

2614
02:03:58,953 --> 02:04:00,853
Get away! Get away!

2615
02:04:13,569 --> 02:04:15,035
I ran.

2616
02:04:16,571 --> 02:04:18,301
I ran until my muscles burned

2617
02:04:18,374 --> 02:04:20,501
and my veins pumped battery acid.

2618
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:24,940
Then I ran some more.

2619
02:05:06,558 --> 02:05:08,389
What the fuck are you doing?

2620
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:10,052
Running around in your underpants.

2621
02:05:10,129 --> 02:05:11,427
Man, you look like a crazy person.

2622
02:05:11,498 --> 02:05:13,226
No, I'm onto you.

2623
02:05:13,298 --> 02:05:14,424
I know what's going on here.

2624
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:15,558
Well come on, then.

2625
02:05:15,635 --> 02:05:17,125
I got us a great place to watch from.

2626
02:05:18,504 --> 02:05:19,562
It'll be like
pay-per-view.

2627
02:06:08,524 --> 02:06:09,457
Oh, Christ.

2628
02:06:09,526 --> 02:06:11,426
Now what are you doing?

2629
02:06:11,495 --> 02:06:12,587
I'm stopping this.

2630
02:06:12,663 --> 02:06:15,689
Why? Greatest thing
you've ever done, man.

2631
02:06:15,766 --> 02:06:17,393
No, I can't let this happen.

2632
02:06:17,468 --> 02:06:18,992
You know there are 10 other bombs

2633
02:06:19,069 --> 02:06:20,537
in 10 other buildings.

2634
02:06:20,605 --> 02:06:21,969
God damn it, since
when is Project Mayhem

2635
02:06:22,039 --> 02:06:22,971
about murder?

2636
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:24,337
The buildings are empty.

2637
02:06:24,409 --> 02:06:25,967
Security and maintenance,
all our people.

2638
02:06:26,044 --> 02:06:27,237
We're not killing anyone, man,

2639
02:06:27,311 --> 02:06:28,539
we're setting 'em free.

2640
02:06:28,612 --> 02:06:29,544
Bob is dead.

2641
02:06:29,613 --> 02:06:31,343
They shot him in the head.

2642
02:06:31,416 --> 02:06:32,677
You wanna make an omelet,

2643
02:06:32,750 --> 02:06:34,308
you gotta break some eggs.

2644
02:06:34,384 --> 02:06:35,647
No, I'm not listening to you.

2645
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:36,778
You're not even there.

2646
02:06:44,595 --> 02:06:45,562
Wouldn't do that.

2647
02:06:45,630 --> 02:06:48,394
Not unless I knew which wires were what.

2648
02:06:48,466 --> 02:06:50,126
If you know, then I know.

2649
02:06:55,807 --> 02:06:56,740
Or...

2650
02:06:56,809 --> 02:06:57,741
maybe I knew you'd know,

2651
02:06:57,810 --> 02:06:58,834
so I spent the whole day

2652
02:06:58,911 --> 02:07:00,071
thinking about the wrong ones.

2653
02:07:08,723 --> 02:07:09,712
You think?

2654
02:07:11,762 --> 02:07:13,559
Oh, heavens no, not the green one.

2655
02:07:14,731 --> 02:07:16,062
Pull any one but the green one.

2656
02:07:21,939 --> 02:07:23,805
I asked you not to do that!

2657
02:07:29,414 --> 02:07:30,710
Tyler, get away from the van.

2658
02:07:33,752 --> 02:07:35,185
Tyler, I'm not kidding!

2659
02:07:35,254 --> 02:07:37,153
Get away from the van!

2660
02:07:37,221 --> 02:07:38,483
God damn it!

2661
02:07:39,792 --> 02:07:41,259
Whoa!

2662
02:07:41,327 --> 02:07:42,258
Whoa!

2663
02:07:45,464 --> 02:07:48,261
OK, you are now firing a gun

2664
02:07:48,333 --> 02:07:49,596
at your imaginary friend

2665
02:07:49,668 --> 02:07:52,364
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

2666
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:56,335
Look, Tyler, Tyler!

2667
02:07:59,444 --> 02:08:00,673
Ahh!

2668
02:08:09,822 --> 02:08:11,483
Aw, come on.

2669
02:08:11,557 --> 02:08:12,752
Don't go.

2670
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:52,561
What?!

2671
02:09:38,483 --> 02:09:39,643
3 minutes.

2672
02:09:39,718 --> 02:09:42,016
This is it.

2673
02:09:42,087 --> 02:09:44,146
The beginning.

2674
02:09:44,222 --> 02:09:46,191
Ground zero.

2675
02:09:46,258 --> 02:09:48,225
I think this is about where we came in.

2676
02:09:48,293 --> 02:09:49,260
Would you like to say a few words

2677
02:09:49,327 --> 02:09:51,125
to mark the occasion?

2678
02:09:53,034 --> 02:09:54,227
I'm sorry?

2679
02:09:54,301 --> 02:09:56,930
I still can't think of anything.

2680
02:09:58,606 --> 02:10:00,732
Ah, flashback humor.

2681
02:10:05,946 --> 02:10:07,608
It's getting exciting now.

2682
02:10:09,984 --> 02:10:11,007
2 and 1/2.

2683
02:10:11,084 --> 02:10:12,017
Think of everything

2684
02:10:12,086 --> 02:10:13,611
we've accomplished, man.

2685
02:10:14,990 --> 02:10:16,820
Out these windows, we will view

2686
02:10:16,891 --> 02:10:18,484
the collapse of financial history.

2687
02:10:19,661 --> 02:10:22,027
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

2688
02:10:36,979 --> 02:10:38,344
Why is she here?

2689
02:10:38,413 --> 02:10:40,347
Tying up loose ends.

2690
02:10:40,415 --> 02:10:43,509
Put me down, you bald-headed fucks!

2691
02:10:43,585 --> 02:10:44,814
I'm begging you,

2692
02:10:44,888 --> 02:10:45,819
please don't do this.

2693
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:46,820
I'm not doing this.

2694
02:10:46,889 --> 02:10:48,584
We are doing this.

2695
02:10:48,657 --> 02:10:49,716
This is what we want.

2696
02:10:49,793 --> 02:10:51,851
No, I don't want this.

2697
02:10:51,927 --> 02:10:55,057
Right, except you is meaningless now.

2698
02:10:55,132 --> 02:10:56,792
We have to forget about you.

2699
02:10:56,866 --> 02:10:59,130
Jesus, you're a voice in my head.

2700
02:10:59,202 --> 02:11:00,500
You're a voice in mine.

2701
02:11:00,571 --> 02:11:02,038
You're a fucking hallucination,

2702
02:11:02,106 --> 02:11:03,231
why can't I get rid of you?

2703
02:11:03,306 --> 02:11:04,238
You need me.

2704
02:11:04,307 --> 02:11:06,436
No, I don't, I really don't anymore.

2705
02:11:06,570 --> 02:11:07,594
Hey, you created me.

2706
02:11:07,671 --> 02:11:09,433
I didn't create some loser alter ego

2707
02:11:09,505 --> 02:11:10,973
to make myself feel better.

2708
02:11:11,041 --> 02:11:12,099
Take some responsibility.

2709
02:11:12,175 --> 02:11:13,371
I do.

2710
02:11:13,445 --> 02:11:15,435
I am responsible for all of it,

2711
02:11:15,514 --> 02:11:16,606
and I accept that.

2712
02:11:16,682 --> 02:11:18,946
So please, I'm begging you,

2713
02:11:19,017 --> 02:11:20,677
please call this off.

2714
02:11:23,021 --> 02:11:24,886
Have I ever let us down?

2715
02:11:26,358 --> 02:11:28,656
How far have you come because of me?

2716
02:11:34,601 --> 02:11:36,592
I will bring us through this.

2717
02:11:36,668 --> 02:11:38,603
As always,

2718
02:11:38,671 --> 02:11:40,866
I will carry you, kicking and screaming,

2719
02:11:40,940 --> 02:11:43,067
and in the end, you will thank me.

2720
02:11:43,142 --> 02:11:45,042
Tyler.

2721
02:11:45,111 --> 02:11:47,307
Tyler, I'm grateful to you

2722
02:11:47,381 --> 02:11:48,642
for everything

2723
02:11:48,715 --> 02:11:49,704
that you've done for me.

2724
02:11:49,782 --> 02:11:51,340
But this is too much.

2725
02:11:51,417 --> 02:11:52,942
I don't want this.

2726
02:11:53,020 --> 02:11:53,951
What do you want?!

2727
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:55,282
Want to go back to the shit-job,

2728
02:11:55,355 --> 02:11:57,823
fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

2729
02:11:57,892 --> 02:11:59,859
Fuck you. I won't do it.

2730
02:11:59,926 --> 02:12:02,588
Oh, God, this can't be happening.

2731
02:12:02,662 --> 02:12:05,131
It's already done, so shut up.

2732
02:12:05,199 --> 02:12:06,130
60 seconds.

2733
02:12:06,199 --> 02:12:07,564
Can you see alright?

2734
02:12:10,404 --> 02:12:11,836
I can figure this out.

2735
02:12:11,905 --> 02:12:13,464
I can figure this out,
this isn't even real.

2736
02:12:13,541 --> 02:12:15,533
You're not real, that gun isn't-

2737
02:12:15,610 --> 02:12:17,372
That gun isn't even in your hand.

2738
02:12:18,913 --> 02:12:20,404
The gun's in my hand.

2739
02:12:26,021 --> 02:12:28,420
Hey, good for you.
Doesn't change a thing.

2740
02:12:37,334 --> 02:12:40,029
Why do you want to
put a gun to your head?

2741
02:12:40,102 --> 02:12:42,936
Not my head, Tyler.

2742
02:12:43,006 --> 02:12:44,769
Our head.

2743
02:12:46,510 --> 02:12:47,909
Interesting.

2744
02:12:51,281 --> 02:12:54,046
Where are you going
with this, I KEA boy?

2745
02:13:00,825 --> 02:13:04,283
Hey, it's you and me.

2746
02:13:07,266 --> 02:13:08,198
Friends.

2747
02:13:10,234 --> 02:13:11,166
Tyler...

2748
02:13:14,173 --> 02:13:17,073
I want you to really listen to me.

2749
02:13:17,141 --> 02:13:18,074
OK.

2750
02:13:21,112 --> 02:13:22,774
My eyes are open.

2751
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:42,500
What's that smell?

2752
02:14:02,758 --> 02:14:04,316
Where is everybody?

2753
02:14:04,393 --> 02:14:05,588
I don't know, what's goin' on?

2754
02:14:06,662 --> 02:14:07,924
Mr. Durden!

2755
02:14:08,997 --> 02:14:10,363
Oh, my God.

2756
02:14:10,433 --> 02:14:11,365
Sir?

2757
02:14:15,906 --> 02:14:17,032
Are you, uh...

2758
02:14:17,107 --> 02:14:18,937
Are you alright, sir?

2759
02:14:19,008 --> 02:14:20,236
Oh, yeah, I'm OK.

2760
02:14:20,309 --> 02:14:21,242
You look terrible, sir.

2761
02:14:21,311 --> 02:14:22,972
What happened?

2762
02:14:23,047 --> 02:14:25,241
Oh, nothing. It's no problem.

2763
02:14:25,314 --> 02:14:27,078
Oh, no, no, sir, he's not kidding.

2764
02:14:27,151 --> 02:14:28,311
You look really awful.

2765
02:14:28,385 --> 02:14:29,544
You need medical assistance.

2766
02:14:29,619 --> 02:14:31,086
- I'm fine.
- Ugh.

2767
02:14:31,154 --> 02:14:32,144
Look, I'm fine.

2768
02:14:32,222 --> 02:14:34,712
Everything's fine.

2769
02:14:38,228 --> 02:14:40,253
Let-Let her go.

2770
02:14:40,329 --> 02:14:41,318
Christ almighty!

2771
02:14:41,397 --> 02:14:43,263
You!

2772
02:14:43,333 --> 02:14:45,767
Hi, Marla.

2773
02:14:46,836 --> 02:14:47,804
Leave her with me,

2774
02:14:47,871 --> 02:14:48,803
get your stuff,

2775
02:14:48,872 --> 02:14:49,804
I'll meet you downstairs.

2776
02:14:49,873 --> 02:14:50,805
Are you sure?

2777
02:14:50,874 --> 02:14:52,842
Yes, I'm sure.

2778
02:14:54,012 --> 02:14:55,980
You fucker!

2779
02:14:56,047 --> 02:14:56,979
What kind of sick fucking game

2780
02:14:57,048 --> 02:14:57,980
are you playing now,

2781
02:14:58,049 --> 02:14:58,981
putting me on a fucking bu-

2782
02:14:59,050 --> 02:15:00,950
Oh, my God, your face!

2783
02:15:01,019 --> 02:15:02,452
Yeah, I know.

2784
02:15:07,258 --> 02:15:09,192
What happened?

2785
02:15:09,260 --> 02:15:10,420
Don't ask.

2786
02:15:10,495 --> 02:15:11,427
You're shot.

2787
02:15:11,496 --> 02:15:12,861
Yes, I'm shot.

2788
02:15:12,931 --> 02:15:14,458
Oh, my God.

2789
02:15:14,535 --> 02:15:15,967
I can't believe he's standing.

2790
02:15:16,036 --> 02:15:17,469
One tough motherfucker.

2791
02:15:21,341 --> 02:15:23,206
Who did this?

2792
02:15:23,276 --> 02:15:25,802
I did, actually.

2793
02:15:25,880 --> 02:15:27,278
Find some gauze.

2794
02:15:29,282 --> 02:15:31,342
You shot yourself?

2795
02:15:31,419 --> 02:15:32,476
Yes, but it's OK.

2796
02:15:32,552 --> 02:15:34,111
Marla, look at me.

2797
02:15:34,188 --> 02:15:36,453
I'm really OK.

2798
02:15:36,525 --> 02:15:38,492
Trust me.

2799
02:15:38,559 --> 02:15:40,289
Everything's gonna be fine.

2800
02:15:53,375 --> 02:15:55,171
You met me at a very
strange time in my life.
