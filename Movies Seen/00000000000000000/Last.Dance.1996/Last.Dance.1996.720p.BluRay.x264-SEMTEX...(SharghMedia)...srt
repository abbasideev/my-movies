1
00:01:56,822 --> 00:02:01,535
# With no warmth inside
we surely will shiver

2
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:08,834
# So we sleep
We sleep so satisfied

3
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:15,298
# Lay down, lay down, lay down
Down and feed

4
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:18,927
# Lay down, lay down, lay down
Down and feed

5
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,346
# Lay down, lay down, lay down

6
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:24,349
# And feed the fire

7
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:29,520
# Lay down, lay down, lay down
Down and feed

8
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:35,609
# Think I'm lost
with all your promises

9
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:42,950
# Think I act strange
when you talk to me

10
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:55,003
Oh, that's gonna kill you.

11
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:01,926
...represent concepts.
Now, what you're...

12
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,054
I'm sorry. Could you tell me where
the chief of staff's office is, please?

13
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:07,473
- Sure. Up the stairs and to your left.
- Up the stairs. Thanks.

14
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:10,560
The one nearest the front door
at the crossing represents justice.

15
00:03:14,147 --> 00:03:16,524
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Rick Hayes.

16
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:19,068
- I'm here to see John Hayes.
- Oh, you're John's brother.

17
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,903
Yeah, among other things.

18
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:23,364
- Louise, John's brother is here.
- Okay.

19
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:28,494
- He's right here in the conference room.
- Great.

20
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:32,581
We should take each case
on its merits.

21
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:34,792
Now, we have restricted
out-of-state travel...

22
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,336
and we've delayed the purchase
of new state vehicles.

23
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:40,464
It doesn't sound like enough.
We have to trim ten million...

24
00:03:40,547 --> 00:03:44,217
from department spending over
the next fiscal year. John?

25
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:49,931
I've requested the department trim
five percent across the board,
except for education.

26
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:52,600
Okay. But we're gonna have to
find some additional measures.

27
00:03:52,684 --> 00:03:54,936
Cutbacks? With an election
next year, it might...

28
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,814
You want the tooth fairy to come,
you're gonna have to put some teeth
under the pillow.

29
00:03:57,897 --> 00:04:00,817
Agreed. With what we've done,
we're now in a position to take stock...

30
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,945
make our judgments regarding
the staffing and expenditures...

31
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:06,864
and we will take a long, hard,
critical look at all...

32
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:20,294
I'm just trying to figure out what kind of
idiot shows up his first day of work...

33
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:22,629
late and stinking of wine.

34
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:24,965
I guess now you know.

35
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:27,634
You wanna try to explain
your resume?

36
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:31,054
- What do you mean?
- Well, you went to law school.
Did pretty well.

37
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:35,392
Worked for Hayes Development for
three years. Working for your old man?

38
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,394
- On and off.
- Mmm.

39
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:41,189
And then there's this gaping hole.

40
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:43,233
What have you been doing with
yourself for the last two years?

41
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:47,487
Well, my father passed away. Maybe you
know. I helped settle his affairs.

42
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:51,365
And after that?

43
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:57,038
Um, well, after that I, uh, I did
some travelling and I, I just
tried some different things.

44
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:59,165
Partied for two years.

45
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:01,792
Well, call it what you want.

46
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:05,921
Okay. What do you want to do?

47
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,841
- What do I wanna do?
- Hell, it's your call.

48
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:12,678
Your brother's
the governor's chief of staff.

49
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:15,013
Well, um...

50
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:20,560
Well, while you think about it, I'll get you
a desk and a subscription to Playboy.

51
00:05:20,644 --> 00:05:25,398
Of course, if you're interested in actually
working, I'm up to my butt here.

52
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:27,358
Yeah, I'd like to give it a try.

53
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:33,865
You know anything about this office?
You know what clemency is?

54
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:36,284
Yeah, it's the power to pardon
people, commute sentences.

55
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:38,953
- Whose power?
- I believe, the governor's.

56
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:42,873
In this state, his sole power.
He makes the final decision.

57
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:47,670
The Clemency Office makes
recommendations, but we're not here
to retry the case.

58
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:51,548
This is about mercy.
Has the prisoner rehabilitated himself?

59
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:54,343
Will solid citizens
speak out on his behalf?

60
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:56,845
Does his own mother
have anything good to say?

61
00:05:56,929 --> 00:06:01,475
- Will I get some kind of training for this?
- Yeah, by doing it.

62
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:05,312
Well, this is it...
124 pending cases.

63
00:06:05,395 --> 00:06:07,898
Everything from tax fraud
to murder.

64
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:09,941
Wow. How do you keep on top
of all of it?

65
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:12,610
You don't. You prioritize.

66
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:15,363
I've got death warrants
coming down any day.

67
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:17,907
Obviously they come first.

68
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:21,869
Every time a death warrant is issued or
reissued, we have to make a new report.

69
00:06:21,953 --> 00:06:25,790
- You know anything about John Reese?
- Uh, yeah, John Reese.

70
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:29,627
That's the cop killer who pleaded
self-defence, right? I saw him
on 60 Minutes

71
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,671
Right. Yeah. Big celebrity.
Even wrote a book.

72
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:36,175
Every time I see him, he gives me one.
Couldn't get through the damn thing.

73
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:40,346
- Well, great. I'll take Reese.
- No, I've already got that one started.

74
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:44,475
Take Cindy Liggett.
Look through her file.

75
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:51,440
- It's a death penalty case?
- Yep.

76
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:54,192
- Get your dick wet with Liggett.
- Okay.

77
00:06:54,276 --> 00:06:58,196
Helen'll get you a desk and a Playboy
if you change your mind.

78
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:07,872
- Slow down, slow down.
- All right.

79
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:10,041
Are we there?

80
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:12,543
All right. Okay.

81
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:16,172
Well, what do you think?
It's not bad, huh?

82
00:07:16,255 --> 00:07:18,632
Bedroom, bathroom,
office area up there...

83
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:21,719
and gourmet kitchen
and swimming pool.

84
00:07:23,262 --> 00:07:25,973
Never know who you'll meet
down there.

85
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:29,268
- And I got you into the tennis club.
- What's this?

86
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:32,229
- Oh, you'll be needing that.
- I got a tux.

87
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:34,606
It's an Armani.

88
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,734
I thought the days of profligate
spending were over, John.

89
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:40,237
Oh, don't worry about it. You're in the
majors now, you gotta look the part.

90
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,073
Okay. Thanks.

91
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:45,325
Ah, don't look like somebody
slammed your nuts in the door.

92
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:47,327
- It's... It's gonna be good.
- I know.

93
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,995
- Wait and see.
- I know.

94
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,623
Listen, it doesn't mean
the party's over.

95
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:53,625
It's just a better class of guests.

96
00:08:53,974 --> 00:08:58,312
Well, you know, her crimes, you don't
think of a woman committing
a crime like that.

97
00:08:58,395 --> 00:09:00,481
I mean, I don't, anyway.
That... That brutal.

98
00:09:00,564 --> 00:09:03,567
Most of the time a woman kills,
it's a crime of passion.

99
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,612
Usually her husband
or her boyfriend.

100
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:10,240
And last time she got a stay of execution
with about four days left.

101
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:13,577
- Well, when was that?
- About 18 months ago.

102
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,745
It's all a delaying game, really.

103
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:18,123
They come up with some new
constitutional theory...

104
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:22,919
and find a sympathetic judge to grant
a stay, then they start appealing
all over again.

105
00:09:23,002 --> 00:09:25,380
Right, and they just
stretch it out indefinitely.

106
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:29,926
Well, no, not this time.
It looks like she's run out of arguments.

107
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:33,304
- And a lot more women
are gonna be executed now.
- Why's that?

108
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:38,309
Women's lobby. They all want equal
treatment in the eyes of the law.

109
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:14,469
- Hey, Frances, what's up?
- Where you goin', girl?

110
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:17,013
What's goin' on?

111
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:20,433
- Hey, Frances!
- I'll tell you something now.
Don't be like that, Frances.

112
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:24,312
- Frances!
- Hey, Cindy, you checkin' out
of death row?

113
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:28,149
- You don't like it here?
- Hey. Hey!

114
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:30,985
...somebody. He don't need
to know my personal life.

115
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:34,655
I have my own life, and just because I have
a kid don't mean my life needs to stop...

116
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:36,657
and I need to stop
what I need to do.

117
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,700
She ain't the only one raising him.
The father raises him too.

118
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:40,452
Oh, yeah. On the weekends he...

119
00:10:42,246 --> 00:10:45,499
And that's my business.
That's my time now.

120
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:47,918
How 'bout self-respect?

121
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:53,840
Every dollar you have, these sweet
and innocent-looking girls...

122
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:58,261
shamelessly tell us
they are money hungry and...

123
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:02,098
I'm Rick Hayes. I'm with the Clemency
Board. Would you like to have a seat?

124
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:08,229
I'm gonna be working on your report,
the update, so we need to...

125
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:10,606
- No.
- No?

126
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,693
No, we don't need
to do anything.

127
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:16,987
- Well, what do you mean?
- I'm not playin' your game.

128
00:11:19,657 --> 00:11:22,034
Um, l...
Well, I don't understand.

129
00:11:22,117 --> 00:11:25,621
It's one big, sick fuckin' joke.

130
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:29,041
- How's that?
- This governor doesn't give clemency.

131
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:34,379
Well, uh... What is it
that you're saying here?

132
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:37,132
I'm saying you go ahead
and you make your damn report...

133
00:11:37,215 --> 00:11:40,302
then you give it to the governor and you
let him give it serious consideration...

134
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:43,138
then you can all go ahead and
kill me with a clear conscience.

135
00:11:45,432 --> 00:11:48,351
Miss Liggett, maybe you can explain
to me... what is it that you have to lose?

136
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:51,646
I mean, there is really no good
reason for you not to cooperate.

137
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:54,148
Just give us something we can work with
here. There's gotta be a...

138
00:11:54,232 --> 00:11:57,568
I'm very, very proud of my 17-year-old
'cause she works and goes to school...

139
00:11:57,652 --> 00:12:00,946
What'd you say your name was?
Rick?

140
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,449
- Right.
- What's that short for?

141
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:05,784
- Eric? Richard?
- Richard, yeah.

142
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:10,164
- Mm-hmm. So, what's wrong
with Richard?
- What's wrong with Rick?

143
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:14,668
Every Rick I ever knew was a slick,
two-faced motherfucker.

144
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:18,213
- I know quite a few.
- Well, you just met one who isn't.

145
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:23,093
That's the first thing every slick,
two-faced motherfucker tells you.

146
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,136
All right, Miss Liggett.

147
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,098
Frances.

148
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,226
Wanna know what the second
thing they say is?

149
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:33,520
What do you got to lose?

150
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,275
- You should really think about this.
- I have.

151
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,277
For about 12 years.

152
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:48,200
You take care of yourself, Rick.

153
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:51,620
Gotta bust out some cash, anything.
I don't care what it is.

154
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,456
- What kind of presents do you get?
- Gold.

155
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,458
I got a bedroom set,
a TV, stereo...

156
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,210
- You got a bedroom set?
- Mm-hmm.

157
00:12:58,293 --> 00:13:00,629
- Did your mom ask you where
it came from?
- No.

158
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:03,924
Well, we don't need
her cooperation anyway.

159
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:08,470
- What do you mean?
- The report's required, with or without it.

160
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,682
Oh, man, she is a pisser.

161
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:18,104
- Sounds like she sure as hell
had your number.
- Yeah.

162
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:42,211
- Rick, come on.
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Emerson. How are you?

163
00:13:42,294 --> 00:13:44,546
- Hi.
- Lobbyist.

164
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,548
- For what?
- Oil companies.

165
00:13:46,632 --> 00:13:48,258
Oh.

166
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:50,886
- The Brothers Hayes.
- Governor.

167
00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:53,013
- John.
- My brother Rick.
- How are you, sir?

168
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:55,015
- Rick. Of course.
- Yes.

169
00:13:55,098 --> 00:13:57,017
- Mrs Governor.
- Tom.
- Nice to meet you.

170
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,019
In the governor's business
we call this a "meet and greet."

171
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:01,271
Well, it wouldn't be hard
to get used to.

172
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:04,691
Bart, stay right where you are.
Don't have too much fun now, fellas.

173
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:07,610
The guy's in perpetual motion.
He's incredible.

174
00:14:07,694 --> 00:14:12,031
Hey, you know, I've been glancing at the
files. He's never granted clemency, huh?

175
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:15,368
- No, not true. No. We've granted
15 pardons since I've been here...
- Yeah?

176
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:17,370
- And scores of sentence reductions.
- Never in a capital case.

177
00:14:17,453 --> 00:14:20,706
No, not in a state where 76 percent of
the voters favour the death penalty.

178
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,084
Well, then why the hell did you
put me in a goddam useless job?

179
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:25,711
Oh, I figured if you messed up,
you couldn't do much damage.

180
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:28,214
Well, you're just a condescending
son of a bitch. Why is that?

181
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:30,758
- Oh, relax. Listen.
- No, no, I'm...
- If things work out...

182
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:32,468
- Hi there, you guys.
- There's an opening in the press office,
the first of the year.

183
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:36,263
- Ladies, ladies!
- Rick, this is my friend Jill Venable.

184
00:14:36,346 --> 00:14:38,891
- And Jill, you know John, of course.
- Everyone knows John, of course.

185
00:14:38,974 --> 00:14:41,226
- Hi, Jill.
- Hey, yeah, I know you.

186
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,229
- You used to live down the street from us
on Oakmont, right?
- That's right.

187
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:48,066
- She's almost the girl next door.
- That's sounds terrible.

188
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:51,361
- I don't remember you being so cute.
- Oh, well, thanks.

189
00:14:51,444 --> 00:14:54,739
- I've been working on it.
- Well, it sure makes my job a lot easier.

190
00:14:54,823 --> 00:14:57,158
- Your job, huh?
- Yeah, I'm supposed to take you around...

191
00:14:57,242 --> 00:15:00,078
and introduce you to people
of power and influence.

192
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:03,539
Oh, I see. Big brother's
looking out for me again?

193
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:06,542
Oh, we can start with a few corrupt
committee chairmen,
work our way down.

194
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:09,170
Ah, none of that. Let's get a couple
of drinks and have a chat.

195
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:17,595
- Do you think your parking space
could've been further away?
- That's what I said. The...

196
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:20,014
- Is this it?
- Yeah, it's right here.

197
00:15:26,603 --> 00:15:32,150
- Ohh. John must have found
this place for you.
- How could you possibly guess?

198
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:35,779
'Cause he's been here seven years
and still rents his furniture.

199
00:15:35,862 --> 00:15:38,073
- We used to go out.
- Oh?

200
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:41,326
We're just friends now.
My decision.

201
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,621
I haven't had a chance to stock the bar
or unpack glasses, but I got some beer.

202
00:15:44,704 --> 00:15:47,790
Great.

203
00:15:47,874 --> 00:15:50,877
Haven't even had a chance to unpack
the stereo, unfortunately.

204
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,588
No drinks, no music.

205
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:55,798
How do you expect to make
any progress?

206
00:15:55,881 --> 00:16:01,512
Well, l-I don't know. I guess I'll, uh, just
have to rely on some personal charm.

207
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:03,556
You might be in trouble.

208
00:16:05,057 --> 00:16:08,060
Well, I could hum something.

209
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:10,145
What would you like to hear?

210
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:13,232
How about Beethoven's Ninth?

211
00:16:13,315 --> 00:16:16,777
- That's a lot to ask on a first date.
- Well, I expect a lot.

212
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,705
Sorry.

213
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,707
My God, what is that?

214
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,251
I'm sorry. This is a case
I'm working on.

215
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,172
What's the matter, you don't come across
stuff like that in Consumer Affairs?

216
00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:40,174
Uh, no.

217
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:47,431
- You got that?
- Okay, go on.

218
00:16:47,515 --> 00:16:50,351
Write him I'm looking forward to when
he's on leave from the Marines...

219
00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:53,437
so he can take me to that club
he wrote me about...

220
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,939
that Waikiki bar
in Honolulu, Hawaii.

221
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:58,692
- Hey, slow down.
- Honolulu?

222
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:02,904
- Child, what you talkin' about?
- Your pen pal said he's gonna
take you to Hawaii?

223
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,532
He's stationed in Korea, girl.
It ain't that far to go.

224
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:09,411
He said he gonna marry me
and have a big party there,
cause he know the owner.

225
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:12,205
Oh, yeah?
You're so full of shit.

226
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:14,958
- Did you tell him about
your other husband?
- Bitch, shut up.

227
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:20,630
Meet... you... in...
Honolu...

228
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:25,718
Is that two O's and two U's?

229
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:49,157
- I'm right here for you, girl.
- Let's just finish the letter.

230
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:52,994
Go on!

231
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,750
- Sam, good morning.
- Good morning.

232
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,419
Um, look, l-I've been
looking at this Liggett file.

233
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:03,963
L-I'd like to go back and see if
I can get her to work with us.

234
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:06,758
Oh. So now it's
a matter of pride, huh?

235
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:10,303
No, no, no, I just... I think it's the only way
we're gonna get anything new.

236
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:15,183
You're wasting your time, Rick.
You've got two dozen people
to reinterview for the update.

237
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:17,184
But they're all gonna say
the same thing, no?

238
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:19,478
You're not gonna get anything
out of Liggett.

239
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:22,440
She's making her stand.
I've been through this before.

240
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:24,275
Well, Sam, I'd at least
like to try.

241
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:27,236
Of course you would.
Everyone does the first time.

242
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,238
It's called
the rescuer syndrome.

243
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,990
That's great. I'm on the job three days,
I got a syndrome.

244
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:35,953
She won't deal with you. They served
her death warrant last night.

245
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:38,163
Execution's in 30 days.

246
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:53,970
- I got five more minutes.
- Visitor.

247
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:57,307
- Today?
- Someone from Clemency.

248
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,644
- Tell him I don't wanna see him.
- Hey, I'm not your social secretary.
Come on.

249
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:08,984
You know you are.

250
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:18,077
This is your last clemency report.
Open it up, take a look.

251
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:22,497
No, huh? I'll do it for you.

252
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:25,751
You just look at the cover page, okay?
That's all. Just the cover page.

253
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:34,759
You see what it says under
"recommendation"? "Deny clemency."

254
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:36,845
- I can read.
- Yeah? Well, that might as
well read "Let's kill her."

255
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:40,181
Now, you know why it says that?
Because you ain't give 'em anything.

256
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:44,519
- They had nothing to work with.
- How long you had this job?

257
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:46,396
Four days.

258
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:48,773
So basically,
you don't know jack shit.

259
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:51,525
That's right. I don't know why you're not
a good candidate for clemency.

260
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:54,528
Now, maybe if I had more experience
I'd just give up and write you off as well.

261
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:57,448
You probably think you know
everything about me.

262
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,867
I know what's in that file.

263
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,119
Look, even if I get clemency...

264
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:06,165
it means life in here with no parole,
and that's no life.

265
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:09,042
I'm not beggin' for mercy
I'm not gonna get.

266
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,753
You think I wanna die?
I do not wanna die. Okay?

267
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:15,215
- Well...
- But if I do, it's gonna be on my terms.

268
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:19,803
You got that? My terms.
That's all I got.

269
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,640
Frances!

270
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:09,809
They know how to harness Negroes
down south too, I hear.

271
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:13,354
With a strap across their back.
Come on.

272
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:36,085
Mmm. Hmm.

273
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:54,102
Get out of my house. Get out
of here, you thievin' whore!

274
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:56,604
Get out of my house, damn you!

275
00:21:56,688 --> 00:21:58,732
Hey! What the fu...

276
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:14,330
Cindy!

277
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:26,258
Reg? Reggie?

278
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,096
Reg, you awake?

279
00:22:37,018 --> 00:22:40,772
Reg? Reg?

280
00:23:36,326 --> 00:23:40,830
Untamed youth with one thing on
their minds... Barq's Root Beer.

281
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:42,915
I know that you were
involved in her appeals.

282
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:45,084
That's right, and I assisted
Ed Duffy at the trial.

283
00:23:45,168 --> 00:23:47,169
Listen, maybe we should
talk later. I got a hearing.

284
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:49,922
Just a minute. Is there anybody
else I should be talking to?

285
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:53,801
Her only family's a kid brother. It's been
a defence nightmare from day one.

286
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:57,096
- That's because of the brutality
of the crime.
- That, yeah.

287
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,765
And we only had nine days
to prepare for trial.

288
00:23:59,848 --> 00:24:03,143
Well, now, the girl... she, in
fact, knew her in school, yes?

289
00:24:03,227 --> 00:24:07,230
Yeah. And the boy was the son of none
other than of William J. McGuire.

290
00:24:07,314 --> 00:24:09,274
McGuire? What, construction?

291
00:24:09,358 --> 00:24:12,068
- Yeah. Hey.
- Hi, Linda.
- Listen.

292
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:15,739
McGuire wanted her to get the death
penalty, and he lobbied like hell for it.

293
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:17,782
- Huh.
- Listen, she got a tough break.
- Is there...

294
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:19,701
But it wasn't like she would've
ever gotten the sympathy vote.

295
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:22,704
Is there anybody out there with
anything good to say about her?

296
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,708
Nobody I'd let
baby-sit my child.

297
00:24:28,876 --> 00:24:32,088
- You again.
- Me again.

298
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:36,133
- Well, it gets me away from the TVs.
- TVs?

299
00:24:36,217 --> 00:24:38,177
Well, they got those TVs
down in the pod...

300
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,680
blastin' game shows
and soap operas all day long.

301
00:24:41,764 --> 00:24:45,184
That's what I'd call cruel
and unusual punishment.

302
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:47,353
Yeah. No question.

303
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:51,482
Guess they figure by the time they get
around to killin' you, you'll be grateful.

304
00:24:51,565 --> 00:24:55,360
Well, I'm just glad you consider me
a notch up from that kind of torture.

305
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:57,404
Just a notch.

306
00:24:59,448 --> 00:25:02,242
What do you want?

307
00:25:02,325 --> 00:25:04,661
Well, let's start with
some names, okay?

308
00:25:04,744 --> 00:25:08,790
Anybody out there with anything
good to say about you?

309
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:11,918
When I was out in the free world,
there wasn't anything good about me.

310
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:17,215
- You could talk to Reggie.
- Oh? Who's Reggie?

311
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:21,344
She's my cell neighbour.
She killed both her husbands.

312
00:25:21,427 --> 00:25:26,348
By the time they were about to arrest her,
she was just about to marry
number three.

313
00:25:26,432 --> 00:25:30,019
Well, she... she might not make
the best character witness, uh...

314
00:25:34,106 --> 00:25:36,525
- What about your brother?
- Billy?

315
00:25:36,608 --> 00:25:39,695
I know he thinks I hate him,
but I don't.

316
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:43,699
I just wasn't a very good sister.
I was runnin' wild.

317
00:25:43,782 --> 00:25:47,619
- Is he still in St. Charles?
- Last I heard.

318
00:25:47,702 --> 00:25:50,288
He's almost 22.

319
00:25:50,372 --> 00:25:52,749
His birthday's in April.

320
00:25:52,832 --> 00:25:55,627
Were you close?

321
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,254
Well, we had different fathers.

322
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:01,215
Neither one of us knew 'em.

323
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:03,968
After my mama died,
it was just us.

324
00:26:04,052 --> 00:26:06,804
Yeah, you were, uh, what, 16?

325
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:11,642
Yeah. She died two days
after my 16th birthday.

326
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:15,729
What was she like?

327
00:26:17,815 --> 00:26:20,192
Pretty. Wild.

328
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,781
When she was feelin' good,
she could be a lot of fun.

329
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:28,200
She wasn't like
anybody's mama I knew.

330
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:31,787
We were more like sisters,
I guess.

331
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:36,750
She just couldn't stay clean. I guess
she passed that on to me.

332
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,336
Now, what is it
you're drawing there?

333
00:26:44,883 --> 00:26:48,052
Oh. Well, sorry I asked.

334
00:26:48,136 --> 00:26:50,972
It say in my file
I take drawing lessons?

335
00:26:51,055 --> 00:26:53,599
- No, I don't think so.
- I do.

336
00:26:53,683 --> 00:26:58,020
Through the mail.
Helps me pass the time.

337
00:26:58,104 --> 00:27:00,815
You know, and every week they
give you something new to draw.

338
00:27:00,898 --> 00:27:02,858
This week it's castles.

339
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,278
Takes me away.

340
00:27:12,242 --> 00:27:15,204
Do you think you could get me
a picture of the Taj Mahal?

341
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:20,709
- Yeah. Why?
- I wanna draw it.

342
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:25,005
Taj Mahal? I expect that's
not too easy to draw.

343
00:27:25,088 --> 00:27:28,091
Well, I got 23 and a half hours
a day to get it right.

344
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:39,018
No. No, hold our table.

345
00:27:39,102 --> 00:27:41,103
We are on our way.

346
00:27:41,187 --> 00:27:43,648
- Order a good bottle of red.
We'll be there in ten.
- No, Johnny, l...

347
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:47,943
- The ladies are not happy.
- You gotta apologize for me, cause I gotta work tonight.
- Aw, come on.

348
00:27:48,027 --> 00:27:51,322
No, no, no, I been going through
the transcripts from the Liggett trial,
and listen to this...

349
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:54,241
- Sam gave you Liggett?
- Yeah. He's got that guy Henry Reese.

350
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:56,952
Well, Liggett shouldn't keep you that
busy. It's a pretty open-and-shut case.

351
00:27:57,036 --> 00:28:00,497
- No, no, not necessarily.
- Huh? Well, it always
seemed that way to me.

352
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:02,165
- Yeah, but...
- And I'm familiar with the case.

353
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:03,959
No. L-I found this
police report, right?

354
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:06,837
Her brother said that she and her
codefendant had been up for two days...

355
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,505
smoking crack
and robbing houses.

356
00:28:08,588 --> 00:28:11,258
At the sentencing hearing, her lawyer
doesn't say word one about drugs...

357
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:13,843
or intoxication or even a possible
lack of premeditation.

358
00:28:13,927 --> 00:28:15,845
Well, that's a judgement call.

359
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:18,681
Yeah, but when juries vote to execute,
the key issue is intent.

360
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:22,602
I mean, was this murder intentional?
Was there a reasonable expectation
that death would result?

361
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:24,687
I was a prosecutor.
I know the law.

362
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:27,523
Well, then why didn't the lawyer use it?
'Cause this girl was blasted
out of her mind.

363
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:29,525
It would've at least raised
a doubt with the jury.

364
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:31,527
- Does it make it a clemency issue?
- No, not technically.

365
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:34,113
Then stay within the guidelines
of your office and wrap this one up.

366
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:36,824
Hold on. Does she have to die because
she had a lousy defence lawyer...

367
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:38,826
and the father of one of her victims
is a buddy of the governor?

368
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:41,829
No. She has to die because
she committed a double murder.

369
00:28:41,912 --> 00:28:44,123
Well, I'm not saying that she doesn't
deserve to be behind bars.

370
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:48,252
I'm saying I don't think this woman
deserves to be put to death.

371
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,339
Let's go. Come on.

372
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:55,050
- Whoa.
- I want things to work out for you here.

373
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,219
- What does that mean?
- It means be sensible.

374
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,387
- Don't patronize me.
- Oh, not intended.

375
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:02,557
- Oh, I see. I'm just supposed
to shut up and be grateful...
- No, not grateful. Successful.

376
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,227
- And you're dead set on preventing it.
- Oh, boy, John, I really
appreciate your confidence.

377
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:10,982
- I want you to have a chance.
- Oh, by putting me in a job
where no one expects anything.

378
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:13,484
What have you done
to deserve anything more?

379
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:18,823
I think I've lost my appetite.

380
00:29:35,714 --> 00:29:38,258
- Can you tell me where Morris lives?
- Next one.

381
00:29:51,104 --> 00:29:53,773
Hi.

382
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:55,775
- Who are you?
- Uh, Miss Morris, well, I'm Rick Hayes.

383
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:57,777
I'm with the State Clemency Board.

384
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,988
- What's it about?
- Well, it's about your niece,
Cindy Liggett.

385
00:30:01,072 --> 00:30:03,449
- No.
- No, she's not your niece?

386
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:05,451
- No. Not any more.
- Well, she did live here, yes?

387
00:30:05,535 --> 00:30:07,620
- Mm-mmm. No. No.
- Well, uh, can I just ask you...

388
00:30:07,703 --> 00:30:09,663
- There seems to be a...
- No.

389
00:30:16,587 --> 00:30:18,672
Ooh, baby, you drive me

390
00:30:18,756 --> 00:30:22,634
So don't send me home

391
00:30:22,718 --> 00:30:27,222
I dressed up my windows
and I shined up my chrome

392
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,810
You're blowin'my gaskets

393
00:30:31,893 --> 00:30:35,438
Lay down a five and I'll
show you my kitty cat.

394
00:30:35,522 --> 00:30:39,067
Come here. I'd like to talk to you about
a girl named Cindy Liggett.

395
00:30:41,194 --> 00:30:45,907
Don't turn up my heater
Don't shut off my light

396
00:30:47,617 --> 00:30:50,495
How she got into it?

397
00:30:50,578 --> 00:30:52,496
How far back you want me to go?

398
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,000
I mean, her mama's boyfriend
got her high on smack when she
was 14, and then he fucked her.

399
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:59,670
- So...
- Cindy got into fuckin' and shootin' up
because that's what her mama was into.

400
00:30:59,753 --> 00:31:01,922
Tell me about
the girl she killed.

401
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:04,174
- Debbie Hunt.
- Yeah. What, you knew her?

402
00:31:04,258 --> 00:31:08,011
Everybody knew Debbie.
Her daddy was foreman at McGuire.

403
00:31:08,095 --> 00:31:11,265
You... Cindy's mom, she worked at
McGuire Lumber as well, yeah?

404
00:31:11,348 --> 00:31:14,685
Hunt's bookkeeper. Hell, she couldn't
add water to orange juice.

405
00:31:14,768 --> 00:31:17,020
What, like personal favours?

406
00:31:17,104 --> 00:31:19,689
On-the-job services.

407
00:31:19,773 --> 00:31:22,233
Sweet deal for old Hunt
till rumours started flyin'.

408
00:31:22,317 --> 00:31:25,070
Then she spread it around she stole
from petty cash and fired her.

409
00:31:25,153 --> 00:31:29,115
I'm sorry. You're saying that she knew this
when she went in that house that night.

410
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:32,118
It's like she was trying to
get even for her mom.

411
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:35,079
She was too screwed up
to know what she was doin'.

412
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:38,040
- I loved her and all, but...
- Did you see her that night?

413
00:31:38,124 --> 00:31:40,543
You know if she
was on any drugs?

414
00:31:41,794 --> 00:31:44,213
Look, I'm on next.

415
00:32:26,671 --> 00:32:31,425
Doug? Hi. I'm, I'm Rick Hayes.
I'm with the Clemency Board.

416
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:35,596
The reason I'm here is, uh, it looks like
Cindy could be executed in three weeks.

417
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,766
- Uh-huh.
- Well, l-I'm just...

418
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:41,351
l-I'm wondering, uh,
now that it's ancient history...

419
00:32:41,435 --> 00:32:44,730
if there was anything you might
like to add before it's too late.

420
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:48,066
- Like what?
- Well...

421
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:51,361
Well, l-I know you plea-bargained
down to second-degree murder...

422
00:32:51,445 --> 00:32:54,447
- in exchange for testifying
against her at the trial...
- Yeah.

423
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:57,450
And at the trial you said
the whole thing was her idea.

424
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:03,498
- Actually, that's kind of unusual, isn't it?
- Why?

425
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,668
I don't know. I mean,
17-year-old guys...

426
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:10,171
don't usually let girls lead 'em
around, now, do they?

427
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,509
Maybe she was the one
that was unusual.

428
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:18,387
Th-The two of you had pulled off
quite a few burglaries that summer.

429
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:22,850
- So she masterminded all of'em.
- I was 17 fuckin' years old, boy.

430
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:26,562
Oh, uh, I see what you mean. She was...
She was older. She was, what, 19?

431
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:29,231
Yeah, 19, goin' on about 30.

432
00:33:29,314 --> 00:33:31,483
And drugs. What kind of drugs
were you on?

433
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:35,153
Some weed, some beer.

434
00:33:35,237 --> 00:33:37,698
- That's all?
- Yeah.

435
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:39,783
What about crack?

436
00:33:39,866 --> 00:33:43,662
- Nah, no crack.
- You sure? Because the,
the police report...

437
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:45,830
- Am I sure?
- Yeah.

438
00:33:45,914 --> 00:33:47,832
You think I'm ever gonna
forget that night?

439
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:51,419
Well, you would if it would save you from
being executed, now, wouldn't you?

440
00:33:54,589 --> 00:33:57,759
- You're fuckin' with me.
- No, you help me, and maybe
I can help you.

441
00:33:57,842 --> 00:34:01,012
- Did she send you?
- No.

442
00:34:01,095 --> 00:34:04,307
She suckin' your cock?

443
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,059
Oh, shit, she can get a guy
to do anything she wants.

444
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:08,936
She's a cocksuckin' witch!

445
00:34:12,273 --> 00:34:14,775
I'll kick your ass!

446
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:21,114
Fuckers!

447
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:52,144
Have you got mental problems?
Is that why they stuck you down here?

448
00:34:52,228 --> 00:34:54,146
- Hey...
- 'Cause that's gotta be it.
- It got out of hand.

449
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:57,399
Listen to me. I don't care what your
name is. Your brother can fire my ass.

450
00:34:57,483 --> 00:35:00,027
- Look...
- You're not here to retry this case or duke
it out with the prosecution's witness.

451
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,696
Sam, when I came here you asked me
if I wanted to work. That's all I'm
trying to do.

452
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,491
I thought you'd be a lazy bastard. I didn't
know you'd go into business for yourself.

453
00:35:05,574 --> 00:35:07,492
Well, maybe the woman
doesn't deserve to die.

454
00:35:07,576 --> 00:35:09,494
- That's not your decision, Rick.
- Okay.

455
00:35:09,578 --> 00:35:11,621
- You understand? Huh?
- Yeah.

456
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:16,626
Good. Now, I'm reassigning you. Do some
fact checking on the John Reese report.

457
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,587
- What about all the interviews
I'm supposed to do?
- No, no, no, no. John Reese.

458
00:35:19,671 --> 00:35:22,590
Or you're out of here.

459
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:31,682
Who do you think you are, man?
Get your butt over here.

460
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:34,101
Attention on the yard.
Attention on the yard.

461
00:35:34,185 --> 00:35:38,522
The following inmate, Labarber, Michelle,
report to the visiting room.

462
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:51,034
Well, I'll be damned.

463
00:35:51,118 --> 00:35:53,829
- Hey, Reg?
- What?

464
00:35:53,912 --> 00:35:57,332
Reg, come here.
I wanna show you something.

465
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,418
- You remember that guy?
- What guy?

466
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:02,337
- That guy from Clemency.
- Yeah. What?

467
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,965
- He sent me a picture of the Taj Mahal.
- The what?

468
00:36:05,048 --> 00:36:08,885
The, the, the, the Taj Mahal.
It's this place in India.

469
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:11,221
This king built it
for his queen.

470
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:13,139
Oh, yeah, that's nice.
I like that.

471
00:36:13,223 --> 00:36:15,892
Here, come on.
Hey, hey, let me see.

472
00:36:15,975 --> 00:36:19,145
Cindy. Cindy,
turn it down this way.

473
00:36:19,228 --> 00:36:21,856
- Got that?
- Oh, that's nice. Nice!

474
00:36:21,939 --> 00:36:25,151
- That looks real good.
- Yeah, I've seen that one before.

475
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:29,029
- Oh, yeah. I bet you been
there a hundred times too.
- Well, I think it's pretty.

476
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:31,031
What's it say?

477
00:36:31,115 --> 00:36:35,995
It says, "I wish you were there.
Sincerely, Slick Rick."

478
00:36:36,078 --> 00:36:40,165
- What the hell's that mean?
- Oh, nothin'. Just a kind of a joke.

479
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:55,930
Good luck with your appeal,
Mr Reese. Goodbye.

480
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:02,270
Mr Reese, how are you? Hi.

481
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,192
- Where's Sam?
- Well, he had to work
on another case today.

482
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:11,028
- Who are you?
- I'm Rick Hayes.

483
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:13,614
- I'm gonna be working on your report.
- I can't believe Sam didn't come.

484
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,534
Well, uh, I'd just like to verify a few things,
if that's okay.

485
00:37:16,617 --> 00:37:18,536
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

486
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:24,541
- Tell me, have you read the report?
- Of course I read it.

487
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,461
- There's another letter comin'
you have to put in.
- Oh? From whom?

488
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:30,839
Dr Arnold Marks.

489
00:37:30,923 --> 00:37:34,718
- What's the nature of the letter?
- You don't know who he is?

490
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:38,221
- No.
- He's the top cardiovascular
surgeon in New York City.

491
00:37:38,305 --> 00:37:40,265
- Oh.
- And a personal friend.

492
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:43,268
He did my bypass.

493
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:48,398
Man read my book, came down here,
did my bypass, no charge.

494
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:52,568
Well, you have a lot of
impressive friends, Mr Reese.

495
00:37:52,652 --> 00:37:56,239
Yeah, and right now I'm gonna need
every one of'em. You read my book?

496
00:37:56,322 --> 00:37:59,784
- Yeah, I started it.
- Finish it.

497
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:04,622
- I plan to.
- You see the letter from the
dean of the Yale law school?

498
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:07,958
- Yeah.
- I've been corresponding with him.

499
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:10,711
I've strategized all my appeals,
you know. I taught myself.

500
00:38:10,794 --> 00:38:14,673
I've taken control
of the killing machine.

501
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:25,851
Look at me.

502
00:38:27,936 --> 00:38:30,105
Is he working
for the white girl now?

503
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:32,482
- What?
- Cindy Liggett.

504
00:38:32,565 --> 00:38:35,485
Is she the one getting clemency?
Is that... That's why Sam's not here?

505
00:38:35,568 --> 00:38:38,613
Mr Reese, the governor
determines who gets clemency.

506
00:38:38,696 --> 00:38:41,616
Yeah, but what is
the smart money saying, huh?

507
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:45,995
I mean, who's gonna live, me or
the white girl? Who's he gonna forgive?

508
00:38:46,078 --> 00:38:50,499
A man of colour
who earned a law degree...

509
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:54,837
who wrote a best-seller and won the
admiration of some of our best people...

510
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,800
or a white trash girl who
bludgeoned two people to pulp...

511
00:38:59,883 --> 00:39:01,844
without blinking an eye?

512
00:39:03,345 --> 00:39:05,639
They will be diminished...

513
00:39:05,722 --> 00:39:07,808
by my death...

514
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:12,479
'cause I represent everything
they love and admire.

515
00:39:12,562 --> 00:39:15,357
How they gonna go
and kill a man...

516
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,652
who has been on The New York
Times best-seller list?

517
00:39:25,408 --> 00:39:27,368
- Hey there.
- Hey.

518
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,999
So, what's all that stuff?
Homework?

519
00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:37,211
No, these are your trial transcripts. Um,
look, I'm not supposed to be here, okay?

520
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:39,338
- They took me off the case.
- How come?

521
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:43,425
Mmm, doesn't matter.
But there's stuff in here,
especially in your sentencing hearing.

522
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:45,344
- Forget it.
- Grounds for appeal that
haven't been raised. No...

523
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:47,679
- Just leave it alone.
- Think your lawyer really blew it.

524
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:50,015
- You might not have gotten
the death penalty.
- Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?

525
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,851
Yeah, it does to me.
What do I have to say to you?

526
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:56,438
Look, if you wanna be my buddy,
just come see me on Saturday, okay?
I got two left.

527
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:59,649
What... You tell me what it is I have to say
to you to get you to want to save your
own life.

528
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:04,362
- What is this with you, some
kind of ego thing or what?
- What?

529
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:07,157
You don't like to lose.
Is that it?

530
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,701
What are you
tryin' to prove here?

531
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:12,120
I'm just trying to do my job.

532
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:17,125
I mean, I guess this is
the first real job I've had.

533
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,378
I knew you was a rich boy.

534
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:23,130
Huh. Yeah? It shows, does it?

535
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:30,554
See, growing up I thought everyone lived
like me. I had a good time.

536
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:33,849
I mean, I graduated law school
and...

537
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,685
- I'm sorry. I don't want to bore you
with this, but I'd like to...
- I know.

538
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:41,189
I been listenin' to the same four
life stories for way too long now.

539
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,567
One more would be just great.

540
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:47,737
Well, uh, I graduated
law school and, uh...

541
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:51,866
I drew a salary from my dad's company,
and I travelled and I partied.

542
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,244
Tough. Breakin' my heart here.

543
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:59,123
Yeah, well, the recession hit
and my father's business fell apart.

544
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,751
I tried to help with
the company and...

545
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:05,838
I mean, we almost got things
turned around, but, uh,
a bunch of loans came due...

546
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:10,217
and, and one thing
led to another and, uh...

547
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:14,263
See, we ended up juggling the books
and borrowing on false collateral...

548
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:18,559
and we lost everything, and,
and I beat a fraud charge...

549
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,145
and, uh...

550
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,188
and l-I almost got disbarred.

551
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:26,900
I mean, I don't even
know how it all...

552
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,653
It's just...
One thing led to another.

553
00:41:29,736 --> 00:41:31,696
Yeah, I know how that goes.

554
00:41:33,865 --> 00:41:37,619
Yard recall and lockdown.
Yard recall and lockdown.

555
00:41:37,702 --> 00:41:39,913
You gotta go.

556
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:42,207
- Well...
- See ya.

557
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:45,501
Saturday?

558
00:41:45,585 --> 00:41:47,337
Saturday.

559
00:41:56,053 --> 00:41:58,681
Sam! Hold on there.

560
00:41:58,764 --> 00:42:02,685
- Goddam it, what are you trying to do?
- Just hold on one second.

561
00:42:02,768 --> 00:42:05,354
Let me see that stick
you got in your hand.

562
00:42:05,437 --> 00:42:08,690
- It's a sand wedge.
- Ah, well, you don't want
to use a sand wedge.

563
00:42:08,774 --> 00:42:11,318
I'm up to my eyeballs in sand, and
you're telling me I don't want to use
a sand wedge?

564
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:13,987
- That's right. You wanna use
a pitching wedge.
- Just back off.

565
00:42:14,071 --> 00:42:16,657
- Give me the sand wedge.
- Listen to me. Pitching wedge, okay?

566
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:21,077
Break your wrists off right away,
cut straight down into it.

567
00:42:21,161 --> 00:42:23,955
Trust me.

568
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:27,417
All right, but if you're wrong you're
working the Department of Highways
tomorrow.

569
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,128
Okay.

570
00:42:30,211 --> 00:42:31,713
Right down now.

571
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:40,471
- Okay!
- You're welcome.

572
00:42:40,555 --> 00:42:44,684
Goddang. I forgot
who I was dealing with.

573
00:42:44,767 --> 00:42:47,186
Probably grew up on the
ninth hole at White Sands.

574
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:51,398
Well, golf's about as close as we came
to any kind of organized religion.

575
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:54,026
Let's put it that way.

576
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:58,030
- The Reese reports ready to go?
- Well, yeah, except for
your recommendation.

577
00:42:58,113 --> 00:43:01,533
- You want this in or out?
- You can take it out.

578
00:43:04,995 --> 00:43:07,038
Why don't you finish up
on Liggett.

579
00:43:07,122 --> 00:43:10,417
Go to St. Charles County and
do those last few interviews.

580
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,460
No problem.

581
00:43:18,466 --> 00:43:20,385
Nice.

582
00:43:20,468 --> 00:43:22,470
You gotta watch yourself, Rick.

583
00:43:22,553 --> 00:43:25,765
You get sucked in,
it does nobody any good.

584
00:43:25,848 --> 00:43:28,935
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

585
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:31,937
So you do all this work
on these capital cases...

586
00:43:32,021 --> 00:43:35,399
for a governor who, who never
grants clemency, huh?

587
00:43:35,483 --> 00:43:37,484
Always a first time.

588
00:43:37,568 --> 00:43:41,655
- Well, how do you stay with it?
- I'm highly motivated.

589
00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:45,742
If I don't pay my child support,
I'll end up in state prison.

590
00:43:45,826 --> 00:43:47,786
You never get involved
emotionally?

591
00:43:50,956 --> 00:43:53,250
You ever hear of a guy
named James Nichols?

592
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,752
Um, no, I don't think so.

593
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:58,088
I got to know him pretty well.

594
00:43:58,171 --> 00:44:01,216
Big kid in a man's body.
Killed three people.

595
00:44:01,299 --> 00:44:03,218
Yeah?

596
00:44:03,301 --> 00:44:05,678
He wanted me to be there
at the end.

597
00:44:05,762 --> 00:44:08,681
- Here you go.
- Made me promise.

598
00:44:11,434 --> 00:44:16,606
They were still using the electric chair
then, and they messed up.

599
00:44:16,689 --> 00:44:19,775
Took a long time
for Jimmy to die.

600
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:23,445
He started to burn, literally.

601
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:26,323
His knees fused together.

602
00:44:26,407 --> 00:44:29,868
Smoke started coming off of him.
You could smell it.

603
00:44:29,952 --> 00:44:31,870
Jesus.

604
00:44:33,497 --> 00:44:35,415
I can still smell it.

605
00:44:42,923 --> 00:44:44,841
This is her senior picture.

606
00:44:44,925 --> 00:44:47,552
The high school dedicated
the full page.

607
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,389
They were all wild kids.

608
00:44:51,473 --> 00:44:54,058
We let 'em run wild.

609
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:59,689
I mean, the things they were doin',
it could've happened to any of'em.

610
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:07,863
But I don't believe in killing.
"Thou shalt not kill."

611
00:45:07,947 --> 00:45:09,907
Not even Cindy Liggett.

612
00:45:11,784 --> 00:45:16,288
L-I can only i-imagine that must
be difficult for you to say.

613
00:45:16,372 --> 00:45:19,166
Well, I'm not saying
that I forgive her...

614
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,293
although I'm trying.

615
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:27,007
God, I known her since
she was five years old...

616
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,259
and they were sweet kids.

617
00:45:29,342 --> 00:45:31,678
It's just that
putting her to death...

618
00:45:31,761 --> 00:45:35,390
is only gonna keep us
locked in this darkness.

619
00:45:35,473 --> 00:45:40,520
Well, ma'am, would you consider signing
a statement on behalf of Miss Liggett?

620
00:45:40,603 --> 00:45:43,189
No.

621
00:45:44,816 --> 00:45:46,943
Bu... Can you tell me why not?

622
00:45:48,778 --> 00:45:51,280
No.

623
00:45:59,788 --> 00:46:02,041
- Good day, sir.
- Hi. I'm Rick Hayes.

624
00:46:02,124 --> 00:46:05,419
Mr McGuire's in the drawing
room waiting for you, sir.

625
00:46:05,502 --> 00:46:07,463
Thank you.

626
00:46:13,135 --> 00:46:15,053
Mr McGuire, hello.

627
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,725
- This is Mr Faring, my attorney.
- Hi. Rick Hayes.

628
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:23,812
You wanted some kind
of a statement.

629
00:46:23,895 --> 00:46:26,940
Well, it's an update.
It's required by law.

630
00:46:28,733 --> 00:46:32,820
A copy of this has already
been sent to the governor.

631
00:46:36,616 --> 00:46:40,244
- All right.
- I'm not in the best of health.

632
00:46:42,163 --> 00:46:44,331
But I promise you...

633
00:46:44,415 --> 00:46:47,334
that I'm gonna live to see this
woman pay for what's she's done.

634
00:46:49,128 --> 00:46:51,797
This scum brutally
murdered my son...

635
00:46:53,215 --> 00:46:55,926
and she's brutally murdered
an entire family's chance...

636
00:46:56,009 --> 00:46:59,930
for another moment
of peace or happiness.

637
00:47:00,013 --> 00:47:03,934
There's nothing left
for us now except justice.

638
00:47:06,937 --> 00:47:11,858
My boy would've been
about your age today.

639
00:47:11,941 --> 00:47:14,194
He didn't deserve to die
like that.

640
00:47:16,487 --> 00:47:18,406
What she did to him...

641
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:23,327
It had to be a closed casket.

642
00:47:25,997 --> 00:47:29,750
Mr Hayes, what if
it was your son?

643
00:47:38,425 --> 00:47:41,345
First time I picked her up
was on a Drunk and Disorderly.

644
00:47:41,428 --> 00:47:45,140
I was a beat cop. She was 14.

645
00:47:45,223 --> 00:47:48,435
Had a set of balls on her
even as a kid.

646
00:47:48,518 --> 00:47:51,104
This was no surprise.

647
00:47:51,188 --> 00:47:55,150
She and Barnes had committed at least
20 burglaries that we knew of
that summer.

648
00:47:55,233 --> 00:47:59,737
The brutality of the crime...
uh, did that seem in character?

649
00:47:59,821 --> 00:48:01,364
- Character.
- Yeah.

650
00:48:01,447 --> 00:48:03,866
A crackhead's got no character.

651
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,744
Doug Barnes was so hot to cut
a deal with the D. A...

652
00:48:06,828 --> 00:48:10,706
he testified against Cindy and then
tossed in a couple of dope dealers
just for good measure.

653
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:12,833
- I'll sign it after this hearing.
- Yes, sir.

654
00:48:14,126 --> 00:48:16,253
I have to be in court
in 30 minutes.

655
00:48:16,337 --> 00:48:18,672
Okay, we're just about
finished here, Mr Rusk.

656
00:48:18,756 --> 00:48:22,301
- I am trying to find her brother though.
- Her brother.

657
00:48:22,384 --> 00:48:25,596
- You think he's gonna help you?
- He's in Walkerton.

658
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:28,515
Next time he screws up,
state prison.

659
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:31,185
Okay, well, I appreciate
your time. Thank you.

660
00:48:31,268 --> 00:48:33,854
You can include these
in your report, Mr Hayes.

661
00:48:33,937 --> 00:48:39,234
They were considered too inflammatory
to be introduced at the trial.

662
00:48:40,777 --> 00:48:42,946
I hear she's changed quite a bit in there.
Is that right?

663
00:48:43,029 --> 00:48:46,032
- She has.
- That's great.

664
00:48:46,116 --> 00:48:48,827
You know, it's a shame that these people
don't get to change.

665
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:50,662
They'll stay like this forever.

666
00:48:52,705 --> 00:48:55,041
Look, I prosecuted this case.

667
00:48:55,124 --> 00:48:58,252
It was my first big case,
and I know it cold.

668
00:48:58,336 --> 00:49:01,213
The attorney general's office is totally
behind us, and so is the public...

669
00:49:01,297 --> 00:49:03,341
and we're gonna see
this sentence carried out.

670
00:49:03,424 --> 00:49:09,263
Now, you can dick around all you want,
but this sentence will be carried out.

671
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,807
It's good to see you, Joe.

672
00:49:30,325 --> 00:49:35,830
"...call our grandfather
Grandpa."

673
00:49:40,835 --> 00:49:42,795
Frances?

674
00:49:44,088 --> 00:49:46,007
Frances?

675
00:49:48,175 --> 00:49:50,678
What time is it, Frances?

676
00:49:50,761 --> 00:49:54,557
3.30. Saturday hours are over.

677
00:49:55,683 --> 00:49:58,477
Shit.

678
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,604
Ain't no man worth
gettin' upset over.

679
00:50:00,688 --> 00:50:02,606
Shut up.

680
00:50:02,689 --> 00:50:06,526
You wanna get mad, I can give you
a lot better things to get mad about.

681
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:09,946
- Just stay out of it, bitch!
- Who you callin' bitch, bitch?

682
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,157
Calling' you bitch,
you stupid bitch!

683
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,951
You think anybody's gonna marry you
after you killed two husbands?

684
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:17,787
At least I ever got married.
That's more than you can say.

685
00:50:17,871 --> 00:50:21,875
- Shut up!
- Girl, you losin' your mind.

686
00:50:32,468 --> 00:50:35,680
...since the tender age
of 12 years old.

687
00:50:35,763 --> 00:50:41,310
Carrie says that men are stupid,
and Carrie specializes in...

688
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,982
Hey.

689
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:50,944
Didn't think you were comin'.

690
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:53,322
Well, I was out of town.

691
00:50:53,405 --> 00:50:55,616
So much for promises.

692
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:58,201
I was doing interviews
for your report.

693
00:50:58,285 --> 00:51:00,370
Then I guess you know
everything now.

694
00:51:00,454 --> 00:51:03,164
No, I know about the past.

695
00:51:03,248 --> 00:51:05,208
You're not that person any more.

696
00:51:10,296 --> 00:51:14,050
All right, look, I need you
to tell me about that night.

697
00:51:16,594 --> 00:51:18,763
That night?

698
00:51:23,267 --> 00:51:25,186
That night is...

699
00:51:25,978 --> 00:51:28,105
inside me like this...

700
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,026
big, terrible shadow.

701
00:51:35,404 --> 00:51:37,698
I hated Debbie Hunt.

702
00:51:37,781 --> 00:51:41,577
I hated everything,
everything I didn't have.

703
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:47,165
And Debbie Hunt used to just
rub my nose in it.

704
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:50,710
And all that hate...

705
00:51:50,794 --> 00:51:53,713
just blew everything apart.

706
00:51:55,924 --> 00:51:58,051
I killed them.

707
00:51:58,134 --> 00:52:00,219
I killed myself.

708
00:52:00,303 --> 00:52:02,221
I know what I did.

709
00:52:03,556 --> 00:52:05,975
I can't change that.

710
00:52:06,058 --> 00:52:08,811
I can only change myself.

711
00:52:10,479 --> 00:52:14,066
Uh, I guess there are just...

712
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:16,068
some things...

713
00:52:16,152 --> 00:52:18,404
can't be forgiven.

714
00:52:18,487 --> 00:52:21,240
Why not...

715
00:52:21,323 --> 00:52:24,368
if a person's able to change?

716
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:28,413
'Cause the people doin' the
forgivin' have to change too.

717
00:52:41,509 --> 00:52:44,762
Today for the first time
in my term as Governor...

718
00:52:44,846 --> 00:52:47,390
in light of a number
of most-compelling reasons...

719
00:52:47,473 --> 00:52:50,393
I am granting clemency
in a capital case.

720
00:52:54,689 --> 00:52:59,235
I'm withdrawing my order of
execution for John Henry Reese...

721
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:03,280
and commuting his sentence
to life imprisonment.

722
00:53:03,405 --> 00:53:06,242
- What about Liggett?
- There should be no mistake however...
- No.

723
00:53:06,325 --> 00:53:09,912
- That I remain a strong proponent
of the death penalty...
- Why?

724
00:53:10,037 --> 00:53:13,290
- And a firm believer of its place in our society.
- What the hell do you want, a religious conversion?

725
00:53:13,373 --> 00:53:16,543
- Wouldn't have hurt.
- And I know the people of this state...

726
00:53:16,668 --> 00:53:19,755
overwhelmingly agree with me.

727
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:22,132
- There are, however...
- Look...

728
00:53:22,257 --> 00:53:25,260
- those rare occasions when
exceptions cry out.
- It's an issue of credibility.

729
00:53:25,343 --> 00:53:27,387
- And the rule of law...
- Whose credibility?
- Mine.

730
00:53:27,512 --> 00:53:30,932
Must acknowledge
extraordinary circumstances.

731
00:53:31,015 --> 00:53:33,768
- I'll take a few questions now.
- Governor.
- Governor.

732
00:53:33,851 --> 00:53:37,522
Governor, could you tell us
the compelling reasons
that prompted your decision...

733
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,483
to commute
Mr Reese's sentence?

734
00:53:40,566 --> 00:53:45,529
- Mr Reese has gone as far as any prisoner I've ever seen...
- I stick my neck out, there better be a damn good reason.

735
00:53:45,613 --> 00:53:51,285
- Transforming himself into a thinking, contributing...
- I don't see it with Liggett. Maybe you do. I'm sorry.

736
00:53:51,368 --> 00:53:54,371
- This is about reelection, isn't it?
- Responsible and very unique voice.

737
00:53:54,496 --> 00:53:57,041
It's about getting
the black vote, isn't it?

738
00:53:57,124 --> 00:53:59,334
It's about clemency.

739
00:54:00,752 --> 00:54:03,463
Governor, what about
the Liggett case?

740
00:54:03,547 --> 00:54:07,843
Clemency was denied. Miss Liggett's
death warrant is set to be carried out...

741
00:54:07,968 --> 00:54:12,264
at 12.01 a.m. On Saturday,
one week from today.

742
00:54:12,389 --> 00:54:16,851
If it's carried out, Cindy Liggett will be
the first woman in 11 years...

743
00:54:16,935 --> 00:54:18,895
to be executed in this state.

744
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:23,733
- Any comment?
- Miss Liggett committed a brutal
and senseless double murder.

745
00:54:23,858 --> 00:54:27,862
Her sex made no difference to her victims.
It makes no difference to us
under our legal system.

746
00:54:39,248 --> 00:54:43,419
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

747
00:54:43,502 --> 00:54:45,212
I know.

748
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:54,346
Look, I've got an idea
for an appeal.

749
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:57,891
No, no. You've gotta keep
letting me fight this.

750
00:55:00,894 --> 00:55:03,355
I am afraid to say no...

751
00:55:03,438 --> 00:55:06,065
and I am afraid to say yes.

752
00:55:10,737 --> 00:55:12,864
Look.

753
00:55:14,532 --> 00:55:17,159
There is somethin'
you can do for me.

754
00:55:25,417 --> 00:55:27,628
- One, two, three, hey!
- What's this about?

755
00:55:27,711 --> 00:55:29,838
- One, two, three, hey!
- I'm a friend of your sister's.

756
00:55:29,964 --> 00:55:32,716
- One, two, three, hey!
- Here's how it is.

757
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,846
Uh, she's got six more days, okay?
Maybe you already know that.

758
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:40,307
Now she wanted me
to get you this.

759
00:55:43,977 --> 00:55:47,314
You're the only family she's got.

760
00:55:47,397 --> 00:55:50,150
She loves you.

761
00:55:50,275 --> 00:55:53,111
- She said that?
- Yes, she did.

762
00:55:53,194 --> 00:55:56,197
You'll be doin' K.P., boy!
Let's move it!

763
00:55:56,322 --> 00:55:59,492
Six days.

764
00:55:59,575 --> 00:56:02,411
We're doin' all we can.

765
00:56:05,081 --> 00:56:07,124
I'm the one who turned her in.
Did you know that?

766
00:56:07,249 --> 00:56:09,627
Look, she doesn't hold anything
against you, okay?

767
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:12,671
She's... She's actually grateful that
you stopped her. Believe me.

768
00:56:12,755 --> 00:56:17,051
- The cops, they, um... they said
I'd be savin' her life.
- Yep.

769
00:56:17,176 --> 00:56:19,720
What I did,
I did it to help her.

770
00:56:19,803 --> 00:56:23,932
She was all messed up. Couldn't
tell what she was gonna do next.

771
00:56:24,016 --> 00:56:26,476
I didn't know this
was gonna happen.

772
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:30,063
Listen, she knows all that,
all of it.

773
00:56:30,188 --> 00:56:32,482
She's okay.

774
00:56:40,615 --> 00:56:42,575
Come on, boys! Move it!

775
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:47,497
So my next trick, kids,
is very impressive, very exciting.

776
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:51,876
What I'm going to do is show you
a beautiful bouquet of flowers.

777
00:56:51,959 --> 00:56:54,003
- Would ya like to see that?
- Yeah.

778
00:56:54,086 --> 00:56:57,590
Would ya? Okay. Good.
Hold on. Ah, here they are.

779
00:56:57,715 --> 00:57:02,261
Aren't they beautiful?
As you can see, there's blue...

780
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:04,680
and red and pink.

781
00:57:04,763 --> 00:57:08,976
What's so funny? Why are you giggling?
What do you mean there's no flowers?

782
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:12,271
- Hi, I'm Rick Hayes. Remember?
- This happens to be my home.

783
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:14,856
- Look, I, I need your help. I'm sorr...
- It's my daughter's birthday.

784
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:20,695
Okay. Well, I need you to file a stay of
execution in Federal District Court
for Cindy Liggett.

785
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:24,741
- Mama, Vanessa took my M&Ms.
- Okay, sweetheart, go back.
I'll take care of it.

786
00:57:24,824 --> 00:57:26,451
- Okay.
- I'll be right there.

787
00:57:26,534 --> 00:57:29,621
L-I'm sorry. But we... we have some
big-time grounds for appeal here.

788
00:57:29,704 --> 00:57:34,083
- What grounds?
- Well, ineffective counsel.
Basically, your partner Ed Duffy blew it.

789
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:38,254
- Oh, you got a hell of a nerve.
- All right. Well, you take a look
at this, uh...

790
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:42,133
I've got a police report here, okay?

791
00:57:42,216 --> 00:57:45,386
And this is a statement made by
her brother before the arrest.

792
00:57:47,596 --> 00:57:51,100
She and Doug Barnes had been
up for two days smokin' crack.
Now, he never introduced it.

793
00:57:51,183 --> 00:57:53,143
You tell me why.

794
00:57:53,227 --> 00:57:57,064
Well, I don't know. Maybe he felt a jury
sees a drug addict as subhuman.

795
00:57:57,147 --> 00:58:00,233
You and I both know they'd be a lot more
likely to execute an addict.

796
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:03,362
Hey, we're talkin' a level of intoxication
here that might save her life.

797
00:58:03,487 --> 00:58:05,864
- Oh, man, it was a strategic move.
- Oh, come on.

798
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:08,992
- Maybe he should have
pressed the drugs.
- We're six days from her execution.

799
00:58:09,075 --> 00:58:12,746
This is the only chance
she's got.

800
00:58:12,871 --> 00:58:17,750
Will you do it? Look, I'll handle
the research. I'll do the legwork.

801
00:58:17,834 --> 00:58:22,213
- Mom, I wanna open my presents.
- In a minute, baby. In a minute.

802
00:58:22,338 --> 00:58:25,341
One, two, three.

803
00:58:25,424 --> 00:58:28,219
Abracadabra.

804
00:58:28,302 --> 00:58:31,389
- I'll do my own research.
- Good.

805
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:37,937
Good night.

806
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:20,603
Good evening, sir.

807
00:59:20,728 --> 00:59:22,688
Thanks.

808
00:59:29,695 --> 00:59:31,989
Nice to see you.

809
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,660
- Hey.
- Hey.

810
00:59:36,785 --> 00:59:38,995
- You made it.
- Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late, sweetie.

811
00:59:39,121 --> 00:59:42,791
Well, you missed the soggy crab cakes
and the California champagne.

812
00:59:42,874 --> 00:59:45,251
- Well, you look beautiful, though.
- Thank you.

813
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:47,921
- Hey, here's John.
- There he is.

814
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:50,423
- Hi. - Hi, how ya doin'?
- I'm good. You? - You okay?

815
00:59:50,548 --> 00:59:54,927
- Yeah, everything's good.
- You free on Sunday, maybe
for some tennis or whatever?

816
00:59:55,011 --> 00:59:57,555
Uh, yeah. Maybe.

817
01:00:02,101 --> 01:00:04,228
Rick?

818
01:00:04,312 --> 01:00:07,648
- They spent hundreds of thousands
on the building alone.
- Governor? Governor?

819
01:00:07,773 --> 01:00:10,776
- Excuse me, sir. Hi. Um, I'd like to...
- Mr Hayes.

820
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,070
- Yes, sir.
- Clemency.
- Yes.

821
01:00:13,153 --> 01:00:15,906
You fellas did a mighty
fine job on the Reese case.

822
01:00:16,031 --> 01:00:19,201
- Thank you, sir. I'd like to talk to you
about Cindy Liggett.
- Liggett?

823
01:00:19,284 --> 01:00:23,121
- Yes. I urge you to reconsider. - Oh, not now.
- I believe that this woman deserves clemency as well.

824
01:00:23,205 --> 01:00:25,415
- This is completely inappropriate.
- It's all right.
- No, it isn't all right.

825
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:28,627
- We'll talk tomorrow in my office.
John, set that up.
- She had ineffective counsel.

826
01:00:28,752 --> 01:00:30,712
- She should've been given a life sentence.
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

827
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:33,465
- Prison is the only stable environment...
- This is difficult for all of us, Mr Hayes.

828
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:37,051
- That this woman has ever known. Her life outside...
- Rick, come on.
- John, let go of me.

829
01:00:37,135 --> 01:00:40,305
Her life outside was a nightmare.
She's changed. She's grown.

830
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:44,767
She's a different person now. Now,
we're... we're not settin' an example here.

831
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:48,563
We never gave her a chance to become
like us, sir! We've become like her.

832
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:51,732
You have an eloquent tongue, Mr Hayes.
Must run in the family.

833
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:55,486
- Well, Cindy Liggett didn't have a chance,
sir. And if you'd just...
- Now, you've had your turn!

834
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:58,948
Now, the rule of law demands that
this girl receive the maximum penalty
for what she did.

835
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:02,034
- Governor, you...
- May I finish?

836
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:06,121
- Yes.
- Now, if you don't like this particular law,
by all means, change it.

837
01:01:06,205 --> 01:01:10,500
But in the meantime, it's my sworn duty
as governor to uphold the laws
as I find them.

838
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:14,212
You understand? You just pour
yourself a good, stiff drink.

839
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:18,008
- Enjoy the rest of the party
with your brother John.
- Sir.

840
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,761
- Let's go.
- Mark, I'm sorry about that.
Now, the building...

841
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:24,848
Young turks.

842
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:28,393
- I hope you know what you just did.
- John, the man pulls the switch.
Bottom line.

843
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:31,229
- Quiet. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.
- Look, I don't care who hears this.

844
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:34,565
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- For what? Do you think this is about me?

845
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,359
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Yeah.

846
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:39,195
- You're ruining your life and mine too.
- What about her life?

847
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:41,405
- You can't change what's gonna happen.
- Then you try and stop me.

848
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:43,407
- I'm trying. Believe me, I'm trying.
- Uh-huh.

849
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:46,702
I kept you from being disbarred after
that mess with Dad, but I don't know.

850
01:01:46,827 --> 01:01:49,913
- You've got me on this one, brother.
- What are you talkin' about?

851
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:54,710
- John, you think this is about us?
You and me?
- You tell me.

852
01:01:54,793 --> 01:01:59,089
You are so way off. This is the first thing
ever that is not about you and me.

853
01:02:09,557 --> 01:02:12,310
I figured I'd save you
the trouble.

854
01:02:14,354 --> 01:02:16,397
I'm sorry.

855
01:02:16,481 --> 01:02:20,693
Don't be.
And congratulations on Reese.

856
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:27,033
You were right.
There's a first time for everything.

857
01:02:27,116 --> 01:02:30,536
She has unlimited visiting time.
You know that, don't you?

858
01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:34,873
Then I'd better get goin'.
Sam, thanks.

859
01:02:34,957 --> 01:02:38,127
- Thanks?
- Hey, I don't regret anything
that's happened here.

860
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,380
It's the next four days
I'm worried about.

861
01:02:42,923 --> 01:02:45,842
I wish I could tell you
something that would help, but...

862
01:02:45,926 --> 01:02:49,095
- Well, there is somethin' you could do.
- What's that?

863
01:02:49,221 --> 01:02:51,348
Well, her brother's up
at Walkerton Work Camp.

864
01:02:51,473 --> 01:02:55,643
Now, if you could get him a visit with her,
that would mean a lot.

865
01:02:55,727 --> 01:02:59,230
- I'll see what I can do.
- Well, that'd be great.

866
01:02:59,314 --> 01:03:01,524
- See y'all.
- Bye, Rick.

867
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:21,877
- Hey, how's it goin'?
- I tried to reach you at the office.

868
01:03:22,002 --> 01:03:24,296
- We heard on the appeal?
- We got turned down.

869
01:03:24,421 --> 01:03:26,799
- Shit!
- This came this morning.

870
01:03:26,882 --> 01:03:29,509
- No hearing, nothing. Just a ruling.
- Man.

871
01:03:29,593 --> 01:03:34,056
Our next move should be Judge Gorman
on the Federal Court of Appeals.
He's a good guy.

872
01:03:34,181 --> 01:03:36,141
- Who's that, Gorman?
- Yeah, Gorman.

873
01:03:36,266 --> 01:03:39,603
- They're in recess now.
Can you track him down?
- Yeah, l-I'll get to work on it.

874
01:03:39,686 --> 01:03:43,982
Look, uh, you should know I left the job.
I have no authority any more.

875
01:03:44,065 --> 01:03:48,528
Well, great. Now that you're no longer a
third-rate bureaucrat, you can really help.

876
01:03:48,611 --> 01:03:50,905
Well, let's hope so.

877
01:03:52,573 --> 01:03:55,660
Mrs Gorman, I promise you I would not be
calling you at your home at this hour...

878
01:03:55,785 --> 01:03:57,745
if it weren't urgent.

879
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:01,624
No, l-I understand. It's-It's...
It's his vacation, but...

880
01:04:01,749 --> 01:04:05,252
Well... No, I'm...
I'm sorry, but...

881
01:04:05,377 --> 01:04:07,504
Well, all right.

882
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:11,133
Uh, look, I'm sorry
to have bothered you.

883
01:04:12,468 --> 01:04:15,470
- Hi.
- Remember me?

884
01:04:15,596 --> 01:04:18,056
I've got a fully-stocked bar now.

885
01:04:20,475 --> 01:04:23,812
Uh, this is for you.

886
01:04:23,937 --> 01:04:26,064
He's a family friend...

887
01:04:26,147 --> 01:04:29,734
and, uh, I guess
you'll be lookin' for a job.

888
01:04:32,278 --> 01:04:37,158
- Senator Paul Hagan?
- He's looking for a new legislative aide.

889
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:39,952
He's expecting your call.

890
01:04:40,036 --> 01:04:43,456
- No strings.
- No strings?

891
01:04:43,581 --> 01:04:47,668
Well, I figure if you can
chase a lost cause, so can I.

892
01:04:48,836 --> 01:04:50,880
I mean, uh...

893
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:58,387
What are you doin'?
I don't understand.

894
01:04:58,512 --> 01:05:00,556
You're just...
You're throwing it away. L...

895
01:05:00,681 --> 01:05:05,394
Is it some kind of...
romantic slumming?

896
01:05:05,477 --> 01:05:09,231
- No.
- You're too young for a midlife crisis.

897
01:05:17,906 --> 01:05:21,242
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't get it.

898
01:05:21,367 --> 01:05:24,203
- Look, Jill...
- No, I gotta go.

899
01:05:30,501 --> 01:05:34,505
- You listen to me, Rick.
You have done more for me...
- No.

900
01:05:34,588 --> 01:05:37,383
- Than anyone ever has.
- Look, it is not over, okay?

901
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:39,593
- There is a judge on Federal
Court Appeals.
- No.

902
01:05:39,677 --> 01:05:41,470
- Yes.
- No.

903
01:05:41,595 --> 01:05:47,059
I have screwed up a lot of things in my life.
This one I wanna do right.

904
01:05:49,895 --> 01:05:54,066
Now, I want you to
get me somethin'. Okay?

905
01:05:54,149 --> 01:05:56,026
Okay.

906
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,990
It's not so bad.

907
01:06:02,073 --> 01:06:04,034
What isn't?

908
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,413
Knowin' what comes next.

909
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:15,169
What do you think
about this one?

910
01:06:15,253 --> 01:06:17,797
Uh, it's...
It's fancy too.

911
01:06:17,922 --> 01:06:19,799
I don't think it's that fancy.

912
01:06:19,924 --> 01:06:23,678
Well, l-I just... It's something
simple, you know? Like, uh...

913
01:06:23,761 --> 01:06:27,014
What exactly does
she need it for?

914
01:06:27,139 --> 01:06:29,433
It doesn't matter.

915
01:06:35,856 --> 01:06:38,775
What about this one?
It's simple.

916
01:06:41,945 --> 01:06:44,406
Yeah.

917
01:06:52,122 --> 01:06:55,208
I mean, would you donate
two dollars if you had two?

918
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:59,837
- This is the third time she's
done this to me.
- It's about time someone told her.

919
01:07:01,464 --> 01:07:03,841
Well, I'm sorry.

920
01:07:03,925 --> 01:07:07,678
There was nothing you or I
could've done. It's the system.

921
01:07:08,638 --> 01:07:11,891
Well, we're the system.

922
01:07:13,225 --> 01:07:17,771
Aw, wait a minute.
Why not let it go?

923
01:07:17,896 --> 01:07:21,942
- You wouldn't understand, John.
- Try me.

924
01:07:22,025 --> 01:07:25,445
Everyone gave up on her.

925
01:07:36,122 --> 01:07:40,168
Meanwhile, the clock continues to count
down for death row inmate Cindy Liggett.

926
01:07:40,293 --> 01:07:42,837
Sometime tomorrow evening, Liggett
is expected to be transferred...

927
01:07:42,962 --> 01:07:47,175
to Men's State Prison, where she will
spend her last 48 hours on deathwatch.

928
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,053
Liggett was convicted of the murders
of Matt McGuire and Debbie Hunt...

929
01:07:50,136 --> 01:07:54,515
in St. Charles 12 years ago, and her
execution has been scheduled
three times.

930
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:58,019
This time, however, her attorneys'efforts
to achieve a fourth stay...

931
01:07:58,102 --> 01:08:00,229
appear not to have succeeded.

932
01:08:20,999 --> 01:08:23,209
Thank you.

933
01:08:25,962 --> 01:08:29,966
I hear there's some people up in Catesville
who are real eager to see you, Doug.

934
01:08:30,049 --> 01:08:34,762
- I don't know anyone up there.
- It seems Cindy wasn't the only one
you put away when you copped your plea.

935
01:08:34,887 --> 01:08:38,391
You also turned in your dealers.
Now, do you remember that?

936
01:08:38,474 --> 01:08:42,770
- That's news to me.
- Oh, then you won't mind
being transferred, huh?

937
01:08:42,853 --> 01:08:44,647
- What?
- Yeah. It's all arranged.

938
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:47,483
You see, someone I care about might die
'cause of one lyin' scumbag.

939
01:08:47,608 --> 01:08:51,195
So I'm gonna send that scumbag
to Catesville.

940
01:08:53,405 --> 01:08:56,992
- Do it.
- The two of you were out of
your mind on crack that night.

941
01:08:57,117 --> 01:09:01,914
That fact could've saved her life.
Now, why'd you say it was only beer
and marijuana?

942
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:08,420
- I'll see you in Catesville.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

943
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:13,925
- What the hell you want?
- I want a statement.

944
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:16,928
I want to know why you
kept quiet about the drugs.

945
01:09:17,011 --> 01:09:21,307
- Well, they said to.
- Who told you to?

946
01:09:21,432 --> 01:09:23,810
The D.A. Rusk.

947
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,605
The D.A. Instructed you to lie?

948
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:36,530
- And you won't get me moved?
- You sign this affidavit.

949
01:09:36,614 --> 01:09:41,410
- Clemency Office.
- Hi, Helen. It's Rick. Did you have
any luck finding thejudge?

950
01:09:41,493 --> 01:09:45,706
Yeah. Um, he's at the Gulf Winds Fishing
Camp somewhere near Marquesa Lake.

951
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:48,542
- But there's no phone.
- How'd you track him down there?

952
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:52,546
Well, Sam...
Sam says good luck.

953
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:55,132
- Tell Sam thank you.
- You're welcome, Rick. Bye.

954
01:10:07,143 --> 01:10:09,604
You won't be able
to take those.

955
01:10:09,729 --> 01:10:13,399
- Why not?
- It's a part of the procedure.

956
01:10:13,524 --> 01:10:17,528
- What harm is a few drawings gonna do?
- I'm sorry, Cindy.

957
01:10:33,293 --> 01:10:36,713
- Hey, Reg.
- Hey, baby girl.

958
01:10:39,633 --> 01:10:42,469
Why'd you shave your head?

959
01:10:42,552 --> 01:10:47,849
It's for you, girl. Nothing left to lose.
You know what I mean?

960
01:10:50,894 --> 01:10:53,688
You keep the faith now.

961
01:10:57,066 --> 01:10:59,026
Bye.

962
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:01,237
All right, Cindy.

963
01:14:00,535 --> 01:14:03,079
Miss Liggett?

964
01:14:03,162 --> 01:14:05,456
I'm Warden Laverty.

965
01:14:05,581 --> 01:14:09,001
This is Reverend Cummins.

966
01:14:09,127 --> 01:14:12,213
Officer Mulkey
will be right here.

967
01:14:12,296 --> 01:14:17,635
Anything you want from the canteen
in the way of sodas or candy,
just let her know.

968
01:14:17,718 --> 01:14:21,639
- And she'll also have a TV hooked up
for you to watch.
- No TVs.

969
01:14:22,848 --> 01:14:25,851
That's okay too.

970
01:14:25,976 --> 01:14:29,897
We will need for you to change
into that blue uniform there.

971
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:34,568
Cindy, I'm on 24-hour call.

972
01:14:34,651 --> 01:14:37,988
I'll come to you
whenever you want.

973
01:14:38,071 --> 01:14:42,075
Okay. Well...

974
01:14:42,158 --> 01:14:45,745
we're going to try to make you
as comfortable as possible.

975
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:48,248
Thanks.

976
01:15:41,174 --> 01:15:44,260
Okay, c'mon. Let's go.

977
01:15:45,803 --> 01:15:48,097
Get your ass outta the car.

978
01:15:49,432 --> 01:15:52,309
They go to the beach
every weekend.

979
01:16:08,742 --> 01:16:12,078
- They got a V.C.R.
- Yeah, I'll get it.

980
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,690
Shit!

981
01:16:43,108 --> 01:16:45,861
Oh, it's you, you fuckin' whore.

982
01:16:45,945 --> 01:16:48,322
Get outta my house.
Get outta my house!

983
01:16:48,447 --> 01:16:52,201
Get outta here, you thievin' whore!
Get outta my house!

984
01:17:18,184 --> 01:17:20,728
There it is.

985
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:06,898
Judge Gorman!

986
01:18:06,981 --> 01:18:09,984
Goddam it, Will! What the hell
are you doin' here anyway?

987
01:18:10,109 --> 01:18:11,819
- Judge Gorman?
- Yes.

988
01:18:11,902 --> 01:18:14,447
Your Honour, I'm sorry.
My name is Rick Hayes...

989
01:18:14,572 --> 01:18:18,409
and I have a motion from State Legal Aid
to stay the execution of Cindy Liggett...

990
01:18:18,492 --> 01:18:22,079
which is scheduled for 12.01 a.m.
This Saturday, tomorrow night.

991
01:18:22,204 --> 01:18:25,791
Now, attached here you'll find
a witness's statement...

992
01:18:25,874 --> 01:18:30,671
- that the prosecution attempted
to suppress evidence.
- All right, all right. I know the case.

993
01:18:30,796 --> 01:18:33,965
Well, once you've read it, when might
we expect to hear from you?

994
01:18:34,091 --> 01:18:36,801
I'll radio my ruling back
from the ranger station.

995
01:18:36,885 --> 01:18:39,429
Thank you, sir.
All right.

996
01:18:39,554 --> 01:18:41,765
Thank you.

997
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:48,563
DDKnews time, 12. 14.
In other news,

998
01:18:48,688 --> 01:18:51,232
prison officials continue
preparations for the execution...

999
01:18:51,315 --> 01:18:53,443
of double-murderer Cindy Liggett.

1000
01:18:53,568 --> 01:18:57,613
Unless a stay is issued, Liggett is
scheduled to die in less than 24 hours.

1001
01:19:22,345 --> 01:19:26,433
I found that judge.
I think he might help us.

1002
01:19:42,823 --> 01:19:45,618
- You gonna stay?
- Yeah.

1003
01:19:47,411 --> 01:19:50,122
To the end?

1004
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:55,419
When I go,
will you be there?

1005
01:19:59,506 --> 01:20:02,301
It's too much to ask, huh?

1006
01:20:02,384 --> 01:20:04,845
No.

1007
01:20:06,555 --> 01:20:09,724
If it happens, I will be there.

1008
01:21:00,815 --> 01:21:02,942
I'm not a real breakfast person.

1009
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:06,446
Yeah, I'm just a...
I'm a coffee man myself.

1010
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:08,781
Me too.

1011
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:35,307
You see arriving here today some
who are for capital punishment
while others are against it.

1012
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:39,353
Others are carrying placards
saying "Cindy must die."

1013
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:42,481
- Kill the bitch.
- Others saying, "Thou shalt not kill."

1014
01:22:00,331 --> 01:22:02,291
She know I'm comin'?

1015
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:05,336
Well, she's gonna be
glad to see ya.

1016
01:22:16,597 --> 01:22:18,474
Bill?

1017
01:22:21,518 --> 01:22:23,395
Bill.

1018
01:22:25,355 --> 01:22:27,149
Hey.

1019
01:22:27,274 --> 01:22:31,027
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

1020
01:22:31,111 --> 01:22:35,407
I know, but what
you did was right.

1021
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:39,077
I didn't know this would happen.
If I'd known...

1022
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:42,664
I'm so glad that you're here.

1023
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,587
# Amazing Grace

1024
01:22:49,712 --> 01:22:54,342
# How sweet the sound

1025
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:59,180
- That saved a wretch like me
- You know damn well she should die!

1026
01:22:59,305 --> 01:23:03,601
- You over there with that sign! - The
crowd is becoming more and more vocal.

1027
01:23:03,684 --> 01:23:05,644
As the hour of
the execution approaches...

1028
01:23:05,769 --> 01:23:08,939
every man, woman and child
that is gathered here...

1029
01:23:09,022 --> 01:23:11,316
- has some opinion, whether they think...
- Kill her!

1030
01:23:11,441 --> 01:23:14,319
Do you know what you're gonna do
when you get outta there?

1031
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:16,446
N-No, I'm not sure yet.

1032
01:23:16,571 --> 01:23:18,949
Well, you better start
thinkin' about it.

1033
01:23:19,074 --> 01:23:22,911
You better make some plans. Listen to me.
You're gonna end up right back there.

1034
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,751
- Hello.
- Linda. What's going on? Anything?

1035
01:23:29,834 --> 01:23:32,295
No, he hasn't called yet, Rick.

1036
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:35,339
All right. What are we gonna do
if he turns us down?

1037
01:23:35,423 --> 01:23:37,717
Only place left is
the U.S. Supreme Court.

1038
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,344
- Well, is there time?
- Not really.

1039
01:23:40,428 --> 01:23:43,931
You need fourJustices to issue a stay.
We'd need at least a day.

1040
01:23:44,056 --> 01:23:48,519
Well, then... then he just better come
through and that damn radio
better work.

1041
01:23:48,602 --> 01:23:52,523
- I hope so.
- Well, do it.

1042
01:23:52,648 --> 01:23:57,027
- All right.
- All right or yes? Look at me.

1043
01:23:57,152 --> 01:24:02,991
You better look me in the eye and say yes,
'cause I'll be watchin' you.

1044
01:24:03,116 --> 01:24:07,829
And I'm tellin' you, if you screw up,
I'm gonna come all the way back here
just to kick your ass.

1045
01:24:20,508 --> 01:24:23,469
- Oh, this is insane.
- I know. I'm sorry.

1046
01:24:23,553 --> 01:24:26,097
I mean, we don't pick up
that goddam signal, she's dead.

1047
01:24:26,222 --> 01:24:28,933
Listen, Rick, we've still got
some time. Don't give up.

1048
01:24:29,016 --> 01:24:31,143
Aw, Linda, he's gotta
come through.

1049
01:24:50,912 --> 01:24:54,833
- Man.
- I decided to stop watchin' my weight.

1050
01:24:57,794 --> 01:24:59,921
Filet mignon.

1051
01:25:00,004 --> 01:25:02,841
Yeah, I always wanted to try it.

1052
01:25:06,803 --> 01:25:10,223
Cindy, did you get
everything you asked for?

1053
01:25:10,348 --> 01:25:12,391
Looks like it.

1054
01:25:12,517 --> 01:25:15,519
Well, it's quite a meal.

1055
01:25:15,645 --> 01:25:18,189
Hope you enjoy it.

1056
01:25:21,066 --> 01:25:24,820
They get so nice
right before they kill ya.

1057
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:01,063
Hello, Cindy.

1058
01:26:02,732 --> 01:26:05,192
How's that steak?

1059
01:26:05,317 --> 01:26:07,778
Fine... what I had of it.

1060
01:26:10,072 --> 01:26:13,909
Cindy, if you want me,
remember I'm just down the hall.

1061
01:26:13,993 --> 01:26:18,705
Well, right now I feel like I got
everything and everybody I need.

1062
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:24,836
Oh, they sent these over
from Bridgeland.

1063
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,589
They thought
you should have 'em.

1064
01:26:34,137 --> 01:26:36,431
Thank you.

1065
01:27:02,456 --> 01:27:04,750
Miss Liggett?

1066
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:08,629
Dr Forrester would like
to see your arms.

1067
01:27:18,763 --> 01:27:21,599
This is hard for everyone.

1068
01:27:21,683 --> 01:27:24,769
We're going to get through
this together.

1069
01:27:26,312 --> 01:27:28,356
- Would you like a sedative?
- No.

1070
01:27:28,481 --> 01:27:32,860
- It's quite common.
- I'm not spendin' my last hour like that.

1071
01:27:32,944 --> 01:27:37,156
- Well, if you change your mind...
- I won't.

1072
01:27:39,325 --> 01:27:42,328
We'll be back
in about five minutes.

1073
01:27:50,836 --> 01:27:53,046
Bill, come here for a minute.

1074
01:27:57,801 --> 01:27:59,928
Now, listen to me.

1075
01:28:00,053 --> 01:28:03,056
We'll always be
brother and sister.

1076
01:28:03,139 --> 01:28:08,186
Nothing can ever
change that. Okay?

1077
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:13,358
You're in my heart.

1078
01:28:13,483 --> 01:28:16,986
You know that? Hmm?

1079
01:28:23,117 --> 01:28:25,661
Now, you go on, okay?

1080
01:28:30,416 --> 01:28:34,169
- Well... - Look.
- Our timing wasn't exactly the best,
- was it?

1081
01:29:20,089 --> 01:29:22,716
Cindy?

1082
01:31:57,032 --> 01:32:00,952
"I have been directed
at 12.01 a. M...

1083
01:32:01,077 --> 01:32:03,288
"by the Superintendent of Prisons...

1084
01:32:03,413 --> 01:32:07,542
"to cause the sentence of death
to be executed on Cindy Leanne Liggett...

1085
01:32:07,625 --> 01:32:11,838
"by intravenous injection
of a substance or substances...

1086
01:32:11,921 --> 01:32:17,510
"in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause
the death of said Cindy Leanne Liggett...

1087
01:32:17,593 --> 01:32:22,223
and until the said
Cindy Leanne Liggett is dead."

1088
01:32:43,827 --> 01:32:45,954
Warden?

1089
01:32:51,292 --> 01:32:54,129
Yes?

1090
01:32:56,923 --> 01:32:59,801
Yes. Stand down.
Stand down!

1091
01:33:30,205 --> 01:33:32,499
- Calm down. Calm down. It's over! It's over.
- Stop it! Stop it!

1092
01:33:32,624 --> 01:33:36,670
- You've been saved. It's over.
- Stop it! No!

1093
01:33:36,753 --> 01:33:39,214
Cindy. Cindy.

1094
01:33:39,297 --> 01:33:42,383
You're saved. You're saved.
It's over. It's over.

1095
01:33:42,467 --> 01:33:45,470
It's over. It's okay.

1096
01:33:45,553 --> 01:33:50,016
Shh. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

1097
01:33:50,099 --> 01:33:52,560
In a surprise announcement,
Deputy Warden Marvin Heinrich...

1098
01:33:52,643 --> 01:33:56,397
here at Men's State Corrections informed
us just moments ago that the execution...

1099
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,734
of Cindy Liggett scheduled for
12.00 midnight six minutes ago...

1100
01:33:59,859 --> 01:34:03,612
was abruptly cancelled three minutes
before it was to have been carried out.

1101
01:34:03,696 --> 01:34:06,407
We are told Federal District
Court Judge Byron Gorman...

1102
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:11,036
issued the stay of execution based on
a petition from Miss Liggett's attorneys.

1103
01:34:11,119 --> 01:34:14,122
We have no idea on whether or when
the State will appeal this ruling.

1104
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:16,917
You can see here we have
protestors on both sides.

1105
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,795
We will follow this big story throughout
the night. This is Peter Bellows...

1106
01:34:28,553 --> 01:34:31,097
We stopped 'em.

1107
01:34:31,181 --> 01:34:34,350
- I can't take any more.
- No, no, come on. You hold on.

1108
01:34:34,475 --> 01:34:37,562
You hold onto me. I'm right
here for you. Come on.

1109
01:34:40,398 --> 01:34:42,358
I saw you.

1110
01:34:43,943 --> 01:34:46,237
I could feel
your eyes on me.

1111
01:34:46,362 --> 01:34:48,656
I know.

1112
01:34:48,781 --> 01:34:51,075
I wasn't scared.

1113
01:34:56,914 --> 01:35:00,834
- Good evening.
- Ah, gentlemen, I think you know
District Attorney Rusk.

1114
01:35:00,918 --> 01:35:03,754
- Pete, sorry to bring you out so late.
- Good to see you, Judge.

1115
01:35:03,879 --> 01:35:06,798
Your Honours, any questions
you might have...

1116
01:35:06,882 --> 01:35:10,802
any information you need,
I brought the files for each of you.

1117
01:35:10,927 --> 01:35:12,804
Thank you.

1118
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:58,306
So that is their decision?

1119
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:01,267
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

1120
01:36:07,315 --> 01:36:09,442
Good night.

1121
01:36:20,703 --> 01:36:25,833
Cindy, a special panel
of Federal Court of Appeals...

1122
01:36:25,916 --> 01:36:27,960
- was convened a short while ago.
- Oh, no.

1123
01:36:28,043 --> 01:36:32,422
The stay of execution has been lifted.
We've been ordered to proceed.

1124
01:36:32,548 --> 01:36:35,634
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?
What, they couldn't wait?

1125
01:36:35,759 --> 01:36:40,055
- This is...
- Let it go! Please.

1126
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:44,100
You have got
to let me go now.

1127
01:36:44,226 --> 01:36:46,186
Yes.

1128
01:36:51,858 --> 01:36:54,527
Don't take your eyes off me.

1129
01:38:50,723 --> 01:38:56,228
<i>...built by Shah Jahan
in 1631 to 1653...</i>

1130
01:38:56,353 --> 01:39:00,023
<i>in the memory of his
beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal.</i>

1131
01:39:00,148 --> 01:39:04,528
<i>And Mumtaz Mahal means "the beautiful
ornament of the palace."</i>

1132
01:39:04,611 --> 01:39:08,031
<i>And she was so beautiful
that Shah Jahan...</i>

1133
01:39:08,156 --> 01:39:10,700
<i>and Shah Jahan
so loved his queen...</i>

1134
01:39:10,784 --> 01:39:14,037
<i>that he commissioned this
building to be as beautiful...</i>

1135
01:39:14,162 --> 01:39:18,541
<i>and inspiring
and graceful as she was...</i>

1136
01:39:18,666 --> 01:39:22,587
<i>that he made in soul
of his love and her beauty.</i>

1137
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:25,381
# Darling
Don't you understand

1138
01:39:25,464 --> 01:39:27,925
# I feel so ill at ease

1139
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:30,928
# The room is full of silence

1140
01:39:31,011 --> 01:39:33,848
# And it's getting hard to breathe

1141
01:39:33,973 --> 01:39:37,309
# Take this gilded cage of pain

1142
01:39:37,393 --> 01:39:39,603
# And set me free

1143
01:39:39,728 --> 01:39:43,649
# Take this overcoat of shame

1144
01:39:43,732 --> 01:39:48,862
# It never did belong to me

1145
01:40:00,999 --> 01:40:05,878
# It never did belong to me

1146
01:40:08,881 --> 01:40:11,175
# I need to go outside

1147
01:40:11,259 --> 01:40:13,970
# I need to leave the smoke

1148
01:40:14,053 --> 01:40:16,722
# 'Cause I can't go on living

1149
01:40:16,806 --> 01:40:19,642
# In the same sick joke

1150
01:40:19,725 --> 01:40:22,645
# It seems our lives have taken on

1151
01:40:22,728 --> 01:40:25,564
# A different kind of twist.

1152
01:40:25,689 --> 01:40:29,026
# Now that you have given me

1153
01:40:29,151 --> 01:40:31,904
# The perfect gift

1154
01:40:46,835 --> 01:40:52,423
# You have given me the gift

1155
01:40:55,593 --> 01:40:58,679
# For we have fallen

1156
01:40:58,763 --> 01:41:03,017
# From our shelves

1157
01:41:07,062 --> 01:41:09,607
# To face the truth

1158
01:41:09,732 --> 01:41:14,695
# About ourselves

1159
01:41:18,615 --> 01:41:22,035
# And we have tumbled

1160
01:41:22,119 --> 01:41:26,832
# From our tree

1161
01:41:31,461 --> 01:41:39,177
# Tumbled from our tree

1162
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:46,601
# And I can almost

1163
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:51,772
# I can almost hear
the rain fallin

1164
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:58,070
# Don't you know it feels so good

1165
01:41:58,153 --> 01:42:00,447
# It feels so good

1166
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:09,831
# So let's go out
into the rain again

1167
01:42:18,131 --> 01:42:22,177
# Just like we said
we always would
