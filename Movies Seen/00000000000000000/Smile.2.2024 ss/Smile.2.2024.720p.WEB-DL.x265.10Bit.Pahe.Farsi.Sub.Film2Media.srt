1
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,647
Okay.

2
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,447
-Hey, what the fuck? Hey, hey.
-Easy. Don't move.

3
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,326
You're making
big mistake, you know that?

4
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,410
Shut the fuck up.

5
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,954
-Let's go.
-Fuck.

6
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,918
Get the door. Shut the fuck up.

7
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,838
-Watch the fucking jacket, man. It's new.
-Shut the fuck up!

8
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,100
Listen to me.
You alert your brother

9
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,936
and I shoot you in the back of the
head, you understand me?

10
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,438
Okay. You're the boss.

11
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,150
Slow.

12
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,825
Yo, yo, yo!

13
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,829
You remember
my pumpkin frappé, huh?

14
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,793
Don't! Don't.

15
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,296
Touch it and he's
fucking dead. Hands up!

16
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,967
Jesus Christ, you dumb motherfucker.
Do you know who we are?

17
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,511
Yeah, I know who you
fucking are. Last January,

18
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,139
the two of you shot an
innocent mother and a kid.

19
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,057
Killed 'em. In Newark.

20
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:07,270
Oh, yeah? Says who?
Who the fuck are you, huh?

21
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,734
I brought something
to give you.

22
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,943
Uh-huh?

23
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,447
But you have to watch
what I'm doing.

24
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,700
You watching?

25
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,079
Oh! No!

26
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,708
No! No!

27
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,598
Oh, shit. No, no, no.

28
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,850
No, no, no. Fuck!

29
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,936
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

30
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,772
No, don't die. Don't die, don't die!

31
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,191
Fuck! Fuck. Look at me.

32
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,527
Look at me, you motherfucker,
you can't die! You can't die!

33
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,446
It needs somebody
to fucking pass to.

34
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,782
If you die, it won't
fucking work. Look at me!

35
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:04,118
Stay alive, you piece of shit.
Stay alive, you piece of shit!

36
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,880
Oh, G-- No.

37
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,008
Oh, no.

38
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,805
Oh, no.

39
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,395
Fuck. Fuck.

40
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,105
Fuck!

41
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,067
Now it has no one
to pass to, fuck!

42
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,154
Fuck. Fuck.

43
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,364
No, no, no!

44
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,241
-Who the fuck are you?
-No one.

45
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,910
-Who the fuck are you?
-I'm Lewis.

46
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,746
-I'm no one. I'm no one. I'm literally no one.
-What the fuck you doing here?

47
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,290
-Don't shoot me.
-Answer me!

48
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,083
What the fuck
are you doing here?

49
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,835
I just buy from them, okay?

50
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,337
I fucking hate those guys.
I hate them, too!

51
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,714
I fucking hate them,
especially him!

52
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,465
Please, don't shoot me.

53
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,220
I didn't know
anybody else was here.

54
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,181
Okay, fuck it.

55
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,476
I didn't fucking know
anybody else was here!

56
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,521
I fucked this whole thing up.

57
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,441
I fucked this whole thing up
and I'm sorry.

58
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,610
This wasn't meant for you.

59
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,945
What?

60
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,697
This wasn't meant for you.

61
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,240
What wasn't meant for me?

62
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,162
-I'm sorry.
-What? What are you-- Fuck.

63
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,122
What are you sorry for?

64
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,917
Fuck.

65
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,171
-I'm sorry.
-What?

66
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,636
Yo,

67
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,472
who the fuck is that?

68
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,849
Oh, shit.

69
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,768
Ah!

70
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,353
Fuck!

71
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,439
Who has the goddamned key?

72
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,362
Come on! Fuck!

73
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,416
-No, no, no, no, don't shoot!
-Shit.

74
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,087
-Fuck! Alexi and Yev are fucking dead!
-Oh, fuck.

75
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,465
Get that piece of shit!

76
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,801
Open it!

77
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,679
Break the fucking door down!

78
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,598
Break it! Break it!

79
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,227
Go! Go!

80
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,022
Move! Move!

81
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,983
Shoot the motherfucker!

82
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,659
Problem solved.

83
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,976
Thank you, everybody.
Now, nearly one year ago,

84
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,730
singer/songwriter
and pop superstar Skye Riley

85
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:46,067
was fighting for her life after
being injured in a car accident.

86
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,904
An accident that also
tragically took the life

87
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,614
of actor Paul Hudson.

88
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,116
Today, for her first
public interview

89
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,409
since the accident,

90
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,036
ladies and gentlemen,

91
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,121
the one and only Skye Riley.

92
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,967
Oh, my God, Drew!

93
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,178
Thank you so much
for having me.

94
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,848
So happy to be doing this
with you.

95
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,018
I mean, I have got to say that
you look incredible in person.

96
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,312
-Oh, my gosh. As do you.
-Your hair-- I'm obsessed.

97
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,940
Oh, my God. My hair. I was
just trying something new.

98
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,109
-I'm not sure if I'm pulling it off.
-Um, I-- What do we think?

99
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,111
Oh, my God.

100
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,946
Well, I think
you have your answer.

101
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,407
-Now you've announced new tour dates...
-Yes.

102
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,618
...actually kicking off
right here in New York City

103
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,538
next week. Is this
an emotional comeback?

104
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,666
Yes, a lot of different emotions,
you know, with this one.

105
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,003
-A year ago, you had just won a Grammy.
-Mm-hmm.

106
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,756
-You were in the middle of a big world tour.
-Mm.

107
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,759
And then you hit
this rough patch.

108
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,928
"Rough patch" might
be generous.

109
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,681
I was wondering
if you could share anything

110
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,766
from that period of your life.

111
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,978
I was dealing with
a lot of stress and pressure

112
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,688
from the demands of the tour.

113
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,150
And I should have
asked for help, but

114
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,820
instead I drowned it all out
with...

115
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:17,325
drugs and alcohol
and a lot of bad decisions.

116
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,827
And I let myself get
completely out of control.

117
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,913
And actually, I want to
take this opportunity

118
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,583
to apologize to my fans,

119
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,503
my loved ones, my team.

120
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,882
Everyone who was counting on me
and supporting me.

121
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,385
I let you all down and...

122
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,596
I promise

123
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,973
that will never
happen again.

124
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,059
So, thank you.

125
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,480
You were in the hospital.
When you got out,

126
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,567
what has the time been like
between then and now?

127
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,241
I spent a lot of time
looking inward.

128
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,622
Relearning how to
appreciate life sober.

129
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,917
And I'm...

130
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,461
I'm just so grateful
for this second chance,

131
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,672
and I don't want to waste it.

132
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,765
Car's waiting right
outside by the curb.

133
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,809
There's a bit of a crowd.

134
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,113
Skye!

135
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,960
-My name is Ashley.
-So nice to meet you.

136
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,139
That went really well.

137
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,349
-You were perfectly graceful.
-Yeah.

138
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,518
Skye, you've got
Instagram and TikTok

139
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,312
seriously blowing up right now.

140
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,567
You're trending number two on Twitter.
I mean, you should really be so proud...

141
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,113
Good.

142
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,288
Eyes up!

143
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,686
Are you okay?

144
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,313
What happened?

145
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,482
Are you hurt?

146
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,150
Yep, I'm fine.

147
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,403
I'm fine. I think
I just took a weird step.

148
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,823
Let's take a break, everyone.
Can we get some ice?

149
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,282
Anton, I'm fine. I'm fine.

150
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,660
-Skye.
-Can we please just go again?

151
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,036
-I want to get it right, okay?
-Okay.

152
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,246
-Let's go.
-Let's go again.

153
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,831
-Line up!
-Rewind it.

154
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,749
-Yep.
-Back to one.

155
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,293
Music.

156
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,674
Shit!

157
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,093
One second!

158
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,852
Yeah, come in.

159
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,313
Hey.

160
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,606
You okay?

161
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,650
-You ready to go?
-Yeah, Mom.

162
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,277
I just need a minute.

163
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,948
You should feel really good
about today.

164
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,284
I know.

165
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,287
I do.

166
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,788
Good.

167
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,376
We're ready whenever you are.

168
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,261
Final rehearsal is
confirmed for Wednesday.

169
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,180
So we'll be at the venue
first thing in the morning.

170
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,974
You have a fitting,
photo shoot,

171
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,102
then stage walk-throughs,
then a fan meet-and-greet.

172
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,021
Please go straight to bed
when you get home.

173
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,856
It's going to be a long day.

174
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,611
Oh, and reminder:
Darius gets in tomorrow.

175
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,947
He's gonna be here for opening.

176
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,908
I want him
to feel the love, please.

177
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,327
The label is advancing
a lot of money on this tour.

178
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,537
Have I ever not been
good with Darius?

179
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,499
Darius adores you,
obviously.

180
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,293
Just want you to remember
who's paying the bill.

181
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,018
Hey, straight to bed, Skye.

182
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,228
Good night.

183
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,232
Miss Riley.

184
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,682
Hey.

185
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,522
What the fuck, Lewis?

186
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,650
-What do you want from me?
-Vicodin! Just Vicodin.

187
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,112
-Just for pain, same as last time.
-Fuck that!

188
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,865
Skye Riley isn't just gonna
suddenly show up here.

189
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,951
Your text
said to come over.

190
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,286
-What?
-What?

191
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,122
-What? What?
-What? What?

192
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,171
I don't--
I don't remember texting that.

193
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,091
How come I don't remember
texting that?

194
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,676
-Oh, fuck.
-I don't know.

195
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,595
Just get the fuck off me.

196
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,679
Get the fuck off me!

197
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,223
Oh. Oh, shit.

198
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,684
Holy shit, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

199
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:47,066
I am having the worst week.

200
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,824
The worst!

201
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,829
Lewis... what was
with the sword?

202
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,999
Uh, what? What sword?

203
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,709
Oh, that sword.

204
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,129
I feel--
I'm so sorry about that.

205
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,049
I cannot be too careful
right now. Okay?

206
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:16,428
I am in the middle of some
genuinely fucking freaky shit.

207
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,764
Okay? I'm talking like
fucking scary,

208
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,016
fucking haunted-house shit,
you know?

209
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,604
Yo...

210
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,983
do you believe in, like,
weird stuff?

211
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,404
-Yeah, I'm gonna go.
-What? No, no, no!

212
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,991
No, please stay. Please stay.
What am I doing? What am I doing?

213
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,953
Skye fucking Riley's here and Lewis
is being fucking crazy?

214
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,706
I am so stoked to see you.
I am pumped. Come on. Come in.

215
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,252
I will chill. Be my guest.
Please take a seat.

216
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,921
Make yourself at home.
I'm sorry about the mess.

217
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,006
You said you, uh, wanted...
what was it?

218
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,050
You want Vicodin? Right?

219
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,261
-Yeah.
-I got you. I got you.

220
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,179
Want anything else?
I got banger ketamine.

221
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,724
I got really good
fucking Molly. I got some...

222
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,228
-I don't know what this is.
-No, dude, just the Vicodin for my back.

223
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,023
Oh, right, your back.

224
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,860
Ouch. That sucks.
I hate that.

225
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,612
Okay, well, you chill,
and I'll be right back.

226
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,866
You chill and I'll be
right back, okay?

227
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,826
I'll be right back. Mmm.

228
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,120
-Oh, my God.
-You smell good.

229
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,373
I missed you!
Skye fuckin' Riley, dude!

230
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,501
Vicodin. Vicodin.
What the fuck are you thinking?

231
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,211
...could still have

232
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,046
some freezing
or subfreezing temps...

233
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,590
What the fuck?

234
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,092
Ah, shit.

235
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,018
Here's how we
see everything coming together.

236
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,396
The cold air stays in place.

237
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:53,400
-...north of the area...
-Freddy. It's some snow.

238
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,320
I mean, this is not a huge
storm. It's not, you know,

239
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,865
an ultra-dangerous situation out there.
It's our first snow of the season.

240
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:04,203
Over in pop culture news,
singer/songwriter Skye Riley is back,

241
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,456
nearly one year after she was
hospitalized in a car crash

242
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,000
that tragically killed
actor Paul Hudson.

243
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,669
Hudson had been driving the vehicle
after the high-profile couple

244
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:16,048
had left a private party where both
were reportedly seen intoxicated.

245
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,050
Yeah, you know,
that accident occurred

246
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,552
while Riley was in the middle
of a blockbuster tour

247
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,138
and at the time,
there was speculation

248
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,724
surrounding
Riley's substance abuse.

249
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,726
Especially after candid photos
of the singer

250
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,229
went viral just two weeks
before the acc--

251
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,992
Hey, uh, Lewis, I kind of have a
really early morning tomorrow, so...

252
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,336
Lewis!

253
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,383
This fucking guy.

254
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,971
Lewis, what the fuck, man?

255
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,818
Lewis!

256
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,990
Swear to God, if you're
fucking with me, dude...

257
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,588
-Jesus!
-Skye!

258
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,132
What the fuck
is wrong with you, Lewis?

259
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,466
Where the fuck
did you come from?

260
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,843
What?

261
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,973
-Oh! No! No! No!
-What? What is it?

262
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,560
-Get the fuck away from me! Get the fuck away from me!
-What the fuck is happening?

263
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,979
No! No!

264
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,237
Oh, shit.

265
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,531
Lewis? Lewis? Fuck!

266
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,576
What do I do, Lewis, do I call
an ambulance? Fuck. Shit.

267
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,454
Lewis, Lewis! Lewis?
What the fuck?

268
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,539
Lewis?

269
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,207
Fuck. Shit!

270
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,668
Shit.
You fuckin' OD'ing, man?

271
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,004
Shit! Fuck!

272
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,467
Lewis?

273
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,252
Okay.

274
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,632
Oh, fuck.

275
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,343
Oh, shit.

276
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,304
Oh, fuck.

277
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,768
Oh, my God.

278
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,183
What do you think, Skye?

279
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,477
Skye?

280
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,771
Hey! Are you paying attention?

281
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,565
What?

282
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,692
Yeah.

283
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,527
This stuff is important.

284
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,280
-I'm listening.
-Are you okay?

285
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,574
-You look exhausted.
-Wow, thanks, Mom.

286
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,118
It's really important for you

287
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,869
to stay on top of
your sleep schedule.

288
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,122
-Joshua, grab her a water.
-I'm fine.

289
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,541
I want you to have someone around
to help out with things again.

290
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,751
Have you talked to Gemma
about coming on tour?

291
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,753
Gemma is not gonna want
to hear from me, Mom.

292
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,089
-Have you reached out?
-No, not exactly.

293
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,466
She's your best friend. I'm
sure she'd be willing to forgive

294
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,261
whatever it was that happened
between the two of you.

295
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,306
-You're a completely different person than you were a year ago.
-Can you please leave it alone?

296
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,935
All I'm saying is real friends
are hard to come by.

297
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,438
And it was really good for you
when Gemma was around.

298
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,232
I'd be more than happy to help
out with any personal stuff

299
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,568
Skye might need.
Do you want--

300
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,903
-I don't want that.
-You need to stay hydrated.

301
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,363
Will you just stop?

302
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,365
Okay.

303
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,326
No, sorry, not you.

304
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,037
Come in!

305
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,499
Hi, Darius!

306
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,169
Just wanted to say hi
to my favorite rock star.

307
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,296
I'd get up and hug you
but I'm trapped.

308
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,964
-All good. I'll come to you.
-Look at you.

309
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,215
-Hey, Elizabeth.
-Hi.

310
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,510
-Hey, Darius.
-Hey, man.

311
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,012
Starting to get
exciting around here.

312
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,389
Oh, my God. I am so excited.

313
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,267
-I have a little favor to ask of you.
-Sure.

314
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,604
Tomorrow night, there's a fundraising
dinner for Music Inspires Hope.

315
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,856
It's a foundation
for underprivileged youth.

316
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,484
-Interscope Records has done a lot of work with the foundation.
-Wow.

317
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,320
I know this is last-minute,
but I was hoping you'd be willing

318
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,448
-to be a special presenter.
-Oh!

319
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:46,201
I know you've got a lot on your
plate, but there's no arrival carpet,

320
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,578
no press. None of that
annoying stuff.

321
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,538
-It's purely about the kids.
-Yes.

322
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,249
Your remarks will be prewritten.
All you have to do is smile

323
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,793
and read from the teleprompter.

324
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,838
How could I say no?

325
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,465
Number three.

326
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,008
Let's start with a 70.

327
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,512
All right, Skye.

328
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,266
Loving this.

329
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,645
Can you give me more?

330
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,232
Even more.

331
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,444
More.

332
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,086
"Hey..."

333
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,076
What the fuck?

334
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,703
Fuck this guy, man.

335
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,997
Come on.

336
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,456
Get your shit together.

337
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,458
Get your shit together.

338
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,507
Jesus!

339
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,300
Can you knock?

340
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,469
We were knocking.
You weren't answering.

341
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,180
Why were you screaming?

342
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,684
-I-- I saw a spider.
-Sorry, there's a spider in here?

343
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:44,355
Tanya says there's some wardrobe
issue that you needed me to look at.

344
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,275
Yeah, I'm not wearing this one.

345
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,444
I love it. What--
What's wrong with it?

346
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,070
Can you show her, please?

347
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,493
-The lighting's gonna show right through this onstage.
-And?

348
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,996
I'm not trying to show everyone
how fucking disgusting I am.

349
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,708
I think you're overreacting
a little bit.

350
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,586
Yeah, Skye, you know what?
I think your scar is badass.

351
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,296
-It is badass.
-Seriously.

352
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,173
This is honestly
one of your best looks.

353
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,383
I'm not wearing it.

354
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,738
-There you go.
-Thank you, thank you!

355
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,990
All right,
let's grab that photo, yeah?

356
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,495
Can we do matching poses?

357
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,996
Of course.
What are you thinking?

358
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,082
Um, like...

359
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,626
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

360
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,795
Twinsies. Super cute.

361
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:33,172
Thank you.
Thanks for coming out.

362
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,507
-Thank you.
-Who's next?

363
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,343
"Too Much For One Heart"
got me through

364
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,595
literally the worst breakup
of my life.

365
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,014
I feel like
you're my spirit animal and...

366
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,558
Oh, my gosh,
can I give you a hug?

367
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,893
Oh, my gosh, yes! Aw.

368
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,188
Skye, you got to check out
my SoundCloud.

369
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,941
-Oh.
-Like, who does your production?

370
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,901
All right, dawg,
let's grab that photo now.

371
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,487
-Nice.
-Oh, can we do one more vertical?

372
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,200
Oh, my God, that's...

373
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,410
That was amazing.

374
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:09,208
Could you sign,
"For Alfredo..."

375
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,460
Alfredo...

376
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,672
"...love...

377
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,632
Skye."

378
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,385
Yeah.

379
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,144
There you go.

380
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,479
All right.
Let's take that photo.

381
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,067
I'm a really big fan.

382
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,069
Oh, thanks for coming out.

383
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,781
I can see you're sad
on the inside.

384
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,660
-Sorry, what?
-I could make you happy.

385
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,538
-We would be so happy together.
-Okay, I think we got it.

386
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,082
And you're so beautiful.

387
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,753
You have the most
amazing... skin!

388
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,755
-Dude, get the fuck off me!
-Amazing skin!

389
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,465
Skye, I love you!

390
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,884
I love you, Skye! Skye!

391
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:03,137
Skye, I love you!

392
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,060
Hey, folks, just give us,
like... one quick sec.

393
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,235
You okay?

394
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,448
You need to take a break?

395
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,287
-You sure?
-Let's just get through this.

396
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,297
Hey, Skye.

397
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,591
-Everything gravy?
-Yeah, fine.

398
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,427
All right, who's next?

399
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,066
Hi. What's your name?

400
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,073
That's-- That's a pretty
cool shirt you got.

401
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,741
You want me to sign it?

402
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,677
Okay.
How about a photo?

403
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,515
Yeah. So sweet.

404
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,517
All right, one, two...

405
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,227
Cheese.

406
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,396
All right.

407
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,023
Now that's a good one.

408
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,295
It's Gemma. Leave it.

409
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,881
Hi!

410
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,841
Hi, it's me. Um...

411
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,969
I was just thinking
about you and, uh...

412
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,846
how much...

413
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,351
how much I want to apologize
about everything.

414
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:02,775
Anyway, I don't know if
you want to talk to me. Um...

415
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,569
Will you call me? Please?

416
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,947
I miss you.

417
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,243
Shit.

418
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,461
-Hey!
-Hey.

419
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,717
How have you been?

420
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,094
Pretty good, I guess.

421
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,179
Surprised to hear from you.

422
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,850
I know. Sorry I just
called out of the blue.

423
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,018
No, it's okay.

424
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,395
It's cool.

425
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,648
Actually, um...

426
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,861
I kind of feel...

427
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,571
...really, uh,
overwhelmed at the moment.

428
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,656
I know it's not...

429
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,367
I know it's not your problem
and it's probably really...

430
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:57,621
shitty of me to even
be calling you. But, uh...

431
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,666
I don't really have anyone
I can talk to right now.

432
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,668
What's going on?

433
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,089
-Any chance you'd want to come over?
-What, like right now?

434
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,634
Yeah, unless you're, you know,
busy or something.

435
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,556
No, I...

436
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:19,727
Yeah, no, I can come over.
Give me, like, 45.

437
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,438
-Perfect.
-Okay, cool. See you soon.

438
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,523
See you then. Bye.

439
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,576
Hello?

440
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,260
Jesus, fuck!

441
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,682
What is happening right now?

442
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,488
Is someone else here?

443
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,177
Skye, what's going on?

444
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,860
What the fuck?

445
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,862
Right. So...

446
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,280
I'm confused.

447
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,784
Oh. Hi to you, too.

448
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,161
-How did you get here so fast?
-Wait.

449
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,914
Why? What do you mean?
You called me like an hour ago.

450
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,502
An hour?

451
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,804
How you doing, Skye?

452
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,309
I, um...

453
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,646
...didn't sleep
last night, and I...

454
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:41,149
think I had some sort of crazy
lucid-nightmare-fever-dream,

455
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,235
and it scared the...

456
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,362
...scared the crap out of me.

457
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,450
Um... thirsty?

458
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:59,710
This therapist from my recovery
program she suggested that...

459
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:03,338
anytime I feel overwhelmed by
the urge to use or get drunk

460
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,173
that I should stop
whatever I'm doing

461
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,259
and drink
a full glass of water.

462
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,344
It's supposed to be some
sort of form of acknowledgement

463
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,430
for what I can
and can't control.

464
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,558
Well, it's good to see you.

465
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,897
Jesus, Gemma.

466
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,027
I'm so sorry.

467
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,322
I was a ginormous
fucking asshole.

468
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,619
-I owe you such a huge apology.
-You really do.

469
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,455
I don't know why it's taken you
like a year to tell me that.

470
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:39,750
I know. I'm sorry. I...
I did want to call sooner.

471
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,376
I just didn't know
if you would...

472
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,211
forgive me
or if you hated me

473
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,546
and never wanted
to hear from me again.

474
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,423
Okay, apology accepted.

475
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,052
Oh, God.

476
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,513
Fucking love you.
You know that, right?

477
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,350
-Okay.
-Seriously. You're my ride or die.

478
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,769
Okay! Before we start
sucking each other's dicks,

479
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,646
what's going on?
Why are you being so weird?

480
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,106
I don't know.

481
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,613
I don't know.

482
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,118
I'm such a mess.

483
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,503
Just how messy
are we talking?

484
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,466
Something really bad happened.

485
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,601
You remember Lewis Fregoli?

486
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,228
Lewis Fregoli from high school?

487
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,605
He died in front of me
yesterday.

488
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,941
-What?
-I went to his apartment to buy Vicodin.

489
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,360
-Skye, what the fuck?
-Just for pain, I swear.

490
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,612
Gemma, I haven't
touched alcohol

491
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,197
or coke in a year,
I promise.

492
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,740
But my back
is still fucked.

493
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,784
Since I have a history
of substance abuse,

494
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,869
no one will prescribe me
anything stronger than Tylenol.

495
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,122
You think that maybe
there's a reason for that?

496
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,416
Well, I don't know
what else to do.

497
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,961
Everyone's counting on me.

498
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,505
Okay, just wait.
All right. Go back.

499
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,589
What happened to Lewis?

500
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,174
When I showed up,

501
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,385
there was something off
about him.

502
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,679
Like he was scared
of something.

503
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,974
He started... freaking out

504
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,727
and screaming,
like screaming screaming.

505
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,353
And then he...

506
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:28,525
grabbed this metal gym weight
from like a bench press...

507
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,279
and then he like...

508
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,657
just smashed
his whole face in with it.

509
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,951
What?

510
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,537
-Ew. Oh, my God. What?
-I didn't know what to do.

511
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,582
I just freaked
and ran out, and...

512
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:47,502
-Gemma, I just left him there.
-Does anyone else know about this?

513
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:51,506
-No. Should I tell the police?
-No! Skye, no, listen to me.

514
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,633
If anyone connects you
to a drug dealer's death,

515
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,678
the story will take over your
life and fuck up everything.

516
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:01,099
-And it's not your fault.
-I keep seeing his face everywhere.

517
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,769
-I just feel so fucked up!
-Yeah, no wonder.

518
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,937
I can't imagine how scary
that must have been.

519
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,815
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

520
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,734
I'm so sorry I'm laying
all of this on you.

521
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,110
I just...

522
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,991
I don't know, I just don't
really have anyone to talk to.

523
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,747
You want me to spend the night?

524
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,709
Really? Would you?

525
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,753
I mean, I'm already here.

526
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,841
Oh, God,
I missed you, bitch.

527
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,235
Help me!

528
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,197
Please someone help!

529
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,070
Hey, are you okay?

530
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,655
Yeah.

531
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,053
Gemma, I'm so sorry
about everything.

532
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:30,016
I know, it's okay.
I already forgave you.

533
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:41,027
I don't know why
I destroy everything.

534
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:49,619
I feel like my brain is...

535
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,000
this really fucked-up place,

536
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,752
full of all this

537
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,588
chaos and noise.

538
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,549
And I'm trapped there

539
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,094
all alone...

540
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,179
...in this darkness.

541
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,640
And I just want
to quiet the noise,

542
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,392
but I don't know how.

543
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,148
It's because
you're a horrible person.

544
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,280
What did you say?

545
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,746
Gemma?

546
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,681
Gemma?

547
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:12,452
Oh, hey, you're up!

548
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,457
What the fuck is happening?

549
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,043
What do you mean?
I made matcha.

550
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,712
Matcha? What?

551
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,675
Wait, it's-- it's morning?
What time is it?

552
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,970
Fuck! Fuck, I'm so late!
Why didn't you wake me?

553
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,765
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
I don't have your schedule.

554
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:37,143
My mom is gonna
fucking kill me! Aw, shit.

555
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,903
-Can I help you or something?
-Will you come on tour?

556
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,906
-What?
-Come to rehearsal with me today.

557
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,617
Today? I can't. I have
a friend's thing later on.

558
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,995
What? What-- What friend?
Do you have to go?

559
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,831
Well, yeah,
I made a commitment.

560
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:01,084
Fuck. Well, then
can you start tomorrow?

561
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,670
I mean, I don't know. I sort of
feel like this is like a thing

562
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,047
we should have a conversation
about first.

563
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,928
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

564
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,888
There are a hundred people
waiting for just you.

565
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,890
I know! I know!

566
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,770
Hey, Elizabeth.

567
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,692
Look, talent's here.

568
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,402
Okay, talent's pulling in.

569
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:36,202
-Thought we said 8:30.
-I'm so sorry. It's my fault.

570
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,079
But I'm ready.
I'm ready, let's do this.

571
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:41,124
Sorry, everyone.
I'm here. I'm so sorry.

572
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,501
Sorry.

573
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,101
I need some water
for my daughter.

574
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,687
For my daughter,
I need some water.

575
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,272
I need a waiter
with some water.

576
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:05,732
I need a waiter
with some water.

577
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,486
Oh, fuck!

578
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,071
God!

579
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,118
Oh, my God! Fuck!

580
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:24,412
Oh, fuck, fuck!

581
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,623
Fuck!

582
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,834
Oh, God.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

583
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:33,880
Are you okay?

584
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,590
My leg!

585
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:38,301
-What happened? What's wrong?
-My--

586
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,143
Who was that?

587
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,270
One of you was out of place
and knocked me over!

588
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,356
Who was it?

589
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,358
Skye, I don't think
that's what happened.

590
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:56,194
Do not tell me
what I just experienced, Anton!

591
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,488
I'm not.

592
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:01,616
I'm just saying
that from where I was watching,

593
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,201
I didn't see anyone
out of place.

594
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,215
Skye!

595
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,330
-What happened?
-Where is Joshua?

596
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,416
Christ, what did you do?

597
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:35,835
Hey. Everything okay?
Can I get you anything?

598
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,503
What the fuck
is your problem, man?

599
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,924
-Sorry, what?
-Are you fucking with me?

600
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,927
-I have no idea what you're talking about, I swear.
-He trashed my dressing room!

601
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:48,473
-What? Wha-- No, I didn't!
-I fucking saw you, Joshua!

602
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:51,225
Skye! I... Skye.
I would never,

603
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,561
ever do something
like that to you, okay?

604
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,855
Like, come on.
What reason would I have?

605
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,942
-Fuck you. Fuck you!
-Okay.

606
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:02,320
Fuck you! Fuck you, Joshua!

607
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,030
-Fuck you!
-All right. That's enough.

608
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,032
Mom, you need to believe me.
He did this!

609
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,451
-He fucking did this!
-You need to cool off.

610
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,369
You're not actually
taking his side?

611
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,538
I am on your side, okay? Always.

612
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,374
But Joshua has been
with me the entire day.

613
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,461
What? What are you
even talking about?

614
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:21,005
I don't even care what happened
in here, we'll get it fixed.

615
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:23,758
-I just need you to...
-...tell me the truth.

616
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,802
I'm gonna ask you something...

617
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,637
...and I want you
to be honest with me.

618
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,681
Skye? Are you using again?

619
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,016
What?

620
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:33,476
Nobody has to know.

621
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,812
You just have to
tell me the truth.

622
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:39,065
Oh, my God, no!
I am not using again, Mom.

623
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,442
You want me
to take a drug test?

624
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:43,569
Okay.

625
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,822
I believe you. Um...

626
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,575
What's going on?

627
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,036
I don't know! I don't know!
I just--

628
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:57,542
Fuck, I feel crazy all the time.
Everything's going wrong.

629
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:01,838
Nobody will fucking listen to me
and everyone fucking hates me.

630
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,507
Oh, come on, do you hear
yourself? Everybody loves you.

631
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:08,052
We're all here for you. We're
here because we believe in you.

632
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:10,429
We believe in this tour.

633
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,140
I think doing this tour
was a huge mistake. It's--

634
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:16,602
-It's too much. I'm not-- I'm not ready for it.
-Okay, you know what?

635
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,522
We're gonna, um, look at the
book tonight. Look at the dates,

636
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,941
carve out some time for you
to decompress before opening.

637
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,318
But right now
you need to pull it together

638
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,445
and get back out there.

639
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,031
Because we need to be on time
for Darius's foundation event.

640
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,659
Fuck, no. Mom, please
don't make me do that.

641
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:34,412
I can't get out on stage in front
of a bunch of people tonight.

642
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,330
-Skye.
-Mom, you're not--

643
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,708
Fuck, you're not
listening to me!

644
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,585
I am not in the headspace

645
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:42,712
to put on a fucking dress
and play dancing monkey

646
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:46,132
-in front of a room full of strangers!
-Darius is counting on you

647
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,050
to be there, okay?

648
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,844
You gave him your word.

649
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:52,763
You are a woman
who keeps her word.

650
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,266
You are not gonna cancel
on a commitment

651
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:57,143
to underprivileged youth

652
01:04:57,226 --> 01:05:00,104
right before launching a tour.

653
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:25,630
Music Inspires Hope
was founded on the idea

654
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,924
that no dream could be too big.

655
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:32,803
With the help and support
of everyone in this room

656
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,640
and from all of our donors
across the country,

657
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,725
the foundation has been able

658
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:41,562
to reach more families
this year than ever before.

659
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,315
Thanks to you,

660
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:47,026
more and more children
every day

661
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:51,489
are able to make
their wildest dreams a reality.

662
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:54,700
And now without further ado,

663
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:57,203
it is my great pleasure

664
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,205
-to introduce...
-Ten seconds.

665
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:02,833
...a wonderful young artist.
Ladies and gentlemen,

666
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:05,127
-please put your hands together...
-I'll take that.

667
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,172
...for Skye Riley.

668
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:18,891
Wow.

669
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,518
Thank you.

670
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,604
Thank you so much.

671
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:30,695
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

672
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,697
I'm Skye Riley,

673
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,281
and I'm here tonight to...

674
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:36,575
Uh...

675
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,958
I'm here tonight to...

676
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,751
Uh...

677
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,920
Oh, that's, uh...

678
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:58,347
So, how's everyone
doing tonight?

679
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,766
Hope you're all
enjoying the party.

680
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,561
Uh. Don't worry, though.
I'm sober.

681
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:05,062
So...

682
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:10,735
Um...

683
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:18,200
What can I say about
how music inspires hope?

684
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:19,744
Well,

685
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,204
music gave me
everything I ever wanted.

686
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:28,127
Then again, music did almost
kill me, so there's that.

687
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:31,005
Uh... Well, I--
I guess that's not fair.

688
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:33,007
Music didn't put
all those drugs up my nose,

689
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,091
I did.

690
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:39,555
Um...

691
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,977
I-- I think
I'm supposed to be up here

692
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:50,357
offering words of inspiration
and advice.

693
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,985
Well, when I think about
what I wish someone would have

694
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:56,530
told me when I was younger
and first getting started,

695
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,241
I suppose I'd say

696
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,912
this business is really hard.

697
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:07,708
And, uh, you'll spend years
of your life chasing success

698
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,377
you know, thinking that
when it comes,

699
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:14,423
it will magically fix,
you know, everything

700
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:18,094
that's bad and wrong about you.

701
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:20,930
And then you achieve success,
and you realize that it can't fix

702
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:23,682
the deeply broken person
that you have always been.

703
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,811
And now you can't escape

704
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,814
the miserable thing
that you've become,

705
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:31,357
and one day, you realize

706
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,983
how badly you wish you could

707
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,652
just trade it all just for

708
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:36,028
one fucking moment of happiness!

709
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:48,332
Oh.

710
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:49,875
Sorry about that. Uh...

711
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:57,424
What I meant to say is:

712
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:01,053
I hope the next generation
of young artists

713
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:04,431
finds themselves
truly inspired tonight.

714
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:06,976
I know I sure am.

715
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:12,273
And without any further ado,

716
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:14,692
I'd like to introduce
our next guest,

717
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:16,610
a very special person

718
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:19,280
who surely needs
no introduction:

719
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,031
Paul Hudson.

720
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:24,910
What?

721
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,122
Why does it say that?
That's not--

722
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:30,791
This-- No. Why did s--

723
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:33,919
This-- Why did--

724
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,423
What?

725
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:46,432
No.

726
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:49,727
No.

727
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,690
No.

728
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,108
No, stay away from me.

729
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,277
Stay away from me!

730
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:00,821
Paul's dead!

731
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:02,573
You're not Paul!

732
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:05,201
Stop smiling at me!

733
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:09,496
No, no.

734
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,835
I can hold it. No, no, stop.

735
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:28,802
Okay.

736
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:43,669
Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

737
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:14,199
Do you see it?

738
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:24,918
It just stares at me,

739
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:26,795
smiling.

740
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:31,216
Skye!

741
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:13,277
Thank you for agreeing to see--
Wait, what are you doing?

742
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,697
Sending a photo of you to my friend
in case you're some kind of creep.

743
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,365
What? I'm not a creep.

744
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:20,534
Yeah, that's what
every creep says.

745
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:26,164
Look, I realize
you're super famous,

746
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:29,209
and I invaded your
privacy. I apologize.

747
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:31,128
This is also
very weird for me.

748
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:32,671
-How do you know Lewis?
-I don't.

749
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:35,132
I-- I didn't.

750
01:16:35,215 --> 01:16:37,301
I was trying to
contact Lewis to warn him.

751
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:39,428
Tracked down his address
and went to his apartment.

752
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,763
The front door was unlocked,
and he was already dead inside.

753
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:44,474
I checked his phone, and you were
the last person he texted with.

754
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:47,644
W-What were you trying
to warn him about?

755
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:51,273
I'm aware that what I'm about to say
is going to sound completely insane,

756
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,692
but Lewis didn't kill himself.

757
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:58,238
He was systematically infected,
possessed and then murdered

758
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:00,949
by some kind
of metaphysical being.

759
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:03,243
What the fuck
are you talking about?

760
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:08,081
If it helps, you might call it
a-- a spirit or a demon.

761
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:11,001
Maybe. I have no clue
what this thing is!

762
01:17:11,084 --> 01:17:13,128
But it disguises itself

763
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:16,840
to look like people.
Like smiling people.

764
01:17:16,923 --> 01:17:19,760
But only the person that's
been infected by it can see it.

765
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:22,929
No, that's-- that's not real.
That's some supernatural bullshit.

766
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:25,390
But you've seen it,
haven't you?

767
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,517
That's why you're still
sitting here.

768
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,565
I--

769
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,442
I don't know.
I don't know what's happening.

770
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:37,778
I feel like I'm losing
my goddamn mind!

771
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:39,988
That's precisely what this thing does
to you. It's what it did to Lewis

772
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:42,407
while it was latched onto him.
It's like a parasite

773
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,368
that infects the host
through their mind.

774
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:47,120
In less than a week,
it drives the host insane.

775
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:49,873
It's like it feeds off
all the bad shit in their head,

776
01:17:49,956 --> 01:17:52,209
and then
once it's done feeding,

777
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:55,128
it forces the host to kill
themself in front of a witness.

778
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:57,631
And then that witness
becomes the new host.

779
01:17:57,714 --> 01:17:59,299
That's how you got it
from Lewis.

780
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:02,052
It was passed to Lewis
by a cop in Jersey.

781
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:03,679
That cop was the first one
I tried to contact,

782
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:05,639
but I guess he went
off the grid.

783
01:18:05,722 --> 01:18:07,391
That cop caught it
from some doctor, who got it

784
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:09,017
from a patient, who got it
from a college professor.

785
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,811
And the chain
keeps going back.

786
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:12,813
I've documented all of this.
I can show you.

787
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:14,231
Why do you even know
all of this?

788
01:18:14,314 --> 01:18:16,692
Because it killed my brother.

789
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:19,778
My brother was a host

790
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:22,906
eight people before you.

791
01:18:22,989 --> 01:18:25,117
He tried to tell me
what was happening to him.

792
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,993
But he made it hard
to trust him,

793
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:28,370
and the stuff he was saying

794
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:32,249
sounded certifiably crazy.

795
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:36,336
He begged me for help.
But I didn't listen.

796
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,755
And then a few days later...

797
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:40,465
...I got a call informing me

798
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,926
that he tore his own jaw off
with a crowbar.

799
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:51,351
-Well, have you gone to the police?
-And say what?

800
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,645
My brother's suicide
was actually caused

801
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:57,065
by some cosmic evil being
that no one else can see?

802
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,067
The police can't
stop this thing anyway.

803
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:01,069
So I'm just supposed to wait
until this thing kills me?

804
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,446
No, I want you

805
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:04,906
-to help me destroy it.
-How?

806
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:08,326
From what I can tell,
the chain stops

807
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:11,997
when an infected host dies
in some other way

808
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,124
outside of the being's control.

809
01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:17,252
My guess is that,
just like other parasites,

810
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:18,587
without a living host

811
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:20,297
it has no way to survive.

812
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,841
It ceases to exist.

813
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,551
So it only stops if--

814
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:26,219
if I die before it kills me?

815
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:28,138
Exactly. We need
to kill you first.

816
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:29,806
What?

817
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,684
Only technically. Look.

818
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:36,271
There are ways that we can
very safely stop your heart.

819
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:38,982
That'll deprive it
of a living host.

820
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:40,817
Once it goes,

821
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,903
I can resuscitate your heart
and bring you back.

822
01:19:42,986 --> 01:19:44,821
Are you
out of your fucking mind?

823
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:46,281
I know it seems extreme.

824
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:47,908
"Extreme"?
You're asking to kill me!

825
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:49,993
Whoa, hey. Just keep it down.

826
01:19:50,076 --> 01:19:52,120
I don't even know you.
I don't even know you!

827
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:54,289
My name is Morris.
I'm an ER nurse,

828
01:19:54,372 --> 01:19:56,458
and if we don't do this,
it's gonna kill you

829
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:58,668
like it killed Lewis
and infect another victim.

830
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:00,796
Look, I've already got
everything prepared.

831
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:03,089
We should just go now and
get rid of this thing tonight.

832
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:08,386
-I can't. I can't do this.
-You're nearly out of time!

833
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,014
This thing has been feeding
on you for three days already!

834
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:13,850
It's already taking control
of your brain, and pretty soon

835
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:16,228
you won't even realize
the ways it's manipulating you,

836
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:19,397
and then it'll be too late to stop it.
We have to go right now.

837
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,067
-Is that Skye Riley?
-Holy shit. Dude.

838
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,569
-That's Skye?
-It's Skye Riley!

839
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:27,656
-Would you do a quick TikTok with us?
-Skye Riley!

840
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:31,201
I watched that video where you knocked
down that old lady like fifty times!

841
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:32,953
That shit was so fucking funny.

842
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,040
Skye!

843
01:20:37,749 --> 01:20:39,376
Skye, can I get your autograph?

844
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:11,968
Fuck!

845
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,180
Fuck!

846
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:27,108
Fuck!

847
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:37,452
Fuck!

848
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:56,818
No! No!

849
01:25:56,901 --> 01:25:59,154
Don't! No!

850
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,412
No! No! No!

851
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:08,955
No!

852
01:26:16,045 --> 01:26:17,255
Get off!

853
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:26,532
What?

854
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:27,867
What?

855
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:29,244
-What?
-What?

856
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,664
Oh, Jesus Christ.

857
01:27:34,123 --> 01:27:36,459
Are you crying right now?

858
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:39,128
I'm-- I'm not crying.

859
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:40,964
Are you crying?

860
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,218
Hmm? Huh?

861
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:48,596
Hey! Hey, I'm fucking
talking to you!

862
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:54,978
Are you fucking kidding me?

863
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:56,396
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

864
01:27:56,479 --> 01:27:57,814
What the fuck is wrong with me?

865
01:27:57,897 --> 01:27:59,649
What the fuck
is wrong with you, huh?

866
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:01,484
I don't know! I don't know!

867
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:03,152
I don't know, Paul.
Why don't you tell me,

868
01:28:03,236 --> 01:28:04,988
since I can't
do anything right?

869
01:28:05,071 --> 01:28:07,573
Jesus Christ! I swear--

870
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:10,159
I swear to fucking God,
you are so--

871
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:11,869
What? What? What?

872
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:14,998
I'm so fucking what?
Say it. What am I?

873
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:17,709
Tell me, I am so fucking...

874
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:20,586
You're fucking psycho!

875
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:22,338
-Oh, yay!
-Yeah!

876
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:25,008
-Psycho!
-It's out of the bag!

877
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:26,926
You're fucking crazy!

878
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,678
I'll show you crazy!

879
01:28:28,761 --> 01:28:30,888
-You want to fucking see crazy?
-Stop it! Stop it!

880
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,849
-What are you doing?
-Is that crazy enough for you?

881
01:28:32,932 --> 01:28:35,518
-Is that fucked up? Huh?
-Stop it!

882
01:28:35,601 --> 01:28:37,520
-Is that crazy enough for you?
-Yes, that is crazy,

883
01:28:37,603 --> 01:28:39,856
you fucking psycho!

884
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:43,151
Jesus fucking Christ!
I'm fucking driving.

885
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:47,030
-Fucking hate you!
-Good! Good!

886
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:50,783
'Cause I fucking hate you, too.
I fucking--

887
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:53,536
You crazy bitch.

888
01:28:56,622 --> 01:28:59,584
Ah, you psycho bitch!

889
01:29:01,627 --> 01:29:04,380
Oh, you're gonna cry.

890
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:07,884
Are you gonna cry now?
Is that your thing? "Oh, God!"

891
01:29:07,967 --> 01:29:11,971
Oh, you look so fucking ugly
when you cry. It's horrible.

892
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:15,308
I can't-- Ew, I can't--

893
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:20,980
"Oh, help me, God!"

894
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:26,819
What the fuck are you doing?

895
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:28,404
What are you doing?

896
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:32,700
Jesus! Oh, my God!

897
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:40,375
It's okay, it's okay.
Everything's fine. Hey, hey.

898
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:42,627
You're okay.

899
01:29:43,836 --> 01:29:45,838
You have a mild concussion.

900
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:55,223
Where am I? Where am I?

901
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:58,142
Harvest Moon.
It's a private wellness clinic.

902
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:00,478
You fainted and hit your head.

903
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:04,023
We found you lying
on your living room floor,

904
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:05,650
unconscious.

905
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:07,568
The doctor said
you were sleep deprived

906
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:09,695
and extremely dehydrated.

907
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:12,115
No, no, no, that's not--

908
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:13,783
That's not--
That's not what happened.

909
01:30:13,866 --> 01:30:15,827
Joshua, could you go
find Dr. Fowler

910
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:18,413
-and let him know Skye's awake?
-Of course, yeah.

911
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:21,165
I hope you're
feeling better, Skye.

912
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:25,378
I, uh... I brought a sweatshirt
for you, just in case you...

913
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:27,964
...you get cold.

914
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:45,898
We can cover that with makeup.

915
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:49,110
And the team's already working
on a fill piece for your hair.

916
01:30:53,906 --> 01:30:56,534
Don't worry, you won't be able
to tell the difference.

917
01:30:57,702 --> 01:30:59,912
And I've cleared your schedule.

918
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:02,290
So today you can
just have a whole day

919
01:31:02,373 --> 01:31:04,500
of rest and recuperation.

920
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:07,420
Where's my phone?

921
01:31:07,503 --> 01:31:08,796
-I need my phone.
-It's right here.

922
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,423
I got it.

923
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:13,092
-I need it. Give it to me.
-Maybe later.

924
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:16,679
Right now, we're just
gonna focus on relaxing.

925
01:31:16,762 --> 01:31:20,266
Mom.
Please, please.

926
01:31:20,349 --> 01:31:22,143
Something really crazy
is happening to me.

927
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:23,811
I need to get out of here
right now.

928
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:27,440
No. We are gonna
stay here together

929
01:31:27,523 --> 01:31:30,526
until we head to the venue
tomorrow for the preshow.

930
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:32,820
That way we can make sure
you're a hundred percent

931
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:34,739
and ready to perform.

932
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:36,449
No, no. I can't. I--

933
01:31:36,532 --> 01:31:37,992
Can't what?

934
01:31:41,704 --> 01:31:43,289
I can't do the show.

935
01:31:45,124 --> 01:31:49,545
If you... cancel the show,
then you will be

936
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:52,924
checking yourself into
a recovery program.

937
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:55,635
-That's the only explanation...
-Mom--

938
01:31:55,718 --> 01:31:58,054
...as to why Skye Riley
is canceling another tour

939
01:31:58,137 --> 01:31:59,388
the night before it starts.

940
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:01,390
You will have to explain
to the label

941
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:03,518
who've invested
millions of dollars.

942
01:32:03,601 --> 01:32:06,103
-And you're putting the workers--
-Mom, you don't understand!

943
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:09,232
No! You don't
understand, Skye.

944
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:11,692
There are
no more second chances.

945
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:14,946
If you cancel, this is it.

946
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:17,907
The media will rake you
over the coals.

947
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:20,159
We'll be sued
by the label for millions.

948
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:23,955
It will be the end
of everything we've built.

949
01:32:25,164 --> 01:32:26,916
Oh, my God, Mom.

950
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:29,460
Why is that
all you care about, Mom?

951
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:32,880
You treat me like
I'm some fucking windup toy.

952
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:34,423
You don't give a shit about me!

953
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:36,717
How dare you
talk to me like that?

954
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:38,177
You arrogant little asshole!

955
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,596
I have given up
everything for you!

956
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,473
Every second of my time.

957
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,267
Years of my life.

958
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:47,895
My career.
And here I am,

959
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:52,942
sacrificing every fiber
of my being to support you.

960
01:32:53,025 --> 01:32:55,945
But you're too selfish
to even see it.

961
01:32:56,028 --> 01:32:59,782
You put everyone
through absolute hell,

962
01:32:59,865 --> 01:33:02,535
and still we support you.

963
01:33:02,618 --> 01:33:05,580
But you want to go
and throw it away? Fine!

964
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:08,332
Do it! Throw it away!
I don't care!

965
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,960
That's what everyone expects
of you anyway.

966
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:16,340
I wish you could feel
what it's like

967
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:18,718
having to live inside my head.

968
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:24,932
I've tasted
what's inside your head!

969
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:26,851
No, no, please, no!

970
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:29,020
Please, no.

971
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:30,229
No.

972
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:36,611
No, no, no! Please!

973
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:38,195
No!

974
01:33:41,907 --> 01:33:43,826
Oh, no, no!

975
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:59,884
Look what you're doing
to your poor mother.

976
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:03,512
No, God!

977
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:26,220
Oh, God, that's not real.

978
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:29,056
It's not real. It's not real.

979
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,599
It's not real.

980
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:32,560
No, no.

981
01:35:32,643 --> 01:35:34,061
No!

982
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:39,191
It's not real, it's not real,
it's not real.

983
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:50,703
Oh...

984
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:53,205
Oh!

985
01:36:11,807 --> 01:36:13,559
It's Joshua!

986
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:19,273
I need a second!

987
01:36:19,356 --> 01:36:22,026
-I'm changing.
-Oh! Sorry! Uh...

988
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:24,111
You know what?
I'll wait out here.

989
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:26,030
Also, the doctor said
he's gonna come and see you

990
01:36:26,113 --> 01:36:27,114
in a few minutes.

991
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:29,366
Actually, I...

992
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:32,620
I... I feel kind of thirsty.
I need a--

993
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:34,705
Do you think you could go
find me something to drink?

994
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:37,082
Oh. Uh, I brought
some bottles of water.

995
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:39,376
Put them
in the little refrigerator.

996
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:41,879
I feel like soda. Could you
get me a soda, please?

997
01:36:41,962 --> 01:36:43,756
Sure. Yeah, no problem.

998
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:46,717
What kind?

999
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:49,386
Any kind, just... surprise me.

1000
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:51,931
You got it. You know what?
I'll be right back

1001
01:36:52,014 --> 01:36:54,892
with one, uh...
surprising soda.

1002
01:37:23,045 --> 01:37:24,880
Fuck.

1003
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:28,801
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, fuck!

1004
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:37,017
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

1005
01:37:46,193 --> 01:37:47,653
Shit.

1006
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:25,501
Skye?

1007
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:28,629
Are you--

1008
01:39:28,712 --> 01:39:31,173
Oh, my God! Is that...

1009
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:33,342
blood?

1010
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:38,847
No.

1011
01:39:40,557 --> 01:39:43,519
Hey, uh...
We need a doctor over here!

1012
01:39:43,602 --> 01:39:45,854
-Shut the fuck up!
-Yeah, could we please

1013
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:47,606
get some help, somebody?

1014
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:50,442
-Just shut the fuck up!
-Are you hurt?

1015
01:39:50,526 --> 01:39:52,027
Somebody please help!
We need a doctor.

1016
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:53,779
Oh, my God, Skye.

1017
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,782
Hey... you, you, you!

1018
01:39:56,865 --> 01:39:58,117
Please help me!

1019
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,119
Whoa, whoa, easy!
I got you.

1020
01:40:00,202 --> 01:40:01,412
Get away from me!

1021
01:40:05,457 --> 01:40:08,502
Hey... just take it easy.

1022
01:40:08,585 --> 01:40:11,588
I said get the fuck
away from me!

1023
01:40:13,757 --> 01:40:15,676
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1024
01:40:15,759 --> 01:40:16,969
Skye?

1025
01:40:17,761 --> 01:40:19,972
Skye? What are you doing?

1026
01:40:20,055 --> 01:40:22,224
Think about the tour.

1027
01:40:23,767 --> 01:40:26,228
Fuck the tour!

1028
01:40:34,486 --> 01:40:35,946
Is that Skye Riley?

1029
01:40:46,915 --> 01:40:49,543
Fuck! Fuck!

1030
01:40:50,335 --> 01:40:53,338
Fuck! Oh, God.

1031
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:54,631
Skye?

1032
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:56,717
What are you doing out here?

1033
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,260
Gemma, what are you doing here?

1034
01:40:58,343 --> 01:41:00,304
Your mom called me.
Are you bleeding?

1035
01:41:00,387 --> 01:41:03,223
-Is your car here?
-No, your mom's driver drove me, why?

1036
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:06,602
-Where is he?
-He just dropped me off over there. What's going on?

1037
01:41:06,685 --> 01:41:08,479
Skye!
Skye Riley. That's her!

1038
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:09,938
What happened?

1039
01:41:11,523 --> 01:41:12,983
Hey, that's Skye Riley!

1040
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:15,152
Totally off her rocker.

1041
01:41:15,235 --> 01:41:16,820
Hey, get out! I need your car!

1042
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:18,739
Ms. Riley, what--

1043
01:41:18,822 --> 01:41:22,576
-Get the fuck out of the car!
-She's got a gun!

1044
01:41:22,659 --> 01:41:25,204
What the fuck are you doing?

1045
01:41:25,287 --> 01:41:28,749
Gemma, I love you, but if I don't
leave right now, I'm gonna fucking die!

1046
01:41:28,832 --> 01:41:32,252
-Fuck it! I'm coming with you. Move over.
-No, Gemma, no!

1047
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:35,756
-You don't know how to drive. Move over!
-Fuck!

1048
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:47,518
Whoa!

1049
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:04,118
Dude, where are we going?

1050
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:06,578
What am I doing?
Where am I going?

1051
01:42:08,872 --> 01:42:11,041
-Where am I going? Skye!
-I don't know yet.

1052
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:13,085
-Just keep driving.
-No, I need you to explain

1053
01:42:13,168 --> 01:42:16,130
what the hell is going on.

1054
01:42:18,507 --> 01:42:20,551
I need to get to Staten Island.

1055
01:42:20,634 --> 01:42:22,636
What? Gross. Why?
Oh, shit.

1056
01:42:24,179 --> 01:42:25,472
Fuck!

1057
01:42:26,223 --> 01:42:27,349
Fuck!

1058
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:33,021
Jesus Christ! You need to go to a hospital!

1059
01:42:33,105 --> 01:42:36,316
-No! I need to go to Staten Island.
-What the fuck is going on?

1060
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,609
Why are we going
to Staten Island?

1061
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:48,579
Skye.

1062
01:42:48,662 --> 01:42:51,081
-Gemma, pull over, please.
-What? You just told me to go to Staten Island!

1063
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:53,667
Gemma, just fucking
pull over, please!

1064
01:42:55,502 --> 01:42:59,006
All I've ever done
is make your life hell.

1065
01:42:59,089 --> 01:43:01,758
I don't deserve you.
So please, just pull over

1066
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:04,970
and get away from me so
I don't fuck up your life, too.

1067
01:43:08,932 --> 01:43:11,226
No, fuck that noise.

1068
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,522
Ride or die, bitch!

1069
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:24,907
I need to...

1070
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:26,450
I need to tell you something.

1071
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:28,827
What?

1072
01:43:32,789 --> 01:43:33,916
Skye?

1073
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:55,479
-Hello?
-Hey, it's me. I got your voicemail.

1074
01:43:55,562 --> 01:43:57,356
Sorry it's taken me a few days
to get back to you.

1075
01:43:57,439 --> 01:43:59,650
But, honestly,
I wasn't even sure

1076
01:43:59,733 --> 01:44:01,318
if I was gonna call you back.

1077
01:44:02,486 --> 01:44:05,447
Did you spend the night
at my place?

1078
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:08,784
What? I haven't been
to your place in like a year.

1079
01:44:08,867 --> 01:44:11,411
Since you said I was
a "stupid opportunistic cunt,"

1080
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:13,747
remember?

1081
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:16,333
Also, what's up with these
weird-ass fuckin' text messages

1082
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:18,252
you've been sending me?

1083
01:44:20,212 --> 01:44:22,214
Hello?

1084
01:44:22,297 --> 01:44:24,466
Gemma hates you, Skye.

1085
01:44:24,549 --> 01:44:26,468
No, please. Please, Gemma, no.

1086
01:44:26,551 --> 01:44:29,680
Please, Gemma, no.
Not you, please.

1087
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,307
No, no!

1088
01:44:32,391 --> 01:44:34,059
No! No! No!

1089
01:44:34,142 --> 01:44:35,394
Fuck you!

1090
01:44:35,852 --> 01:44:37,938
Fuck you!

1091
01:44:38,021 --> 01:44:40,065
Fuck you, fuck you!

1092
01:44:40,899 --> 01:44:42,234
Let me the fuck out!

1093
01:44:42,317 --> 01:44:45,070
-Let me go!
-No one cares about you.

1094
01:44:45,153 --> 01:44:48,031
This is not real.
You're not driving, you're not driving.

1095
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:50,450
You're not driving,
this isn't happening.

1096
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:52,369
You're in my head,
you're in my head.

1097
01:44:52,452 --> 01:44:53,954
You're in my head!
You're in my head!

1098
01:44:54,037 --> 01:44:56,123
You're in my head!

1099
01:44:56,206 --> 01:44:57,791
You're in my head!

1100
01:44:57,874 --> 01:45:01,211
You're not in control. I am!

1101
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:07,175
You're not in control. I am.

1102
01:45:08,885 --> 01:45:12,681
I'm in control,
I'm in control, I'm in control.

1103
01:45:13,849 --> 01:45:18,770
I'm in control, I'm in control,
I'm in control.

1104
01:45:39,499 --> 01:45:40,709
I'm in control.

1105
01:45:45,922 --> 01:45:48,925
Fuck you!
Learn to fucking drive!

1106
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:10,280
Jesus Christ!

1107
01:46:13,617 --> 01:46:15,702
Christ, are you okay?
Where are your shoes?

1108
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:17,871
-I don't have any. Here, take this.
-Why do you have a gun?

1109
01:46:17,954 --> 01:46:19,790
Just take it! Hey!

1110
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:21,458
If this theory of yours
doesn't work

1111
01:46:21,541 --> 01:46:24,544
or you see me change
and start smiling,

1112
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:27,297
-shoot me in the head.
-Whoa, whoa, hold on!

1113
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:29,341
Hey! You need to stop it,
no matter what.

1114
01:46:29,424 --> 01:46:30,634
We're going to.

1115
01:46:30,717 --> 01:46:32,302
-Promise me!
-All right!

1116
01:46:33,387 --> 01:46:36,306
All right, I promise
I'll shoot you.

1117
01:46:39,601 --> 01:46:41,186
How do we stop my heart?

1118
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:49,319
Sorry I haven't
done anything about the lights.

1119
01:46:52,155 --> 01:46:56,576
-Is this a Pizza Hut?
-It's the only thing I could find for lease on short notice

1120
01:46:56,660 --> 01:47:00,664
-that had a large enough freezer.
-Why do we need a freezer?

1121
01:47:00,747 --> 01:47:02,374
For your brain.

1122
01:47:04,334 --> 01:47:05,544
Fuck.

1123
01:47:11,133 --> 01:47:14,678
Once we stop your heart,
your brain stops receiving oxygen.

1124
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:17,013
Normally,
necrosis sets in immediately.

1125
01:47:17,097 --> 01:47:19,641
You'd have two minutes maybe
before permanent brain damage,

1126
01:47:19,724 --> 01:47:23,228
but if we bring your body temperature
down far enough, we can delay the process,

1127
01:47:23,311 --> 01:47:25,313
giving us up to nine minutes
before permanent damage.

1128
01:47:25,397 --> 01:47:29,693
We need to make sure this thing
isn't able to hang around. And...

1129
01:47:29,776 --> 01:47:33,113
...I like our odds with
nine minutes better than two.

1130
01:47:48,295 --> 01:47:52,215
The freezer door latch is broken.

1131
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:54,885
If it closes all the way,
it can't be opened from the inside.

1132
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:01,266
Here. Change into this.

1133
01:48:06,229 --> 01:48:08,023
Jesus, that's a lot of blood!

1134
01:48:08,106 --> 01:48:09,816
Are-- Are the cops
gonna be looking for you?

1135
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,360
I don't know.
Let's just do this.

1136
01:48:15,906 --> 01:48:18,158
Once your body temperature
drops low enough,

1137
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:20,911
I will inject you with a drug
that will cause your heart

1138
01:48:20,994 --> 01:48:23,997
to start slowing down
until it stops.

1139
01:48:24,998 --> 01:48:26,416
How long will it take?

1140
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:32,422
It's critical you reach
flatline as fast as possible.

1141
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:35,842
So I'll need to inject it directly
into your internal jugular.

1142
01:48:35,926 --> 01:48:38,720
After 30 seconds...
you'll be dead.

1143
01:48:38,803 --> 01:48:41,515
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Jugular, like in my neck?

1144
01:48:44,351 --> 01:48:45,685
Let me see the needle.

1145
01:48:49,648 --> 01:48:51,107
What the fuck, man?

1146
01:48:51,191 --> 01:48:53,235
I know. Sorry.

1147
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:55,403
Lie down here.

1148
01:49:18,051 --> 01:49:20,011
Oh, my God,
I'm so fucking cold.

1149
01:49:20,095 --> 01:49:23,223
That's the idea. I'll be
monitoring your heart rate.

1150
01:49:23,306 --> 01:49:26,893
The moment you flatline, I'll
start a timer for eight minutes.

1151
01:49:26,977 --> 01:49:28,812
Once the timer's up,

1152
01:49:28,895 --> 01:49:32,357
I will inject a dose of
adrenaline into your heart

1153
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:36,194
and start CPR resuscitation.

1154
01:49:36,278 --> 01:49:38,863
I can't believe I might die in the
freezer of a fucking Pizza Hut.

1155
01:49:38,947 --> 01:49:41,116
I promise
I'm gonna bring you back.

1156
01:49:45,036 --> 01:49:46,496
Morris?

1157
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:48,999
I'm sorry about your brother.

1158
01:49:49,082 --> 01:49:50,458
I know that's why
you're doing this.

1159
01:49:50,542 --> 01:49:52,919
Thank you for helping me.

1160
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:56,590
Can I ask what made you
change your mind?

1161
01:49:58,633 --> 01:50:02,345
Every good thing in my life...

1162
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:04,973
ends up broken because of me.

1163
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:11,062
I hurt everything
and everyone I touch.

1164
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:16,985
It doesn't matter
what happens to me anymore.

1165
01:50:19,362 --> 01:50:22,616
But I will not
let this fucking thing...

1166
01:50:23,533 --> 01:50:26,494
use me to hurt anyone else.

1167
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:35,337
Put this in your mouth.

1168
01:50:38,048 --> 01:50:39,466
Don't move.

1169
01:50:39,549 --> 01:50:41,426
I just have to get something.

1170
01:50:43,303 --> 01:50:45,472
Wait. Where--
Where are you going?

1171
01:50:45,555 --> 01:50:47,057
Shit.

1172
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:51,186
Wait.

1173
01:50:51,811 --> 01:50:52,937
Wait.

1174
01:50:58,401 --> 01:51:00,111
Morris?

1175
01:51:20,382 --> 01:51:21,549
Hey!

1176
01:51:22,842 --> 01:51:24,678
Don't leave me alone here!

1177
01:51:25,261 --> 01:51:26,388
Please.

1178
01:51:28,098 --> 01:51:29,391
Mor-- Morris?

1179
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:11,766
No!

1180
01:52:21,067 --> 01:52:23,319
No! No!

1181
01:52:44,632 --> 01:52:47,594
I've been waiting for you
for such a long time.

1182
01:52:48,386 --> 01:52:49,846
Mor--

1183
01:52:49,929 --> 01:52:51,890
Morris! Morris, it's in here!

1184
01:52:51,973 --> 01:52:55,560
Morris can't help you anymore.

1185
01:52:57,604 --> 01:52:59,105
It's just you and me.

1186
01:53:01,941 --> 01:53:03,651
I like wearing your skin.

1187
01:53:12,827 --> 01:53:16,623
You can't get away
from me, Skye.

1188
01:53:32,764 --> 01:53:34,682
You'll never
escape who you truly are

1189
01:53:34,766 --> 01:53:36,726
on the inside.

1190
01:53:45,276 --> 01:53:47,195
Look at me!

1191
01:54:35,618 --> 01:54:37,912
Fuck... you!

1192
01:54:39,205 --> 01:54:40,999
Skye!

1193
01:54:44,085 --> 01:54:46,963
Skye!

1194
01:54:49,132 --> 01:54:52,427
Skye!

1195
01:54:53,887 --> 01:54:55,930
Skye!

1196
01:54:56,347 --> 01:54:58,641
Skye! Skye!

1197
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:20,955
This isn't real, Skye.

1198
01:55:37,347 --> 01:55:38,556
No! No!

1199
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:40,308
No.

1200
01:55:47,857 --> 01:55:49,484
No. No!

1201
01:55:50,151 --> 01:55:51,486
Please, no!

1202
01:55:51,569 --> 01:55:54,322
You're not in control, Skye.

1203
01:55:54,405 --> 01:55:55,531
No!

1204
01:55:59,327 --> 01:56:00,536
I am.

1205
01:56:13,883 --> 01:56:15,885
Break a leg out there.

1206
01:56:37,323 --> 01:56:39,117
No. No.

1207
01:57:20,950 --> 01:57:22,785
Skye, I love you!

1208
01:57:23,244 --> 01:57:24,620
Skye!

1209
01:57:25,913 --> 01:57:28,291
Whoo! Skye!

1210
01:57:28,374 --> 01:57:30,001
Skye, you're the best!

1211
01:57:30,543 --> 01:57:32,003
Skye!

1212
01:57:32,086 --> 01:57:33,796
I love you, Skye!

1213
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,465
Skye, you look beautiful!

1214
01:57:39,177 --> 01:57:41,054
I love you, Skye!

1215
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:43,473
All right, Skye!

1216
01:57:43,556 --> 01:57:45,058
-Skye!
-Skye!

1217
01:57:45,141 --> 01:57:46,142
Whoo!

1218
01:57:48,686 --> 01:57:50,021
-Yeah!
-Skye!

1219
01:57:50,104 --> 01:57:51,606
Whoo!

1220
01:57:52,815 --> 01:57:54,067
I love you, Skye!

1221
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:55,651
Smile.

1222
01:58:38,444 --> 01:58:39,779
No.

1223
01:58:42,365 --> 01:58:44,992
No!

1224
01:58:48,788 --> 01:58:54,460
No!

1225
01:59:34,709 --> 01:59:35,918
Somebody help her!

1226
01:59:37,837 --> 01:59:39,964
My God. Do something!

1227
01:59:40,882 --> 01:59:42,592
I love you!

1228
01:59:42,675 --> 01:59:44,051
Get up, Skye!

1229
01:59:45,178 --> 01:59:47,388
Yeah! There you go, Skye!

1230
01:59:47,471 --> 01:59:50,308
Whoo! We love you, Skye!

1231
01:59:50,391 --> 01:59:52,977
All right, Skye!

1232
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:54,937
Skye, we love you!

1233
01:59:55,021 --> 01:59:56,772
