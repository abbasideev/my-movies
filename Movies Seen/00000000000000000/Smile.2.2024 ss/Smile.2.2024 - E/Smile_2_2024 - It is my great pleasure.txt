It is my great pleasure

-to introduce...
-Ten seconds.

...a wonderful young artist.
Ladies and gentlemen,

-please put your hands together...
-I'll take that.

...for Skye Riley.

Wow.

Thank you.

Thank you so much.

Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

I'm Skye Riley,

and I'm here tonight to...

Uh...

I'm here tonight to...

Uh...

Oh, that's, uh...

So, how's everyone
doing tonight?

Hope you're all
enjoying the party.

Uh. Don't worry, though.
I'm sober.

So...

Um...

What can I say about
how music inspires hope?

Well,

music gave me
everything I ever wanted.

Then again, music did almost
kill me, so there's that.

Uh... Well, I--
I guess that's not fair.

Music didn't put
all those drugs up my nose,

I did.

Um...

I-- I think
I'm supposed to be up here

offering words of inspiration
and advice.

Well, when I think about
what I wish someone would have

told me when I was younger
and first getting started,

I suppose I'd say

this business is really hard.

And, uh, you'll spend years
of your life chasing success

you know, thinking that
when it comes,

it will magically fix,
you know, everything

that's bad and wrong about you.

And then you achieve success,
and you realize that it can't fix

the deeply broken person
that you have always been.

And now you can't escape

the miserable thing
that you've become,

and one day, you realize

how badly you wish you could

just trade it all just for

one fucking moment of happiness!

Oh.

Sorry about that. Uh...

What I meant to say is:

I hope the next generation
of young artists

finds themselves
truly inspired tonight.

I know I sure am.

And without any further ado,

I'd like to introduce
our next guest,

a very special person

who surely needs
no i
who surely needs
no introduction:

Paul Hudson.

What?

Why does it say that?
That's not--

This-- No. Why did s--

This-- Why did--

What?

No.

No.

No.

No, stay away from me.

Stay away from me!

Paul's dead!

You're not Paul!

Stop smiling at me!

No, no.

I can hold it. No, no, stop.
