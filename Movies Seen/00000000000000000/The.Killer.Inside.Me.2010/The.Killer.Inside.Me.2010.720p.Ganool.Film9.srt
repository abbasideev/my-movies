1
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:47,356
# You never know how much I love you #

2
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:50,796
# Never know how much I care #

3
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:54,028
# When you put your arms around me #

4
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:57,299
# I get a feeling
that's so hard to bear #

5
00:00:57,338 --> 00:01:01,001
# You give me fever #

6
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:02,509
# When you kiss me #

7
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:06,502
# Fever when you hold me tight #

8
00:01:06,547 --> 00:01:08,014
# Fever #

9
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:10,074
# In the morning #

10
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:12,585
# Fever all through the night #

11
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,421
# Listen to me, baby #

12
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,226
# Hear every word I say #

13
00:01:23,264 --> 00:01:26,461
# No one can love you the way I do #

14
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,333
# 'Cause they don't know
how to love you my way #

15
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,136
# You give me fever #

16
00:01:33,174 --> 00:01:34,539
# When you kiss me #

17
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:38,409
# Fever when you hold me tight #

18
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:39,936
# Fever #

19
00:01:39,981 --> 00:01:42,006
# In the morning #

20
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:45,507
# And fever all through the night #

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,817
name of Joyce Lakeland.

22
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:50,756
Lives about four or five miles
out on Derrick Road

23
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,486
past the old Branch place.

24
00:01:52,526 --> 00:01:53,925
Oh, I know the old Branch place.

25
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:55,292
She a hustlin' lady, Bob?

26
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:56,626
Well, I guess so,

27
00:01:56,664 --> 00:01:59,030
but she's-she's been
pretty decent about it.

28
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,863
She ain't taken on no roustabouts

29
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:01,868
or nothin' like that.

30
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:03,426
In fact,

31
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:05,701
if these preachers around town
weren't rompin' down on me,

32
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,207
I wouldn't bother her at all.

33
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:08,299
Well, how shall I handle it?

34
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:10,139
Tell her to lay off awhile or...

35
00:02:10,177 --> 00:02:11,838
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.

36
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,178
Just go out and size her up
and make your own decision.

37
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:16,740
I know you'll be gentle,

38
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:19,048
as gentle and pleasant as you can be.

39
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:21,145
So go on out there,
see how she looks to ya.

40
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:23,452
All right.

41
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,857
Thanks, Bob.

42
00:02:43,444 --> 00:02:44,672
Mornin' Miss Parker.

43
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:48,648
- Oh, hello.
- Mornin', ma'am.

44
00:02:48,683 --> 00:02:50,651
The trouble with growing up
in a small town

45
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:53,017
is everybody thinks
they know who you are.

46
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:01,794
I was born here 29 years ago.

47
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:03,319
And Central City was small enough

48
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:07,824
that my father
was the only doctor in town.

49
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:08,994
Then the oil boom came,

50
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:12,904
and the town grew to fit its name.

51
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,874
The sheriff's office
handles the policing

52
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:16,570
for both the city and the county.

53
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,444
We do a pretty good job of it,
to our own way of thinkin'.

54
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:23,143
We're kind of old-fashioned.

55
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:25,152
Out here, you say,
"Yes, ma'am," and "No, ma'am,"

56
00:03:25,186 --> 00:03:28,053
to anything with a skirt on.

57
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:29,989
Out here, if you catch a man
with his pants down,

58
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:31,389
you apologize,

59
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:34,087
even if you have to
arrest him afterwards.

60
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:38,324
Out here, you're a man
and a gentleman,

61
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:41,493
or you aren't anything at all.

62
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:43,628
And God help you if you're not.

63
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:07,487
Yes?

64
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:09,587
I'm sorry, ma'am, uh...

65
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,427
Come on in.

66
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:16,959
You go on back.

67
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:18,995
I just need to wash up.

68
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:40,592
What do you think
you're doing with that?

69
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:42,721
Sheriff's office, ma'am.

70
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:43,821
What are you doing with it?

71
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:45,991
I have a permit.

72
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:54,338
Are you satisfied, copper?

73
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:01,973
Well, I reckon it's all right.

74
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:05,042
And my name's Ford, ma'am,
not Copper.

75
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:07,246
Jesus.

76
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:09,756
The only decent-looking guy
I've seen in this stink hole

77
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,384
and he's a boy scout with a badge.

78
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:13,859
How much?

79
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:15,020
I don't jazz cops.

80
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:17,121
That's not very polite, ma'am.

81
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:19,098
I just came out here for a little talk.

82
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:20,794
And I asked you what you wanted.

83
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:24,669
Well, I guess I want you out
of Central City by sundown.

84
00:05:24,705 --> 00:05:27,640
And if I see you here after that...

85
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,165
I'm gonna run you in for prostitution.

86
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,370
You lousy son of a bitch.

87
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:32,402
Don't you call me that, ma'am.

88
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:38,047
You lousy son of a bitch!

89
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:41,953
You son of a bitch, bastard, pimp!

90
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,460
Get off me!

91
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:55,661
Get off me!

92
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:58,103
Let go of me, you bastard!

93
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:05,239
Get off me!

94
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,839
You bastard son of a bitch!

95
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:49,721
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:53,284
- I'm sorry.
- No.

97
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:56,319
Don't say you're sorry.

98
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:19,341
# I'm a tip-top daddy #

99
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:20,648
# And I'm gonna have my way #

100
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:22,121
# Keep away from the corners #

101
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:23,418
# Hear what I got to say #

102
00:07:23,457 --> 00:07:24,685
# Hold one hand only #

103
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:26,124
# Get ready for a ride #

104
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,221
# Give me one hand loose
and I'll be satisfied #

105
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:32,630
I went back the next day
and the day after that.

106
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,156
I couldn't help it.

107
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:36,328
It was like a wind had been
turned on a dying fire.

108
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,803
# Give me free hand, woman #

109
00:07:37,838 --> 00:07:39,430
# Let it swing by my side #

110
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:42,738
# Give me one hand loose
and I'll be satisfied #

111
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:11,261
# Satisfied #

112
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:18,672
Let's pull out of this
crummy old town together,

113
00:08:18,712 --> 00:08:21,237
just you and me.

114
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:22,771
What, are you crazy?

115
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:27,552
Go on.

116
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:29,351
Let me hear you say it.

117
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,914
Oh, no.

118
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,721
Go on.

119
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,752
Tell me what a fine ol'
family y'all Fords is.

120
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:37,764
"We all Fords, ma'am.

121
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:39,663
"We wouldn't even think
of living with one of you

122
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,894
miserable ol' whores, ma'am."

123
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:43,164
Don't.

124
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:45,262
You think you're too good for me.

125
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:46,829
Don't start that.

126
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:49,240
You do.

127
00:08:49,276 --> 00:08:51,801
I'll never give you up.

128
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:53,972
Never.

129
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:55,675
And if you think you're
too good for me now,

130
00:08:55,716 --> 00:08:57,240
I'll make it so you won't be.

131
00:08:57,284 --> 00:09:02,449
Oh, baby, you got your bowels
in an uproar all over nothin'.

132
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:04,423
I was just thinkin' about the money.

133
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,925
I can get money.

134
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,426
Oh, yeah?

135
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:12,489
He's crazy about me,
and he's dumb as hell.

136
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:13,761
I'm sorry?

137
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:17,202
Who's crazy about you and dumb as hell?

138
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:20,673
Elmer Conway.

139
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:23,175
You know who he is,
don't ya?

140
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:27,440
I knew Elmer Conway well enough.

141
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,949
We'd been in the same
class together at school.

142
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:31,746
Aw, he wasn't a bad man.

143
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:33,753
He'd just been spoiled.

144
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:36,915
Spoiled by his father,
Chester Conway.

145
00:09:36,957 --> 00:09:39,221
Chester had built half of Central City,

146
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:40,817
and he acted like he owned the town,

147
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:44,922
and nobody had the guts
to tell him any different.

148
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:46,830
Joyce was a fool to think
she could put one over

149
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:48,960
on old man Conway.

150
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:50,697
But her plan started me thinking about

151
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:53,297
how I could settle some
old scores of my own.

152
00:09:57,778 --> 00:09:59,541
You want a refill, hon?

153
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,672
No, I've got to go.

154
00:10:00,714 --> 00:10:01,703
All right.

155
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,978
So you're a deputy sheriff?

156
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,179
You don't even carry a gun.

157
00:10:07,221 --> 00:10:09,280
No, I don't.

158
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:10,984
What if some crook
should try to shoot ya?

159
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:15,188
Well, I'll tell you a secret.

160
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:17,595
We don't have too many
crooks in Central City.

161
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:19,861
That's good to know.

162
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,800
I started needling people.

163
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:23,359
I couldn't help it.

164
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:26,133
I guess it was a substitute
for somethin' else.

165
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:28,073
- Thank you, Max.
- You don't have to pay.

166
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:30,576
I want to thank you for what
you've done for my Johnnie.

167
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:32,772
No one else would've done what you did.

168
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:34,041
Thank you very much, Max.

169
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:35,173
I appreciate that.

170
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:37,115
It's made a big difference.

171
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:39,312
You know, I figure that you
don't get any more out of life

172
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:40,479
than what you put into it.

173
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:43,354
You're right there, Lou.

174
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,914
Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna push off.

175
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,984
I got a whole lot of
gettin' around to do,

176
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:49,723
and I don't want to rush.

177
00:10:49,763 --> 00:10:52,561
Haste makes waste.

178
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,791
- Evenin'.
- Evenin'.

179
00:10:58,872 --> 00:11:00,840
Hey, how 'bout it, bud?

180
00:11:00,874 --> 00:11:02,933
How 'bout it?

181
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:06,173
Look, I've been on a hell of a binge,

182
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:08,374
and, by God, if I don't get
some food in me pretty soon,

183
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,645
I'm just gonna keel over here,
you know?

184
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:11,776
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

185
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:13,217
Need somethin' to warm you up, huh?

186
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:14,220
Oh, anything.

187
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:16,586
Just anything at all.

188
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:17,988
Yeah.

189
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,289
Ah!

190
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:21,294
Jesus, bud!

191
00:11:21,328 --> 00:11:23,057
Ouch. Cigar.

192
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:25,997
What the hell are you
tryin' to do with that, huh?

193
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,159
See that?

194
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:28,634
That's a real-life sheriff's badge.

195
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:29,636
- Sure.
- Beat it.

196
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,637
Sure, bud.

197
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:32,571
Sure, sure, I'm goin'.

198
00:11:32,606 --> 00:11:34,233
I'm goin'.

199
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:38,572
You better watch it
with that stuff, bud.

200
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:40,204
You think so?

201
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:42,340
You just better watch it.

202
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:09,240
Hello, Lou.

203
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:11,301
- Joe.
- Welcome.

204
00:12:11,345 --> 00:12:12,676
Come on in.

205
00:12:12,713 --> 00:12:15,807
Sorry to ask you to come around so late.

206
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:17,714
Figure it's better to be discreet,

207
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:19,150
you being a public official and all.

208
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:21,620
Have a seat.

209
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:23,748
It is hot out there, huh?

210
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:26,986
What can I do for you?

211
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:32,262
Well, look, Lou,

212
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,062
there's something I want
to talk to you about,

213
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:35,261
and I know that it's something

214
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:39,102
that you're very sensitive about, so...

215
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:42,404
How did you feel about Mike Dean?

216
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:43,739
Well, I don't know what you mean.

217
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:45,005
He was my brother.

218
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:46,706
Right, he was your
foster brother, right?

219
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:47,907
Your father adopted him.

220
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:49,575
Well, Dad and the Deans
were old friends,

221
00:12:49,616 --> 00:12:52,084
and when Mike's parents passed on

222
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:54,815
in that big flu epidemic
we had a while ago,

223
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:57,289
Dad adopted him.

224
00:12:57,324 --> 00:13:00,589
See, my mother died
when I was a baby and...

225
00:13:00,627 --> 00:13:03,755
Dad thought that Mike would
be good company for me.

226
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:05,128
You were the only son and heir,

227
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:06,655
and your father brings in another son.

228
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,032
Didn't that rub you a
little the wrong way?

229
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:11,367
Well, I was only six years
old and Mike was eight,

230
00:13:11,405 --> 00:13:12,429
so I don't--

231
00:13:12,472 --> 00:13:14,463
So you liked Mike, then?

232
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:17,272
Oh, I couldn't have loved
a real brother any more.

233
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:19,211
Even after he did what he did?

234
00:13:21,748 --> 00:13:23,340
Just what would that be?

235
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:26,944
Come on.

236
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:27,976
The girl identified him.

237
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:29,454
That girl was five years old.

238
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:32,083
She would've identified anybody
they put in front of her.

239
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:37,358
So you didn't feel the
slightest bit embarrassed

240
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:39,422
when he came back to Central City?

241
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:40,433
Not at all.

242
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:41,900
I wanted him back;
so did Dad.

243
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:43,732
Dad pulled a lot of strings
to get him that job.

244
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:47,935
You know, Lou, I mean,
that all squares.

245
00:13:47,974 --> 00:13:49,965
So now let me tell you what
I know about Mike's death,

246
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,375
all right?

247
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:54,278
Now, he was killed six years ago.

248
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:58,045
He was working on a girder
on a Conway Construction job.

249
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:01,282
Apparently he slipped on a rivet.

250
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:02,515
So when he fell...

251
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:04,751
he threw himself backwards...

252
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:09,251
so he'd land inside the
building and onto the decking.

253
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:12,561
But the floors, they hadn't been
decked in properly.

254
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:15,568
So he fell...

255
00:14:15,602 --> 00:14:17,536
all the way to the basement.

256
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:19,732
So what about it?

257
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:23,334
Well, listen, I will tell you
what about it, Lou.

258
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:29,539
Conway, Chester Conway,
he didn't install the decking.

259
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,078
Oh, now, Joe.

260
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:40,458
You just haven't thought
this deal through properly.

261
00:14:40,494 --> 00:14:43,361
See, I know you were
getting along all right

262
00:14:43,397 --> 00:14:45,262
with Chester Conway,

263
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:47,892
and then he got a
notion to go non-union,

264
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,765
and, well,
that upset you, didn't it?

265
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:51,794
I understand that.

266
00:14:51,838 --> 00:14:54,363
That's only natural.

267
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:56,899
But if you thought that
there had been a murder,

268
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:59,377
now Joe, you would've said
somethin' six years ago.

269
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:01,506
Am I right?

270
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:08,745
Well listen, I am sorry I
troubled you for nothing, Lou.

271
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:12,748
I mean, I certainly enjoyed
our talk.

272
00:15:12,793 --> 00:15:15,091
May I make a suggestion, Lou?

273
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:17,289
Certainly.

274
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,198
Save the bullshit for the birds.

275
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:22,258
All right?

276
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:26,667
Good night, Joe.

277
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,862
Lou.

278
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:03,534
Lou?

279
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:10,140
What're you doing?

280
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:48,051
Lou.

281
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:49,214
Amy, what're you doin' here?

282
00:16:49,256 --> 00:16:52,817
Waitin' for you, upstairs.

283
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:54,793
- Somebody might've seen ya.
- No one did.

284
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:56,853
I snuck out after my
folks went to sleep.

285
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:01,397
Aren't ya glad?

286
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:03,265
Well, I wasn't expectin' you.

287
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:07,171
Well, my,
such enthusiasm.

288
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:08,435
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:08,475 --> 00:17:13,037
I shed my clothes for you
and my decency and...

290
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,570
you just say you're sorry.

291
00:17:26,026 --> 00:17:29,291
Will I see you Sunday for dinner?

292
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:31,092
Well, I can't, babe.

293
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:32,655
I told a fella I'd do a favor for him.

294
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:34,257
I can't get out of it.

295
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:35,666
Shouldn't be too late.

296
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:39,968
Why don't you come on by
around 10:00 and wait for me.

297
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:41,871
We're gonna have a talk,

298
00:17:41,908 --> 00:17:43,569
talk about why you've
acted the way you have

299
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,100
these past few weeks.

300
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:46,112
Understand?

301
00:17:46,146 --> 00:17:48,444
Yes, Miss Stanton.

302
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:50,847
So now, sleep well.

303
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:52,408
Bye.

304
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,288
# Walk five miles,
lose a hundred bucks #

305
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,025
# When I pardon #

306
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:06,464
# they call him luck #

307
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:08,023
# They say "Take it away, Lucky"#

308
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:10,536
# The luckiest man in town #

309
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:16,108
# Get hit by a truck
and get a busted head #

310
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:20,135
# Everybody says, "Lucky,
he ain't dead"#

311
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,777
# Lucky the luckiest man in town #

312
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:27,480
I loved Joyce,

313
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,885
and there were times when her voice

314
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:30,583
seemed to whisper to me,

315
00:18:30,624 --> 00:18:31,886
"Forget it, Lou.

316
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:34,689
It's not too late if you stop now."

317
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:36,389
But then I'd remember Chester Conway,

318
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:38,294
and I knew I had to go
through with the plan.

319
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:41,027
Come on in.

320
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:42,557
Close the door behind ya.

321
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:49,570
Have a seat.

322
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,907
Well...

323
00:18:51,945 --> 00:18:54,937
You got things all
fixed up for tonight, have ya?

324
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:57,074
Gonna wind this thing
up so it'll stay wound?

325
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:59,210
Well, I'm not gonna do anything.

326
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:01,277
I mean, I've done
all I'm gonna do, so--

327
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:04,415
I don't think we better
leave it that way, Lou.

328
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:06,687
If that damn crazy Elmer sees her again,

329
00:19:06,726 --> 00:19:08,785
there's no tellin' what'll happen.

330
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:10,523
I want you to take the money yourself.

331
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:13,828
$10,000 in small bills.

332
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:14,993
Oh, I won't do that.

333
00:19:15,035 --> 00:19:18,869
Now, you take it,
and you pay her off,

334
00:19:18,905 --> 00:19:20,338
and you bust her around a little bit,

335
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:21,635
and you run her out of the county.

336
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:22,642
Mr. Conway.

337
00:19:22,676 --> 00:19:23,973
That's the way you do it.

338
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,877
You pay her, you bust her,
and you run her out.

339
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:28,904
Did you say somethin'?

340
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:32,980
Now, look here,
Miss Lakeland insisted

341
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:35,886
that Elmer bring that
money out all by himself.

342
00:19:35,922 --> 00:19:37,719
Now, those are her terms,
and I--

343
00:19:37,757 --> 00:19:41,124
I don't see what she's
got to do with it.

344
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:42,128
Well, what you don't see

345
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:44,153
is that you have a whole lot of gall.

346
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:45,186
What'd you say?

347
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:46,630
Well, how do you think it would look

348
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,692
if it got around that
an officer of the law

349
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:52,364
had made a blackmail payoff?

350
00:19:52,405 --> 00:19:53,929
Now, Elmer came to me with his trouble,

351
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:54,940
and I came to you,

352
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:56,373
and you asked me to see what I could do

353
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:57,774
about gettin' this done quietly,

354
00:19:57,811 --> 00:19:59,972
and I've done all that
I can think to do,

355
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:02,948
and I don't see how you can
ask me to do one thing more.

356
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:09,720
Maybe you're right, boy.

357
00:20:09,756 --> 00:20:12,350
But you will see that she leaves
after she gets that money.

358
00:20:12,392 --> 00:20:14,292
If she isn't gone after an hour,

359
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:17,262
I'll move her on myself.

360
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:19,629
Well, I'm gonna send
Elmer over to your place

361
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,157
as soon as I can locate him.

362
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:25,569
And you make sure he's
got everything straight.

363
00:20:25,605 --> 00:20:27,800
Understand?

364
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:34,310
What if the old man
never cools off, hmm?

365
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:35,871
Well, hold on,
you told me you were sure

366
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:37,212
he was gonna come around.

367
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,241
If that isn't the case,
I better tell Miss Lakeland.

368
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:41,378
No.
Don't you do that, Lou.

369
00:20:41,421 --> 00:20:42,581
Why don't you do this?

370
00:20:42,622 --> 00:20:43,816
Why don't you buy a business?

371
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:45,347
Then you and Joyce can run it together,

372
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:46,585
and when it gets goin' good,

373
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:49,789
then you get in touch
with your old man and...

374
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:51,319
he'll see you made a darned smart move.

375
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:57,967
Yeah, I don't know about that.

376
00:20:58,004 --> 00:20:59,369
Well I'm not gonna twist your arm.

377
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:01,202
I already stuck my neck out
about a mile and a half

378
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:02,731
to give you all a fresh start.

379
00:21:02,776 --> 00:21:03,800
I know you did,
but why?

380
00:21:03,843 --> 00:21:05,037
Why?

381
00:21:05,078 --> 00:21:08,343
Why'd you do all this
for me and her, Lou?

382
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:12,078
I might've thought that
you'd do something for me.

383
00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:14,109
Oh.

384
00:21:14,154 --> 00:21:15,280
Well, hey,
I can give you

385
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:17,016
a little out of that $10,000,
I guess.

386
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:18,250
Oh, don't bother.

387
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,781
If you don't have any money of your own,

388
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:22,021
I don't want to take your old man's.

389
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:24,427
I got plenty of my own money.

390
00:21:24,464 --> 00:21:26,591
Come on.

391
00:21:29,803 --> 00:21:31,361
Oh, hell, here.

392
00:21:31,404 --> 00:21:32,701
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

393
00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:34,138
I appreciate it.
Thank you, Elmer.

394
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:36,404
I appreciate it.

395
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:37,966
So you're gonna be there tonight, right?

396
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:39,945
- 10:00.
- 10:00.

397
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:41,810
Hey, have you heard this stuff?

398
00:21:41,848 --> 00:21:43,611
Black.

399
00:21:50,523 --> 00:21:51,490
Yellow.

400
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:57,229
And red.

401
00:22:04,604 --> 00:22:07,198
Ooh, that's good.

402
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,677
# Well #

403
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:15,408
# I woke up this mornin' #

404
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:23,284
# And I saw my honey layin' there #

405
00:22:26,726 --> 00:22:32,358
# I said Honey #

406
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:38,797
# Go in the kitchen
and make me some eggs #

407
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:26,048
- Lou.
- Hi, darlin'.

408
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:28,110
Hi.

409
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:35,290
What are you doin' here?

410
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:38,263
Chester wanted me to come
by and hold Elmer's hand.

411
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:42,997
Well, he won't be here
for another hour, so...

412
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:28,847
You will join me in two weeks,
won't you, Lou?

413
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:33,576
Won't you?

414
00:24:35,688 --> 00:24:39,146
Well, that's my understanding.

415
00:24:39,192 --> 00:24:41,353
You promise?

416
00:24:56,075 --> 00:25:00,808
Lou, do you suppose Elmer will,
you know,

417
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:03,407
make any trouble?

418
00:25:03,449 --> 00:25:05,440
I don't see how he can.

419
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:10,915
What's he gonna do,
squawk to his dad?

420
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:15,257
I'll just tell him
you changed your mind.

421
00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:17,159
I don't know,
it just--

422
00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:19,756
It all seems so complicated.

423
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:24,666
Well...

424
00:25:24,704 --> 00:25:28,231
I'll tell ya, honey,
it is kind of complicated.

425
00:25:28,274 --> 00:25:31,368
You remember my stepbrother,
the one who died?

426
00:25:31,411 --> 00:25:32,378
Mm-hmm.

427
00:25:32,412 --> 00:25:36,143
Well, Chester Conway...

428
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:39,117
organized it for him to be killed.

429
00:25:39,152 --> 00:25:41,313
That's terrible, Lou.

430
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:42,446
Yeah.

431
00:25:42,488 --> 00:25:46,254
You can't do anything to Elmer.

432
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:49,125
You mustn't, honey.

433
00:25:49,162 --> 00:25:51,096
Please?
I won't let you.

434
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:59,033
They won't catch me, baby.

435
00:25:59,072 --> 00:26:01,006
They won't even suspect
me for it, really.

436
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,372
They'll just think he got tanked,

437
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:06,173
like he usually is,

438
00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:10,444
and then you two got to fighting,

439
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:13,475
and you both got killed.

440
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,511
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

441
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:19,252
How am I supposed to be dead?

442
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:26,091
Don't.

443
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:28,828
I have to travel.

444
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:31,869
Baby, you aren't goin' anywhere.

445
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:33,804
Understand?

446
00:26:41,214 --> 00:26:42,203
Lou.

447
00:26:50,857 --> 00:26:52,017
Lou.

448
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:56,886
Hold on.

449
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:58,829
It's almost over.

450
00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:00,765
Why?

451
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,995
Why?

452
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:07,063
I'm sorry, baby.

453
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:09,097
I'm sorry.

454
00:27:17,383 --> 00:27:21,877
I love you.

455
00:27:21,921 --> 00:27:26,017
Hold on.

456
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:29,459
I love you.

457
00:27:38,137 --> 00:27:39,729
Hey.

458
00:27:41,607 --> 00:27:42,835
Hey.

459
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:46,038
Do you hear me?

460
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:48,273
Honey, can you hear me?

461
00:27:54,654 --> 00:27:57,452
I'm sorry.

462
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:02,291
I'm real sorry.

463
00:28:02,328 --> 00:28:03,454
I love you.

464
00:28:03,496 --> 00:28:04,986
Good-bye.

465
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,432
You're gonna be all right.

466
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:09,456
All right.

467
00:29:17,136 --> 00:29:18,831
Hey, Lou, ol' boy.

468
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:20,702
You got here before me, huh?

469
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,071
You bring the money?

470
00:29:22,108 --> 00:29:23,473
What's it look like?

471
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:25,033
Where's Joyce?

472
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:26,476
Oh, she's in the bedroom.

473
00:29:26,512 --> 00:29:28,412
Why don't you go on back?

474
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:30,938
Bet she's all stretched
out and waitin' for ya.

475
00:29:30,983 --> 00:29:34,043
Oh, now you shouldn't talk like that.

476
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:35,348
You know I'm about to be married.

477
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:43,821
Oh!

478
00:29:43,863 --> 00:29:44,852
Honey!

479
00:29:44,897 --> 00:29:46,194
Honey!

480
00:29:46,232 --> 00:29:49,861
Oh, God.

481
00:29:49,902 --> 00:29:51,995
Who did it, Lou?

482
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:53,164
It was suicide.

483
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:54,968
That doesn't make any sense.

484
00:29:55,007 --> 00:29:56,031
Oh, sure it does.

485
00:29:56,075 --> 00:29:57,337
You're just too stupid to see it.

486
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:29,766
I'm real sorry, sweetheart.

487
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:33,370
But I feel anguish,
and I'm sorry.

488
00:30:33,412 --> 00:30:34,811
I know you were scared.

489
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:36,542
You seemed awful surprised,
and I'm sorry.

490
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:55,424
Oh, shoot.

491
00:31:03,376 --> 00:31:04,343
God damn it, Lou.

492
00:31:04,377 --> 00:31:05,708
Oh.

493
00:31:05,745 --> 00:31:07,906
You tryin' to get killed
for Christ's sakes?

494
00:31:07,947 --> 00:31:09,244
Well, I'm real sorry, sir.

495
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:10,873
I had to pull in there with a flat tire,

496
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:12,178
and then I didn't see you when I--

497
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:13,515
Come on, let's go.

498
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:16,020
We don't have time to
stand around gabbin'.

499
00:31:16,055 --> 00:31:17,420
Well, it's still pretty early.

500
00:31:17,456 --> 00:31:18,889
The hell it is.

501
00:31:18,924 --> 00:31:21,051
It's quarter past 11:00,
and Elmer ain't home yet.

502
00:31:21,093 --> 00:31:22,617
He said he was gonna
come back right away,

503
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:24,219
and he ain't done it.

504
00:31:24,263 --> 00:31:25,525
Come on,
you follow me.

505
00:31:57,496 --> 00:32:00,192
Yeah, but don't tell me that again.

506
00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:03,463
I know how bad it is.

507
00:32:03,502 --> 00:32:06,665
He's dead,
and that is that.

508
00:32:06,705 --> 00:32:09,367
What I'm interested in now is her.

509
00:32:09,408 --> 00:32:10,397
Well, do it.

510
00:32:10,443 --> 00:32:13,344
Get on out here as quick as you can.

511
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:16,837
I don't want to see her die,
not this way.

512
00:32:16,882 --> 00:32:19,043
I want to see her burn.

513
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,387
Just get that ambulance out here now.

514
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:35,864
So, Lou, that's, uh...

515
00:32:35,901 --> 00:32:37,562
That's it?

516
00:32:37,603 --> 00:32:39,002
That's all you got to say?

517
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:42,599
Well, I told it five times.

518
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:45,610
I guess the only thing
I left out of it all...

519
00:32:45,644 --> 00:32:47,271
I feel awful sorry.

520
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:48,644
Well it's a bit late for that.

521
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:50,672
Tried to handle this
blackmail deal all by myself.

522
00:32:50,716 --> 00:32:54,208
You know, I sure wish I'd
come to you, Bob, with it.

523
00:32:54,253 --> 00:32:55,584
- It's okay, Lou.
- I really do.

524
00:32:55,621 --> 00:32:57,589
I would have, had it been
anybody other than Chester

525
00:32:57,623 --> 00:32:58,749
asking for help.

526
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,019
- You know that.
- It's all right.

527
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,186
Don't fret yourself about that.

528
00:33:02,228 --> 00:33:04,719
Well, I appreciate your understanding.

529
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:13,996
Well, get some sleep, partner.

530
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,438
Good night.

531
00:33:15,474 --> 00:33:17,339
Good night, boss.

532
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:34,990
Here's your food.

533
00:33:35,027 --> 00:33:36,153
Thank you, Max.

534
00:33:36,195 --> 00:33:39,460
Hey, Lou,
I need to ask you something.

535
00:33:39,498 --> 00:33:41,693
It's about Johnnie.

536
00:33:41,734 --> 00:33:44,168
He's taken a job at
Slim Murphy's and, uh...

537
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:46,797
Well, I hear bad things
about Slim Murphy.

538
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:49,307
So I was wondering--

539
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:50,740
Would you like me to check up on him?

540
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:51,800
Yeah, could you?

541
00:33:51,844 --> 00:33:53,903
I'd be happy to.

542
00:33:53,946 --> 00:33:54,970
Thank you.

543
00:33:55,014 --> 00:33:57,574
Appreciate it.

544
00:33:59,485 --> 00:34:01,715
I was glad to do Max a good turn.

545
00:34:01,754 --> 00:34:03,312
I knew Amy'd be waiting for me,

546
00:34:03,355 --> 00:34:05,915
and I knew she'd be mad as hell.

547
00:34:09,662 --> 00:34:12,927
Fathers are funny.

548
00:34:12,965 --> 00:34:15,126
They got ideas of their own.

549
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:17,294
And the good ones get
in your hair the most.

550
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:20,305
Dad thinks he knows
best about everything.

551
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:23,308
Slim Murphy hasn't got
a very good reputation.

552
00:34:23,342 --> 00:34:25,071
Now, nobody's proved
that he's been mixed up

553
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,977
in any of these car stripping
jobs, but if I were you--

554
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:29,776
Yeah, I know,
I know.

555
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:35,046
I won't get in any trouble, Lou.

556
00:34:35,087 --> 00:34:37,885
That sounds like a promise.

557
00:34:37,923 --> 00:34:40,414
I know you won't break a promise.

558
00:34:44,463 --> 00:34:47,125
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry, baby.

559
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:48,463
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry.

560
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,899
I had a whole lot of trouble tonight.

561
00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:51,232
I'll bet.

562
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,500
Well, you want to hear
about it or don't ya?

563
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:55,700
I've heard so many of
your lies and excuses,

564
00:34:55,741 --> 00:34:57,333
I may as well hear one more.

565
00:34:57,376 --> 00:34:59,037
All right.

566
00:34:59,078 --> 00:35:04,948
Well, it started about three months ago.

567
00:35:04,984 --> 00:35:07,043
Bob asked me to check
up on a prostitute.

568
00:35:09,355 --> 00:35:10,652
Yes?

569
00:35:18,664 --> 00:35:21,326
How could you be so stupid?

570
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:22,664
Why did you do that?

571
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:24,931
Well, I was doing a favor
for Chester Conway.

572
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,801
He wanted me to help
Elmer get out of a fix.

573
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:29,205
Why are you always have
to do people favors?

574
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:30,469
You never do any for me.

575
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:31,806
All right,
I shouldn't have done it.

576
00:35:31,844 --> 00:35:33,641
You shouldn't have let
that woman in this town

577
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:34,646
in the first place.

578
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,171
- No, I shouldn't have.
- Mm-mm.

579
00:35:37,216 --> 00:35:38,547
I don't understand.

580
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:39,983
Hey.

581
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:42,487
Lou.

582
00:35:42,521 --> 00:35:44,284
Stop that.

583
00:35:46,992 --> 00:35:49,893
Lou, stop that.

584
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,050
What's the matter, huh?

585
00:36:15,087 --> 00:36:17,920
All this trouble's just
thrown me for a loop.

586
00:36:17,956 --> 00:36:20,686
Forget everything but me.

587
00:36:20,726 --> 00:36:22,591
I want to.

588
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:24,755
Let me pet you.

589
00:36:37,576 --> 00:36:39,976
You son of a bitch!

590
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:40,979
Hey, what--

591
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:43,140
You dirty,
filthy bastard!

592
00:36:43,182 --> 00:36:44,171
You're dirty.

593
00:36:44,216 --> 00:36:45,410
I can tell,
I can smell it on you.

594
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:47,112
I can smell you've been screwing her.

595
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:48,119
What are you saying?

596
00:36:48,153 --> 00:36:49,120
You screwed her.

597
00:36:49,154 --> 00:36:50,314
You've been doing it all along.

598
00:36:50,355 --> 00:36:51,322
Come here.

599
00:36:51,356 --> 00:36:53,085
You don't touch me!

600
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,251
- Amy, listen.
- No.

601
00:36:54,293 --> 00:36:55,453
- Lou, stop it.
- Amy, look at me.

602
00:36:55,494 --> 00:36:56,961
Look at me.
It's Lou, honey.

603
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:59,293
The same Lou you've known all your life.

604
00:36:59,331 --> 00:37:01,322
Come on, open up.

605
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:03,990
Are you crazy?

606
00:37:04,036 --> 00:37:07,563
Why would I do that?

607
00:37:07,606 --> 00:37:09,972
You did do it.

608
00:37:10,008 --> 00:37:10,975
I know you did.

609
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:12,704
Amy, why?

610
00:37:12,745 --> 00:37:14,610
Stop.

611
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:16,978
Why would I run the risk
of losing a girl like you

612
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:18,710
by running around with some chippy?

613
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:20,241
Oh.

614
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:22,048
No use arguing about it.

615
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:23,782
Just thank my lucky stars

616
00:37:23,822 --> 00:37:25,983
I didn't catch some terrible disease.

617
00:37:26,024 --> 00:37:27,616
Hey.

618
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:28,751
Damn it, hey,
come here.

619
00:37:28,794 --> 00:37:31,786
Come here.

620
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,593
Now, you can say what you want about me,

621
00:37:33,632 --> 00:37:36,533
but don't say that the
girl I'm gonna marry

622
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:40,436
is sleeping with a guy who
would run around with whores.

623
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:41,734
You don't want to marry me.

624
00:37:41,774 --> 00:37:43,139
Yes, I do.

625
00:37:43,175 --> 00:37:45,200
I just didn't want to be told when.

626
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,911
I wanted to propose myself...

627
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,941
which is what I'm doing right now.

628
00:38:03,362 --> 00:38:04,329
Yeah, hello?

629
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:05,421
Hey, Lou, it's Bob.

630
00:38:05,464 --> 00:38:06,453
Bob, what's on your mind?

631
00:38:13,906 --> 00:38:15,430
Hiya, Lou.

632
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:16,702
Sorry to bother you.

633
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:19,040
I hope we didn't interrupt anything.

634
00:38:22,214 --> 00:38:24,614
You had a date for last night?

635
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,242
That's right.

636
00:38:26,285 --> 00:38:28,776
For what time?

637
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:31,346
Well, supposed to be
a little after 10:00,

638
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,516
the time I figured

639
00:38:32,558 --> 00:38:34,219
I'd be finished with
the Conway business.

640
00:38:36,428 --> 00:38:37,656
Who's the girl?

641
00:38:37,696 --> 00:38:38,890
Well, damn it.

642
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:40,728
Now, that I don't think
is any of your business.

643
00:38:40,766 --> 00:38:45,135
Howard, you know, you're kind
of a newcomer out this way,

644
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,104
but you ought to know
better than to ask a man

645
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:49,004
a question like that.

646
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,633
It's my job.

647
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:54,168
If Ford had himself a date
last night, then, uh...

648
00:38:54,213 --> 00:38:57,774
Well, you know what I mean, Ford.

649
00:38:57,816 --> 00:38:59,078
Well, no offense, Howard,

650
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:00,914
but I figured you did all
the jawing you had to do

651
00:39:00,953 --> 00:39:02,443
when I talked to you a couple hours ago.

652
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:03,454
You're wrong, brother.

653
00:39:03,488 --> 00:39:05,046
Okay, easy, Howard.

654
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,079
For cryin' out loud.

655
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:07,091
I know the girl.

656
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,319
I know her folks.

657
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,227
She's one of the nicest
little ladies in town.

658
00:39:11,263 --> 00:39:14,755
I ain't got the slightest doubt
that Lou had a date with her.

659
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,062
The more I'm around you people,

660
00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:18,296
the less I understand you.

661
00:39:27,913 --> 00:39:30,143
Come on.

662
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:34,977
Let's go.

663
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,420
Don't be shy.
Come on.

664
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,896
See that track there, Ford?

665
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,330
You know what caused that?

666
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:48,856
I reckon so.

667
00:39:48,901 --> 00:39:49,868
A flat tire.

668
00:39:49,902 --> 00:39:51,335
So you admit that.

669
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,964
That's the sort of track
you'd get from a flat tire.

670
00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:55,098
What's this all about, Bob?

671
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,869
You know,
I really don't know,

672
00:39:56,909 --> 00:39:58,171
but this is Howard's show,

673
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,837
so you might as well just answer him.

674
00:39:59,878 --> 00:40:01,778
Well, I already said it once.

675
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:04,111
You get that track from
a flat tire, yes, sir.

676
00:40:06,485 --> 00:40:08,646
Come see the track your tire made.

677
00:40:12,591 --> 00:40:14,286
Here we are.

678
00:40:14,326 --> 00:40:18,422
The tire that made
this track wasn't flat.

679
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:19,828
Well, I never said I had a flat tire

680
00:40:19,865 --> 00:40:21,162
when I pulled off the highway.

681
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,099
- Now, wait a minute.
- No, I had a puncture, sure.

682
00:40:23,135 --> 00:40:25,467
Felt the car sway a little,
but I pulled off the lane

683
00:40:25,504 --> 00:40:27,938
before the tire could really go down.

684
00:40:30,542 --> 00:40:34,808
I hope you boys didn't chew up a
perfectly good tire for nothin'.

685
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:40,977
Doggone it, Howard,

686
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:43,385
if this ain't the strangest damn deal.

687
00:40:50,062 --> 00:40:51,461
Getting away with a stupid mistake

688
00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:54,294
can be a blessing twice over.

689
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,130
When a man's rope slides off you once,

690
00:40:56,168 --> 00:40:58,636
he's mighty cautious about
making a second throw.

691
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,763
Feeling twitchy, Lou?

692
00:41:03,508 --> 00:41:05,567
Oh, it's just--

693
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,770
just a passing hunger.

694
00:41:06,812 --> 00:41:10,873
Yeah, I wouldn't mind
grabbing a bite myself.

695
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:14,181
Joyce was bound to die if
she wasn't dead already.

696
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:16,449
As soon as things quieted down,
I'd quit my job.

697
00:41:16,488 --> 00:41:17,819
I'd sell the house.

698
00:41:17,856 --> 00:41:20,450
I'd leave Central City once and for all.

699
00:41:20,492 --> 00:41:22,483
Ooh, those look good.

700
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:25,789
She still unconscious?

701
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:27,025
Yeah.

702
00:41:29,067 --> 00:41:30,034
Thank you.

703
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:31,092
And anything else for you?

704
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
No, I'm good,
thank you.

705
00:41:32,204 --> 00:41:35,571
Enjoy your food.

706
00:41:35,607 --> 00:41:39,270
Conway wants to fly her to Fort Worth.

707
00:41:39,311 --> 00:41:42,178
Says she can't get the right
kind of medical attention here.

708
00:41:43,815 --> 00:41:45,407
Yeah, well,
maybe I'll go myself.

709
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,678
What do you think, Lou?

710
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:49,448
Want to take a little
flight into Fort Worth?

711
00:41:49,488 --> 00:41:50,921
I've never been on an airplane.

712
00:41:50,956 --> 00:41:52,287
Wait a minute.

713
00:41:52,324 --> 00:41:55,350
She hasn't even been booked yet,
let alone arraigned.

714
00:41:56,962 --> 00:42:00,193
Well, Conway wasn't asking you

715
00:42:00,232 --> 00:42:01,722
if he could take her to Fort Worth.

716
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:04,133
He was telling ya.

717
00:42:04,169 --> 00:42:07,627
Did he say what time?

718
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:10,664
12:30.

719
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:12,870
Oh, well, that'll give Lou
and me time

720
00:42:12,911 --> 00:42:14,503
to scrub up a little and pack a bag.

721
00:42:14,546 --> 00:42:16,810
Right, Lou?

722
00:42:16,848 --> 00:42:18,873
Yeah.

723
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:20,885
What's the matter with those eggs, boy?

724
00:42:20,919 --> 00:42:23,410
Better eat 'em before they get cold.

725
00:42:25,557 --> 00:42:26,524
Don't.

726
00:42:26,558 --> 00:42:27,820
I have to travel.

727
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:29,224
Baby, you aren't goin' anywhere.

728
00:42:29,261 --> 00:42:30,558
I want to see her burn.

729
00:42:36,001 --> 00:42:37,525
First time on a plane,

730
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:39,935
and you waste the whole
damn trip sleepin'.

731
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:57,313
Take it easy.

732
00:43:02,861 --> 00:43:04,658
- Sheriff.
- Yes, sir?

733
00:43:04,696 --> 00:43:06,596
You go with the ambulance.

734
00:43:06,631 --> 00:43:08,826
Lou, come on.

735
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:10,892
You ride in the car with me.

736
00:43:12,537 --> 00:43:14,198
All right.

737
00:43:19,311 --> 00:43:21,176
You didn't like that,
did ya?

738
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:24,080
The way I spoke to ol' Bob Maples.

739
00:43:24,116 --> 00:43:26,710
But I have a reputation,
and I'm not about to

740
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:31,154
let anybody's tender
feelings get in my way.

741
00:43:31,189 --> 00:43:32,622
If she pulls through this operation,

742
00:43:32,657 --> 00:43:35,251
she's gonna be able to talk tonight.

743
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:36,385
I want you to be there

744
00:43:36,428 --> 00:43:37,918
when she comes out of that anesthetic.

745
00:43:37,963 --> 00:43:39,123
What about Bob?

746
00:43:39,164 --> 00:43:42,327
Bob Maples is too old to be on his toes.

747
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,465
You can use my hotel suite.

748
00:43:47,506 --> 00:43:50,100
You just come over
when I give you a call.

749
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,874
Let's go to the hospital.

750
00:44:05,757 --> 00:44:08,419
Conway thought he was a big shot.

751
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,087
But his son had just been killed

752
00:44:10,128 --> 00:44:12,790
by a whore he'd fallen in love with,

753
00:44:12,831 --> 00:44:14,958
and he'd never be able to live it down,

754
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,865
not if he lived to be 100,

755
00:44:16,902 --> 00:44:19,803
and I damned well hoped he would.

756
00:44:23,074 --> 00:44:25,099
It was the first time I'd
been out of West Texas,

757
00:44:25,143 --> 00:44:28,203
and I wanted to see the sights.

758
00:44:28,246 --> 00:44:31,409
Instead, I had to stay
cooped up in the hotel.

759
00:44:33,485 --> 00:44:36,943
It was almost like there
was a plot against me.

760
00:44:36,988 --> 00:44:39,513
I had done something
wrong when I was a kid,

761
00:44:39,558 --> 00:44:42,550
and I'd had my nose rubbed
in it day after day

762
00:44:42,594 --> 00:44:44,118
until like an overtrained dog,

763
00:44:44,162 --> 00:44:46,630
I started crapping out of pure fright.

764
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:51,102
Hey there, Lou.

765
00:44:51,136 --> 00:44:53,570
Hey, Bob.

766
00:44:53,605 --> 00:44:55,664
Quite a palace.

767
00:44:59,578 --> 00:45:01,603
You know, Bob, I want you
to know that I'm awful sorry

768
00:45:01,646 --> 00:45:03,443
about what happened out
there at the airport.

769
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:08,374
I didn't like it one bit,
and I-- I told Conway that too.

770
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:16,052
Did you have some kind of
trouble out at the hospital?

771
00:45:19,097 --> 00:45:20,860
She's dead, Lou.

772
00:45:25,237 --> 00:45:27,432
She never came out of the ether.

773
00:45:39,251 --> 00:45:40,650
Well, that's that.

774
00:45:40,685 --> 00:45:44,018
Mm-hmm.

775
00:46:18,223 --> 00:46:19,190
Hey, Lou.

776
00:46:19,224 --> 00:46:21,192
Where are ya, buddy?

777
00:46:21,226 --> 00:46:22,523
Lou.

778
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,652
What you doin'?

779
00:46:23,695 --> 00:46:25,959
What you doin' sitting here?

780
00:46:25,997 --> 00:46:28,397
Oh, I'm just having a smoke.

781
00:46:30,035 --> 00:46:32,003
Well, you can smoke out here.

782
00:46:32,037 --> 00:46:33,026
Come on.

783
00:46:33,071 --> 00:46:35,232
Free booze.

784
00:46:36,975 --> 00:46:39,068
I know what you are, Lou.

785
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,668
I know what you are.

786
00:46:42,414 --> 00:46:43,608
I know.

787
00:46:43,648 --> 00:46:48,142
I know you backwards and forwards.

788
00:46:48,186 --> 00:46:51,019
I knowed you since you was
knee-high to a grasshopper,

789
00:46:51,056 --> 00:46:53,354
and you ain't never done anything wrong.

790
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,594
Maybe I'm behind the times.

791
00:46:57,629 --> 00:46:59,893
Maybe...

792
00:46:59,931 --> 00:47:01,523
Maybe I'm too old for this game.

793
00:47:02,834 --> 00:47:05,200
Why don't you lay down awhile, Bob?

794
00:47:05,236 --> 00:47:07,227
Ain't gonna skip out on me,
are ya?

795
00:47:09,908 --> 00:47:12,069
Just pull up,

796
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:14,908
have yourself a drink on Mr. Conway,

797
00:47:14,946 --> 00:47:18,473
and enjoy it.

798
00:47:27,692 --> 00:47:31,788
# I heard a lonely coyote
a- howlin' for its mate #

799
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:33,957
# I took the blues and packed my shoes #

800
00:47:33,998 --> 00:47:36,091
# and left the Lone Star State #

801
00:47:36,134 --> 00:47:38,432
# I thought if I should ride away #

802
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,233
# I would lose the blues #

803
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:42,466
# But I found out that Texan soil #

804
00:47:42,507 --> 00:47:44,065
# Was sticking to my shoes #

805
00:47:44,109 --> 00:47:47,135
# I'm headin' back #

806
00:47:47,178 --> 00:47:51,205
# I've got the Texas blues #

807
00:48:16,074 --> 00:48:18,042
When's the next train for Central City?

808
00:48:18,076 --> 00:48:22,308
Well, sir, we've got one
leavin' tonight at 7:00.

809
00:48:22,347 --> 00:48:23,473
Well, that'd be all right.

810
00:48:23,515 --> 00:48:24,982
- All right.
- Two passengers.

811
00:48:25,016 --> 00:48:26,813
Thank you, ma'am.

812
00:48:29,287 --> 00:48:30,549
Bob.

813
00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:31,555
Whoa.

814
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:32,783
You're gonna spill your drink.

815
00:48:32,824 --> 00:48:34,917
Oh.

816
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:36,153
Boy, I'm as frazzled

817
00:48:36,194 --> 00:48:39,095
as a cow's hide under a branding iron.

818
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:43,965
Oh, why you always do that
sly grin, spilled-milk stuff?

819
00:48:47,138 --> 00:48:51,438
Well, I bet I know somethin'
you never thought of.

820
00:48:51,476 --> 00:48:52,966
What's that?

821
00:48:55,046 --> 00:48:59,005
It's always lightest...

822
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:01,814
just before the dark.

823
00:49:05,457 --> 00:49:06,481
You got it wrong, Bob.

824
00:49:06,524 --> 00:49:09,823
No, Lou,
you got it wrong.

825
00:49:13,765 --> 00:49:16,734
It's always lightest before the dark.

826
00:49:27,145 --> 00:49:29,705
You mind if I come in, Lou?

827
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:30,975
Not at all,
Mr. Rothman.

828
00:49:31,015 --> 00:49:32,880
All right.

829
00:49:36,488 --> 00:49:39,389
This is very nice.

830
00:49:39,424 --> 00:49:41,619
It's very nice.

831
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:42,648
Want some coffee?

832
00:49:42,694 --> 00:49:43,661
No, thank you.

833
00:49:43,695 --> 00:49:46,289
Would you like an egg?

834
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:48,094
Oh, no, thank you.

835
00:49:50,735 --> 00:49:53,499
So very discreet newspaper
stories are correct

836
00:49:53,538 --> 00:49:55,335
in their hints?

837
00:49:55,373 --> 00:49:58,342
That Elmer tried to dish it out
and had it thrown back at him?

838
00:49:59,878 --> 00:50:01,869
Well, it looks that way,
doesn't it?

839
00:50:01,913 --> 00:50:04,177
I can't help but wondering how
a girl with her face caved in

840
00:50:04,215 --> 00:50:05,307
and her neck broke

841
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,715
can land four bull's-eyes on a guy,

842
00:50:06,751 --> 00:50:08,309
I mean, even one
as large as Elmer Conway.

843
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:11,151
Well, she was shooting him

844
00:50:11,189 --> 00:50:12,520
while he was punching her.

845
00:50:12,557 --> 00:50:13,785
Well, from what I hear, she--

846
00:50:13,825 --> 00:50:16,157
she was still alive after he died,

847
00:50:16,194 --> 00:50:18,958
and any one or, well,
two of the bullets

848
00:50:18,997 --> 00:50:23,627
that she put into him were
enough to lay him low.

849
00:50:23,668 --> 00:50:24,692
You know?

850
00:50:24,736 --> 00:50:26,567
The genuine article, Lou.

851
00:50:26,604 --> 00:50:28,367
No substitutes accepted.

852
00:50:28,406 --> 00:50:31,239
I don't know where you
get off in questioning me.

853
00:50:31,276 --> 00:50:32,834
Well, I know you had it in for Conway,

854
00:50:32,877 --> 00:50:35,004
and perhaps I share some
of that responsibility

855
00:50:35,046 --> 00:50:37,412
for setting you against him.

856
00:50:37,448 --> 00:50:39,313
I just don't want anything to come out

857
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,284
that might put the union in a bad light.

858
00:50:43,221 --> 00:50:45,621
Oh, my, well,
it hadn't occurred to me,

859
00:50:45,657 --> 00:50:46,715
but now that you say it...

860
00:50:46,758 --> 00:50:49,283
sure looks bad.

861
00:50:51,729 --> 00:50:54,459
Incidentally, what's
the score as of today?

862
00:50:54,499 --> 00:50:56,433
A one or a two?

863
00:50:58,169 --> 00:51:00,069
She's dead.

864
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:12,713
Well, they can't prove anything.

865
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,183
But then again,

866
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:17,153
if they knew what I know

867
00:51:17,188 --> 00:51:19,520
about you having a motive.

868
00:51:19,557 --> 00:51:21,923
A motive...

869
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,359
for killing Joyce Lakeland?

870
00:51:23,394 --> 00:51:24,884
Why would I want to do that?

871
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:27,625
Say she's just a piece of stage setting.

872
00:51:27,665 --> 00:51:28,927
I can't tell you what happened,

873
00:51:28,967 --> 00:51:31,060
'cause I wasn't there.

874
00:51:31,102 --> 00:51:32,729
But I know that there
are flukes in murders

875
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,294
just as there are in anything else.

876
00:51:34,339 --> 00:51:35,829
A woman gets her brains blown out

877
00:51:35,873 --> 00:51:37,204
and she crawls five miles.

878
00:51:37,241 --> 00:51:41,143
Some fella gets hanged and
poisoned and chopped up,

879
00:51:41,179 --> 00:51:42,908
and he goes right on living.

880
00:51:42,947 --> 00:51:44,744
I don't know why those things happen.

881
00:51:44,782 --> 00:51:47,683
But I know they do,
and so do you.

882
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:49,914
Yeah, I guess so, Lou.

883
00:51:49,954 --> 00:51:51,819
I guess so.

884
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,322
You know, as screwy
as things are...

885
00:52:00,365 --> 00:52:03,732
you just don't fit the bill as a killer.

886
00:52:03,768 --> 00:52:05,565
Oh.

887
00:52:05,603 --> 00:52:07,230
Well, what do I say to that?

888
00:52:07,271 --> 00:52:10,263
What were you trying to pull off?

889
00:52:16,114 --> 00:52:19,550
The money was supposed to be a payoff.

890
00:52:19,584 --> 00:52:22,348
Conway was paying Joyce
to leave Elmer alone.

891
00:52:22,387 --> 00:52:25,254
So Elmer was trying to
leave with the whore.

892
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:27,189
That's right.

893
00:52:28,626 --> 00:52:32,255
Almost wish I thought of it myself, Lou.

894
00:52:32,296 --> 00:52:36,858
Just a matter of a will finding a way.

895
00:52:36,901 --> 00:52:38,493
Better watch that stuff, Lou.

896
00:52:41,139 --> 00:52:43,767
You save that for the birds, huh?

897
00:53:35,226 --> 00:53:36,386
Do you want to box?

898
00:53:38,029 --> 00:53:39,656
Now you're a real boxer.

899
00:53:39,697 --> 00:53:41,528
You look like a man.

900
00:53:45,837 --> 00:53:47,327
Oh!

901
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:49,464
Hit harder.

902
00:53:49,507 --> 00:53:50,599
Ow.

903
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,147
You want to be a big boy?

904
00:54:04,188 --> 00:54:07,954
Look what your daddy did.

905
00:54:07,992 --> 00:54:09,186
Do you want to do it too?

906
00:54:15,967 --> 00:54:17,662
It's okay.

907
00:54:17,702 --> 00:54:19,192
I like it when you hurt me.

908
00:54:59,177 --> 00:55:00,701
Lou Ford speaking.

909
00:55:00,745 --> 00:55:02,406
Howard, Lou.

910
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:04,710
Got some news on the Conway murder.

911
00:55:04,749 --> 00:55:06,273
Yeah?

912
00:55:06,317 --> 00:55:07,648
We got him.

913
00:55:07,685 --> 00:55:08,674
What?

914
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:09,913
We got him, Lou.

915
00:55:09,954 --> 00:55:11,888
Think you know him.

916
00:55:11,923 --> 00:55:13,015
Who?

917
00:55:13,057 --> 00:55:16,185
Johnnie Pappas.

918
00:55:16,227 --> 00:55:17,592
Johnnie Pappas?

919
00:55:17,628 --> 00:55:18,925
Yup.

920
00:55:18,963 --> 00:55:20,863
Come on down to the courthouse.
He's been asking for you.

921
00:55:33,044 --> 00:55:34,705
Sweet talk him, Lou.

922
00:55:34,745 --> 00:55:37,839
Well, who am I to be
telling you what to do, huh?

923
00:55:37,882 --> 00:55:39,975
Well, you haven't told me anything yet.

924
00:55:40,017 --> 00:55:41,416
Not anything that makes any sense.

925
00:55:41,452 --> 00:55:44,148
Now, I know Johnnie's been
bucking the saddle a little bit,

926
00:55:44,188 --> 00:55:47,248
but I don't see him as a murderer.

927
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:50,852
Elmer Conway took 10,000 bucks
around to that chippy's house.

928
00:55:50,895 --> 00:55:54,456
When we counted it up,
$500 was missing.

929
00:55:54,498 --> 00:55:55,465
Yeah?

930
00:55:55,499 --> 00:55:57,228
The bills were all marked, see?

931
00:55:57,268 --> 00:55:59,236
The old man had already
tipped off the local banks.

932
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:01,204
If she tried to hang around
town after the payoff,

933
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:03,002
he was gonna squeeze her for blackmail.

934
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,133
That Conway,
they don't put many past him.

935
00:56:05,176 --> 00:56:08,703
Well, seems like they put a few past me.

936
00:56:08,746 --> 00:56:11,237
Oh, come on Lou, you got
no reason to feel like that.

937
00:56:11,282 --> 00:56:14,149
All right,
let it go.

938
00:56:14,185 --> 00:56:15,846
So Johnnie spent some
of the money, then?

939
00:56:15,887 --> 00:56:16,979
$20.

940
00:56:17,021 --> 00:56:18,716
Broke it at the drugstore last night.

941
00:56:18,756 --> 00:56:20,883
Traced it back to him
a couple hours ago.

942
00:56:20,925 --> 00:56:22,222
Now, he could've taken that $20 in

943
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,955
and paid himself with it.

944
00:56:23,995 --> 00:56:25,519
But he couldn't admit to it.

945
00:56:25,563 --> 00:56:28,054
And here's the kick.

946
00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:29,862
From about 9:00 Sunday
night until 11:00,

947
00:56:29,901 --> 00:56:31,425
his time can't be accounted for.

948
00:56:31,469 --> 00:56:34,165
We can't account for it,

949
00:56:34,205 --> 00:56:36,435
and he just won't.

950
00:56:36,474 --> 00:56:37,998
I know how you feel, Lou.

951
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:39,566
He's just a kid,
and you know him.

952
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,771
But you got to think about how
that poor woman must've felt

953
00:56:41,812 --> 00:56:43,871
when he was beating her face in.

954
00:56:43,915 --> 00:56:45,712
You saw what her face looked like.

955
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,717
Stewed meat.

956
00:56:46,751 --> 00:56:47,718
Hamburger.

957
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:49,447
Oh, for Christ's sake.

958
00:56:49,487 --> 00:56:52,115
Hey, I'm sorry, Lou,
but that's the truth of it.

959
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:56,286
All right.

960
00:56:58,696 --> 00:57:00,129
Sweet talk him, Lou.

961
00:57:06,003 --> 00:57:08,096
I know this one.

962
00:57:08,139 --> 00:57:10,073
Hey, Ford,
get me out of here!

963
00:57:10,107 --> 00:57:12,200
He's in the back.

964
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:22,513
Want me to wait?

965
00:57:22,553 --> 00:57:23,542
No, I'll be all right.

966
00:57:23,587 --> 00:57:26,613
Thank you.

967
00:57:26,657 --> 00:57:27,624
Hey, Lou.

968
00:57:27,658 --> 00:57:28,647
How ya doin', Johnnie?

969
00:57:28,693 --> 00:57:29,660
Oh, I knew you'd come.

970
00:57:29,694 --> 00:57:30,683
I sent for you.

971
00:57:30,728 --> 00:57:32,127
Everything's gonna be all right.

972
00:57:32,163 --> 00:57:33,255
Sure.

973
00:57:33,297 --> 00:57:34,924
You got a cigarette, Lou?

974
00:57:34,966 --> 00:57:36,490
Those bastards took all my cigarettes.

975
00:57:36,534 --> 00:57:40,595
Ah, they're just doing their duty, kid.

976
00:57:40,638 --> 00:57:43,129
Have a cigar.

977
00:57:43,174 --> 00:57:45,165
I'll have one with ya.

978
00:57:45,209 --> 00:57:47,302
I don't know how you
can stand it in here.

979
00:57:47,345 --> 00:57:51,076
Sure driving me crazy.

980
00:57:51,115 --> 00:57:55,916
Well, it'd drive anyone crazy.

981
00:57:55,953 --> 00:57:59,480
I think that's the idea.

982
00:57:59,523 --> 00:58:00,547
How soon can I leave?

983
00:58:03,127 --> 00:58:05,288
It won't be long now.

984
00:58:18,476 --> 00:58:19,875
Say, you didn't tell those fellas

985
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:21,810
about that $20 bill
I gave you, did you?

986
00:58:21,846 --> 00:58:22,938
No.

987
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:25,676
What do you think I am, anyway?

988
00:58:25,716 --> 00:58:28,082
Gosh, I know you don't
make a lot of money.

989
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:30,019
You know, if someone
should slip you a little tip,

990
00:58:30,054 --> 00:58:32,955
I'm not gonna say anything.

991
00:58:34,558 --> 00:58:36,617
I don't take bribes, Johnnie.

992
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:42,231
Well, who said anything about bribes?

993
00:58:42,266 --> 00:58:44,860
You just said something about a bribe.

994
00:58:44,902 --> 00:58:46,893
Well, I just wasn't gonna
let 'em hit ya cold with it

995
00:58:46,937 --> 00:58:48,529
until you figured out

996
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:50,699
or remembered where you found it.

997
00:58:50,741 --> 00:58:53,733
I wish you hadn't done that.

998
00:58:53,778 --> 00:58:56,303
You understand?

999
00:58:56,347 --> 00:58:58,907
You understand that was
the wrong thing to do.

1000
00:59:00,051 --> 00:59:03,145
I don't care about those guys.

1001
00:59:03,187 --> 00:59:04,916
You're my friend.

1002
00:59:14,532 --> 00:59:17,399
I've got a foot on both
sides of the fence.

1003
00:59:17,435 --> 00:59:21,428
They were put there early,

1004
00:59:21,472 --> 00:59:24,270
and they stayed put.

1005
00:59:24,308 --> 00:59:28,972
I can't move.
I can't jump.

1006
00:59:29,013 --> 00:59:34,576
All I can do is wait until I split

1007
00:59:34,618 --> 00:59:37,883
right down the middle.

1008
00:59:37,922 --> 00:59:40,220
You get it?

1009
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,253
Yeah.

1010
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,367
I killed them.

1011
00:59:53,404 --> 00:59:54,928
I killed both of them.

1012
00:59:58,742 --> 01:00:00,403
Bet you had a real good reason, Lou.

1013
01:00:00,444 --> 01:00:02,639
There's a reason.

1014
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,478
I bet they had it comin'.

1015
01:00:05,516 --> 01:00:06,847
No.

1016
01:00:06,884 --> 01:00:09,546
Nobody has it comin' to them.

1017
01:00:11,689 --> 01:00:13,953
That's why nobody can see it comin'.

1018
01:00:24,301 --> 01:00:27,031
Hi.

1019
01:00:27,071 --> 01:00:29,403
Give ya any trouble, Lou?

1020
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,930
Not at all.

1021
01:01:19,823 --> 01:01:21,120
Hi, honey.

1022
01:01:21,158 --> 01:01:22,489
I'm sorry.

1023
01:01:22,526 --> 01:01:23,754
It's all right.

1024
01:01:23,794 --> 01:01:24,886
Where have you been?

1025
01:02:35,866 --> 01:02:36,890
Yeah, hello?

1026
01:02:36,934 --> 01:02:37,901
Lou.

1027
01:02:37,935 --> 01:02:39,027
Hendricks.

1028
01:02:39,069 --> 01:02:40,263
What is it, Howard?
It's late.

1029
01:02:40,304 --> 01:02:41,771
Johnnie Pappas.

1030
01:02:41,805 --> 01:02:43,466
You really put the fear
of God into the boy.

1031
01:02:43,507 --> 01:02:45,532
Sign a confession,
did he?

1032
01:02:45,576 --> 01:02:46,736
Well, more than that, Lou.

1033
01:02:46,777 --> 01:02:48,142
He hanged himself.

1034
01:02:48,178 --> 01:02:49,577
Thank you for calling, Howard.

1035
01:02:49,613 --> 01:02:52,104
I appreciate it.

1036
01:02:56,587 --> 01:03:00,318
What was that all about?

1037
01:03:00,357 --> 01:03:03,986
Hmm?

1038
01:03:04,028 --> 01:03:05,655
Johnnie Pappas hanged himself.

1039
01:03:07,264 --> 01:03:09,425
Oh, no, Lou.

1040
01:03:14,071 --> 01:03:16,733
Baby, I'm so sorry.

1041
01:03:27,184 --> 01:03:29,516
After Johnnie's death,
somethin' changed.

1042
01:03:29,553 --> 01:03:32,147
It wasn't anything I
could put my finger on,

1043
01:03:32,189 --> 01:03:34,157
but I got the feeling that
people were looking at me

1044
01:03:34,191 --> 01:03:35,385
in a different way.

1045
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:48,402
Bob Maples kept on drinkin',

1046
01:03:48,439 --> 01:03:50,930
and he seemed to age about ten years.

1047
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:55,405
And nobody talked about Johnnie.

1048
01:03:55,446 --> 01:03:58,677
But that didn't stop me
from thinking about him,

1049
01:03:58,716 --> 01:04:00,343
and I realized a week had gone by,

1050
01:04:00,384 --> 01:04:03,478
and I hadn't paid my
respects to Max Pappas.

1051
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,147
And here's a look at
the weather picture.

1052
01:04:05,189 --> 01:04:06,383
It's gonna be the same.

1053
01:04:06,423 --> 01:04:08,118
Clear today,
turning cooler this afternoon.

1054
01:04:08,158 --> 01:04:09,648
Clear and colder tonight and tomorrow.

1055
01:04:14,231 --> 01:04:16,495
I'm sorry, Officer Ford,
we're not open for business.

1056
01:04:16,533 --> 01:04:18,364
Well, that's all right.

1057
01:04:18,402 --> 01:04:19,369
That's all right, Max.

1058
01:04:19,403 --> 01:04:22,668
I just wanted to--

1059
01:04:22,706 --> 01:04:24,003
I just wanted to come by,

1060
01:04:24,041 --> 01:04:27,636
and I've been meaning to
come by since that night,

1061
01:04:27,678 --> 01:04:30,169
and I wanted to just
tell you how sorry I am

1062
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:33,445
and had there been
anything I could've done,

1063
01:04:33,484 --> 01:04:34,451
I would've done it.

1064
01:04:34,485 --> 01:04:36,112
You know that.

1065
01:04:36,153 --> 01:04:38,485
I'm sorry that you're closing down.

1066
01:04:38,522 --> 01:04:39,648
I'm not closing.

1067
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,157
Why should I close?

1068
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:43,125
Just remodeling it.

1069
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,253
Adding some new booths,
a new floor.

1070
01:04:45,295 --> 01:04:48,162
Just like Johnnie would've liked it.

1071
01:04:50,334 --> 01:04:51,323
Well, that's right.

1072
01:04:58,876 --> 01:05:00,707
Hurry up, Reggie.

1073
01:05:01,245 --> 01:05:02,610
But remember the Flick
rear window sticker

1074
01:05:02,646 --> 01:05:06,138
can be the only contest sticker
of its kind on your car.

1075
01:05:12,089 --> 01:05:13,647
- Did I do this?
- Mm-hmm.

1076
01:05:15,192 --> 01:05:18,491
# If #

1077
01:05:18,529 --> 01:05:24,126
# You wait for me #

1078
01:05:24,168 --> 01:05:27,467
# Until #

1079
01:05:27,504 --> 01:05:32,965
# I come back home #

1080
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:36,241
# From far #

1081
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:40,842
# Across the sea #

1082
01:05:40,884 --> 01:05:44,911
# I'll sing you my #

1083
01:05:44,955 --> 01:05:50,325
# Korean love song #

1084
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,557
# I know #

1085
01:05:53,597 --> 01:05:58,899
# You're lonely too #

1086
01:05:58,936 --> 01:06:02,030
# The days #

1087
01:06:02,072 --> 01:06:07,567
# And nights are long #

1088
01:06:07,611 --> 01:06:10,842
# But hear #

1089
01:06:10,881 --> 01:06:16,217
# My love for you #

1090
01:06:16,253 --> 01:06:19,711
# In my #

1091
01:06:19,756 --> 01:06:22,919
# Korean love song #

1092
01:06:34,304 --> 01:06:38,434
Mind if I join ya?

1093
01:06:38,475 --> 01:06:40,375
Thanks.

1094
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:42,401
I knew you wouldn't.

1095
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:49,883
So you're visiting the
scene of the crime.

1096
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,219
That's what they call it,
isn't it?

1097
01:06:53,257 --> 01:06:55,885
What do you want?

1098
01:06:55,926 --> 01:06:57,120
I saw you headin' out this way,

1099
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,525
and I wanted to have a little talk.

1100
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,333
How many times you come here, Lou?

1101
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,634
How many times you lay her?

1102
01:07:13,043 --> 01:07:16,444
I'm not so hard up for it
that I have to lay whores.

1103
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,072
Sure.

1104
01:07:18,115 --> 01:07:22,211
Tail like that,
man can live without, I suppose.

1105
01:07:22,252 --> 01:07:24,982
But what could be
substitute for bullshit?

1106
01:07:25,022 --> 01:07:28,753
Where would we be without it?

1107
01:07:28,792 --> 01:07:30,953
Well...

1108
01:07:30,994 --> 01:07:34,020
I wouldn't be listening to you now.

1109
01:07:34,064 --> 01:07:36,498
Okay, let's cut the bullshit.

1110
01:07:36,533 --> 01:07:38,660
Now, we both know that Conway's looking

1111
01:07:38,702 --> 01:07:41,296
to pin Elmer's murder on someone,

1112
01:07:41,338 --> 01:07:45,138
and I'm just trying to make sure
that he doesn't pin it on me.

1113
01:07:45,175 --> 01:07:47,769
Why would he do that?

1114
01:07:47,811 --> 01:07:49,438
Well, Conway hates the union

1115
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:51,447
almost as much as I hate him.

1116
01:07:54,351 --> 01:07:56,911
Johnnie Pappas killed Elmer.

1117
01:07:56,954 --> 01:07:58,114
That's why he hanged himself.

1118
01:07:59,823 --> 01:08:01,757
You been talking to Max Pappas?

1119
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:02,986
I was.

1120
01:08:03,026 --> 01:08:04,653
Now, where do you
suppose he got the money

1121
01:08:04,695 --> 01:08:05,753
for that kind of remodeling?

1122
01:08:05,796 --> 01:08:08,492
- Not my place to consider it.
- No.

1123
01:08:08,532 --> 01:08:10,363
Chester Conway's jobbing
all the material.

1124
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,563
He's paying off all the men.

1125
01:08:13,604 --> 01:08:17,165
I mean, no one's seen a
nickel coming from Pappas.

1126
01:08:17,207 --> 01:08:18,970
I mean, doesn't that strike you
as rather odd

1127
01:08:19,009 --> 01:08:20,374
that he'd be doing a job for a man

1128
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:23,937
whose son killed his boy?

1129
01:08:23,981 --> 01:08:27,212
Conway takes all the
turnkey stuff he can get.

1130
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,343
Cuts half a dozen
profits instead of one.

1131
01:08:29,386 --> 01:08:32,719
Well, I suppose so.

1132
01:08:32,756 --> 01:08:34,587
So you been out to Johnnie's grave?

1133
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:37,492
No, I'm ashamed to say
I haven't done that yet.

1134
01:08:37,527 --> 01:08:39,324
Yeah, I bet.

1135
01:08:39,363 --> 01:08:41,797
You know,
he's buried on sacred ground.

1136
01:08:41,832 --> 01:08:44,130
You know what that means, Lou?

1137
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:46,692
I reckon the church
didn't call it a suicide.

1138
01:08:46,737 --> 01:08:47,761
Have any answer, Lou?

1139
01:08:47,804 --> 01:08:49,237
Do we have an answer?

1140
01:08:49,272 --> 01:08:53,038
Well, he was so awful young,
I figure they cut him a break.

1141
01:08:57,981 --> 01:09:02,441
Yeah, maybe.

1142
01:09:02,486 --> 01:09:05,546
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

1143
01:09:07,424 --> 01:09:09,358
You know,
there's just one more thing.

1144
01:09:09,393 --> 01:09:11,691
It's the big thing.

1145
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:15,462
Now, on the Sunday night that Elmer

1146
01:09:15,499 --> 01:09:17,592
and the late occupant
of this cottage got it,

1147
01:09:17,634 --> 01:09:22,367
one of my carpenters went to
the picture show at the Palace.

1148
01:09:22,406 --> 01:09:29,209
Parked his car around
back at around 9:30.

1149
01:09:29,246 --> 01:09:33,444
When he came back,
all four of his tires were gone.

1150
01:09:33,483 --> 01:09:34,848
Well, that's funny.

1151
01:09:34,885 --> 01:09:36,546
I didn't hear anything about it.

1152
01:09:36,586 --> 01:09:41,216
It'd been funny if you had,
Lou, 'cause he didn't report it.

1153
01:09:41,258 --> 01:09:42,691
But he did mention it to one of the boys

1154
01:09:42,726 --> 01:09:44,159
at the Tuesday joiners' meeting,

1155
01:09:44,194 --> 01:09:46,628
and one of them, it turned out
bought two of the tires

1156
01:09:46,663 --> 01:09:49,223
from Johnnie Pappas.

1157
01:09:54,404 --> 01:09:56,338
You feelin' the chill, Lou?

1158
01:09:57,874 --> 01:09:59,341
Jeez, I guess I don't get you.

1159
01:09:59,376 --> 01:10:02,106
The birds, Lou.

1160
01:10:02,145 --> 01:10:04,204
Remember?

1161
01:10:04,247 --> 01:10:05,805
Starving sparrows.

1162
01:10:09,586 --> 01:10:12,316
If Johnnie Pappas had an alibi
for the night of the murders,

1163
01:10:12,355 --> 01:10:13,379
then he would've told me,

1164
01:10:13,423 --> 01:10:15,914
and he wouldn't have hanged himself.

1165
01:10:15,959 --> 01:10:17,586
He trusted you.

1166
01:10:19,963 --> 01:10:20,930
He liked you.

1167
01:10:20,964 --> 01:10:22,431
You were his friend.

1168
01:10:26,403 --> 01:10:28,701
I was his friend.

1169
01:10:33,043 --> 01:10:34,032
Okay.

1170
01:10:34,077 --> 01:10:36,807
That's fine.

1171
01:10:36,847 --> 01:10:38,041
That's fine, Lou.

1172
01:10:38,081 --> 01:10:41,448
But you think you're so clever,
don't ya?

1173
01:10:41,485 --> 01:10:44,943
But Conway,
he ain't no fool.

1174
01:10:44,988 --> 01:10:47,115
So if I were you,
I wouldn't hang around.

1175
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,921
You know, I thought about
leaving town.

1176
01:10:51,962 --> 01:10:52,929
Yeah?

1177
01:10:52,963 --> 01:10:56,729
Sounds like a good idea, Lou.

1178
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:59,565
That's a good idea.

1179
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,099
What?

1180
01:11:32,135 --> 01:11:33,102
What?

1181
01:11:37,274 --> 01:11:39,742
- Lou, why don't we--
- Amy, why--

1182
01:11:39,776 --> 01:11:41,801
- Bread 'n butter.
- Bread 'n butter.

1183
01:11:41,845 --> 01:11:44,177
Bad luck stay away from my darlin'.

1184
01:11:44,214 --> 01:11:46,273
You do want to still, right?

1185
01:11:46,316 --> 01:11:47,476
Honest and truly?

1186
01:11:47,517 --> 01:11:49,678
Didn't I just start to ask you?

1187
01:11:49,719 --> 01:11:50,686
How?

1188
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,687
When?

1189
01:11:51,721 --> 01:11:53,120
I mean,
what were you--

1190
01:11:53,156 --> 01:11:55,420
Well, I was thinking in a couple weeks--

1191
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:56,891
I was thinking the same.

1192
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,417
Darlin', I was just gonna say that.

1193
01:11:58,461 --> 01:11:59,428
What?

1194
01:11:59,462 --> 01:12:00,429
Well, I was gonna--

1195
01:12:00,463 --> 01:12:01,452
What were you thinking?

1196
01:12:01,498 --> 01:12:02,965
I was thinking that we should elope.

1197
01:12:06,903 --> 01:12:10,395
You want to elope?

1198
01:12:45,342 --> 01:12:46,832
This Doc Ford's place?

1199
01:12:46,877 --> 01:12:48,037
Well, I'm sorry, stranger,

1200
01:12:48,078 --> 01:12:49,568
the doctor doesn't practice anymore.

1201
01:12:49,613 --> 01:12:50,705
Oh, that's okay, bud.

1202
01:12:50,747 --> 01:12:51,736
It's just a little burn.

1203
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:53,373
Doesn't make any difference.

1204
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:57,079
Yeah, a cigar burn.

1205
01:12:58,555 --> 01:13:03,891
See, you and me, we got some
talkin' to do and, uh...

1206
01:13:03,927 --> 01:13:04,894
I'm thirsty.

1207
01:13:04,928 --> 01:13:07,590
You got any whisky around?

1208
01:13:07,631 --> 01:13:08,859
No, but I got a phone.

1209
01:13:08,899 --> 01:13:10,526
The jail's about six blocks away.

1210
01:13:10,567 --> 01:13:12,535
Well, why don't you go
right ahead with that, bud?

1211
01:13:12,569 --> 01:13:14,161
Go right ahead.

1212
01:13:14,204 --> 01:13:16,536
But it'll cost ya.

1213
01:13:16,573 --> 01:13:19,098
And it won't be just the
price of one burned hand.

1214
01:13:30,654 --> 01:13:32,144
All right,
let's have it.

1215
01:13:32,188 --> 01:13:34,986
I did a year stretch at
the Houston pea farm,

1216
01:13:35,025 --> 01:13:36,822
and I seen a couple of guys like you.

1217
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:38,191
Is that right?

1218
01:13:38,228 --> 01:13:40,628
So I figured it might pay
to watch you a little.

1219
01:13:40,664 --> 01:13:43,997
I followed you that night,

1220
01:13:44,034 --> 01:13:45,968
and I heard some of
that talk you was havin'

1221
01:13:46,002 --> 01:13:47,367
with that labor fella.

1222
01:13:47,404 --> 01:13:50,862
Well, I reckon that meant
a whole lot to ya, did it?

1223
01:13:50,907 --> 01:13:52,101
No, no, no, no,

1224
01:13:52,142 --> 01:13:54,337
it hardly meant anything to me at all.

1225
01:13:54,377 --> 01:13:56,470
Matter of fact,
it didn't mean much to me

1226
01:13:56,513 --> 01:13:58,310
a couple of nights later

1227
01:13:58,348 --> 01:14:02,944
when you come up to that
little shack I was camping in,

1228
01:14:02,986 --> 01:14:05,750
and then you cut cross prairie
to that little yellow house.

1229
01:14:05,789 --> 01:14:09,589
Did you say you had some whisky, bud?

1230
01:14:14,864 --> 01:14:17,765
Yeah, you see,
I caught up on the news.

1231
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:21,328
And then them things that
you done and you said,

1232
01:14:21,371 --> 01:14:24,772
well, they suddenly meant plenty.

1233
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,851
I don't have much money.

1234
01:14:38,888 --> 01:14:41,083
Yeah.

1235
01:14:41,124 --> 01:14:43,854
Well, you got this place.

1236
01:14:43,893 --> 01:14:46,987
Must be worth a tidy little sum too.

1237
01:14:51,301 --> 01:14:53,633
Maybe I could get a loan.

1238
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:56,002
How long do you think it
would take to get this loan?

1239
01:14:56,039 --> 01:14:58,098
Two weeks.

1240
01:15:05,548 --> 01:15:07,709
$5,000.

1241
01:15:07,751 --> 01:15:11,847
$5,000 in two weeks.

1242
01:15:11,888 --> 01:15:15,756
5:00, two weeks from tonight,
and we'll call that a deal.

1243
01:15:15,792 --> 01:15:19,421
And don't worry, I ain't a hog
about money or nothin'.

1244
01:15:19,462 --> 01:15:21,430
I get the $5,000,

1245
01:15:21,464 --> 01:15:23,295
that's the last we'll
ever see of each other.

1246
01:15:25,935 --> 01:15:29,496
Well...

1247
01:15:29,539 --> 01:15:31,063
all right.

1248
01:15:35,412 --> 01:15:37,710
Oh, and don't you go gettin' no notions

1249
01:15:37,747 --> 01:15:40,648
about running out on me.

1250
01:15:40,683 --> 01:15:42,310
Do you think I'm crazy?

1251
01:15:44,087 --> 01:15:46,021
You ask an unpleasant question, bud,

1252
01:15:46,056 --> 01:15:47,990
you might get an unpleasant answer.

1253
01:16:04,607 --> 01:16:07,371
I went to work every working
day of those two weeks.

1254
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:08,775
Morning, Jeff.

1255
01:16:08,812 --> 01:16:10,279
Howdy, Lou.

1256
01:16:12,849 --> 01:16:14,783
Chester Conway came
to talk to Hendricks,

1257
01:16:14,818 --> 01:16:17,343
and I made it my job to see him.

1258
01:16:17,387 --> 01:16:18,979
Mr. Conway.

1259
01:16:19,022 --> 01:16:20,353
Lou.

1260
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:21,789
I'd like to talk to you for a second.

1261
01:16:21,825 --> 01:16:22,792
Mm-hmm.

1262
01:16:22,826 --> 01:16:24,259
What about?

1263
01:16:24,294 --> 01:16:26,319
I should've gone out with
Elmer just like you said.

1264
01:16:26,362 --> 01:16:30,128
And if cussin' me out will
make you feel any better

1265
01:16:30,166 --> 01:16:31,292
or if you want my job,

1266
01:16:31,334 --> 01:16:33,165
Lord knows you can have it.

1267
01:16:33,203 --> 01:16:36,502
I sure won't hold a grudge.

1268
01:16:36,539 --> 01:16:37,597
Elmer trusted you.

1269
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,767
I trusted you.

1270
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:44,337
Appreciate that.

1271
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,575
Hey, Lou.

1272
01:16:46,616 --> 01:16:48,777
I think you're gonna like this one.

1273
01:16:48,818 --> 01:16:50,979
Amy came to see me every day.

1274
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:54,387
She always brought some
cake or pie or somethin'.

1275
01:16:54,424 --> 01:16:56,449
And she had to take it kind
of easy when she sat down.

1276
01:17:07,971 --> 01:17:10,132
We'd sit outside and have a drink,

1277
01:17:10,173 --> 01:17:11,902
and I'd think how much
she looked like her.

1278
01:17:14,377 --> 01:17:16,436
And afterwards,
she'd lie in my arms,

1279
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:20,643
and I could almost fool myself
into thinking it was her.

1280
01:17:20,683 --> 01:17:21,650
But it wasn't her.

1281
01:17:21,684 --> 01:17:23,311
And for that matter,

1282
01:17:23,353 --> 01:17:26,151
it wouldn't have made any
difference if it had been.

1283
01:17:26,189 --> 01:17:28,555
I'd just be right back where I started.

1284
01:17:30,493 --> 01:17:32,393
I took her everywhere she wanted to go,

1285
01:17:32,428 --> 01:17:33,986
did everything she wanted to do.

1286
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:35,361
It wasn't any trouble.

1287
01:17:35,398 --> 01:17:38,424
She didn't want to go much or do much.

1288
01:17:38,468 --> 01:17:40,561
For the first time in
I don't remember when,

1289
01:17:40,603 --> 01:17:42,935
my mind was really free.

1290
01:17:51,314 --> 01:17:53,407
I knew I had to kill Amy.

1291
01:17:53,449 --> 01:17:54,939
I could put the reason into words.

1292
01:17:54,984 --> 01:17:56,281
But every time I thought about it,

1293
01:17:56,319 --> 01:17:58,810
I had to stop and think why again.

1294
01:17:58,855 --> 01:18:01,323
I'd be doing somethin',
reading a book or somethin',

1295
01:18:01,357 --> 01:18:02,984
and all of a sudden,
it would come over me

1296
01:18:03,026 --> 01:18:04,687
that I was gonna kill her,

1297
01:18:04,727 --> 01:18:08,993
and the idea seemed so crazy
that I'd almost laugh out loud.

1298
01:18:09,032 --> 01:18:11,330
Then I'd start thinking,
and I'd see it,

1299
01:18:11,367 --> 01:18:13,358
see that it had to be done.

1300
01:18:19,542 --> 01:18:21,874
Bob, Amy and me got somethin'
mighty important to do tonight,

1301
01:18:21,911 --> 01:18:23,879
and I'm gonna be out Monday and Tuesday.

1302
01:18:23,913 --> 01:18:27,178
Oh, well, now.

1303
01:18:27,217 --> 01:18:30,983
Well, now,
you don't think maybe you--

1304
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:32,851
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

1305
01:18:32,889 --> 01:18:34,720
That's good news, Lou.

1306
01:18:34,757 --> 01:18:35,849
That's real good news.

1307
01:18:35,892 --> 01:18:39,020
I know you're gonna be happy together.

1308
01:18:39,062 --> 01:18:40,757
I feel pretty lucky.

1309
01:18:40,797 --> 01:18:42,389
Feel like my life's a picture show.

1310
01:18:42,432 --> 01:18:46,994
They don't come any
better than little Amy.

1311
01:18:49,138 --> 01:18:50,662
Yes, sir.

1312
01:18:50,707 --> 01:18:52,197
Gonna be good.

1313
01:18:52,242 --> 01:18:54,403
# Gave my heart as a token #

1314
01:18:54,444 --> 01:18:56,878
# When returned it was broken #

1315
01:18:56,913 --> 01:19:00,474
# Shame,
shame on me-- you #

1316
01:19:00,516 --> 01:19:01,949
# Hide your face #

1317
01:19:03,453 --> 01:19:04,977
# Shame on you #

1318
01:19:10,593 --> 01:19:14,029
# Shame,
shame on you #

1319
01:19:15,732 --> 01:19:20,169
# Shame,
shame on you #

1320
01:19:20,203 --> 01:19:22,763
# Gave my heart as a token #

1321
01:19:22,805 --> 01:19:25,296
# When returned it was broken #

1322
01:19:25,341 --> 01:19:27,832
# Hide your face #

1323
01:19:27,877 --> 01:19:29,208
# Shame on you #

1324
01:19:29,245 --> 01:19:31,406
Lou.

1325
01:19:31,447 --> 01:19:33,938
Honey?

1326
01:19:37,387 --> 01:19:39,412
Darlin'?

1327
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:46,357
Well, you're not even ready yet.

1328
01:19:46,396 --> 01:19:48,694
Here you are on our day of elopement--

1329
01:19:48,731 --> 01:19:49,857
Don't say anything, Amy.

1330
01:19:49,899 --> 01:19:51,059
Don't say anything.

1331
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,226
Don't say--

1332
01:19:52,268 --> 01:19:53,565
All I want to say is
how much I love you.

1333
01:19:54,003 --> 01:19:55,095
Oh!

1334
01:22:35,031 --> 01:22:36,191
You're late.

1335
01:22:36,232 --> 01:22:38,530
You got the money?

1336
01:22:38,568 --> 01:22:39,967
Put that in your pocket.

1337
01:22:40,002 --> 01:22:42,766
I have the rest back in the kitchen.

1338
01:22:56,552 --> 01:22:57,519
Oh, shit!

1339
01:22:57,553 --> 01:22:59,714
What--

1340
01:22:59,755 --> 01:23:01,746
You stupid son of a bitch.

1341
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:03,850
I was gonna marry that poor little girl.

1342
01:23:03,893 --> 01:23:05,292
I was gonna marry that poor little--

1343
01:23:05,328 --> 01:23:07,023
no!

1344
01:23:07,063 --> 01:23:09,224
No! No!

1345
01:23:09,265 --> 01:23:10,562
No! No!

1346
01:23:19,942 --> 01:23:24,709
Help!

1347
01:23:24,747 --> 01:23:27,875
Help! Help!

1348
01:23:27,917 --> 01:23:29,077
Get to your mom and dad!

1349
01:23:29,118 --> 01:23:30,608
What's goin' on?

1350
01:23:35,258 --> 01:23:37,283
Hey!

1351
01:23:41,063 --> 01:23:42,189
Help!

1352
01:23:42,231 --> 01:23:43,721
Help!

1353
01:23:43,766 --> 01:23:44,790
Help! Help!

1354
01:23:44,834 --> 01:23:46,563
Murderer!

1355
01:23:50,473 --> 01:23:51,804
He killed Amy Stanton!

1356
01:23:51,841 --> 01:23:53,433
Murderer!

1357
01:23:53,476 --> 01:23:54,534
Help me!

1358
01:23:54,577 --> 01:23:55,544
He killed Amy Stanton!

1359
01:23:55,578 --> 01:23:56,704
Anybody!
Somebody!

1360
01:23:56,746 --> 01:23:57,838
Halt!

1361
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:58,847
He's a murderer!

1362
01:23:58,881 --> 01:23:59,848
He killed Amy Stanton!

1363
01:23:59,882 --> 01:24:01,543
Help!

1364
01:24:01,584 --> 01:24:02,915
- Help!
- Halt!

1365
01:24:07,657 --> 01:24:08,885
Murderer!

1366
01:24:08,925 --> 01:24:10,415
Halt!

1367
01:24:10,459 --> 01:24:12,518
He killed Amy Stanton!

1368
01:24:22,071 --> 01:24:23,561
Stay back!

1369
01:24:23,606 --> 01:24:24,573
Back up.

1370
01:24:24,607 --> 01:24:25,596
Stay back!

1371
01:24:25,641 --> 01:24:28,906
Stay back!

1372
01:24:28,945 --> 01:24:30,606
Get an ambulance, now.

1373
01:24:33,516 --> 01:24:37,885
Please step back.

1374
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,887
No, go home, now.

1375
01:24:38,921 --> 01:24:40,752
Go home.

1376
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:41,950
Go on home.

1377
01:24:41,991 --> 01:24:43,322
We're all done here.

1378
01:25:43,686 --> 01:25:47,452
Gosh, Jeff,
how long you been out here?

1379
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:50,050
Reckon I been here quite a spell.

1380
01:25:50,092 --> 01:25:51,150
Well, come on in.

1381
01:25:51,193 --> 01:25:52,160
I was just fixin' some--

1382
01:25:52,194 --> 01:25:55,288
Kind of like it where I am.

1383
01:25:55,331 --> 01:25:58,664
Air smells real good.

1384
01:25:58,701 --> 01:26:02,660
It's been smelling real good, anyways.

1385
01:26:06,575 --> 01:26:08,065
Where is everybody?

1386
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:09,975
I figured they'd come by.

1387
01:26:10,012 --> 01:26:13,379
Told 'em you wasn't up to it.

1388
01:26:13,416 --> 01:26:16,544
Told 'em you was all
broke up about Bob Maples.

1389
01:26:16,585 --> 01:26:18,485
About Bob?

1390
01:26:18,521 --> 01:26:22,651
Shot hisself last night around midnight.

1391
01:26:22,692 --> 01:26:24,284
Yes, sir.

1392
01:26:24,326 --> 01:26:28,422
Poor ol' Bob killed hisself.

1393
01:26:28,464 --> 01:26:31,865
And I reckon I know just how he felt.

1394
01:26:42,478 --> 01:26:43,877
Sure you don't want a cup of coffee?

1395
01:26:43,913 --> 01:26:46,245
No, thank you.

1396
01:27:02,798 --> 01:27:07,360
Last night's events,
these recent events,

1397
01:27:07,403 --> 01:27:08,995
I don't like 'em one bit.

1398
01:27:09,038 --> 01:27:11,302
Well, that's only natural, Howard.

1399
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:13,308
I don't see how you could.

1400
01:27:13,342 --> 01:27:15,173
I mean, I don't like 'em
one bit, either.

1401
01:27:15,211 --> 01:27:19,113
Well, now,
take this drifter,

1402
01:27:19,148 --> 01:27:22,982
this alleged robber rapist
that you'd have us believe

1403
01:27:23,018 --> 01:27:25,612
robbed and raped Miss Stanton.

1404
01:27:25,654 --> 01:27:28,418
We know he didn't do it.

1405
01:27:28,457 --> 01:27:29,549
He's a pipeline worker.

1406
01:27:29,592 --> 01:27:31,287
He had a pocket full of wages.

1407
01:27:31,327 --> 01:27:34,194
You're not gonna get away with
planting that money on him.

1408
01:27:34,230 --> 01:27:35,356
What money?

1409
01:27:35,397 --> 01:27:37,922
The money you stole from Elmer Conway.

1410
01:27:37,967 --> 01:27:39,764
The money you stole the
night you killed him

1411
01:27:39,802 --> 01:27:40,769
and that whore Lakeland.

1412
01:27:40,803 --> 01:27:42,100
Why would I kill Joyce Lakeland?

1413
01:27:42,138 --> 01:27:43,435
'Cause you killed Elmer Conway.

1414
01:27:43,472 --> 01:27:44,666
You had to shut her up.

1415
01:27:46,342 --> 01:27:47,502
Why would I kill Elmer Conway?

1416
01:27:47,543 --> 01:27:48,703
I've known him all my life.

1417
01:27:48,744 --> 01:27:50,473
You killed him;
you killed Joyce Lakeland;

1418
01:27:50,513 --> 01:27:51,775
you hanged Johnnie Pappas.

1419
01:27:51,814 --> 01:27:54,214
Howard, you're not making any sense.

1420
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:56,150
You killed Johnnie Pappas
to protect yourself.

1421
01:27:56,185 --> 01:27:58,449
You'd given him that marked $20 bill.

1422
01:27:58,487 --> 01:28:00,478
How much money went missing?

1423
01:28:00,523 --> 01:28:02,855
$500?

1424
01:28:02,892 --> 01:28:05,019
You're saying that I killed
Elmer Conway for $500?

1425
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:06,789
I'm saying Johnnie
Pappas wasn't anywhere

1426
01:28:06,829 --> 01:28:08,023
near the scene of those murders.

1427
01:28:08,063 --> 01:28:09,030
I never believed that.

1428
01:28:09,064 --> 01:28:10,429
He was stealing tires at the time.

1429
01:28:10,466 --> 01:28:13,060
Johnnie Pappas was my friend.

1430
01:28:13,102 --> 01:28:16,128
That was your theory.

1431
01:28:16,172 --> 01:28:20,233
You think you got it
all figured out, don't ya?

1432
01:28:20,276 --> 01:28:22,801
Four, five murders.

1433
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:24,710
Six if you count poor Bob Maples,

1434
01:28:24,747 --> 01:28:26,738
staked everything he had on ya.

1435
01:28:26,782 --> 01:28:30,513
And you just sit there
explainin' and smilin'.

1436
01:28:30,553 --> 01:28:35,388
You ain't bothered one bit.

1437
01:28:35,424 --> 01:28:37,483
How can you do it, Ford?

1438
01:28:37,526 --> 01:28:39,255
How can you just sit there and do that?

1439
01:28:39,295 --> 01:28:41,729
Well, somebody's got to keep
their head around here.

1440
01:28:45,234 --> 01:28:46,360
Any more questions?

1441
01:28:46,402 --> 01:28:48,802
Yeah, I got one.

1442
01:28:48,838 --> 01:28:53,400
Shoot.

1443
01:28:53,442 --> 01:28:56,002
How did Miss Stanton get
those bruises on her body?

1444
01:28:56,045 --> 01:28:57,603
Old bruises,
not made last night.

1445
01:28:57,646 --> 01:29:00,376
Same kind of bruises we found
on the Lakeland woman's body.

1446
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:03,351
How do you think she got them, Lou?

1447
01:29:03,385 --> 01:29:05,785
Oh, gosh Howard,
you got me there.

1448
01:29:05,821 --> 01:29:06,845
How would I know?

1449
01:29:06,889 --> 01:29:08,015
You'd been beatin' on her

1450
01:29:08,057 --> 01:29:10,525
just like you beat on that whore.

1451
01:29:10,559 --> 01:29:15,053
So I was beatin' on Amy,
and she kept right on seeing me?

1452
01:29:15,097 --> 01:29:20,160
I was bruisin' her up,
and she was fixin' to marry me?

1453
01:29:20,202 --> 01:29:21,635
Boy, you didn't know Amy Stanton.

1454
01:29:25,174 --> 01:29:26,539
Maybe you didn't know Amy Stanton

1455
01:29:26,575 --> 01:29:27,701
as well as you thought you did.

1456
01:29:27,743 --> 01:29:29,040
Is that right?

1457
01:29:29,078 --> 01:29:31,410
This was in her purse.

1458
01:29:31,447 --> 01:29:33,176
Apparently she intended to have you stop

1459
01:29:33,215 --> 01:29:36,082
at some restaurant down the
road and have you read it.

1460
01:29:36,118 --> 01:29:39,281
- Now it begins, "Lou Darling."
- Let me have it.

1461
01:29:39,321 --> 01:29:40,754
- I'll read it.
- It's his letter.

1462
01:29:40,789 --> 01:29:41,881
Let him have it.

1463
01:29:44,026 --> 01:29:45,084
Very well.

1464
01:29:53,335 --> 01:29:54,996
"Lou Darling...

1465
01:29:55,037 --> 01:29:56,834
"Now you know why I had you stop here

1466
01:29:56,872 --> 01:29:59,602
"and why I've excused
myself from the table.

1467
01:29:59,642 --> 01:30:01,667
"It was to allow you to read this,

1468
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:04,873
"the things I couldn't
somehow otherwise say to you.

1469
01:30:04,914 --> 01:30:06,939
"Lou, I beg you, please, please,

1470
01:30:06,982 --> 01:30:09,951
"please not to take it the wrong way.

1471
01:30:09,985 --> 01:30:11,919
"But I'm afraid.

1472
01:30:11,954 --> 01:30:14,320
"Are you in trouble?

1473
01:30:14,356 --> 01:30:16,256
"Now, I don't want to
ask you more than that,

1474
01:30:16,292 --> 01:30:18,817
"but I do want you to
believe that whatever it is,

1475
01:30:18,861 --> 01:30:20,294
"even if it's what I--

1476
01:30:20,329 --> 01:30:23,059
"whatever it is, Lou,
I'm on your side.

1477
01:30:23,098 --> 01:30:24,827
"I love you.

1478
01:30:24,867 --> 01:30:26,858
"Are you tired of my saying that?

1479
01:30:26,902 --> 01:30:29,837
"I know you'd never
knowingly do anything wrong.

1480
01:30:29,872 --> 01:30:32,363
"So even if it should involve
being separated for a while,

1481
01:30:32,408 --> 01:30:34,842
"a long while, let's--

1482
01:30:34,877 --> 01:30:39,541
"well, we'll make it all right,
you and I together.

1483
01:30:39,581 --> 01:30:43,984
"If you'll only tell me,
if you'll just let me help you.

1484
01:30:44,019 --> 01:30:45,577
"I hope that when I
come back to the table

1485
01:30:45,621 --> 01:30:47,179
"you'll still be there.

1486
01:30:47,222 --> 01:30:49,315
"But if you feel that you can't,

1487
01:30:49,358 --> 01:30:51,952
"then just leave my
bags inside the door.

1488
01:30:51,994 --> 01:30:53,222
"I have money with me,

1489
01:30:53,262 --> 01:30:56,754
"and I can get a job in some other town.

1490
01:30:56,799 --> 01:30:58,232
"I've always loved you,

1491
01:30:58,267 --> 01:31:00,895
"and I always will,
whatever happens.

1492
01:31:00,936 --> 01:31:03,496
"Always, darling,
forever and forever.

1493
01:31:03,539 --> 01:31:05,973
Always and forever, Amy."

1494
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:14,806
She was so damn talkie,
wasn't she?

1495
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:16,215
I mean,
just the sweetest thing,

1496
01:31:16,251 --> 01:31:18,219
but just talk a fencepost
right out of a field.

1497
01:31:18,253 --> 01:31:19,311
You dirty son of a bitch.

1498
01:31:19,355 --> 01:31:20,413
Don't say that to me.

1499
01:31:20,456 --> 01:31:21,718
No, don't say that.

1500
01:31:21,757 --> 01:31:23,782
Don't never say anything
about a man's mother.

1501
01:31:23,826 --> 01:31:25,123
To hell with that crap.

1502
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:26,627
You killed that little girl.

1503
01:31:26,662 --> 01:31:30,223
She as good as says so.

1504
01:31:30,265 --> 01:31:36,101
She wrote it down after I killed her?

1505
01:31:36,138 --> 01:31:37,696
That's quite a trick, Howard.

1506
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:39,435
You killed them, Ford.

1507
01:31:39,475 --> 01:31:41,705
You killed them all.

1508
01:31:49,651 --> 01:31:51,915
Know what that thing is right there?

1509
01:31:51,954 --> 01:31:53,387
Over by Jeff?

1510
01:31:53,422 --> 01:31:54,889
It's called a door.

1511
01:31:54,923 --> 01:31:57,414
Now, I can't think of
a thing to keep you

1512
01:31:57,459 --> 01:31:59,484
and Mr. Plummer from walking through it.

1513
01:31:59,528 --> 01:32:02,395
I sure liked Bob Maples.

1514
01:32:02,431 --> 01:32:04,490
I sure liked that little Miss Amy.

1515
01:32:04,533 --> 01:32:06,626
Why don't you close that door
behind you real careful?

1516
01:32:06,668 --> 01:32:07,862
I'm still suffering from shock.

1517
01:32:07,903 --> 01:32:11,202
Jeff.

1518
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,867
You right sure you ain't comin' with us?

1519
01:32:12,908 --> 01:32:16,275
You don't reckon you
could change your mind?

1520
01:32:18,714 --> 01:32:19,942
They put me down in the cooler

1521
01:32:19,982 --> 01:32:22,143
where Johnnie Pappas had killed himself.

1522
01:32:22,184 --> 01:32:24,311
And they kept me there for a week.

1523
01:32:24,353 --> 01:32:26,082
I guess they thought that'd break me.

1524
01:32:26,121 --> 01:32:28,385
But it didn't,
just gave me time to think.

1525
01:32:30,192 --> 01:32:31,454
On the eighth day,

1526
01:32:31,493 --> 01:32:33,893
they transferred me
to the insane asylum.

1527
01:32:33,929 --> 01:32:35,726
I didn't see that comin'.

1528
01:32:41,670 --> 01:32:44,764
No one tried to push me around
or even questioned me there.

1529
01:32:44,807 --> 01:32:48,538
I tried to tell myself
that was a good sign.

1530
01:32:48,577 --> 01:32:50,135
But in my heart I knew.

1531
01:32:50,179 --> 01:32:53,945
I knew they must have some evidence.

1532
01:33:36,992 --> 01:33:39,256
Morning, Mr. Ford.

1533
01:33:39,294 --> 01:33:41,262
Will they be playing the
pictures again tonight?

1534
01:33:41,296 --> 01:33:42,524
Excuse me?

1535
01:33:42,564 --> 01:33:44,088
Would you tell 'em not to do it so fast?

1536
01:33:44,133 --> 01:33:46,693
I hardly get a chance to see her.

1537
01:33:55,244 --> 01:33:57,269
Where is he!

1538
01:33:57,312 --> 01:34:00,941
What have you done with that poor man?

1539
01:34:00,983 --> 01:34:03,508
Have you torn out his tongue?

1540
01:34:03,552 --> 01:34:07,488
Have you roasted his poor
broken body over slow fires?

1541
01:34:07,523 --> 01:34:08,922
He has come!

1542
01:34:08,957 --> 01:34:10,322
I've come, sir!

1543
01:34:10,359 --> 01:34:13,624
Have they punctured your eardrums, huh?

1544
01:34:13,662 --> 01:34:15,527
You fiends!

1545
01:34:15,564 --> 01:34:16,997
Oh!

1546
01:34:17,032 --> 01:34:18,590
Oh!

1547
01:34:18,634 --> 01:34:20,226
Are you too weak to cry out?

1548
01:34:20,269 --> 01:34:22,237
Be brave,
my poor fellow!

1549
01:34:22,271 --> 01:34:23,397
Be brave!

1550
01:34:30,846 --> 01:34:32,609
It's a dirty habit.

1551
01:34:32,648 --> 01:34:34,878
Got it young, though,
and reckon I'd keep it.

1552
01:34:34,917 --> 01:34:37,215
Thank you.

1553
01:34:37,252 --> 01:34:38,719
You know something,
Mr. Ford,

1554
01:34:38,754 --> 01:34:43,817
there wasn't a damn bit of
sense to what I did back there.

1555
01:34:43,859 --> 01:34:45,258
No, I couldn't see it.

1556
01:34:45,294 --> 01:34:48,752
I didn't get you free,
Mr. Ford.

1557
01:34:48,797 --> 01:34:50,389
They let me have this writ.

1558
01:34:50,432 --> 01:34:52,229
That's why you can be here with me.

1559
01:34:52,267 --> 01:34:53,234
Oh, I know.

1560
01:34:53,268 --> 01:34:55,566
I figured it'd be that way.

1561
01:34:55,604 --> 01:34:58,095
You know who sent for me?

1562
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:00,005
Joe Rothman.

1563
01:35:00,042 --> 01:35:02,602
That's right.

1564
01:35:02,644 --> 01:35:04,168
You know why?

1565
01:35:04,213 --> 01:35:06,374
Well, I reckon he's scared.

1566
01:35:06,415 --> 01:35:09,179
He figures they're gonna pin
the Elmer Conway murder on me,

1567
01:35:09,218 --> 01:35:11,118
and he thinks I'm gonna
drag him into it.

1568
01:35:12,287 --> 01:35:13,618
You're pretty smart,
Mr. Ford.

1569
01:35:19,761 --> 01:35:21,524
They got somethin' on you?

1570
01:35:21,563 --> 01:35:22,621
Somethin' you can't beat?

1571
01:35:26,235 --> 01:35:27,600
They have got it.

1572
01:35:27,636 --> 01:35:30,662
Maybe you better tell me what it is.

1573
01:35:30,706 --> 01:35:33,402
Oh, I don't think there's
anything you can do, Mr. Walker.

1574
01:35:33,442 --> 01:35:35,467
Just be wasting your time,

1575
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:39,571
and I wouldn't want
to get Joe into a fix.

1576
01:35:39,615 --> 01:35:41,310
I reckon I might be a better judge

1577
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:43,443
about some things than you,
Mr. Ford.

1578
01:35:47,522 --> 01:35:49,615
I just don't want
anyone else to get hurt.

1579
01:35:51,593 --> 01:35:54,858
Mr. Ford...

1580
01:35:54,896 --> 01:35:58,559
I wonder if you might
tell me your story.

1581
01:35:58,600 --> 01:35:59,999
You don't have to,
you understand,

1582
01:36:00,035 --> 01:36:01,593
but it might be useful to me,

1583
01:36:01,637 --> 01:36:03,332
and I might be able
to help somebody else.

1584
01:36:07,576 --> 01:36:11,444
I don't think so.

1585
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:14,381
I never had any
legal schoolin', Mr. Ford.

1586
01:36:14,416 --> 01:36:18,216
I pick up my law by reading
in a attorney's office.

1587
01:36:18,253 --> 01:36:21,780
All the higher education I ever had was

1588
01:36:21,823 --> 01:36:23,654
two years at in agricultural college,

1589
01:36:23,692 --> 01:36:26,160
and that was pretty much
a plain waste of time.

1590
01:36:26,194 --> 01:36:28,185
I just learned two things
at that college, Mr. Ford,

1591
01:36:28,230 --> 01:36:30,255
that was ever any use to me.

1592
01:36:30,299 --> 01:36:34,326
One was I couldn't do any worse
than the people in the saddle

1593
01:36:34,369 --> 01:36:38,328
so maybe I better try pulling
'em down and riding myself.

1594
01:36:38,373 --> 01:36:41,467
And the other was a--

1595
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:45,844
was a definition in an agronomy book.

1596
01:36:45,881 --> 01:36:50,375
A weed is a plant out of place.

1597
01:36:51,586 --> 01:36:53,952
I find a hollyhock in my cornfield,

1598
01:36:53,989 --> 01:36:55,616
and that's a weed.

1599
01:36:55,657 --> 01:36:58,421
I find it in my yard,
and it's a flower.

1600
01:36:59,761 --> 01:37:02,753
You're in my yard,
Mr. Ford.

1601
01:37:14,376 --> 01:37:18,039
Well, it's a long story.

1602
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:22,983
I don't rightly know where to begin.

1603
01:37:23,018 --> 01:37:25,350
I could start with my mother
dying when I was young,

1604
01:37:25,387 --> 01:37:27,446
or I could start with
when I first met Joyce.

1605
01:37:27,489 --> 01:37:28,456
Come on in.

1606
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:30,515
She'd hit me or I would hit her.

1607
01:37:30,559 --> 01:37:31,787
I'm sorry.

1608
01:37:31,827 --> 01:37:33,454
There's Amy to tell about.

1609
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:37,530
So I told him how it went.

1610
01:37:37,566 --> 01:37:40,831
The whens and whys and whos of it all.

1611
01:37:40,869 --> 01:37:41,858
What are you doing?

1612
01:37:41,903 --> 01:37:43,393
I bet they had it comin'.

1613
01:37:43,438 --> 01:37:47,033
5:00, two weeks from tonight,
and we'll call that a deal.

1614
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:53,074
It's always lightest...

1615
01:37:53,115 --> 01:37:57,313
just before the dark.

1616
01:37:57,352 --> 01:38:00,321
They had it right from the beginning.

1617
01:38:03,024 --> 01:38:06,755
I let it go because I had to.

1618
01:38:06,795 --> 01:38:08,660
I reckon they knew the truth all along.

1619
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,397
That's the whole thing, huh?

1620
01:38:15,604 --> 01:38:17,834
That's it.

1621
01:38:32,954 --> 01:38:34,114
Would you care to have me

1622
01:38:34,156 --> 01:38:36,522
come inside with you
for a while, Mr. Ford?

1623
01:38:36,558 --> 01:38:37,991
Well, I don't think it'd be smart.

1624
01:38:38,026 --> 01:38:41,985
I got an idea that...

1625
01:38:43,865 --> 01:38:45,298
it won't be long now.

1626
01:38:48,904 --> 01:38:51,338
All right, then.

1627
01:38:51,373 --> 01:38:54,900
I am sorry, Mr. Ford.

1628
01:38:54,943 --> 01:38:57,241
I had hoped if I couldn't do any better,

1629
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:00,248
at least I'd be taking
you away from here.

1630
01:39:04,519 --> 01:39:08,250
You said that you didn't want
anyone else to get hurt.

1631
01:39:08,290 --> 01:39:10,781
You meant it?

1632
01:39:10,826 --> 01:39:15,092
I meant it.

1633
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:18,293
Can't hurt somebody who's already dead.

1634
01:39:49,731 --> 01:39:53,326
Oh, man.

1635
01:39:53,368 --> 01:39:57,532
That looks terrible.

1636
01:39:57,572 --> 01:39:59,631
Pants don't even fit.

1637
01:39:59,674 --> 01:40:04,475
It's ridiculous
I'm not wearing a tie.

1638
01:40:04,513 --> 01:40:06,140
Look at your--

1639
01:40:06,181 --> 01:40:09,014
I look--
I ought to wear a tie.

1640
01:40:09,050 --> 01:40:10,347
You ought to wear a tie.

1641
01:40:10,385 --> 01:40:11,374
You'd look better.

1642
01:40:13,088 --> 01:40:15,147
Hi.

1643
01:41:56,891 --> 01:41:58,882
Long time, no see.

1644
01:42:07,502 --> 01:42:09,766
Long time, no see.

1645
01:42:43,471 --> 01:42:46,065
Howdy, Lou.

1646
01:42:46,107 --> 01:42:48,200
Howdy, Jeff.

1647
01:42:58,687 --> 01:43:01,679
Hello, Lou.

1648
01:43:01,723 --> 01:43:03,247
Hi, sweetheart.

1649
01:43:03,291 --> 01:43:07,250
Howard.

1650
01:43:07,295 --> 01:43:09,593
The whole gang's here.

1651
01:43:09,631 --> 01:43:11,223
Look at you boys.

1652
01:43:11,266 --> 01:43:13,928
Howard Hendricks, the D.A.

1653
01:43:13,968 --> 01:43:17,233
Mr. Conway, the villain.

1654
01:43:17,272 --> 01:43:18,534
Hank Butterby.

1655
01:43:18,573 --> 01:43:20,302
Don't say anything, Hank.

1656
01:43:20,341 --> 01:43:22,775
They haven't given you any lines.

1657
01:43:28,183 --> 01:43:32,779
I didn't tell 'em anything.

1658
01:43:32,821 --> 01:43:38,088
I just wanted you to know that.

1659
01:43:38,126 --> 01:43:40,924
And I wanted to see you.

1660
01:43:41,963 --> 01:43:46,093
I wanted to see you too.

1661
01:43:46,134 --> 01:43:48,125
So I could tell you.

1662
01:43:48,169 --> 01:43:49,397
Don't say anything.

1663
01:43:52,841 --> 01:43:54,399
I love you too.

1664
01:44:27,475 --> 01:44:32,572
# Shame, shame on you #

1665
01:44:32,614 --> 01:44:37,142
# Shame, shame on you #

1666
01:44:37,185 --> 01:44:39,676
# Gave my heart as a token #

1667
01:44:39,721 --> 01:44:42,155
# When returned it was broken #

1668
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:44,715
# Hide your face #

1669
01:44:44,759 --> 01:44:47,853
# Shame on you #

1670
01:44:47,896 --> 01:44:51,127
# Shame, shame on you #

1671
01:44:52,901 --> 01:44:57,270
# Shame, shame on you #

1672
01:44:57,305 --> 01:44:59,773
# Ran around with other guys #

1673
01:44:59,808 --> 01:45:02,208
# Tried to lie when I got wise #

1674
01:45:02,243 --> 01:45:04,609
# Foolish girl #

1675
01:45:04,646 --> 01:45:07,911
# Shame on you #

1676
01:45:47,722 --> 01:45:50,714
# Shame, shame on you #

1677
01:45:52,861 --> 01:45:57,264
# Shame, shame on you #

1678
01:45:57,298 --> 01:45:59,732
# Can you hold your head up high #

1679
01:45:59,767 --> 01:46:02,133
# Look your friends right in the eye #

1680
01:46:02,170 --> 01:46:04,604
# No, you can't #

1681
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:07,437
# Shame on you #
