00:01:01,512 --> 00:01:03,245
That's very close, by the way.

4
00:01:03,247 --> 00:01:04,679
I'm just
saying.

5
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:08,384
Who's my little man? Are you my little man?

6
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:11,455
That's my sixth husband right there.
The best of 'em.

7
00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:15,459
Tonya's my fifth child
from husband number four.

8
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:18,494
She was always a handful.

9
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:21,329
And I guess we spoiled her,
which is a goddamn hat trick

10
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,832
when you haven't got shit
your entire life.

11
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:28,370
Still, drove her to competitions,
practices, sewed her all her costumes.

12
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:30,338
But to her,
her mother's a monster.

13
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,976
Generally,
people either love Tonya

14
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:36,714
or... not big fans.

15
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,482
Just like people
either love America

16
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:41,584
or they're not big fans.

17
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:45,720
Tonya was...
totally American.

18
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:48,590
<i>You know, originally,
Jeff and Tonya,</i>

19
00:01:48,592 --> 00:01:52,597
<i>uh, wanted to take out
Nancy Kerrigan.</i>

20
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:54,730
<i>"Take her out."</i>

21
00:01:54,732 --> 00:01:57,333
<i>And I was the one
who popped up and said,</i>

22
00:01:57,335 --> 00:01:59,868
<i>"There are other ways
to disable people."</i>

23
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,771
<i>So...</i>

24
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:03,738
<i>you're welcome.</i>

25
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,007
Well, I was a reporter

26
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:07,375
for <i>Hard Copy,</i>

27
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:13,048
a pretty crappy show that the
legitimate news outlets looked down on.

28
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,850
And then became.

29
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:18,321
Well, uh, I mean, at 27,

30
00:02:18,323 --> 00:02:20,859
I was, uh, the most
hated man in America.

31
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:23,461
Maybe the world.

32
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:26,529
Um, with a mustache,

33
00:02:26,531 --> 00:02:30,031
I still can't
apologize enough for.

34
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:32,667
Uh, my name was a verb.

35
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:36,372
Like, if you bash someone
in the kneecap,

36
00:02:36,374 --> 00:02:38,410
you, uh...
you Gilloolied them.

37
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:40,942
That was...

38
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:42,447
That was cool though.

39
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:48,017
Most people's
impression of me?

40
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:49,554
Um...

41
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:55,360
That I'm a real person.

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,464
You know? I never apologized for
growing up poor or being a redneck.

43
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:04,568
Which is what I am.

44
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:10,839
Um, you know,
and it's... a sport

45
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:14,110
where the friggin' judges want
you to be this old-timey version

46
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:16,347
of what a woman's
supposed to be...

47
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,892
for being the first US woman
to land a triple axel.

48
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:31,596
So fuck 'em.

49
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:02,058
Diane!

50
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,926
LaVona Harding.

51
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:07,897
I spoke with you on the phone.

52
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:10,433
Yeah.

53
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:16,640
Give me a minute, okay?

54
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:21,543
Mrs. Harding.

55
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:23,678
LaVona. It's LaVona.

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,548
I am so sorry, but there's
no smoking on the ice.

57
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,918
Oh. Well, I'll smoke it
quietly then.

58
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:33,488
This here
is my daughter Tonya.

59
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,791
Mrs. Harding,
I told you on the phone...

60
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:38,928
I know what you told me.
Only you never seen her skate.

61
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,663
I don't train beginners.

62
00:04:40,665 --> 00:04:43,065
All she does is talk about
skating, all day and night.

63
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,366
Can't shut her up about it.

64
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,101
So it's easier for me to put her
on ice, if you know what I mean.

65
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:50,673
And we figure with the right training
she could make the most of her gift.

66
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:52,811
Like Ice Capades
maybe one day or somethin'.

67
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:57,178
How old are you, honey?

68
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,080
Mmm.

69
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:00,584
She's a soft four.

70
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,587
Well, she's
a very pretty girl.

71
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:08,656
But I'm sorry, I don't take
on students this young.

72
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:10,959
Now, if you'll forgive me,
I have a class waiting.

73
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,164
How'd it feel?
Feel good?

74
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,736
Go on. Skate.

75
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,494
<i>Stay away.</i>

76
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,094
<i>Look out.</i>

77
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:50,031
<i>I mean, six months later
I win my first competition.</i>

78
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:52,000
<i>I was four, okay?</i>

79
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:54,606
<i>I mean, those bitches
didn't know what hit 'em.</i>

80
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:02,947
Wrong!

81
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,147
Ordinary.
Nothing special there.

82
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:08,683
Are you even trying?

83
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:10,888
'Cause there's other places
I'd rather fuckin' be.

84
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:14,656
Concentrate.

85
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,926
You call that a clean skate,
for Christ's sake?

86
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:19,294
Would you not swear in front of the kids.
Please, LaVona?

87
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,962
- I didn't swear.
- You cunt.

88
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,866
Hey, stop talking to her. Yeah.

89
00:06:23,868 --> 00:06:26,637
That girl is your enemy. You're
not here to make friends.

90
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,104
Mmm. Where do you
think you're going?

91
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:32,974
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Don't tell me what you have to do.

92
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,780
I paid for you to skate. You're
gonna stay on the ice and skate.

93
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:39,851
Get over here.

94
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,055
You gotta get off the ice some time.
You hear me?

95
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:53,130
I'll be right here,
waitin'.

96
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:04,675
Oh, shit.

97
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:16,952
Skate wet.

98
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:20,188
To hear her tell it, I would operate
on her daily without anesthesia.

99
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,991
Please.

100
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:24,993
One fuckin' time. I hit her
one time with a hairbrush.

101
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:27,395
You're a terrible,
scum-suckin' loser!

102
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:29,964
Please!

103
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,000
What?

104
00:07:31,002 --> 00:07:33,969
<i>A child sometimes
wants to be corrected.</i>

105
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:36,137
Answer me when I talk to you.

106
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:38,842
When I felt this, I gave her criticism...
Stop that.

107
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:41,409
<i>The thing about Tonya was,</i>

108
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:43,745
<i>she skated better
when she was enraged.</i>

109
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:47,051
If there was no "you
can't do it" type thing,

110
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:50,152
she wouldn't do it.

111
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:53,421
On the ice, I was there to inspire her.
Off the ice...

112
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:56,190
<i>she was a happy, well-adjusted girl.</i>

113
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:57,392
Dang!

114
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,995
- Clean shot, Tonnie.
- I know it.

115
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:02,296
I was aiming for her eyes,
like you said.

116
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:04,899
Otherwise I could've
got her, probably.

117
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,269
No sense shooting a bunny if you
shoot half the meat off her.

118
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:11,874
When I'm older, I'm gonna work at
an office and have a deadline.

119
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:14,613
- Thought you wanted to do Ice Capades.
- I can do both.

120
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:19,715
Yesterday, Mom made me wear
my skating costume to school.

121
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:22,250
<i>The red one
with the tassels.</i>

122
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,019
Everyone made fun of me.

123
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:28,023
- Why'd she do that?
- 'Cause they were taking school pictures.

124
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:30,661
She said we could use the
samples for competition.

125
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:35,963
I told Mom that Margie Sussman
called us "white trash."

126
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:38,701
- <i>Mom told me...</i>
- Spit in her milk.

127
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:40,968
I hope you didn't do that.

128
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,773
Not yet.

129
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:48,113
Do you love her?

130
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:53,685
I guess.

131
00:08:54,385 --> 00:08:55,854
Do you?

132
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:00,925
- Yeah.
- Like you love me?

133
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,161
Nope.

134
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:07,328
Good, Tonnie.
But check out sooner.

135
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,766
What does she need a fuckin' fur coat for?
I don't have a fuckin' fur coat.

136
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:13,135
Because it's not
just about skating.

137
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:17,039
- The judges want figure skaters to be...
- Yeah. Rich, prissy A-holes.

138
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,808
Well-rounded. It's a
question of fitting in.

139
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,375
She's 12 and she lands
fuckin' triples.

140
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:23,312
She doesn't fit in.
She stands out.

141
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:26,818
She stands out because she looks
like she chops wood every morning.

142
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:30,085
She <i>does</i> chop wood
every morning.

143
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:32,154
LaVona, you wanna
work with me a little?

144
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:34,756
Twenty-three students I train
so I can coach Tonya full-time.

145
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:37,292
And I waitress full-time
to pay for your coaching.

146
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:40,194
- Yes, but she's not my child.
- No, she's mine.

147
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:44,098
And I'm not throwing my money away so
she can fit in with these little shits.

148
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,534
You can dress up a pig however you want.
You know what I saying?

149
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:50,205
It's not just about fitting in.
It's about how she's growing up.

150
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:52,039
Lick my ass, Diane.

151
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,079
She can do
a fuckin' triple.

152
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,281
Beautiful.

153
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:03,986
<i>I didn't have a
lot of fun growing up.</i>

154
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:07,389
<i>I mean, we never went
to, you know, Disneyland</i>

155
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:09,390
<i>or on trips.</i>

156
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:16,564
<i>If I wanted something, I had to
come up with a way to get it.</i>

157
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:18,769
What kind
of coat is that?

158
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:25,072
Go on! Get out!

159
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,542
I thought
you'd never leave.

160
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,276
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:31,580
- It's not your fault, Tonnie.
- Then take me with you.

162
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,418
Gotta work 12-hour night shifts.
I can't look after you.

163
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,120
You could if you want to.

164
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:40,791
We'll talk on the phone.
Everything's gonna work out.

165
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:48,130
You gotta move now, honey.

166
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:49,800
Tonnie, please.

167
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:56,039
You're not gonna
leave me here.

168
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:58,977
Daddy.

169
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,246
Daddy?

170
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,983
Take me with you!

171
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,919
I need you.

172
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:18,863
You're in... my... way.

173
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:31,439
Who's that?

174
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:44,285
Yeah.

175
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,892
We met at an ice rink
where I was practicing.

176
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,659
<i>I was 15.</i>

177
00:11:50,661 --> 00:11:53,895
<i>I was there
eight hours a day, skating.</i>

178
00:11:53,897 --> 00:11:55,596
<i>I don't know
what</i> he <i>was doing there.</i>

179
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:57,201
Hey.

180
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,002
<i>I was young,</i>

181
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:04,107
<i>and I had no game
whatsoever.</i>

182
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:08,378
So... do you like food?

183
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:18,252
<i>Back then, my stepbrother, Creepy Chris,</i>

184
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:19,990
<i>was living with us.</i>

185
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,491
I remember
Jeff and my's first date

186
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,528
<i>because I'd had
Creepy Chris...</i>

187
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:31,265
<i>arrested earlier that day.</i>

188
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:34,403
<i>Jeff did, uh, consult
me regarding Tonya</i>

189
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:37,105
<i>and asked me,
"What do you think?"</i>

190
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:39,209
<i>And I said, "Go for
it, man." But...</i>

191
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,410
<i>Not to be a bragger or anything,</i>

192
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:47,215
<i>but had I told Jeff "You
can do better, man,"</i>

193
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:50,154
<i>no one would be talking about
the two of them today.</i>

194
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:55,023
<i>I mean, I've never
been a girlie girl.</i>

195
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,060
<i>Jeff was
my first date ever.</i>

196
00:12:57,962 --> 00:12:59,364
<i>And my mom came.</i>

197
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:04,435
- Hi.
- I got it.

198
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,384
You a gardener
or a flower, John?

199
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,488
It's... Jeff.

200
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:28,293
In a relationship there's
a flower and a gardener.

201
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:32,059
Um...

202
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,129
- Don't answer.
- I don't know. I mean, I...

203
00:13:34,131 --> 00:13:36,199
I just thought...

204
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,367
I'm a gardener
who wants to be a flower.

205
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:41,104
How fucked am I?

206
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:44,139
This one can't garden
to save her life.

207
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:46,107
You're gonna have to do
all the gardening.

208
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:47,344
- Mom!
- What?

209
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:57,385
You two fuck yet?

210
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,616
Hey.

211
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,653
Hey.

212
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,559
My dad's only been laid off
for a couple months now.

213
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:40,095
So he stopped sending money.

214
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:45,133
We had plenty of money before. I have a...
You know, I have a fur coat and stuff.

215
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,534
- Yeah?
- You know, otherwise...

216
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:48,138
My family's poor.

217
00:14:54,844 --> 00:14:57,645
You need me to, um,
tighten that

218
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,349
before you reconnect.

219
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:02,619
Okay.

220
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:10,227
There you go.

221
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:16,401
It's okay.

222
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:23,041
So, um...

223
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,178
what are you gonna do
now that school's done?

224
00:15:29,646 --> 00:15:31,279
Uh, well, I...

225
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:33,347
I do this job
for the, um,

226
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,521
Association
for Retarded Persons.

227
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,321
I mean,

228
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:41,456
I'm not a retarded person.

229
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,359
I'm their driver,
which is cool.

230
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,461
My...

231
00:15:46,463 --> 00:15:49,898
My dad was air force and
he died when I was young,

232
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,637
so my college
is paid for, just...

233
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,539
I don't know.

234
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:02,343
My parents
had me quit school

235
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:04,745
so I could concentrate
on skating.

236
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:06,347
It's like your super power.

237
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:09,553
Fucking awesome,
what you can do.

238
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:39,517
So, um...

239
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,951
What, do you,
like, like me?

240
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:51,394
You're
so fuckin' pretty.

241
00:16:55,532 --> 00:16:57,201
No, I'm not.

242
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:05,276
You are.

243
00:17:21,391 --> 00:17:23,824
<i>He was really
sweet in the beginning.</i>

244
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:25,560
<i>He was a good kisser.</i>

245
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:28,495
<i>He told me he loved me.
And I believed him.</i>

246
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:30,364
You're not having
a conversation.

247
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:32,266
- You're just fucking yelling at me.
- Hey.

248
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:33,738
- Hey!
- Fuck.

249
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,740
- <i>But then...</i>
- He started hitting me a few months in.

250
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,309
I'm sorry... Ow!

251
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:44,312
<i>Then he would say
it would never happen again.</i>

252
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:48,550
- <i>But I figured...</i>
- My mom hits me. She loves me.

253
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:50,851
<i>And I thought
it was my fault.</i>

254
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:52,821
<i>That's just what I knew.</i>

255
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:56,326
- Hey. Watch it.
- Don't touch me!

256
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:03,465
<i>He'd say he was sorry. Then things
would be normal for a while.</i>

257
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,600
- I'm sorry.
- Mmm.

258
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:10,341
<i>He was the first boy I ever loved.</i>

259
00:18:11,975 --> 00:18:13,874
<i>The only catch was...</i>

260
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:16,578
He beat the living hell
out of me.

261
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,283
And I thought
it was <i>my</i> fault.

262
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:25,053
Nancy gets hit one time...

263
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:27,755
Why? Why?

264
00:18:27,757 --> 00:18:30,492
and the whole world shits.

265
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:33,661
For me, it's
an all-the-time occurrence.

266
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:35,296
I never hit her.

267
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:37,564
That's... not me.

268
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:39,367
I'm, uh...

269
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,504
I'm actually
a pretty meek guy, um...

270
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:44,538
<i>She hit me.
Packed a wallop.</i>

271
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,643
<i>Fired a gun at me too.</i>

272
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:49,777
This is bullshit.

273
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,514
I never did this.

274
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:55,585
<i>Then comes later.
We're still happy now.</i>

275
00:18:56,853 --> 00:18:59,920
I can see that shiner
through your makeup, you know.

276
00:18:59,922 --> 00:19:03,294
- Yeah, I fell on the ice yesterday.
- I don't know, Tonnie.

277
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:07,329
I would never be with
someone who fuckin' hit me.

278
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:09,533
- You hit Dad.
- That's different.

279
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:13,400
Anyway, he said
he was sorry.

280
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,402
Seriously though,
you're a dumb piece of shit

281
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,639
who thinks
she deserves to get hit.

282
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:19,543
How did I get <i>that</i> idea?

283
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Maybe he <i>should</i> hit you.

284
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:29,453
Yeah. Maybe you'd learn to keep your
big mouth shut. Sure helps me out.

285
00:19:35,691 --> 00:19:38,459
I'm supportive of this relationship.
You hear me?

286
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,063
Gotta go to practice.

287
00:19:42,065 --> 00:19:43,433
Hey.

288
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:47,772
Kiss your mother
good-bye.

289
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,113
<i>Up next is Tonya Harding,</i>

290
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:44,454
<i>skating to ZZ Top's
"Sleeping Bag."</i>

291
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,793
<i>4.8, 4.9...</i>

292
00:23:31,795 --> 00:23:33,660
They hate me. Emily Ann
fell and scored higher.

293
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,296
- Honey, you're different.
- I'm not dressing like a retarded tooth fairy.

294
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:37,931
The judges expect
a conventional program.

295
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,967
- I don't wanna be conventional.
- Your scores reflect that.

296
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:42,070
If I did the triple axel, they'd
have to give me my fucking score.

297
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:44,032
- You can't just do the triple.
- Sometimes I can!

298
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,283
- It wasn't my fault...
- Nothing's ever your fault.

299
00:23:55,285 --> 00:23:57,351
I out-skated the other...

300
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,786
You skated like
a graceless bull dyke.

301
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,824
I was embarrassed
for you.

302
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:06,961
Sorry.

303
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:10,264
Your father's not paying
alimony, you know.

304
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:12,934
Every penny I make... Every
penny goes to your skating.

305
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:14,972
And you weren't even
fucking trying.

306
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:17,138
I said I was sorr...

307
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,842
Don't talk back to me.

308
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:25,213
- Saying "I'm sorry" is not talking back.
- That's supposed to be smart?

309
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,348
Stop it. I just said...

310
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,984
Rolling your fucking alien eyes
at me when I'm talking to you!

311
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:32,986
- I didn't roll my eyes!
- You think I like working for you?

312
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:34,722
- You're bat-shit crazy!
- You selfish bitch!

313
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,224
Are you fucking crazy?

314
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:38,258
You fucking that mustache,
you're gonna start paying rent.

315
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,262
- I'm not paying for you to act like a whore!
- Fucking psycho!

316
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:44,668
- I don't wanna fucking live with you anyway!
- Ugly fuckin' whore!

317
00:25:17,366 --> 00:25:21,436
Oh, please. Show me a family
that doesn't have ups and downs.

318
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:24,871
Tonya needed to
get away from her mom.

319
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:27,274
<i>So we got
a place together.</i>

320
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:30,143
<i>There was no more talk
of college or air force.</i>

321
00:25:30,145 --> 00:25:32,913
<i>And I didn't care.</i>

322
00:25:32,915 --> 00:25:35,283
<i>I wanted
to take care of her,</i>

323
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:36,784
<i>to protect her.</i>

324
00:25:48,331 --> 00:25:49,733
Come here.

325
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:52,036
Okay.

326
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:54,938
Does it need
more tulle?

327
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:58,272
I want it
to look pretty.

328
00:25:58,274 --> 00:26:00,143
Tulle's classy,
you know.

329
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:05,215
You think any more about
getting your high school GED?

330
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:09,286
I don't give a red-hot shit
about that anymore.

331
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:12,419
Well, I think
you should look into it.

332
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:15,159
What about a bow
at the back?

333
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,532
What if
I'm not smart enough?

334
00:26:27,136 --> 00:26:30,804
I ever tell you what I was
most afraid of growing up?

335
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:33,174
No.

336
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:34,775
"Oh, my's."

337
00:26:34,777 --> 00:26:36,444
- "Oh, my's"?
- Yeah.

338
00:26:36,446 --> 00:26:39,717
You know, like in <i>The
Wizard of Oz</i> when they say,

339
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,251
- "Lions and tigers and bears, oh, my!"
- "Oh, my."

340
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:48,822
My brother convinced me that "Oh, my's"
were gonna come in the middle of the night

341
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,024
and eat me alive.

342
00:26:51,995 --> 00:26:53,227
You're so fuckin' dumb.

343
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,332
And I got
a high school diploma.

344
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,704
Well...

345
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:07,240
you're gonna get a medal
for your sewing alone.

346
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:09,409
Oh, my! Oh, my!

347
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:10,814
No!

348
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,420
<i>Looking back,</i>

349
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:22,358
<i>that was probably
our happiest time.</i>

350
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:26,593
<i>I'd make peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches,</i>

351
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:29,897
<i>and she'd go off
to competitions.</i>

352
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,136
<i>We had exactly the same interests.
I mean...</i>

353
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:37,338
<i>We both liked trucks</i>

354
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,040
- <i>and fixing cars up.</i>
- Whoo!

355
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:45,979
<i>So I just thought it would last forever.</i>

356
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:49,987
This is fucking wrong, Diane.

357
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,486
Tonya!

358
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:01,461
Hey, how do I get
a fair shot here?

359
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:04,532
'Cause I'm up at 5:00 every
morning working my ass off.

360
00:28:04,534 --> 00:28:08,602
Does someone wanna just tell me to my face
you're never gonna give me the scores I deserve?

361
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:12,206
Uh, this is how it's done. Some of
these girls have paid their dues.

362
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:15,543
I don't give a shit.
I out-skated 'em <i>today.</i>

363
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:17,980
We also judge
on presentation.

364
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:21,815
Well, you know what?

365
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:27,053
If you can come up with $5,000 for a
costume for me, I won't have to make one.

366
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:29,023
Till then,
just stay out of my face.

367
00:28:29,025 --> 00:28:31,659
Maybe you're just not
as good as you think.

368
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:33,863
Maybe you should
pick another sport.

369
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:37,098
Suck my dick!

370
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,303
This is fuckin' rigged!

371
00:28:56,786 --> 00:29:01,324
Do you really think your scores will
improve now that you've told them to...

372
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:08,562
If you dressed appropriately, maybe
they'd score you appropriately.

373
00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:10,697
I dressed pretty!

374
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:14,401
God, you don't like the way I
dress or talk or any of my music.

375
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:17,004
It's like you want me to be
an entirely different person.

376
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,343
I want you to be
a better competitor.

377
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,946
Otherwise,
I'm wasting my time.

378
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,345
Well, then you're
wasting your time.

379
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:28,181
'Cause you know what? Dodie Teachman
wants to be my coach anyways.

380
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,253
You're fucking fired,
Diane!

381
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:47,133
<i>That wasn't my fault.</i>

382
00:29:47,135 --> 00:29:50,170
<i>Unless puberty
is my fault.</i>

383
00:29:50,172 --> 00:29:52,572
<i>To be fair,
Jeff did love her.</i>

384
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:54,277
<i>He really loved her.
Like...</i>

385
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:57,311
<i>I remember a time
when he took her</i>

386
00:29:57,313 --> 00:29:59,313
<i>to a Richard Marx
concert.</i>

387
00:29:59,315 --> 00:30:01,485
<i>That's when I knew
shit was serious.</i>

388
00:30:04,286 --> 00:30:07,324
You do dumb things
when you're young.

389
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:10,056
<i>Like marrying Jeff.</i>

390
00:30:27,642 --> 00:30:31,145
<i>The wedding was nice.</i>

391
00:30:31,147 --> 00:30:33,613
<i>It made sense at the time.
Okay?</i>

392
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:38,753
<i>I mean, I could have insurance,
good benefits all around.</i>

393
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:40,755
<i>I mean, he had a car.</i>

394
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:46,694
<i>Plus, I was doing six hours a day
of practice and competitions</i>

395
00:30:46,696 --> 00:30:49,196
<i>while I worked
at a hardware store.</i>

396
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:54,036
<i>And I ran a forklift and a drill
press, and I did welding.</i>

397
00:30:54,636 --> 00:30:57,204
<i>But... But now...</i>

398
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:59,672
<i>now I could just skate,</i>

399
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:03,113
<i>like all the other girls.</i>

400
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,195
I don't know
what to tell you.

401
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:27,136
Marrying the first idiot
who says you're pretty.

402
00:31:29,372 --> 00:31:32,476
You fuck dumb.
You don't marry dumb.

403
00:31:41,784 --> 00:31:45,585
Most people don't even understand
how insanely difficult it is

404
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:48,822
to <i>attempt</i> a triple axel.

405
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,191
There's a reason why
nobody was trying it.

406
00:31:51,193 --> 00:31:52,860
You skate backward,

407
00:31:52,862 --> 00:31:56,097
and then take off from a forward
position on your left leg,

408
00:31:56,099 --> 00:31:57,698
and then somehow...

409
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,569
Fuckin' hurl yourself blindly three-and-a-half
rotations like you're light as shit,

410
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:03,670
which, I'm tellin' you,
Tonya never was.

411
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:08,876
Land on the opposite foot on the back,
outside edge of a razor-thin blade.

412
00:32:08,878 --> 00:32:11,277
It's that extra
half rotation,

413
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,680
when you already
did three,

414
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:18,451
that made us call Tonya the Charles
Barkley of figure skating.

415
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:20,389
<i>It was bad-ass.</i>

416
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:24,824
I don't know
if I can do this, Dodie.

417
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:26,459
I missed it
in last training.

418
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:28,531
Of course you can.
You got this.

419
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:31,498
Hey, Tonya.

420
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,199
You suck.

421
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,468
What is this, Rednecks on Ice?
The Lice Capades?

422
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,470
- You know what...
- Hey! Come here.

423
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:39,540
Oh! Here she comes!
White Castle queen!

424
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:42,842
No woman in the history of figure
skating has landed a triple axel.

425
00:32:42,844 --> 00:32:45,379
All of those women before you,
not one of them did it.

426
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,614
- Ignore him. Hey. Hey.
- You suck!

427
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,184
- The skating association doesn't think you can do it.
- You suck!

428
00:32:50,186 --> 00:32:52,218
"Trashy Tonya
doesn't belong."

429
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,554
Your mother doesn't think so.

430
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,158
Now show 'em.

431
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,395
- Hey, Tonya. Where'd you park your double-wide?
- Don't listen to him.

432
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:04,165
- Get out there. Focus.
- You suck!

433
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:06,199
- Go.
- You suck!

434
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:08,671
You suck!

435
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,738
You suck!

436
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,475
<i>Tonya
Harding, 20 years old,</i>

437
00:33:14,477 --> 00:33:17,244
<i>from Portland, Oregon.</i>

438
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,845
Here now is Tonya Harding,

439
00:33:18,847 --> 00:33:20,514
second after
the original program.

440
00:33:20,516 --> 00:33:22,716
Just 20 years old,
from Portland, Oregon.

441
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:26,189
Great power, great speed,
great athletic ability.

442
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,724
And the question is
whether, three moves into the program,

443
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:07,294
she will do a triple axel.

444
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,432
First, a triple lutz.

445
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:13,767
Nicely done.

446
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:15,970
And now we will
find out whether she will be

447
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:19,743
the first American to attempt and
complete a triple axel jump.

448
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,712
We will know that here,
whether she tries it or not.

449
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:29,582
- Atta girl!
- Isn't that great?

450
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:54,344
<i>Oh, my God, I mean, it was...</i>

451
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:58,280
<i>totally
the most awesomest thing.</i>

452
00:34:59,048 --> 00:35:01,347
<i>'Cause leading up to it
you're like,</i>

453
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,050
<i>"I can't do it.
I can't. I can't."</i>

454
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:06,052
<i>And, then, bam! I can!</i>

455
00:35:06,054 --> 00:35:09,756
<i>And all those people
who said I couldn't make it,</i>

456
00:35:09,758 --> 00:35:12,325
<i>well, fuck you... I did.</i>

457
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:14,961
<i>I proved everyone wrong.</i>

458
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,367
I was loved.

459
00:35:58,507 --> 00:36:00,673
<i>I can't describe how it felt.</i>

460
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:03,943
<i>There... I mean, there were
people standing up.</i>

461
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:05,979
<i>I mean, I was just...</i>

462
00:36:05,981 --> 00:36:08,682
<i>For the first time I knew...</i>

463
00:36:08,684 --> 00:36:13,423
I <i>knew</i> I was the best
figure skater in the world.

464
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,426
At one point in time.

465
00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:26,469
Sorry. No one ever really
asks me about this anymore.

466
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:33,573
Tonya! Tonya! Hey!

467
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:35,441
<i>I was blindsided.</i>

468
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:43,416
<i>As soon as she got back from nationals,</i>

469
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:45,785
<i>she was an entirely
different person.</i>

470
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:49,458
<i>And that person
didn't want ol' Jeff no more.</i>

471
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,860
Where the fuck
are my Dove bars?

472
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:56,796
We can't afford 'em. Eskimo
Pie is just as good.

473
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,032
I'm America's
best figure skater.

474
00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:00,800
I don't want Eskimo Pie.
I wanted...

475
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:04,438
Oh, Jesus. When was the
last time you showered?

476
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,409
Just wanted
a fucking Dove bar.

477
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,682
After the triple...

478
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:18,621
- everything changed.
- everything changed.

479
00:37:19,755 --> 00:37:23,724
<i>The Jeff I fell
in love with was gone.</i>

480
00:37:23,726 --> 00:37:26,492
<i>If I got up in the morning,
I got hit.</i>

481
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,861
<i>If I took a shit,
I got hit.</i>

482
00:37:28,863 --> 00:37:32,800
<i>I... H-He didn't need a reason
anymore, is what I'm saying.</i>

483
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:35,635
<i>And I'd just had enough.
You know?</i>

484
00:37:35,637 --> 00:37:37,938
<i>My... My whole, entire life</i>

485
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,907
<i>I'd been told
I wouldn't amount to anything.</i>

486
00:37:42,644 --> 00:37:45,382
<i>Well, you know what?
Maybe I would.</i>

487
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:56,689
<i>So suddenly Kristi and Nancy
are coming in second and third,</i>

488
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,693
<i>and Tonya is coming in second
at world championships</i>

489
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,961
<i>and winning Skate America.</i>

490
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:03,963
Fuck 'em. I'm skating
better than ever.

491
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:07,603
So the skating community
is like, oh, my God.

492
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:09,836
What the fuck...

493
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:11,838
I mean, this is
our skating champion?

494
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:20,481
<i>Tonya did the triple axel.</i>

495
00:38:20,483 --> 00:38:22,883
<i>No one else could
or even had the balls to try.</i>

496
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:25,017
Tonya Harding
was not the image...

497
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:28,956
Could I just interrupt with a quick word
about Nancy Kerrigan? It'll just take a sec.

498
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:32,959
<i>Nancy and I were friends. Okay?</i>

499
00:38:32,961 --> 00:38:36,563
<i>We were roommates, sometimes,
on the road.</i>

500
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:39,832
<i>But the press wanted Nancy
to be a princess</i>

501
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:42,535
<i>and me to be
the pile of crap.</i>

502
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,007
<i>To sell papers.</i>

503
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:47,807
I mean,
what kind of friggin' person

504
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:50,012
bashes in
their friend's knee?

505
00:38:51,112 --> 00:38:53,449
Who would do that
to a friend?

506
00:38:54,983 --> 00:38:56,416
This is bullshit.

507
00:38:56,418 --> 00:39:00,753
I mean, you gave her everything you
have, and this is how she treats you?

508
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,523
- Tell her that.
- Why are you being such a bitch?

509
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:05,224
You're acting
completely different, Tonya.

510
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:06,894
<i>- I</i> am <i>different.</i>
- Yes, but...

511
00:39:06,896 --> 00:39:09,863
<i>Everything's different, Jeff.
People actually smile at me now.</i>

512
00:39:09,865 --> 00:39:12,733
- What's she saying?
- People... People smile at her now.

513
00:39:12,735 --> 00:39:15,035
Mmm. "People smile at..."
Oh...

514
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:17,771
And how could you file a
restraining order on me? Huh?

515
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:20,206
- They showed up at work in front of everybody, Tonya.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

516
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:23,843
<i>I filed a restraining order so I wouldn't
have to look at your fucking face.</i>

517
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,079
What?

518
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:29,816
- She hung up.
- No, she didn't.

519
00:39:29,818 --> 00:39:32,119
- I'm calling her back.
- Call her back, Jeff.

520
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:35,188
Mrs. Eckhardt, uh, do you mind
dialing that number back?

521
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,526
- It's local, Ma.
- Okeydokey!

522
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:43,764
This shit
is unbelievable.

523
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:45,264
- Tonya.
- <i>Fuck you!</i>

524
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,072
What'd she say now?

525
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:53,073
Just one more time,
Mrs. Eckhardt!

526
00:39:53,075 --> 00:39:55,044
Mom, just help us out!

527
00:39:56,945 --> 00:39:58,711
<i>I said fuck you!</i>

528
00:39:58,713 --> 00:39:59,916
Don't...

529
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:04,584
- Did she...
- We're going to Sun Valley. Let's go.

530
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,222
I like
when you're like this, Jeff.

531
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:13,327
- You're not gonna let her get the last word, man.
- No way.

532
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:15,227
None of my women
get the last word.

533
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:17,863
I'm going to Sun Valley. She'll
be there for a competition.

534
00:40:17,865 --> 00:40:20,903
- I'll get the last word, 'cause I'm the man.
- We're the man!

535
00:40:31,947 --> 00:40:34,615
I've been a co-op specialist
in Switzerland and Europe.

536
00:40:34,617 --> 00:40:36,148
Hostage retrieval
is my area of expertise.

537
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,985
I'm telling you, man,
we're in, and we're out.

538
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:43,356
Mind control may be necessary, which
I've been practicing in Kenya, Korea...

539
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,827
When traveling internationally
I'm as resourceful as a lizard.

540
00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:51,698
My skills have been honed by years of
infiltrating underground organizations.

541
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,267
So we blend
and we disappear.

542
00:40:54,269 --> 00:40:56,302
And under
no circumstances

543
00:40:56,304 --> 00:40:58,238
do we create
or cause a scene.

544
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,840
Tonya!

545
00:41:00,842 --> 00:41:02,110
No!

546
00:41:03,112 --> 00:41:04,947
Fuck <i>you!</i>

547
00:41:13,822 --> 00:41:15,624
<i>I liked being married.</i>

548
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:18,061
<i>Just not to him.</i>

549
00:41:20,796 --> 00:41:22,863
<i>But he was calling
all the time,</i>

550
00:41:22,865 --> 00:41:28,334
<i>saying "I've been to therapy"
and "I love you. Take me back."</i>

551
00:41:28,336 --> 00:41:32,108
<i>I... I wanted to be loved.</i>

552
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:36,878
<i>I hoped it would work.</i>

553
00:41:41,717 --> 00:41:44,787
<i>So I... I went back.</i>

554
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:48,889
The second
we were back together,

555
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:50,323
everything went to shit.

556
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:54,193
<i>The closer the Olympics got,
the worse my skating got.</i>

557
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:57,463
<i>It was like a nightmare,
or a frickin' curse.</i>

558
00:41:57,465 --> 00:41:59,668
I still believed.

559
00:42:00,802 --> 00:42:02,804
I knew I was gonna do it.

560
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,073
<i>Mesdames et messieurs...</i>

561
00:42:06,075 --> 00:42:07,441
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

562
00:42:09,077 --> 00:42:11,177
<i>from
the United States of America...</i>

563
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:14,149
<i>- Tonya Harding.
- Tonya Harding.</i>

564
00:42:15,383 --> 00:42:17,450
<i>I would be the first</i>

565
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,086
<i>and only woman</i>

566
00:42:19,088 --> 00:42:21,854
<i>to do the triple axel
in the Olympics.</i>

567
00:42:21,856 --> 00:42:25,260
<i>My whole life was leading up
to this one moment.</i>

568
00:42:29,063 --> 00:42:31,898
Visualize the triple
when you're in the lay-back.

569
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,499
This is everything
you've been working for.

570
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:35,737
Yeah.
I fuckin' got it, Dodie.

571
00:42:37,106 --> 00:42:40,139
She was first
in the United States in 1991.

572
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,843
She was second in the world
in 1991,

573
00:42:42,845 --> 00:42:44,910
third in nationals
in Orlando.

574
00:42:44,912 --> 00:42:46,912
She arrived late
for these games

575
00:42:46,914 --> 00:42:49,182
and missed
the opening ceremony entirely.

576
00:42:49,184 --> 00:42:51,153
Here is Tonya Harding.

577
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:16,376
Now, her opening move,
a lay-back spin, is unique,

578
00:43:16,378 --> 00:43:18,378
because you're dizzy
from the spins.

579
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,514
And her next jump,
the triple axel,

580
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:24,720
is the most difficult jump being
performed in the ladies' event.

581
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:28,387
This is so exciting.

582
00:43:28,389 --> 00:43:33,559
No woman has attempted and completed a
triple axel in Olympic competition.

583
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:36,061
Tonya Harding
could make history

584
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,866
right here.

585
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:42,001
So, I'd broken off
my skate blade

586
00:43:42,003 --> 00:43:44,003
two days before,
in practice,

587
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:46,439
and they put it back on
a little off.

588
00:43:46,441 --> 00:43:49,342
<i>So all my landings
were off.</i>

589
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,749
All of them.

590
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:56,416
I mean,
that wasn't my fault.

591
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:10,896
<i>5.2, 5.2...</i>

592
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,200
<i>So I come in fourth
behind Nancy.</i>

593
00:44:14,202 --> 00:44:16,102
<i>And... I mean,</i>

594
00:44:16,104 --> 00:44:18,307
<i>I was really happy
with that.</i>

595
00:44:19,608 --> 00:44:22,144
<i>It was awesome.</i>

596
00:44:23,345 --> 00:44:25,611
<i>It just wasn't fuckin' fair.</i>

597
00:44:25,613 --> 00:44:29,081
<i>Tonya Harding of the United
States wound up in fourth place,</i>

598
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,552
<i>followed by Surya Bonaly,
Chen Lu and Yuka Sato.</i>

599
00:44:32,554 --> 00:44:34,186
<i>Very athletic skater.</i>

600
00:44:34,188 --> 00:44:36,122
<i>Her weakness
is her artistry.</i>

601
00:44:36,124 --> 00:44:39,929
<i>Tonya Harding's Olympic
competition is complete.</i>

602
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:47,869
Um, this next part...
I mean...

603
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:54,876
Not true.

604
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,177
I never said that.

605
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:00,213
I never even said that!
You're full of shit!

606
00:45:00,215 --> 00:45:01,217
Tonya.

607
00:45:02,016 --> 00:45:04,416
Tonya,
get in the house.

608
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:05,952
I'm not going
inside with you.

609
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:07,620
Why would I go...

610
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,555
- Don't you fuckin' touch me!
- Hey!

611
00:45:09,557 --> 00:45:11,624
I swear to God!

612
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,362
Fuck! Aah!

613
00:45:18,032 --> 00:45:19,164
Damn it!

614
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:24,236
<i>Things got out of hand.</i>

615
00:45:26,508 --> 00:45:30,242
<i>I mean, we couldn't be
in the same house together.</i>

616
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:34,514
<i>I called the authorities on him
the whole summer.</i>

617
00:45:34,516 --> 00:45:38,988
<i>I mean, I was filing
restraining orders, you name it.</i>

618
00:45:39,521 --> 00:45:41,224
<i>Finally...</i>

619
00:45:42,257 --> 00:45:43,860
<i>I divorced him.</i>

620
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:46,322
Whoo! Missing something?

621
00:46:48,523 --> 00:46:50,959
Jesus... Fuck.

622
00:46:52,594 --> 00:46:54,059
Fuck.

623
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,296
- Got your bag, Tonya. Open the door.
- Jeff... Jeff...

624
00:46:56,298 --> 00:46:58,398
- I have your bag!
- You can't be here.

625
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,601
- Listen. I have your bag.
- You can't be within a hundred feet of me.

626
00:47:01,603 --> 00:47:04,637
- Can I not drop something off?
- If you don't fuck off, I'm calling the cops. Okay?

627
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:05,673
Baby...

628
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:10,443
I'm gonna break your fucking
legs, you fucking cunt!

629
00:47:10,445 --> 00:47:12,244
Fuck!

630
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,347
Jeff, get the fuck
outta my... Get the...

631
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:16,548
Hey!
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

632
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,084
- You want me to do that?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

633
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,389
- You want me to kill you?
- You're gonna put a fucking gun in my...

634
00:47:22,391 --> 00:47:24,057
- Want me to kill myself?
- Stop it.

635
00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:25,724
- Which is it?
- Stop it!

636
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:28,494
Jeff, I am fucking serious.
I am serious.

637
00:47:28,496 --> 00:47:31,764
- Give me the fucking gun. This is not a joke.
- I will fucking kill you.

638
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:35,200
You don't need your purse! You
don't need anybody. You need me.

639
00:47:35,202 --> 00:47:38,104
- Okay. Okay.
- All right? That's it.

640
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:41,243
- Okay. Just put down the fucking gun.
- Okay.

641
00:47:42,376 --> 00:47:43,776
Jeff!

642
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,512
Fucking stop it.
Give me the gun.

643
00:47:46,514 --> 00:47:48,213
Give me the fucking gun.

644
00:47:56,391 --> 00:47:58,126
Jesus. Oh, fuck.

645
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:08,300
You're okay.

646
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,202
Hey, you okay?

647
00:48:10,204 --> 00:48:12,238
Stand back! Stand back.

648
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,807
- Are you kidding me?
- Everything is fine.

649
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:17,077
A loaded gun? What the fuck?

650
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:19,211
Get in the car.

651
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:25,420
Yep. Everything's fine.

652
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:44,137
What? Oh, fuck.

653
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,840
Goddamn it!

654
00:48:46,842 --> 00:48:49,244
Pull over!

655
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:57,117
Fuck.

656
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,586
Fuck. You fuckin' bitch.
Look what you made me do.

657
00:49:00,588 --> 00:49:03,155
I'll fuckin' kill you
if you say anything.

658
00:49:04,825 --> 00:49:07,126
Aah!

659
00:49:07,128 --> 00:49:08,894
Fuck.

660
00:49:17,905 --> 00:49:19,606
Good evening.

661
00:49:22,177 --> 00:49:25,613
I'm gonna need you to get out of the car.

662
00:49:28,282 --> 00:49:30,219
Okay.

663
00:49:34,923 --> 00:49:36,756
Do you know how fast
you were going?

664
00:49:36,758 --> 00:49:39,291
- Forty-five.
<i>- Didn't say anything about the blood.</i>

665
00:49:39,293 --> 00:49:41,360
Can you open the trunk,
please?

666
00:49:41,362 --> 00:49:43,662
<i>Took two guns out of the
truck, and alcohol.</i>

667
00:49:43,664 --> 00:49:46,765
<i>And then just leaves me there, with him.</i>

668
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:51,604
Kind of like Kristi Yamaguchi
kind of guys. I don't know. Sympathetic.

669
00:49:51,606 --> 00:49:54,541
<i>Which is why
I don't trust the authorities.</i>

670
00:49:54,543 --> 00:49:56,242
<i>Or anyone.</i>

671
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:59,247
Jeff can talk his way
out of anything.

672
00:49:59,947 --> 00:50:01,583
Never talk to him.

673
00:50:03,184 --> 00:50:05,852
Well, my story line
is disappearing right now.

674
00:50:05,854 --> 00:50:08,390
What... the... <i>fuck.</i>

675
00:50:09,523 --> 00:50:12,791
<i>When you come in
fourth at the Olympics,</i>

676
00:50:12,793 --> 00:50:15,461
<i>you don't get
endorsement deals.</i>

677
00:50:15,463 --> 00:50:18,331
<i>You get the 6:00 a.m. shift
at Spud City.</i>

678
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:20,233
Where's my fuckin' smokes?

679
00:50:49,831 --> 00:50:51,133
You look well.

680
00:50:54,269 --> 00:50:58,340
I look like someone who had a way
out of this shit and fucked it up.

681
00:50:59,374 --> 00:51:01,573
I was being polite.

682
00:51:01,575 --> 00:51:02,575
I know.

683
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,684
Are you okay?

684
00:51:09,818 --> 00:51:11,784
Well...

685
00:51:11,786 --> 00:51:16,456
my skating career is over
and I have... no savings.

686
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:20,563
And I ended up a waitress,
just like my mom.

687
00:51:22,396 --> 00:51:24,732
But on the plus side
I'm unskilled, so...

688
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:27,469
Mmm.

689
00:51:29,737 --> 00:51:31,637
The Olympic Committee
announced today

690
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:36,578
that the next Olympics are going to
be in two years instead of four.

691
00:51:43,885 --> 00:51:45,588
No heavy metal.

692
00:51:46,421 --> 00:51:48,257
Lose the blue nail polish.

693
00:51:51,892 --> 00:51:53,429
I'm too out of shape.

694
00:51:56,398 --> 00:51:58,499
Pear is a shape.

695
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,744
The world is giving you
a second chance.

696
00:52:12,746 --> 00:52:15,717
I know you don't believe
in them, but I do.

697
00:52:38,706 --> 00:52:40,308
Thank you.

698
00:52:51,052 --> 00:52:55,291
This is how Rocky trained when he had
to fight the Russian. It worked.

699
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,762
She actually did this.

700
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:12,872
And this.

701
00:53:22,117 --> 00:53:23,182
And this.

702
00:53:41,702 --> 00:53:43,405
It's okay, honey, you...

703
00:53:44,405 --> 00:53:46,072
Hey. Excuse me.

704
00:53:46,074 --> 00:53:48,407
Sir?

705
00:53:48,409 --> 00:53:50,411
Excuse me.
Sir, can I...

706
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,613
Can I just talk...

707
00:53:53,615 --> 00:53:56,081
Can I just... Can I talk
to you for a second?

708
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:58,684
I just...
About my score?

709
00:53:58,686 --> 00:53:59,921
Happy to.

710
00:54:07,128 --> 00:54:10,365
I know that you guys
don't... like me.

711
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,668
But... I'm landing
all my jumps out there.

712
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:16,905
Tonya.

713
00:54:18,606 --> 00:54:20,642
It's never been entirely
about the skating.

714
00:54:22,776 --> 00:54:26,077
I'll deny I ever said it,
honey, but you're just not...

715
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,750
the image
that we want to portray.

716
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:32,718
You're representing our country,
for fuck's sake.

717
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,454
We need to see
a wholesome American family,

718
00:54:35,456 --> 00:54:36,758
and you...

719
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,463
you just refuse
to play along.

720
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:47,001
I don't have
a wholesome American family.

721
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:52,673
Why... Why can't it just be
about the skating?

722
00:54:56,677 --> 00:54:59,077
<i>They want a
wholesome American family?</i>

723
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:00,512
Fuck you.
Give me that.

724
00:55:00,514 --> 00:55:04,952
<i>Well, it's not gonna be easy, but,
yeah, I could pull that out of my ass.</i>

725
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,427
Shit.

726
00:55:16,264 --> 00:55:18,901
I know you don't expect
me to wait on you.

727
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:24,236
Nope. I didn't
expect a thing, Mom.

728
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,507
Well, aren't you
a little hothouse flower.

729
00:55:28,175 --> 00:55:30,175
I don't know if you heard,

730
00:55:30,177 --> 00:55:33,014
but I'm training
for the Olympics.

731
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,581
So what do you want?
Money?

732
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,586
God, no. I just...

733
00:55:39,521 --> 00:55:41,019
I just wanted
to see you.

734
00:55:41,021 --> 00:55:42,688
You're a taker.

735
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,791
Every cent I made went to your
skating, and you took it.

736
00:55:45,793 --> 00:55:48,463
- What do you want?
- Jesus.

737
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,999
Well, this was
a stupid fucking idea.

738
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:54,001
Um...

739
00:55:55,869 --> 00:55:58,970
Was anything I did
ever good enough for you?

740
00:55:58,972 --> 00:56:00,976
You were soft.

741
00:56:02,543 --> 00:56:04,043
At three?

742
00:56:04,045 --> 00:56:05,912
I made you a fighter.

743
00:56:05,914 --> 00:56:07,914
- You never had a chance without me.
- You fucked with my head.

744
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:10,883
You made me think that I could
skate best when my life was shit.

745
00:56:10,885 --> 00:56:14,787
And now my life is shit... You made
that fucking real... I don't want that.

746
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:18,861
You would have picked it in a heartbeat.
You should be thanking me, not blaming me.

747
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:29,537
Did you...

748
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:32,671
I mean,
when I was a kid,

749
00:56:32,673 --> 00:56:35,978
did you ever love me
or... anything?

750
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:41,083
You think Sonja Henie's
mother loved her?

751
00:56:42,182 --> 00:56:44,182
Poor fuckin' you.

752
00:56:44,184 --> 00:56:48,724
I didn't stay home making apple brown
betties. No. I made you a champion.

753
00:56:49,923 --> 00:56:51,691
Knowing
you'd hate me for it.

754
00:56:51,693 --> 00:56:53,793
That's the sacrifice
a mother makes.

755
00:56:53,795 --> 00:56:56,361
I wish I'd had a mother
like me instead of nice.

756
00:56:56,363 --> 00:56:57,697
Nice gets you shit.

757
00:56:57,699 --> 00:57:01,670
I didn't like my mother either! So what?
I fuckin' gave you a gift.

758
00:57:03,938 --> 00:57:05,106
You cursed me.

759
00:57:12,947 --> 00:57:14,550
You're a monster.

760
00:57:15,215 --> 00:57:16,817
Spilled milk, baby.

761
00:57:21,622 --> 00:57:23,222
Jeff, are you down here?

762
00:57:23,224 --> 00:57:24,789
Oh, Jeff.

763
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:28,693
<i>I was pretty surprised
when Tonya called me.</i>

764
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,229
<i>But she said...</i>

765
00:57:30,231 --> 00:57:34,703
I don't think I
can make it to the Olympics without you.

766
00:57:37,738 --> 00:57:39,238
<i>I admit it.</i>

767
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,242
<i>A part of me still thought that
the sun rose and set with her</i>

768
00:57:43,244 --> 00:57:47,113
<i>and wanted her to look at me
the way that she used to.</i>

769
00:57:47,115 --> 00:57:49,051
<i>I just wanted to hold on.</i>

770
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:54,720
<i>I figured it was
just for three weeks,</i>

771
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:57,923
<i>and the second I made the team
I was gonna dump his ass.</i>

772
00:57:57,925 --> 00:57:58,994
<i>But...</i>

773
00:58:01,095 --> 00:58:03,732
before I could think
too much on that,

774
00:58:04,999 --> 00:58:06,331
that... leads...

775
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:10,204
I mean, it's what you all came for,
folks... the fucking incident.

776
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:14,240
The incident.

777
00:58:14,242 --> 00:58:15,978
Mmm.

778
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,780
The incident.

779
00:58:20,782 --> 00:58:22,883
The fucking incident.

780
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:29,755
Everyone remembers the incident
differently, and that's a fact, um...

781
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:31,724
<i>Some people, honest to God,</i>

782
00:58:31,726 --> 00:58:33,894
<i>remember Tonya
whacking Nancy herself.</i>

783
00:58:36,898 --> 00:58:41,066
Um... I never talked
about how it went down,

784
00:58:41,068 --> 00:58:42,834
except to the FBI.

785
00:58:42,836 --> 00:58:45,970
<i>The press
got everything wrong.</i>

786
00:58:45,972 --> 00:58:47,539
Excuse me.

787
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:51,343
I'm with the Clackamas County Sheriff's
Office. I'm gonna need to talk with you.

788
00:58:51,345 --> 00:58:53,311
Oh, goddamn it, Jeff.
What did you do?

789
00:58:53,313 --> 00:58:55,016
I've received
a death threat.

790
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,919
- From Jeff?
- Against you.

791
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:01,086
What the fuck?

792
00:59:01,088 --> 00:59:03,124
What did
they say, exactly?

793
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,927
Uh, i...

794
00:59:07,929 --> 00:59:09,829
"If Harding skates today,

795
00:59:09,831 --> 00:59:12,298
she'll get a...
a bullet in the back."

796
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,332
What the fuck?

797
00:59:14,334 --> 00:59:17,035
- How seriously should we take this?
- Right?

798
00:59:17,037 --> 00:59:18,738
Girl skaters
at this level,

799
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:22,108
they're always messing with each
other with the, um, costumes,

800
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:23,909
with each other's
skate blades.

801
00:59:23,911 --> 00:59:27,313
- I never knew that.
- Yeah. It's a thing.

802
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:31,052
Well, the point is, this is a large
venue and we can't protect you.

803
00:59:40,161 --> 00:59:42,528
In the end, she was
too freaked out to skate.

804
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:46,231
It screwed with her head
for a long, long time.

805
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:48,501
And it got me thinking.

806
00:59:48,503 --> 00:59:52,173
Which...
isn't always my strength.

807
00:59:54,374 --> 00:59:58,213
What if I do the same thing to Nancy
Kerrigan, only right before nationals?

808
00:59:59,213 --> 01:00:01,113
Yeah. Sort of
even the playing field.

809
01:00:01,115 --> 01:00:02,247
Right.

810
01:00:02,249 --> 01:00:05,517
I wouldn't be the first guy
to cheat at figure skating.

811
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,153
A lot of the judges
are corrupt.

812
01:00:08,155 --> 01:00:10,189
It's not exactly
prim and proper.

813
01:00:10,191 --> 01:00:12,260
Someone did it to Tonya,
lest we forget.

814
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:15,394
It's... my way of...

815
01:00:15,396 --> 01:00:17,829
saying "I love you."

816
01:00:17,831 --> 01:00:20,301
Interested. Go on.

817
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:23,369
No, that's it.

818
01:00:23,371 --> 01:00:27,405
I figure I'm gonna mail some
letters to screw with her head.

819
01:00:27,407 --> 01:00:29,307
Whoa.

820
01:00:29,309 --> 01:00:31,746
You f-in' greenhorn.

821
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:34,782
You cannot mail letters
from here.

822
01:00:36,016 --> 01:00:38,352
- It'll be postmarked from Portland.
- No.

823
01:00:40,021 --> 01:00:42,320
What we do, see, is...

824
01:00:42,322 --> 01:00:44,289
we send somebody
out there.

825
01:00:44,291 --> 01:00:47,193
We fly 'em out there, or maybe to
Massachusetts, where she's from.

826
01:00:47,195 --> 01:00:48,494
Yeah.

827
01:00:48,496 --> 01:00:51,564
Takes the suspicion
off of us, see?

828
01:00:51,566 --> 01:00:52,801
Right.

829
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:55,103
I know a guy.

830
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:59,070
Shouldn't even be
saying his name.

831
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,405
Derrick.

832
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:03,242
All in, you're probably
looking at a thousand bucks,

833
01:01:03,244 --> 01:01:06,148
but you really ought to
let me handle everything.

834
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:36,909
<i>Us being great spies and all,</i>

835
01:01:36,911 --> 01:01:41,347
<i>we call up a friend who leaves a
message where Kerrigan trains...</i>

836
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:44,215
For fuck sake. Jeff,
just call her back.

837
01:01:44,217 --> 01:01:48,186
<i>Only our machine is so old we
can't completely understand it.</i>

838
01:01:48,188 --> 01:01:50,990
She just said Nancy
Kerrigan trains at...

839
01:01:50,992 --> 01:01:52,557
<i>- Kerrigan trains...
- At Tuna Can Arena.</i>

840
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:55,260
Nancy Kerrigan trains at Tuna Can Arena.
She just said that.

841
01:01:55,262 --> 01:01:57,364
Well, who's gonna name
an arena "Tuna Can"?

842
01:01:58,932 --> 01:02:01,969
Fishermen. Everyone's
fishermen in Massachusetts.

843
01:02:04,204 --> 01:02:06,106
Just fucking
call her back and ask.

844
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:13,979
Hi, Vera.
It's Tonya again.

845
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:16,581
Mm-hmm. Our machine's
a piece of crap.

846
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:19,584
Could you just tell me where
Nancy Kerrigan trains again?

847
01:02:19,586 --> 01:02:23,521
- <i>Oh, sure.</i>
- Yeah, I had a stupid bet with Jeff.

848
01:02:23,523 --> 01:02:25,691
Mm-hmm.
Spell that for me, hon.

849
01:02:25,693 --> 01:02:26,995
Uh-huh.

850
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,994
- And what time?
- <i>5:45.</i>

851
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,631
- Got it. Thanks, Vera.
<i>- No problem.</i>

852
01:02:32,633 --> 01:02:34,135
Yeah. See you later.

853
01:02:35,202 --> 01:02:37,936
It's that fuckin' easy.
Tony Kent.

854
01:02:37,938 --> 01:02:39,671
Thank you. Tony Kent.

855
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:42,240
- Tony Kent Arena.
- Not Tuna Can.

856
01:02:42,242 --> 01:02:45,913
Tony Kent Arena.
It's the same fucking thing.

857
01:02:46,546 --> 01:02:48,180
Dinner's ready.

858
01:02:48,182 --> 01:02:52,418
It's bullshit. I mean, the FBI
found this piece of paper

859
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,619
in some random Dumpster,

860
01:02:54,621 --> 01:03:00,559
supposedly in my handwriting, with Nancy's
training schedule or something on it.

861
01:03:00,561 --> 01:03:05,030
It was the arena Nancy skated at
and her training times.

862
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:06,497
What do you need
training times for

863
01:03:06,499 --> 01:03:09,133
if all you're doing
is mailing letters, right?

864
01:03:09,135 --> 01:03:12,704
Jeff Gillooly can change his story all
he wants to make himself feel better,

865
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:15,441
but he confessed to the FBI.

866
01:03:15,443 --> 01:03:16,476
Guilty.

867
01:03:16,478 --> 01:03:20,546
I told the FBI that Tonya
was in on planning it,

868
01:03:20,548 --> 01:03:22,383
<i>which she was.</i>

869
01:03:23,351 --> 01:03:27,251
<i>But the plan was
to mail some letters.</i>

870
01:03:27,253 --> 01:03:29,188
Tonya didn't know
about the assault,

871
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:31,492
because there was never
supposed to be an assault.

872
01:03:34,528 --> 01:03:35,528
Just letters.

873
01:03:51,345 --> 01:03:53,415
I gave Shawn
a thousand bucks.

874
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:58,420
Nothing happens.

875
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,120
Gonna need to come up
with more money.

876
01:04:02,122 --> 01:04:05,090
Do I have "stupid"
written across my head?

877
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:09,160
All they had to do was mail letters
someplace. I'm not giving them more money.

878
01:04:09,162 --> 01:04:11,363
But these are two
of my top operatives.

879
01:04:11,365 --> 01:04:13,432
Derrick needs
expense money...

880
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:17,035
You know what? Call Derrick and tell
him we're calling the whole thing off.

881
01:04:17,037 --> 01:04:19,303
- No.
- Sweetie, the death threat's off.

882
01:04:19,305 --> 01:04:20,372
Whatever.

883
01:04:20,374 --> 01:04:22,340
You cannot
call this thing off.

884
01:04:22,342 --> 01:04:25,309
This baby has moving parts. Balls
are already being played with.

885
01:04:25,311 --> 01:04:29,314
That's too bad. All they had to do
was mail fucking letters, Shawn.

886
01:04:29,316 --> 01:04:32,117
These are not the guys you
wanna double-cross. Trust me.

887
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:35,686
That's your problem. Get me my thousand
bucks back. They didn't do anything.

888
01:04:35,688 --> 01:04:38,689
Your thousand bucks?
Jeff, come on.

889
01:04:38,691 --> 01:04:42,693
Are... Tonya. You still
want this to happen, right?

890
01:04:42,695 --> 01:04:46,097
- I can still make this happen.
- I really don't care, Shawn.

891
01:04:46,099 --> 01:04:48,268
I clearly have
bigger shit to fry.

892
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,471
You eat shit?

893
01:04:52,206 --> 01:04:55,173
- What?
- "Fish to fry," not "shit to fry."

894
01:04:55,175 --> 01:04:58,610
"Shit to fry" is a meal
best served never.

895
01:04:58,612 --> 01:05:01,613
Who cares, you big, fat fuck?
You can't make it happen anyway.

896
01:05:01,615 --> 01:05:04,483
- I'm on your side, Tonya.
- You're not a secret agent.

897
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:05,751
You're not a hit man.

898
01:05:05,753 --> 01:05:09,421
You're just
a fat, nobody gasbag,

899
01:05:09,423 --> 01:05:13,392
who still lives with his parents
and drives a '76 Mercury,

900
01:05:13,394 --> 01:05:16,628
gets laughed at behind his
back, and has never been laid.

901
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:19,398
Just stay away from me!

902
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,700
- January 6.
- I had a session later that night so...

903
01:05:22,702 --> 01:05:24,572
- I was sleeping, yeah.
- I was asleep.

904
01:05:34,581 --> 01:05:37,849
Remember, if your mind is blank,
no one can pick up your vibes.

905
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:41,188
Also, they can't identify you
if they don't see your eyes.

906
01:05:42,456 --> 01:05:43,456
Go.

907
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:04,344
Mind's blank.

908
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,214
Don't let them see my eyes.

909
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:24,530
The john?

910
01:06:50,523 --> 01:06:53,694
Hey. Hey.
Which one's Kerrigan?

911
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:53,220
What the fuck?

912
01:08:08,735 --> 01:08:11,338
Go! Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

913
01:08:13,274 --> 01:08:16,875
I mean, we had no idea that
something like this could be done

914
01:08:16,877 --> 01:08:18,943
by two of the biggest boobs,

915
01:08:18,945 --> 01:08:23,682
in a story
populated solely by boobs.

916
01:08:30,024 --> 01:08:30,921
- Yeah?
<i>- Jeff?</i>

917
01:08:30,923 --> 01:08:32,624
- <i>Holy shit!</i>
- Tonya.

918
01:08:32,626 --> 01:08:35,727
<i>They broke her knee.
They broke her fucking knee!</i>

919
01:08:35,729 --> 01:08:37,362
Whose knee? What?

920
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:38,763
- <i>Are you fucking watching this?</i>
- What?

921
01:08:38,765 --> 01:08:40,866
Turn on the fucking TV!
It's everywhere.

922
01:08:40,868 --> 01:08:42,933
- What are you talking about?
- <i>Nancy Kerrigan!</i>

923
01:08:42,935 --> 01:08:45,871
<i>Some guy just fucking broke
her fucking knee!</i>

924
01:08:45,873 --> 01:08:49,674
No, no, no, no, no! It was
supposed to be uh, just letters...

925
01:08:49,676 --> 01:08:52,311
It's not a fucking letter, Jeff!
They broke her fucking knee!

926
01:08:52,313 --> 01:08:54,946
It was supposed to be letters,
like a death threat!

927
01:08:54,948 --> 01:08:58,683
<i>Jeff, I'm telling you, forget the death
threat. Some guy broke her knee!</i>

928
01:08:58,685 --> 01:09:01,385
<i>Trying to claim
one of two Olympic spots</i>

929
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,687
<i>- on Saturday night.
- Why? Why?</i>

930
01:09:02,689 --> 01:09:05,389
<i>She was practicing for
that performance this afternoon.</i>

931
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,991
<i>She was just leaving the ice.</i>

932
01:09:06,993 --> 01:09:10,062
<i>Reporter Daniel Scarborough
was waiting to interview her.</i>

933
01:09:10,064 --> 01:09:11,629
Aah!

934
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:18,538
Fucking mustache.

935
01:09:32,485 --> 01:09:34,419
- Oh, Jeff.
- Jeff.

936
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:37,022
We did it, man.
We're everywhere.

937
01:09:37,024 --> 01:09:39,758
It is so
friggin' awesome.

938
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,994
- What the hell, Shawn?
- What?

939
01:09:42,996 --> 01:09:44,830
- What the fuck did you do?
- What did I...

940
01:09:44,832 --> 01:09:47,698
Changed the course of history,
if you've been watching.

941
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,869
Are you insane? Nobody
was supposed to get hurt.

942
01:09:50,871 --> 01:09:53,839
It was supposed to be
psychological warfare. Right?

943
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:56,441
What if the psychological
warfare didn't work?

944
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:58,710
What if it didn't scare her?
Then what?

945
01:09:58,712 --> 01:10:00,946
You know, all of our hard work
would've been for nothing.

946
01:10:00,948 --> 01:10:04,448
What hard work? It was
mailing fucking letters!

947
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,853
I had to handle it though, Jeff. I had to
handle this and make sure it happened.

948
01:10:07,855 --> 01:10:10,121
Look, I'm Tonya's bodyguard,

949
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:14,759
and now all the other skaters, maybe more
athletes, are going to need a bodyguard.

950
01:10:14,761 --> 01:10:16,894
So the money's
gonna be flowing in,

951
01:10:16,896 --> 01:10:18,162
and we pocket that money,

952
01:10:18,164 --> 01:10:21,066
and I change the course
of history.

953
01:10:21,068 --> 01:10:24,102
<i>...joins us with
the latest in sports...</i>

954
01:10:25,506 --> 01:10:27,606
Dad, make sure it's a
blank tape this time.

955
01:10:27,608 --> 01:10:30,808
It was a simple plan, Shawn.
Why didn't you just stick to it?

956
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,878
- I did stick to the plan.
- This was not the plan.

957
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,613
This was always the plan.
Do you hear me?

958
01:10:35,615 --> 01:10:38,549
A guy like me, you think
it's easy in my profession,

959
01:10:38,551 --> 01:10:41,488
having to think four
steps ahead of everyone?

960
01:10:43,623 --> 01:10:46,493
Or did you not realize
that I was the one who...

961
01:10:48,628 --> 01:10:51,565
I was the one who called
the death threat on Tonya.

962
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,868
What?

963
01:10:55,802 --> 01:10:56,802
Two to the back.

964
01:10:59,105 --> 01:11:01,740
People don't take me
seriously, Jeff.

965
01:11:01,742 --> 01:11:04,910
But I'm in control
of the situations.

966
01:11:04,912 --> 01:11:06,514
I proved that today.

967
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,580
This was not the...

968
01:11:09,582 --> 01:11:11,422
- You better think...
- This is out of control!

969
01:11:12,019 --> 01:11:14,052
Relax.

970
01:11:14,054 --> 01:11:16,955
Everything is great.

971
01:11:16,957 --> 01:11:20,157
Yes, my parents did tape over my
favorite episode of <i>Star Trek</i>

972
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:21,660
to record the <i>CNN</i> coverage,

973
01:11:21,662 --> 01:11:24,196
but I'm keeping it together.

974
01:11:24,198 --> 01:11:25,600
You're a fucking idiot.

975
01:11:26,233 --> 01:11:27,999
Oh, shit, shit.

976
01:11:28,001 --> 01:11:30,201
We gotta get those guys
out of Detroit, okay?

977
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:34,071
Shane and Derrick, they're just stuck
there. They don't have any money.

978
01:11:34,073 --> 01:11:35,540
Four steps ahead.

979
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:44,515
Jeff. Jeff.

980
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,456
- Jeff.
- Unbelievable.

981
01:11:57,998 --> 01:12:00,564
She
told us today, she said,

982
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,233
"I know there's
a lot of people out there

983
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:04,268
who think I'm a has-been."

984
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:07,171
Well, with Lillehammer
just six weeks away,

985
01:12:07,173 --> 01:12:09,006
now's her chance
to show the country

986
01:12:09,008 --> 01:12:12,646
that she deserves a spot
on the Olympic team.

987
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,014
It'll be interesting to see

988
01:12:17,016 --> 01:12:20,251
whether she plays this
conservatively or not.

989
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:23,254
<i>She can be powerful,
intimidating, and vulnerable</i>

990
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:24,990
<i>all at the same time.</i>

991
01:12:24,992 --> 01:12:27,791
Make it to Derrick Smith
and Shane Stant.

992
01:12:27,793 --> 01:12:30,195
<i>The height
and the speed is so different</i>

993
01:12:30,197 --> 01:12:31,595
<i>from all the other women.</i>

994
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,130
<i>This is a big improvement</i>

995
01:12:33,132 --> 01:12:34,765
<i>from two years ago.</i>

996
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:37,568
<i>A huge jump she made.</i>

997
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:40,037
<i>Pretty great control.</i>

998
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:42,006
<i>This is her final combination.</i>

999
01:12:42,008 --> 01:12:43,875
Not paying you to stand around.

1000
01:12:43,877 --> 01:12:46,047
<i>She may make it to the Olympics.</i>

1001
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:52,017
- Hey.
- I wanna see her face.

1002
01:12:52,019 --> 01:12:55,653
- LaVona, come on.
- I wanna see her fucking face at the end.

1003
01:12:55,655 --> 01:12:57,254
<i>...Tonya's peak had past,</i>

1004
01:12:57,256 --> 01:13:00,060
<i>she's proved tonight
she is still a winner.</i>

1005
01:13:01,595 --> 01:13:03,929
<i>This is a great moment
for Tonya.</i>

1006
01:13:03,931 --> 01:13:07,566
<i>She's had everything go wrong.
She's let everything go wrong.</i>

1007
01:13:07,568 --> 01:13:09,901
<i>And now, all of a sudden,
to pull this off...</i>

1008
01:13:09,903 --> 01:13:13,103
- LaVona.
- <i>and become our national champion is terrific.</i>

1009
01:13:13,105 --> 01:13:15,339
<i>And it looks
like she has most definitely</i>

1010
01:13:15,341 --> 01:13:18,712
<i>earned herself a place
on the US Olympic team.</i>

1011
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:26,050
Shane Stant was clueless,
completely.

1012
01:13:26,052 --> 01:13:29,888
Before the attack, he waited outside
the arena in Massachusetts,

1013
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:31,892
where he thought
Nancy Kerrigan was training.

1014
01:13:33,327 --> 01:13:37,228
Now, he moved his car
every 15 minutes

1015
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:39,700
to avoid suspicion.

1016
01:13:41,267 --> 01:13:44,134
He did this for two days.

1017
01:13:44,136 --> 01:13:46,806
That's when he found out that
Nancy was actually in Detroit.

1018
01:13:52,311 --> 01:13:54,278
Dah dah dah dah.

1019
01:14:04,725 --> 01:14:06,691
<i>Later we found
out they left a trail</i>

1020
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:08,660
<i>as big as the Cumberland Gap.</i>

1021
01:14:08,662 --> 01:14:10,629
<i>Phone records, bank records.</i>

1022
01:14:10,631 --> 01:14:12,129
How'd you find me?

1023
01:14:12,131 --> 01:14:15,501
Next time you pull off a hit,
son, don't put it on Visa.

1024
01:14:19,373 --> 01:14:20,772
Thanks very much.

1025
01:14:20,774 --> 01:14:22,977
- Thanks. That's enough.
- Thank you.

1026
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:26,710
- Thank you.
- We gotta go.

1027
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,246
- Thanks.
- Tonya?

1028
01:14:28,248 --> 01:14:30,115
Okay. Thanks.

1029
01:14:30,117 --> 01:14:32,851
Before this blows up, we gotta
get our stories straight.

1030
01:14:32,853 --> 01:14:34,352
Yeah. You do the talking.
You're my manager.

1031
01:14:34,354 --> 01:14:37,121
Okay. 'Cause we have to be real
careful about what we say.

1032
01:14:37,123 --> 01:14:40,058
We can't afford to make any mistakes.
I've waited so long for this.

1033
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:43,027
Tonya. I wanna be
a skater like you.

1034
01:14:43,029 --> 01:14:46,731
Really? Oh, hey.
Hope you mean it.

1035
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:49,099
- What's your name?
- Annie.

1036
01:14:49,101 --> 01:14:51,639
Annie. There you go.

1037
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:54,474
See you later.

1038
01:14:56,909 --> 01:15:00,045
Hey, we play it cool. After
all, we both have alibis.

1039
01:15:00,047 --> 01:15:03,017
What, for... Alibis?
For Wheaties?

1040
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,820
Wheaties?
What are you talking about?

1041
01:15:08,822 --> 01:15:10,688
My endorsement.
What are you talking about?

1042
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:11,891
The attack.

1043
01:15:14,293 --> 01:15:17,030
- Excuse us.
- We're with the FBI.

1044
01:15:18,832 --> 01:15:21,433
It's just a formality.
We're talking to everyone.

1045
01:15:21,435 --> 01:15:24,205
Well...
we don't know anything.

1046
01:15:25,372 --> 01:15:27,240
That must make life
difficult.

1047
01:15:28,975 --> 01:15:32,477
Maybe you heard something.
Saw something.

1048
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:36,180
I mean, I was asleep,
and Jeff wasn't even here.

1049
01:15:36,182 --> 01:15:39,317
I wasn't even here.
Uh, I was asleep too.

1050
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:42,487
In, um, Oregon at home,

1051
01:15:42,489 --> 01:15:44,992
which is in Portland,
where I live.

1052
01:15:45,992 --> 01:15:46,992
In Oregon.

1053
01:15:48,994 --> 01:15:51,196
So what do you
make of all this, Jeff?

1054
01:15:51,198 --> 01:15:53,167
Well, um...

1055
01:15:56,069 --> 01:15:58,737
It's a scary prospect, what
the world is coming to.

1056
01:15:58,739 --> 01:16:01,205
How long are you
in Detroit?

1057
01:16:01,207 --> 01:16:03,006
We're actually heading
to the airport right now.

1058
01:16:03,008 --> 01:16:05,809
Why don't we give you a ride?

1059
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:08,979
Oh, yeah. Thanks very much.
Yeah.

1060
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,952
But, first,
who's Derrick?

1061
01:16:14,354 --> 01:16:15,823
I don't know any Derricks.

1062
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:20,960
I know lots of Derricks.

1063
01:16:23,797 --> 01:16:26,231
We're gonna miss
our plane.

1064
01:16:26,233 --> 01:16:28,232
Tonya, how do you feel
about going to the Olympics?

1065
01:16:28,234 --> 01:16:31,001
I'm really happy, but it
won't be a true crown

1066
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:34,505
until I get my chance
with Nancy at the Olympics.

1067
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:36,508
Let me tell ya,
I'm gonna whip her butt.

1068
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:39,177
- Did the FBI speak to you?
- Um...

1069
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:40,778
I mean, they talked
to everybody.

1070
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:45,415
And, uh, they're doing
a thorough investigation

1071
01:16:45,417 --> 01:16:48,288
to try and find the man
who did it.

1072
01:16:50,556 --> 01:16:52,557
Thanks, guys. Thanks.

1073
01:16:52,559 --> 01:16:55,527
Holy shit. I'm going
to the Olympics again.

1074
01:16:55,529 --> 01:16:56,827
They were taking my picture.

1075
01:16:56,829 --> 01:16:58,862
I mean, fuck
the Skating Association.

1076
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,300
- Fuck 'em.
- This is a clusterfuck.

1077
01:17:01,801 --> 01:17:03,535
- Shit.
- It's not funny!

1078
01:17:03,537 --> 01:17:06,537
- We gotta fix this.
- Fix what?

1079
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:09,139
We talked to the FBI.
Everything's fine.

1080
01:17:09,141 --> 01:17:11,843
She's right, man.
We outsmarted them.

1081
01:17:11,845 --> 01:17:13,510
My guys are paid,
and deep in cover...

1082
01:17:13,512 --> 01:17:15,345
Fuck!

1083
01:17:15,347 --> 01:17:17,381
Jesus,
what is your problem?

1084
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:20,818
You wanna tell me what happened, Shawn?
Who did you talk to?

1085
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:22,487
Nobody.

1086
01:17:22,489 --> 01:17:24,555
Yeah?
Well, if you don't tell me now,

1087
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:27,457
then... then we're all
gonna be fucked!

1088
01:17:27,459 --> 01:17:29,093
I didn't talk to anybody.

1089
01:17:29,095 --> 01:17:31,028
Somebody knows something when
they shouldn't know anything.

1090
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:34,232
- I never said anything.
- Then how come they know the name Derrick, Shawn?

1091
01:17:34,234 --> 01:17:36,500
I don't know. How can
you even ask me that?

1092
01:17:36,502 --> 01:17:39,336
I could withstand torture
and I would still never talk.

1093
01:17:39,338 --> 01:17:40,504
They could never break me!

1094
01:17:40,506 --> 01:17:42,439
That whole Nancy Kerrigan thing,

1095
01:17:42,441 --> 01:17:43,907
that was my crew.

1096
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,943
We were paid 65 grand
to take her out.

1097
01:17:45,945 --> 01:17:47,978
Then my team
obtains press credentials

1098
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:49,880
by beating up a reporter.

1099
01:17:49,882 --> 01:17:51,381
That's what gets us
inside the ring.

1100
01:17:51,383 --> 01:17:55,286
Then, bam, my hit man
whacks Kerrigan three times

1101
01:17:55,288 --> 01:17:56,920
with a retractable baton.

1102
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:58,923
And then he shouts at her,
he says...

1103
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:04,262
Shawn Eckhardt.

1104
01:18:07,066 --> 01:18:08,499
No.

1105
01:18:08,501 --> 01:18:10,070
Who is it, Shawnie?

1106
01:18:12,572 --> 01:18:15,008
I brought you boys
some nice tea.

1107
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,009
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1108
01:18:18,011 --> 01:18:20,314
M-Maybe some shortbread too,
Mom?

1109
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:29,519
What can you tell us
about Tonya Harding?

1110
01:18:29,521 --> 01:18:31,488
Mmm.

1111
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:33,293
I don't know
a Tony Harding.

1112
01:18:34,394 --> 01:18:35,394
Aren't you
her bodyguard?

1113
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,098
Well...
you didn't let me finish.

1114
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,903
Well, I-I don't...
I don't know her well.

1115
01:18:44,404 --> 01:18:45,906
How about
Nancy Kerrigan?

1116
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:50,210
- Who?
- You haven't heard of Nancy Kerrigan?

1117
01:18:51,377 --> 01:18:52,412
Oh, yeah.

1118
01:18:53,613 --> 01:18:56,316
I thought
he said Nancy Herring.

1119
01:19:05,124 --> 01:19:07,058
- Shawn...
- Jeff did it.

1120
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:08,625
Jeff Gillooly did it.

1121
01:19:22,676 --> 01:19:24,245
What the fuck
is going on?

1122
01:19:26,413 --> 01:19:27,612
Nothing.

1123
01:19:32,551 --> 01:19:34,986
Don't answer it.

1124
01:19:40,659 --> 01:19:41,961
Fuck!

1125
01:19:45,164 --> 01:19:46,531
Jeff Gillooly speaking.

1126
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:50,170
- You gotta pay me my money, and I gotta get outta town.
- Who is it?

1127
01:19:51,538 --> 01:19:55,173
- <i>They know something.</i>
- Wait. What are you...

1128
01:19:55,175 --> 01:19:57,241
Meet me, or else
I'm gonna be forced...

1129
01:19:57,243 --> 01:19:59,480
Shawn, calm down.
Where do you wanna meet?

1130
01:20:00,747 --> 01:20:04,048
The Golden Buddha,
uh, at our regular table.

1131
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:06,451
Meet me
at the stroke of midnight.

1132
01:20:06,453 --> 01:20:09,187
I'm not meeting you at the
fucking stroke of midnight.

1133
01:20:09,189 --> 01:20:12,927
Th-That's the plan, man.
And bring the fucking money.

1134
01:20:15,662 --> 01:20:18,265
Great, great.
Tell your mom I said hi.

1135
01:21:17,489 --> 01:21:18,524
What's going on, Shawn?

1136
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:23,661
Nothin'. Just...
why don't you sit down?

1137
01:21:23,663 --> 01:21:26,464
You wanna go to that bar
on, uh...

1138
01:21:26,466 --> 01:21:28,665
No, no, no.
We're... We're fine here.

1139
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:30,269
Sit down.

1140
01:21:37,209 --> 01:21:38,576
What's up, man?

1141
01:21:38,578 --> 01:21:42,612
You okay? You're, uh,
sweatin' an awful lot.

1142
01:21:42,614 --> 01:21:44,682
- Even for you.
- No, I am not.

1143
01:21:44,684 --> 01:21:48,152
Okay.
You know I'm not okay.

1144
01:21:48,154 --> 01:21:49,423
They know something.

1145
01:21:51,091 --> 01:21:53,060
- Who?
- They...

1146
01:21:54,226 --> 01:21:56,430
- You know.
- I don't.

1147
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,464
The FBI.

1148
01:21:59,466 --> 01:22:02,302
Okay? The FBI,
they know something is up.

1149
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,072
What's up?

1150
01:22:11,144 --> 01:22:13,180
Whoa. Uh...

1151
01:22:18,650 --> 01:22:20,750
- Oh. Oh.
- Jeff. Yeah, Jeff.

1152
01:22:20,752 --> 01:22:24,589
Shawn... are you
trying to tell me

1153
01:22:24,591 --> 01:22:28,125
you had something to do with
the Nancy Kerrigan thing, hmm?

1154
01:22:28,127 --> 01:22:30,294
What the fuck?

1155
01:22:30,296 --> 01:22:32,332
Jeff, of course
I had something...

1156
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,202
- Jeff...
- Don't...

1157
01:22:36,136 --> 01:22:37,634
say another word,

1158
01:22:37,636 --> 01:22:40,474
or I'll be forced
to go to the authorities.

1159
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:48,115
Oh, Jeff.

1160
01:22:51,184 --> 01:22:54,418
I hope you
hear me loud and clear,

1161
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:56,422
you fat fuck.

1162
01:23:01,194 --> 01:23:03,363
But you made your bed.

1163
01:23:05,498 --> 01:23:07,134
Now die in it.

1164
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:32,189
<i>Diane's husband is a lawyer,</i>

1165
01:23:32,191 --> 01:23:34,357
<i>so in the morning,
we meet up at their house.</i>

1166
01:23:34,359 --> 01:23:36,794
<i>It was nice. I mean, they had
a living room and stuff.</i>

1167
01:23:36,796 --> 01:23:40,197
- Hello there. Come on in.
- Hey.

1168
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:42,299
So why don't we
just turn his ugly fat ass in?

1169
01:23:42,301 --> 01:23:43,867
- Because...
- Big, dumb, fucking tub of guts.

1170
01:23:43,869 --> 01:23:48,539
It's only his word against ours.
You and I gotta stick together.

1171
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:51,741
Yeah, but, Jeff,
I'm gonna lose everything.

1172
01:23:51,743 --> 01:23:55,379
I worked my whole life for this, and I'm
gonna lose it because of fucking Shawn?

1173
01:23:55,381 --> 01:23:57,415
If it ever
came down to that,

1174
01:23:57,417 --> 01:24:00,550
I would tell them you didn't
have anything to do with it.

1175
01:24:00,552 --> 01:24:03,521
But right now we gotta
get our story straight.

1176
01:24:03,523 --> 01:24:05,856
And since they can't
pin anything on us,

1177
01:24:05,858 --> 01:24:07,325
we didn't know anything.

1178
01:24:07,327 --> 01:24:09,363
Yeah, but we <i>didn't</i>
know anything.

1179
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:11,532
Right.

1180
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:17,500
Look.
They've arrested Shawn.

1181
01:24:17,502 --> 01:24:20,740
And he's saying that
it was all your idea, Jeff.

1182
01:24:22,242 --> 01:24:24,642
We didn't know anything.

1183
01:24:24,644 --> 01:24:27,478
I mean, it was supposed
to be letters...

1184
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:31,314
It's... It's gonna be a
real shit-show for us soon.

1185
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:34,755
Um... we gotta go home.

1186
01:24:42,729 --> 01:24:46,233
- Don't grab me. Fuck.
- Just get in the fucking car.

1187
01:24:53,573 --> 01:24:55,839
What part of keeping your
mouth shut was unclear,

1188
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,677
you stupid fucking cunt?

1189
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:03,513
There's more to this than
you're telling me, isn't there?

1190
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:04,915
Shut up, Tonya.
I'm telling ya.

1191
01:25:04,917 --> 01:25:06,620
Jeff.

1192
01:25:10,289 --> 01:25:11,557
Did you do it?

1193
01:25:16,496 --> 01:25:17,827
Goddamn it.

1194
01:25:17,829 --> 01:25:21,331
Shit. Fuck.
Jeff, fuck!

1195
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:22,700
What the fuck?

1196
01:25:22,702 --> 01:25:25,568
I mean, this is my...
this is my fucking life.

1197
01:25:25,570 --> 01:25:28,774
This is... Skating is
my whole fucking life.

1198
01:25:31,778 --> 01:25:33,411
What did you do?

1199
01:25:33,413 --> 01:25:35,780
What did... What did you do?
What did you actually fuck...

1200
01:25:35,782 --> 01:25:37,314
Shut up!

1201
01:25:37,316 --> 01:25:38,549
<i>And then, bam!</i>

1202
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:41,786
<i>Nails me
right in the frickin' face.</i>

1203
01:25:41,788 --> 01:25:43,653
<i>That's when I knew.</i>

1204
01:25:49,362 --> 01:25:51,429
<i>I mean,
he's never admitted to me...</i>

1205
01:25:51,431 --> 01:25:52,963
<i>He wouldn't care anymore
anyways.</i>

1206
01:25:52,965 --> 01:25:56,933
<i>But he's never admitted to me
that he actually did it.</i>

1207
01:25:56,935 --> 01:26:01,938
<i>But I knew... In that moment,
I knew he planned it.</i>

1208
01:26:01,940 --> 01:26:03,340
<i>And he had it done.</i>

1209
01:26:14,886 --> 01:26:16,754
Tonya Harding,
23 years old.

1210
01:26:27,632 --> 01:26:29,133
Damn it.

1211
01:26:37,743 --> 01:26:39,712
I can't believe it.
You gave me up!

1212
01:26:41,447 --> 01:26:42,682
No, I didn't.

1213
01:26:43,815 --> 01:26:46,920
Yeah, well, the FBI
showed me your transcript!

1214
01:26:56,762 --> 01:26:59,562
Well, that's just cheating.
I...

1215
01:26:59,564 --> 01:27:01,734
- Open the door.
- Fucking liars.

1216
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:05,870
Tonya, I told you

1217
01:27:05,872 --> 01:27:08,705
they couldn't...
they couldn't prove anything.

1218
01:27:08,707 --> 01:27:12,478
All... All I ever wanted
was to protect you, Tonya.

1219
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,717
Baby, you're...
you're all I ever wanted.

1220
01:27:24,123 --> 01:27:25,359
Honey.

1221
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,837
I fucking lost you now,
didn't I?

1222
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:41,508
Look, Jeff, I...

1223
01:27:43,109 --> 01:27:46,043
I mean, what did you
want me to say?

1224
01:27:46,045 --> 01:27:50,383
I told them that you did this
because you <i>did</i> fucking did this!

1225
01:27:53,219 --> 01:27:54,855
Tonya, what am I
supposed to do?

1226
01:27:57,457 --> 01:28:00,427
Tonya. Honey?

1227
01:28:07,099 --> 01:28:08,668
I don't know. I...

1228
01:28:11,069 --> 01:28:14,340
I really think that you
should just kill yourself.

1229
01:28:35,728 --> 01:28:37,628
<i>Now, there's
this feeling out there</i>

1230
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:40,664
<i>that the one
who was power mad,</i>

1231
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:44,134
<i>the one who was
megalomaniacal was you.</i>

1232
01:28:44,136 --> 01:28:49,106
<i>Incorrect. Um, I am
a professional bodyguard</i>

1233
01:28:49,108 --> 01:28:52,610
<i>and an international
counterterrorism expert.</i>

1234
01:28:52,612 --> 01:28:57,484
<i>I-I work around the world
for espionage agencies.</i>

1235
01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:01,518
<i>But, Shawn,
you don't.</i>

1236
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:02,920
<i>But I do.</i>

1237
01:29:02,922 --> 01:29:06,723
<i>But, Shawn, we checked
and you don't.</i>

1238
01:29:06,725 --> 01:29:09,994
<i>- But I do.
- But you don't.</i>

1239
01:29:09,996 --> 01:29:12,862
<i>But I do. I, uh,
have actually been quoted</i>

1240
01:29:12,864 --> 01:29:17,735
<i>as an expert, uh, in terrorism
trends and profiles.</i>

1241
01:29:17,737 --> 01:29:18,737
<i>Where?</i>

1242
01:29:20,038 --> 01:29:21,608
<i>Um, in...</i>

1243
01:29:24,243 --> 01:29:28,012
<i>I believe it was a travel
magazine a couple of years ago</i>

1244
01:29:28,014 --> 01:29:30,647
<i>during the Gulf War.</i>

1245
01:30:29,675 --> 01:30:33,677
<i>Here in Portland, Oregon, another day
of practice for skater Tonya Harding.</i>

1246
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:36,714
<i>She's still working out every
day right here behind me,</i>

1247
01:30:36,716 --> 01:30:39,116
<i>fully expecting
she'll compete later this month</i>

1248
01:30:39,118 --> 01:30:40,617
<i>at the Olympics in Norway.</i>

1249
01:30:40,619 --> 01:30:42,219
<i>Police and the FBI
continue looking into</i>

1250
01:30:42,221 --> 01:30:44,621
<i>last week's attack
on skater Nancy Kerrigan.</i>

1251
01:30:44,623 --> 01:30:48,258
<i>Even as the US Figure Skating
Association convenes a hearing panel</i>

1252
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:51,195
<i>to consider whether there are
grounds to remove Tonya Harding</i>

1253
01:30:51,197 --> 01:30:52,696
<i>from the American Olympic team.</i>

1254
01:30:52,698 --> 01:30:54,897
<i>Harding's former husband
said Tuesday</i>

1255
01:30:54,899 --> 01:30:57,267
<i>that she knew about the attack
on Nancy Kerrigan</i>

1256
01:30:57,269 --> 01:30:58,269
<i>from the beginning.</i>

1257
01:31:25,131 --> 01:31:28,665
<i>The papers all said I
pled guilty, which I did,</i>

1258
01:31:28,667 --> 01:31:30,733
<i>but not to planning the attack,</i>

1259
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:34,237
<i>uh, which it turns out
didn't really matter because...</i>

1260
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:38,107
once I knew about it and didn't
report it and try to cover it all up,

1261
01:31:38,109 --> 01:31:40,277
I was guilty.

1262
01:31:40,279 --> 01:31:42,879
<i>Tonya's mom put out a red
velvet rope in front of her house.</i>

1263
01:31:42,881 --> 01:31:44,281
Get your fat ass
where it belongs.

1264
01:31:44,283 --> 01:31:48,152
<i>Told us if we wanted to take her
picture, we all had to stand behind it.</i>

1265
01:31:48,154 --> 01:31:50,219
<i>And we did!</i>

1266
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:53,057
<i>I made bail.</i>

1267
01:31:53,059 --> 01:31:57,797
<i>I was charged with racketeering
and fined $100,000.</i>

1268
01:32:00,032 --> 01:32:02,765
<i>Which I never paid.</i>

1269
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:06,006
<i>And I never
talked to Shawn again.</i>

1270
01:32:07,773 --> 01:32:12,679
I thought being famous
was gonna be fun.

1271
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:18,651
I was loved...

1272
01:32:19,719 --> 01:32:20,987
for a minute.

1273
01:32:23,088 --> 01:32:24,791
Then I was hated.

1274
01:32:27,493 --> 01:32:29,796
Then I was
just a punch line.

1275
01:32:33,899 --> 01:32:36,069
It was like being abused
all over again.

1276
01:32:37,069 --> 01:32:39,072
Only this time,
it was by you.

1277
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:42,842
All of you.

1278
01:32:44,944 --> 01:32:47,047
You're all my attackers too.

1279
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,314
<i>With just four
weeks to go to Lillehammer,</i>

1280
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:53,517
<i>she returned to training
this week in Oregon</i>

1281
01:32:53,519 --> 01:32:57,955
<i>under intense media scrutiny and pressure
to withdraw from the Olympic team.</i>

1282
01:32:57,957 --> 01:33:00,156
<i>Kerrigan also was
back on the ice this week,</i>

1283
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:02,291
<i>striving to make it
to Lillehammer.</i>

1284
01:33:02,293 --> 01:33:04,294
<i>But in interviews

<i>former Olympians
and skating insiders</i>

<i>have said
the events of recent weeks</i>

1287
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:11,034
<i>could turn into major stumbling
blocks for both competitors</i>

1288
01:33:11,036 --> 01:33:12,739
<i>as they pursue the gold...</i>

1289
01:33:31,791 --> 01:33:33,126
Go away.

1290
01:33:35,194 --> 01:33:37,130
Shit.

1291
01:33:38,163 --> 01:33:40,964
Could you please
just leave me alone?

1292
01:33:40,966 --> 01:33:42,933
For now?

1293
01:33:50,074 --> 01:33:51,508
Now...

1294
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:54,880
So, what's new?

1295
01:34:05,123 --> 01:34:07,126
Like your hair
pulled back like that.

1296
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:09,128
You look young.

1297
01:34:10,162 --> 01:34:12,030
I'm 23, Mom.

1298
01:34:13,431 --> 01:34:14,900
Yeah, well...

1299
01:34:17,403 --> 01:34:19,338
You seem to be
holding up good.

1300
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,207
Fuck 'em, you know?

1301
01:34:24,209 --> 01:34:25,209
I know.

1302
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:31,415
I never did
like that Jeff.

1303
01:34:31,417 --> 01:34:34,254
- Mom...
- I'm not here to tell you I told you so. I'm not.

1304
01:34:38,556 --> 01:34:40,557
Why are you here?

1305
01:34:40,559 --> 01:34:42,061
What do you want?

1306
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:44,930
I want you to know...

1307
01:34:47,198 --> 01:34:49,368
I don't know.
I-I'm on your side.

1308
01:34:55,608 --> 01:34:57,276
That's a big crowd
out there.

1309
01:34:58,944 --> 01:35:02,015
A lot of people support you.

1310
01:35:05,417 --> 01:35:07,187
You done good.

1311
01:35:10,655 --> 01:35:12,859
I'm proud of you.

1312
01:35:19,364 --> 01:35:21,166
All right. I'm going.

1313
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:23,402
Mom.

1314
01:35:28,373 --> 01:35:31,176
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1315
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:46,425
Hey, hon. Did you know
about the attack?

1316
01:35:57,936 --> 01:35:59,338
Well, you can tell me.

1317
01:36:03,108 --> 01:36:05,442
What?
What are you looking for?

1318
01:36:05,444 --> 01:36:07,411
What are you...?
Stop it!

1319
01:36:07,413 --> 01:36:08,481
Uh...

1320
01:36:11,417 --> 01:36:12,919
It's just a...

1321
01:36:15,954 --> 01:36:17,254
Oh, wow.

1322
01:36:17,256 --> 01:36:18,455
I still meant
everything I said.

1323
01:36:18,457 --> 01:36:20,189
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- You hear me?

1324
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:21,959
- Get out!
- I still meant everything I said.

1325
01:36:21,961 --> 01:36:23,093
Go! Get out!

1326
01:36:23,095 --> 01:36:25,265
Fuck, that hurt.

1327
01:36:26,532 --> 01:36:28,331
No comment.
No fucking comment.

1328
01:36:28,333 --> 01:36:30,269
Hey! Out of my way!

1329
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:32,438
- Wait!
- Tonya!

1330
01:36:34,073 --> 01:36:37,273
<i>Okay. I used to
have her tires flattened</i>

1331
01:36:37,275 --> 01:36:40,242
<i>and her truck towed sometimes.</i>

1332
01:36:40,244 --> 01:36:42,579
So we can get a picture,
you know?

1333
01:36:42,581 --> 01:36:45,182
This was the first time there was
a 24-hour news cycle to fill.

1334
01:36:45,184 --> 01:36:46,683
We all needed that story.

1335
01:36:46,685 --> 01:36:48,485
Bullshit.

1336
01:36:48,487 --> 01:36:50,586
I shouldn't have to apologize
for something I didn't do.

1337
01:36:50,588 --> 01:36:53,557
Tonya, there's talk about not letting
you skate at the Olympics at all.

1338
01:36:53,559 --> 01:36:57,094
You need to give them this.
We're hanging on by a thread.

1339
01:36:57,096 --> 01:37:00,030
I earned my place on the team
fair and square.

1340
01:37:00,032 --> 01:37:01,697
Taking out the competition
with a retractable baton

1341
01:37:01,699 --> 01:37:03,032
doesn't strike everyone
that way.

1342
01:37:03,034 --> 01:37:04,701
I didn't know about it!

1343
01:37:04,703 --> 01:37:07,304
And that's exactly
what you'll say.

1344
01:37:07,306 --> 01:37:09,039
I can't fucking focus
when I'm trying to skate.

1345
01:37:09,041 --> 01:37:11,174
I keep falling
in front of everyone

1346
01:37:11,176 --> 01:37:13,410
while Nancy gets
her own private rink

1347
01:37:13,412 --> 01:37:15,478
where someone catches her
before she falls.

1348
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:18,749
Honey, you'll apologize,
and this will all be over.

1349
01:37:18,751 --> 01:37:21,521
Okay.
I'll do whatever it takes.

1350
01:37:27,126 --> 01:37:29,692
<i>I apologized for ever knowing</i>

1351
01:37:29,694 --> 01:37:31,527
<i>or being associated with Jeff,</i>

1352
01:37:31,529 --> 01:37:35,567
<i>which looks like
I'll never stop doing, ever.</i>

1353
01:37:41,539 --> 01:37:48,014
I had no prior knowledge of the
planned assault on Nancy Kerrigan.

1354
01:37:50,349 --> 01:37:53,482
I am responsible,
however,

1355
01:37:53,484 --> 01:37:55,121
for frailing to...

1356
01:37:57,422 --> 01:37:58,522
failing to...

1357
01:37:58,524 --> 01:38:00,357
<i>And when the Olympic committee</i>

1358
01:38:00,359 --> 01:38:03,326
<i>threatened to take me
off the team,</i>

1359
01:38:03,328 --> 01:38:06,562
<i>I filed a $10 million lawsuit
against them.</i>

1360
01:38:06,564 --> 01:38:08,531
<i>I mean, it was getting ugly.</i>

1361
01:38:08,533 --> 01:38:11,233
But do you think that CBS,
who is showing the games,

1362
01:38:11,235 --> 01:38:15,438
was gonna let this ginormous
ratings fucker not happen?

1363
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:20,576
<i>I mean the whole entire world
was waiting for this... showdown</i>

1364
01:38:20,578 --> 01:38:22,481
<i>between me and Nancy, so...</i>

1365
01:38:23,649 --> 01:38:25,151
<i>I made the team.</i>

1366
01:38:26,651 --> 01:38:29,188
<i>You know, and I was
ready to show you all.</i>

1367
01:38:30,622 --> 01:38:32,289
<i>And this is one of the nights</i>

1368
01:38:32,291 --> 01:38:34,857
<i>everybody's been talking about
around the world.</i>

1369
01:38:34,859 --> 01:38:38,161
<i>One of the most controversial and
talked-about sports events in memory,</i>

1370
01:38:38,163 --> 01:38:40,429
<i>the women's figure skating
competition.</i>

1371
01:38:40,431 --> 01:38:43,165
<i>World champion Oksana Baiul
in second place</i>

1372
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:44,668
<i>going into
tonight's competition,</i>

1373
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:48,237
<i>Nancy Kerrigan in first place
after the technical program,</i>

1374
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:50,639
<i>and Katerina Witt,
a two-time gold medalist</i>

1375
01:38:50,641 --> 01:38:52,412
<i>who will be the last to skate.</i>

1376
01:39:53,672 --> 01:39:55,638
Right here.
Have a seat.

1377
01:39:55,640 --> 01:40:00,477
<i>I was asked to comment
on everything for</i> Hard Copy.

1378
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:02,845
<i>And they paid a lot,
which was cool.</i>

1379
01:40:02,847 --> 01:40:06,616
<i>Representing the United
States of America, Tonya Harding.</i>

1380
01:40:06,618 --> 01:40:08,384
And now the public address

1381
01:40:08,386 --> 01:40:10,687
is announcing
Tonya Harding's name.

1382
01:40:10,689 --> 01:40:13,526
It is her turn to be
on the ice right now.

1383
01:40:25,671 --> 01:40:29,906
<i>Tonya Harding after the warm-up
had a problem with her laces.</i>

1384
01:40:29,908 --> 01:40:32,409
<i>If she's not out here, I
think they're gonna disqualify her.</i>

1385
01:40:32,411 --> 01:40:34,811
<i>I'm not sure. I've never
seen anything like this.</i>

1386
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:38,416
Is it gonna hold?

1387
01:40:43,288 --> 01:40:44,821
Pull it tight enough?

1388
01:40:44,823 --> 01:40:46,923
How does that feel?

1389
01:40:46,925 --> 01:40:48,427
It's okay, honey.

1390
01:40:48,926 --> 01:40:50,794
It's okay.

1391
01:40:50,796 --> 01:40:52,298
We're just gonna...

1392
01:40:54,899 --> 01:40:56,201
Okay, okay.

1393
01:40:56,969 --> 01:40:58,268
It's okay, honey.
It's okay.

1394
01:40:58,270 --> 01:40:59,635
Breathe, breathe.

1395
01:41:03,274 --> 01:41:07,009
- How long do we have?
- We have, uh, one minute.

1396
01:41:07,011 --> 01:41:08,313
A minute?

1397
01:41:09,581 --> 01:41:11,348
Oh, my God.

1398
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:12,549
Do you wanna try?

1399
01:41:12,551 --> 01:41:15,585
It doesn't matter. Just...
Let's go.

1400
01:41:15,587 --> 01:41:17,723
It's not gonna hold me.

1401
01:41:32,938 --> 01:41:34,472
I'm gonna break my ankle.

1402
01:41:35,806 --> 01:41:38,274
You check out those
edges in the beginning.

1403
01:41:38,276 --> 01:41:41,547
You jump high, check out
hard, and go for it.

1404
01:41:42,314 --> 01:41:43,615
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1405
01:43:20,878 --> 01:43:23,448
Please. They broke.

1406
01:43:28,052 --> 01:43:30,853
I really tried
to get out here on time.

1407
01:43:30,855 --> 01:43:32,589
Please.

1408
01:43:32,591 --> 01:43:34,156
<i>In a situation like this,</i>

1409
01:43:34,158 --> 01:43:38,894
<i>the referee, the judging panel
will give her every opportunity</i>

1410
01:43:38,896 --> 01:43:40,964
<i>to put out her best performance.</i>

1411
01:43:40,966 --> 01:43:43,599
<i>I would think, though
no announcement has been made,</i>

1412
01:43:43,601 --> 01:43:47,403
<i>they've obviously given her
a set amount of time.</i>

1413
01:43:47,405 --> 01:43:50,506
<i>Things like
this just don't happen.</i>

1414
01:43:50,508 --> 01:43:53,843
<i>Again, it's so important
that the skate is tied properly.</i>

1415
01:43:53,845 --> 01:43:56,879
<i>It's important that it's
comfortable on your foot.</i>

1416
01:43:56,881 --> 01:44:00,618
<i>Well, I think they're allowing
Tonya to fix her skate.</i>

1417
01:44:01,752 --> 01:44:05,155
<i>Again, this is every skater's
recurring nightmare.</i>

1418
01:44:05,157 --> 01:44:08,924
<i>This is one that you wake up
screaming from every morning.</i>

1419
01:44:08,926 --> 01:44:11,930
Can I just say one quick thing
about Nancy Kerrigan?

1420
01:44:13,498 --> 01:44:15,898
So, my lace breaks,

1421
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:18,168
which I guess is my fault,

1422
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:20,637
but really kinda isn't.

1423
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:25,474
And I go out and do the same
stuff as everybody else.

1424
01:44:25,476 --> 01:44:30,546
<i>I didn't get the marks because I didn't ever
have a shot with the judges to begin with.</i>

1425
01:44:30,548 --> 01:44:34,717
I mean, it was a big story,
but I don't need a big story.

1426
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:38,153
<i>I'm a big story on my own
when I skate.</i>

1427
01:44:38,155 --> 01:44:41,124
I did my best,
and I got eighth.

1428
01:44:41,126 --> 01:44:43,492
<i>But Nancy...</i>

1429
01:44:43,494 --> 01:44:47,563
she goes out and gives
a beautiful skate.

1430
01:44:47,565 --> 01:44:48,767
I never said different.

1431
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:53,202
<i>She wins
a friggin' silver medal.</i>

1432
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:55,237
<i>And when they put that medal
around her neck,</i>

1433
01:44:55,239 --> 01:44:57,443
<i>she looked like
she stepped in poop.</i>

1434
01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:00,809
She does.

1435
01:45:00,811 --> 01:45:02,812
I mean, come on!

1436
01:45:02,814 --> 01:45:07,851
How am I the poor sport
in all of this?

1437
01:45:07,853 --> 01:45:10,719
<i>An Olympic silver.</i>

1438
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:12,757
She looks like
she stepped in poop.

1439
01:45:14,091 --> 01:45:16,795
Defendant, please rise.

1440
01:45:18,630 --> 01:45:23,165
<i>They postponed my trial
till after the Olympics.</i>

1441
01:45:23,167 --> 01:45:27,836
Tonya Harding, you are hereby
sentenced to three years' probation.

1442
01:45:27,838 --> 01:45:33,776
$100,000 fine, plus $10,000 to the
DA's office for special costs.

1443
01:45:33,778 --> 01:45:37,914
Another $50,000 to set up
a fund for the Special Olympics.

1444
01:45:37,916 --> 01:45:40,582
Five hundred hours
community service.

1445
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:44,219
A psychological evaluation.

1446
01:45:44,221 --> 01:45:46,255
And your immediate
resignation

1447
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:48,857
from the US
Figure Skating Association,

1448
01:45:48,859 --> 01:45:51,059
banning you for life

1449
01:45:51,061 --> 01:45:55,667
from all figure skating association
competitions and events.

1450
01:45:58,136 --> 01:45:59,538
So ordered.

1451
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:01,771
No. I...

1452
01:46:03,675 --> 01:46:06,945
All I did was the hindering
of prosecution...

1453
01:46:09,314 --> 01:46:12,549
- What? That you're never...
- He already ruled.

1454
01:46:12,551 --> 01:46:15,151
Never gonna let me
skate again?

1455
01:46:15,153 --> 01:46:18,321
I can't ever... I mean,

1456
01:46:18,323 --> 01:46:20,622
I'd rather do the
jail time, please.

1457
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:22,291
- The...
- Tonya.

1458
01:46:22,293 --> 01:46:25,161
They... They only got
18 months.

1459
01:46:25,163 --> 01:46:26,829
They... They got
18 months.

1460
01:46:26,831 --> 01:46:29,901
I-I'll do that.
You can't...

1461
01:46:34,038 --> 01:46:39,008
Your Honor, I don't
have an education.

1462
01:46:39,010 --> 01:46:42,812
All I know is skating.
That's all I know.

1463
01:46:42,814 --> 01:46:46,782
And I... I am no one
if I can't...

1464
01:46:46,784 --> 01:46:48,351
- if I can't skate.
- It's okay.

1465
01:46:49,954 --> 01:46:51,920
I'm... I'm not...

1466
01:46:51,922 --> 01:46:53,822
- I mean, I'm not some monster...
- Miss Harding.

1467
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:57,160
I'm just... I'm just trying to...
I'm trying to do the best

1468
01:46:57,162 --> 01:46:59,228
- with what I know how to... and you're giving me...
- Miss Harding.

1469
01:46:59,230 --> 01:47:02,197
It's like you're giving me a life sentence
if you do that. You can't do that.

1470
01:47:02,199 --> 01:47:03,265
Miss Harding, that's enough.

1471
01:47:03,267 --> 01:47:04,299
You can't...

1472
01:47:04,301 --> 01:47:06,803
Please, because...

1473
01:47:06,805 --> 01:47:09,805
Just send me to jail
and then I can still skate.

1474
01:47:09,807 --> 01:47:12,075
- I've given you...
- Just send me to jail and then I can skate.

1475
01:47:12,077 --> 01:47:14,012
I've given you my decision.

1476
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:16,682
Thank you, Your Honor.

1477
01:47:19,717 --> 01:47:22,884
This is
the best we could get.

1478
01:47:22,886 --> 01:47:27,055
<i>Top ten questions Connie Chung
asked Tonya Harding earlier.</i>

1479
01:47:27,057 --> 01:47:29,058
<i>Here we go. Number 10:</i>

1480
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:31,960
<i>Would you walk through the metal
detector for me one more time, please?</i>

1481
01:47:33,797 --> 01:47:36,965
<i>Uh, number nine: Do you think
you could kick my ass?</i>

1482
01:47:36,967 --> 01:47:39,001
<i>Number eight: Can you help
me and Maury have a baby?</i>

1483
01:47:39,003 --> 01:47:41,103
<i>Well, I think
that's uncalled for.</i>

1484
01:47:41,105 --> 01:47:43,639
<i>Uh, number seven: How much do you
think your pals would charge</i>

1485
01:47:43,641 --> 01:47:45,375
<i>to whack
Dan Rather's knees?</i>

1486
01:47:45,377 --> 01:47:47,276
<i>Number five:
Do you know Amy Fisher?</i>

1487
01:47:47,278 --> 01:47:49,411
<i>Number four:</i>

1488
01:47:49,413 --> 01:47:53,081
<i>When you hit Nancy in the knee, did
it sort of sound like, "Chung!"</i>

1489
01:47:59,823 --> 01:48:03,962
Got a two-year sentence
and did eight months to the day.

1490
01:48:07,064 --> 01:48:09,165
<i>All that craziness,</i>

1491
01:48:09,167 --> 01:48:11,668
<i>you know, everything
I'll ever be known for</i>

1492
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:16,074
<i>was only a few months,
from start to finish.</i>

1493
01:48:17,374 --> 01:48:19,375
<i>I got up one morning
before I went to jail,</i>

1494
01:48:19,377 --> 01:48:22,014
<i>and the press was leaving.</i>

1495
01:48:23,715 --> 01:48:25,281
<i>Like I dreamed it.</i>

1496
01:48:25,283 --> 01:48:27,082
<i>Simpson told
police he was in Chicago</i>

1497
01:48:27,084 --> 01:48:28,183
<i>at the time
of the killings.</i>

1498
01:48:28,185 --> 01:48:29,285
<i>He arrived at the home</i>

1499
01:48:29,287 --> 01:48:31,254
<i>12 hours after the bodies
were discovered.</i>

1500
01:48:31,256 --> 01:48:33,289
<i>Police escorted him
to the rear of the building.</i>

1501
01:48:33,291 --> 01:48:36,692
<i>And a short time later,
Simpson was seen in handcuffs.</i>

1502
01:48:36,694 --> 01:48:38,764
<i>After a conference
with Simpson's attorney...</i>

1503
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:42,330
I never see Tonya anymore,
and this is fine.

1504
01:48:42,332 --> 01:48:43,768
I could care less.

1505
01:48:44,935 --> 01:48:47,672
I lead a full life.
Very happy.

1506
01:48:53,444 --> 01:48:58,916
Tonya... would never have thought
of calling in a death threat.

1507
01:49:00,851 --> 01:49:06,488
And... I was too caught up
in all the terrible things

1508
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:08,159
that she was saying
about me...

1509
01:49:09,828 --> 01:49:12,931
rather than the fact
that I...

1510
01:49:15,899 --> 01:49:17,935
completely
ruined her career.

1511
01:49:24,242 --> 01:49:25,944
Absolutely ruined it.

1512
01:49:28,378 --> 01:49:32,948
<i>Once I was banned
from figure skating for life,</i>

1513
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:35,820
<i>I didn't have a lot of options.</i>

1514
01:49:37,221 --> 01:49:39,856
Did what I had to do
to just stay in the public eye

1515
01:49:39,858 --> 01:49:42,261
and pay the bills.

1516
01:49:43,394 --> 01:49:46,394
<i>I was the second
most-known person</i>

1517
01:49:46,396 --> 01:49:49,068
<i>behind Bill Clinton
in the world.</i>

01:49:50,834 --> 01:49:52,738
<i>That meant something.</i>

1519
01:49:53,837 --> 01:49:55,838
<i>And people
still wanted to see me.</i>

1520
01:49:58,243 --> 01:50:01,747
<i>So I became a lady boxer.</i>

1521
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:04,213
<i>I mean, why not?</i>

1522
01:50:04,215 --> 01:50:06,982
<i>Violence was always
what I knew anyway.</i>

1523
01:50:18,462 --> 01:50:20,196
<i>America, you know...</i>

1524
01:50:24,202 --> 01:50:26,402
<i>They want someone to love.</i>

1525
01:50:28,506 --> 01:50:31,107
<i>But they want
someone to hate.</i>

1526
01:50:36,948 --> 01:50:39,549
<i>And they want it easy.</i>

1527
01:50:39,551 --> 01:50:41,584
<i>But what's easy?</i>

1528
01:50:41,586 --> 01:50:45,454
<i>And the haters always say,</i>

1529
01:50:45,456 --> 01:50:48,558
<i>"Tonya, tell the truth."</i>

1530
01:50:51,195 --> 01:50:53,262
<i>There's no such thing
as truth.</i>

1531
01:50:53,264 --> 01:50:55,130
<i>I mean it's bullshit.</i>

1532
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:04,941
<i>Everyone has their own truth.</i>

1533
01:51:04,943 --> 01:51:07,910
<i>And life just does
whatever the fuck it wants.</i>

1534
01:51:36,006 --> 01:51:38,340
<i>That's the story
of my life.</i>

1535
01:51:41,378 --> 01:51:43,912
And that's the fucking truth.

1537
01:54:28,645 --> 01:54:33,214
'Cause there's no "You can't
do it" type of thing.

1538
01:54:33,216 --> 01:54:34,750
She won't do it.

1539
01:54:34,752 --> 01:54:36,254
That's incorrect.

1540
01:54:37,788 --> 01:54:42,090
Um, my training
and education,

1541
01:54:42,092 --> 01:54:46,195
um, has been in the areas of
counterespionage and counterterrorism.

1542
01:54:46,197 --> 01:54:48,363
- I can't talk about the specifics.
- Sure.

1543
01:54:48,365 --> 01:54:51,200
And we're just as anxious
to talk to you guys

1544
01:54:51,202 --> 01:54:53,134
as you are to us.

1545
01:54:53,136 --> 01:54:55,071
- There'll be more in a few days.
- Yeah, hopefully.

1546
01:54:55,073 --> 01:54:56,272
I'm really happy,

1547
01:54:56,274 --> 01:54:58,441
but, um, there won't be
a true crown

1548
01:54:58,443 --> 01:54:59,776
until I get my chance
with Nancy.

1549
01:54:59,778 --> 01:55:03,280
That is the Olympics, and let me
tell ya, I'm gonna whip her butt.
