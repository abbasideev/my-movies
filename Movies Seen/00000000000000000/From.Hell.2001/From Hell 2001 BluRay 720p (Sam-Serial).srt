1
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:19,886
Get out of here!

2
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:50,146
You're taking all our money again.

3
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,737
You'll feel better when you get home.

4
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:17,984
There's one over there.

5
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:27,221
- Gonna be a long night, Mary.
- Too bloody long.

6
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:37,965
It's quiet, isn't it? You having any luck?

7
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:39,629
Not much, love.

8
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:50,116
- Give you a penny for a suck.
- Piss off.

9
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:54,587
- Hi. Where's Kate?
- Across the street.

10
00:04:01,695 --> 00:04:02,719
Miss?

11
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:06,231
- What do you want?
- Shut your hole, bitch.

12
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:09,662
I know you.
You're Geordie, from Nichol Street.

13
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:12,635
Do you remember me, Mary Kelly?

14
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,107
I'd never forget you, McQueen.

15
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:20,838
Will you stop that?
Buttons are hard to come by.

16
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:24,776
What does a whore need buttons for?

17
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:29,287
I warned you and your friends.
Payment was expected Monday.

18
00:04:29,623 --> 00:04:31,591
I'm working, ain't I?

19
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:32,783
We all are.

20
00:04:33,894 --> 00:04:38,297
And I am making sure
that no one troubles you.

21
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:42,364
I'm providing a service, Mary Kelly.

22
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,770
And I expect to be paid...

23
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:48,166
...or else you will be very troubled.

24
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:50,342
Now, you tell...

25
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:52,736
...your five...

26
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:56,707
...friends they bring me my money
by tomorrow...

27
00:04:57,484 --> 00:04:59,315
...or this friend of mine here...

28
00:04:59,486 --> 00:05:01,750
...will be your next customer.

29
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,253
- You're bloody filthy this morning.
- I bleedin' stink.

30
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:45,094
- What'd you get up to last night?
- You don't want to know.

31
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,158
Give us a look.

32
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,399
Mary.

33
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:00,241
Thank God I found you.

34
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,845
He's coming.

35
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:04,073
Albert's coming today.

36
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:06,482
I need you to look after the baby.

37
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:08,154
Let's have a hold.

38
00:06:09,222 --> 00:06:13,124
- I'm so proud of her.
- She's the most gorgeous little girl.

39
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:15,490
Isn't she beautiful?

40
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,930
She's lovely, isn't she?

41
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,861
I'll be seeing you in a bit.

42
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:22,999
Get us a jar of gin, will you?

43
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:25,264
You look fine, Ann.

44
00:06:25,672 --> 00:06:28,573
Must be nice,
having a rich man looking after you.

45
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:32,877
She has your eyes and her father's brow.
Don't you think?

46
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:38,578
She is a perfect love, but, Ann,
we're all in a terrible way for money.

47
00:06:38,752 --> 00:06:41,050
- The Nichols gang...
- They want our blood.

48
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:43,746
- Know what they said they'd do?
- Don't start.

49
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:45,688
What's she saying?

50
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:48,054
They want £1 a week from each of us.

51
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:50,095
Count yourself lucky.

52
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,563
Good and lucky that you got
a wealthy man to take care of you.

53
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,727
We need £4 to pay them,
so we can't spare the time.

54
00:06:58,205 --> 00:07:00,571
I'll get you the £4 from Albert.

55
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:02,767
He might say no. I can't take a chance.

56
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:05,243
He won't. I know he won't.

57
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:08,206
He's been in France on business.

58
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:10,907
He wrote, he sold a lot of his paintings.

59
00:07:10,984 --> 00:07:13,544
He's sure to have full pockets
and feel generous.

60
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:16,450
- To you perhaps, but...
- I'll ask for meself.

61
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,115
I'll get you the £4. I promise.

62
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,134
I'm not gonna hurt you, Netley.

63
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:34,137
Remember me?

64
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,509
Remember who I am?

65
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:42,812
Your charge will be coming down
sooner than expected. Much sooner.

66
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,779
Be a good man. Get him home quickly.

67
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:48,648
Quickly and quietly.

68
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:50,455
Understood?

69
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:54,616
Well said.

70
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:57,392
Very well said.

71
00:08:36,937 --> 00:08:38,302
Take them out.

72
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:40,236
What is the meaning of this?

73
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:42,798
Kidney, what in God's name are you doing?

74
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:49,605
I want this room in pieces.

75
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,419
I demand an explanation.

76
00:08:58,525 --> 00:08:59,890
It's Albert.

77
00:09:08,802 --> 00:09:10,064
Get off me.

78
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:13,903
Please. No!

79
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:22,175
Who knows?

80
00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:26,242
I didn't know.

81
00:09:26,787 --> 00:09:28,550
I swear, I didn't.

82
00:09:28,855 --> 00:09:31,050
How can I tell anyone else?

83
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:35,422
Who knows?

84
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,895
Who knows?

85
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,701
I don't know who they could be.

86
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:51,940
Albert must've mixed in
with something terrible.

87
00:09:52,345 --> 00:09:55,246
She's hungry and cold, poor thing.

88
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,015
I've got to take her to them.

89
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:01,416
I've got to take her to Ann's parents.

90
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:04,218
You go. Leave baby Alice with them.

91
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,260
I'll get to work,
and I'll meet you later at the Ten Bells.

92
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:08,278
Notice something, Inspector?

93
00:12:23,997 --> 00:12:26,659
I pay. I already pay.

94
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,563
I'm not after you, Emperor. Where is he?

95
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:33,502
Move it!

96
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:44,611
Get up.

97
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,343
Get up!

98
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,621
Hello, darling.

99
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:10,236
Sergeant.

100
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:14,537
It's night.

101
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:18,139
Well spotted, Inspector Abberline.
Indeed it is night.

102
00:13:18,218 --> 00:13:20,209
Our genius has returned to us.

103
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:22,154
Thank you, gentlemen.

104
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:26,224
Remember, if you ever wish to escape
the dreary confines of your duties...

105
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,120
...this never happened.

106
00:13:28,294 --> 00:13:29,693
Cut along now.

107
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:34,593
Have I lost a day?

108
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:37,463
No. It's only four hours since you left here.

109
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:41,765
Deepest apologies for the rude awakening.

110
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,635
I suspect you enjoyed that.

111
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:47,679
"I must be cruel only to be kind,"
as the poet said.

112
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:51,339
Although, I'd happily wallop you
every time you chase the dragon.

113
00:13:51,684 --> 00:13:54,380
I had a sneaking suspicion
you might interrupt.

114
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:56,415
You've seen something?

115
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,680
What did you see?

116
00:14:01,428 --> 00:14:03,919
A petticoat saturated with blood.

117
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:08,256
They used to burn men like you alive.

118
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:13,029
Sometime this evening,
a bangtail was murdered in George Yard.

119
00:14:13,273 --> 00:14:15,707
That doesn't sound
much out of the ordinary.

120
00:14:16,142 --> 00:14:17,973
It was the way she was done.

121
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:23,078
It was the way the bangtail was done
that cries out for a man of your talents.

122
00:14:33,526 --> 00:14:35,551
Her name was Martha Tabram.

123
00:14:35,762 --> 00:14:38,390
I don't know what sort of name Tabram is.

124
00:14:38,898 --> 00:14:40,832
It sounds foreign to me.

125
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:43,832
This is not what I saw.

126
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,463
Not the woman of your dreams?

127
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:48,001
Are you sure?

128
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:52,372
- Show him.
- You show him.

129
00:14:53,346 --> 00:14:57,476
Why do I have to be exposed
to this degradation over and over again?

130
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:00,249
I've looked at the mess twice.

131
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,155
Before he cut her throat,
he removed her livelihood as a keepsake.

132
00:15:20,707 --> 00:15:24,006
Gentlemen,
we are indeed fortunate today...

133
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:29,710
...to be able to observe an entirely new
approach to the treatment of insanity.

134
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:33,452
Dr. Ferral, I was just saying
to my colleagues...

135
00:15:33,653 --> 00:15:37,987
...we're here in the hope you'll permit us
to observe this new treatment of yours.

136
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:41,922
I wasn't expecting
such distinguished visitors.

137
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:43,825
But you're all welcome, of course.

138
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:45,624
I'm ready to begin.

139
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:48,162
- Who is your patient?
- Ann Crook.

140
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:53,061
An unfortunate, Sir William,
who is hysterical and violent.

141
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:55,764
And has severe delusions of persecution.

142
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:58,737
Poor girl. Do please proceed.

143
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,306
Gentlemen.

144
00:16:51,364 --> 00:16:53,332
We have one tap above...

145
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,463
...and one into the left lobe.

146
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,433
And...

147
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:07,072
...one on the right...

148
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,047
...and this unlucky patient's dementia...

149
00:17:11,384 --> 00:17:13,545
...will no longer take a violent form.

150
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,150
Thanks to this simple procedure...

151
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,156
...we can now permanently alleviate
the poor girl's suffering.

152
00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:30,198
What could I do? I had to leave
the baby with Ann's parents.

153
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:32,930
Rich man?
Thought he was gonna take care of her?

154
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:34,940
Knew that was too good to be true.

155
00:17:35,008 --> 00:17:37,340
They're gonna kill every one of us.

156
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,101
Who is this Albert anyway?

157
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:43,740
Who cares about Albert
and Ann's troubles?

158
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:45,443
What are we gonna do?

159
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:48,452
We can't stay clear
of the Nichols boys forever.

160
00:17:48,521 --> 00:17:50,955
They say that they held
poor Martha down...

161
00:17:51,057 --> 00:17:53,617
...and watched her bleed
until she passed out.

162
00:17:53,726 --> 00:17:55,819
Then they cut her throat.

163
00:17:55,962 --> 00:17:59,398
McQueen is mad.
He enjoys hurting women.

164
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,592
It's insane that they want £4.
How are we gonna get £4?

165
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,798
Not with my old cunny.
I'd be lucky to get four pence.

166
00:18:08,374 --> 00:18:11,172
Behave yourselves or bugger off.

167
00:18:11,411 --> 00:18:12,969
You can bugger off.

168
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:15,438
We work, girls.

169
00:18:15,615 --> 00:18:19,415
We work the streets harder than ever.
Right?

170
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:20,877
Right?

171
00:18:23,423 --> 00:18:25,948
All right. We can do it here, but hurry up.

172
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:28,755
- The bobbies are tracking us tonight.
- Right.

173
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:31,091
Gotta get the old man hard first.

174
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:34,030
Give it here. I'll put it in meself.

175
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:40,165
- Is that in?
- Of course it is. Come on.

176
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:43,675
It's not.
You got it stuck between your legs.

177
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:46,075
No, I haven't. Come on.

178
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:48,170
I knows it when I feels it.

179
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:01,689
That's mine, Polly.

180
00:19:02,195 --> 00:19:03,753
That's my money.

181
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:10,768
I could pop your eye out.

182
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:13,034
The customers wouldn't mind.

183
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:16,164
They don't mind if a whore can see.

184
00:19:18,344 --> 00:19:20,812
- What's that you got there?
- What've I got here?

185
00:19:21,581 --> 00:19:24,482
What have I got here, Constable?
Only a little thing.

186
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:27,810
Only a little thing to you,
but a great thing to me.

187
00:19:28,354 --> 00:19:31,687
Move! Or I'll bash that smart mouth.

188
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:35,627
You're a dead woman.

189
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:46,230
Lovey, he won't bother you again tonight.

190
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:48,197
That's right. Look.

191
00:19:48,307 --> 00:19:51,902
One for the Nichols, and one for me.

192
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,279
Come here.

193
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,614
We'll work the streets together.

194
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:02,220
I'll keep my eye on you, love.

195
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:09,051
You pig!

196
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:11,420
You disgusting pig!

197
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,368
Yeah, I'm a pig.

198
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:18,731
I'm what's wrong with the world.

199
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:21,132
Be on your own then.

200
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:23,103
No!

201
00:20:23,876 --> 00:20:26,344
You don't want the company of a pig!

202
00:20:27,847 --> 00:20:30,077
What the fuck are you looking at?

203
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:48,733
Thirsty?

204
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,036
That was the thing that was in my dream.

205
00:20:57,677 --> 00:21:01,238
- What's it called again?
- Cleopatra's needle.

206
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:04,775
Cleopatra. She was a beauty, wasn't she?

207
00:21:05,318 --> 00:21:10,551
It was carved 1,500 years
before the Son of God was born.

208
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:15,753
Six men died to bring it here...

209
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:18,254
...from Egypt.

210
00:22:21,661 --> 00:22:23,856
May the good Lord have mercy.

211
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:40,074
She was like that when I found her.
All murdered.

212
00:22:40,313 --> 00:22:42,679
What kind of monster did this?

213
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:55,783
The boys have made their rounds
of the taverns...

214
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:59,388
...and the delightful domiciles
that make up this charming street.

215
00:22:59,565 --> 00:23:02,056
Will it surprise you
that no one heard a sound?

216
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:05,495
Her throat was cut,
but there's no arterial spray on the wall.

217
00:23:05,738 --> 00:23:08,036
She was killed somewhere else.

218
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:14,709
It rained last night, didn't it?

219
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,011
She's dry.

220
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:23,183
She was brought here
in a carriage or something.

221
00:23:23,356 --> 00:23:25,722
Her throat must've been cut
in the carriage.

222
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:27,918
I imagine they stopped it over there.

223
00:23:28,194 --> 00:23:29,320
They?

224
00:23:30,596 --> 00:23:32,029
There's more than one?

225
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:33,988
Most definitely.

226
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,465
This was all in your vision?

227
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:44,800
Jesus!

228
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:49,640
So, definitely more than one person.

229
00:23:49,782 --> 00:23:52,478
It has to be a message
from the Nichols boys. Right?

230
00:23:55,187 --> 00:23:56,848
What the hell?

231
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:58,817
That's grapes, isn't it?

232
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:02,251
What the hell would a bangtail
be doing with grapes?

233
00:24:46,906 --> 00:24:49,272
I'd like to give them an answer.

234
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:51,872
- What?
- The Nichols boys.

235
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:56,548
I'd welcome the opportunity to give them
an answer to their bloody message.

236
00:24:57,316 --> 00:25:00,752
There is most definitely a message here.
You're right about that.

237
00:25:00,953 --> 00:25:02,784
What am I wrong about?

238
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,454
Martha Tabram was raped,
tortured and killed.

239
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:10,323
That's cruel.

240
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:13,726
But I've seen that sort of cruelty
in the East End before.

241
00:25:15,301 --> 00:25:17,292
This is methodical.

242
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,370
The butchery is irrational, yet...

243
00:25:20,906 --> 00:25:23,238
...meticulous and deliberate.

244
00:25:25,778 --> 00:25:28,508
Altogether a different breed of killer.

245
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:33,317
As soon as possible,
I'd like to know what he took.

246
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,149
What do you mean "what he took"?

247
00:25:36,822 --> 00:25:38,881
- Didn't you notice?
- What?

248
00:25:39,692 --> 00:25:42,183
He's taken at least one of her organs.

249
00:25:42,328 --> 00:25:43,852
Oh, no.

250
00:25:51,937 --> 00:25:53,996
I want every veterinarian...

251
00:25:54,273 --> 00:25:57,674
...butcher, furrier in the district
interviewed.

252
00:25:58,344 --> 00:26:01,279
Furrier? What did he do, sir? Skin her?

253
00:26:01,514 --> 00:26:03,573
Pipe down, Withers.

254
00:26:04,016 --> 00:26:07,713
When the Inspector is talking
you are listening, understand?

255
00:26:08,187 --> 00:26:09,654
Yes, Sergeant.

256
00:26:10,256 --> 00:26:12,156
He disemboweled her.

257
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:16,221
After he cut her throat,
stabbed her in the chest...

258
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:20,526
...cut open her stomach,
and took out her intestines.

259
00:26:24,336 --> 00:26:26,998
At least one of her organs was removed.

260
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,567
I'm waiting for the police surgeon's report
for more details.

261
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:35,178
I see.

262
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:40,413
One thing's for certain,
an Englishman didn't do it.

263
00:26:43,622 --> 00:26:47,285
Maybe one of these Red Indians...

264
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:52,460
...wandered into Whitechapel
and indulged his natural inclinations.

265
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:56,394
With all due respect, sir...

266
00:26:56,535 --> 00:27:00,938
...I believe this was done by someone with
at least a working knowledge of dissection.

267
00:27:01,006 --> 00:27:04,908
- An educated man, such as a doctor...
- An educated man? That's preposterous.

268
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,137
No well-bred man would do this.

269
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,778
Probably a tradesman or a butcher.

270
00:27:11,784 --> 00:27:14,651
A tradesman is a possibility, sir.

271
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:18,549
But there's a strong indication against it.

272
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:21,282
There was a sprig of grapes
under her body.

273
00:27:21,393 --> 00:27:23,293
What are you driving at?

274
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:28,389
No one in Whitechapel, no matter
what their trade, could afford grapes.

275
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:31,001
Obviously,
they were given to her by the killer.

276
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:34,338
It follows that he must be
someone with money.

277
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:38,004
What about the Jews? A Jew butcher?

278
00:27:38,377 --> 00:27:42,677
Or a Jew tailor might have money.
Plenty of them in Whitechapel.

279
00:27:43,015 --> 00:27:46,041
Sir, for the sake of public safety
in general...

280
00:27:46,452 --> 00:27:50,183
...l'd like to be careful about spreading
the rumor it might be a Jew.

281
00:27:52,491 --> 00:27:56,484
I know your reputation for making guesses
that turn out to be right.

282
00:27:56,962 --> 00:28:00,125
Someone told me
you claim to dream the answers.

283
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,564
Frankly, it doesn't matter to me
what your methods are.

284
00:28:03,936 --> 00:28:08,270
But be certain you don't proceed
without proof. Is that clear?

285
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:09,806
Of course, sir.

286
00:28:09,975 --> 00:28:14,207
Personally, I don't care. The fewer
pinch-pricks on the streets, the better.

287
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:18,544
But the sooner you find this butcher
or tailor...

288
00:28:18,684 --> 00:28:22,211
...the sooner we can all celebrate
your promotion.

289
00:28:23,222 --> 00:28:25,053
Keep me informed.

290
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:55,683
Every cellar, every stable. We'll find him.

291
00:28:55,754 --> 00:28:58,450
It's the bleeding Jews. Let's kill them!

292
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:02,411
I have wonderful news.

293
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:04,113
Tell me.

294
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,075
Surely you, of all people, can guess.

295
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:09,747
I don't want to guess with you.

296
00:31:11,924 --> 00:31:14,017
Dr. Marbury says...

297
00:31:16,528 --> 00:31:18,325
Dr. Marbury says?

298
00:31:19,998 --> 00:31:23,661
Dr. Marbury says
I'm going to have your child.

299
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:57,196
"Ay, to die

300
00:31:57,703 --> 00:31:59,603
"and go we know not where

301
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:02,467
"To lie in cold obstruction and to rot"

302
00:32:05,644 --> 00:32:08,306
A simple "rest in peace" would suffice.

303
00:32:08,413 --> 00:32:09,641
Yes, sir.

304
00:32:10,582 --> 00:32:12,948
"In the midst of life we are in death...

305
00:32:13,118 --> 00:32:16,110
"...of whom may we seek for succor,
but of Thee, O Lord...

306
00:32:16,822 --> 00:32:19,450
"...who for our sins art justly displeased?

307
00:32:20,192 --> 00:32:22,717
"Yet, O Lord God most holy...

308
00:32:22,794 --> 00:32:24,421
"...O Lord most mighty..."

309
00:32:38,877 --> 00:32:40,868
Good afternoon, ladies.

310
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,974
I'm Inspector Abberline.
This is Sgt. Godley.

311
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:47,382
We're investigating the murders
of Polly Nichols and Martha Tabram.

312
00:32:47,486 --> 00:32:50,853
We understand they were both friends
of you ladies.

313
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,682
Close friends.
We're hoping you'd be able to help us.

314
00:32:54,793 --> 00:32:56,761
Don't know nothing.

315
00:32:56,995 --> 00:32:58,326
Me neither.

316
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,365
Why are you bothering us?
You ought to bother McQueen.

317
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:05,094
- Is he the boss of Nichol Street?
- The heart and soul of the gang.

318
00:33:05,204 --> 00:33:08,605
Isn't it your job to be knowing
that small detail?

319
00:33:10,576 --> 00:33:13,067
What makes you think McQueen did this?

320
00:33:13,345 --> 00:33:15,210
Can't prove nothing by me.

321
00:33:17,316 --> 00:33:20,217
- You're Mary Kelly, right?
- That's right.

322
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,246
Unless one of you is willing to testify
against McQueen...

323
00:33:24,323 --> 00:33:26,188
...I can't do nothing.

324
00:33:26,725 --> 00:33:28,625
Surely, Inspector...

325
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,092
...a strong, handsome man like you...

326
00:33:31,263 --> 00:33:34,528
...could do anything
you put your brilliant mind to.

327
00:33:35,734 --> 00:33:38,601
I'm a coward and a weakling.
I can't help meself.

328
00:33:38,737 --> 00:33:42,400
What's your excuse?
Why are you so bloody useless?

329
00:33:46,044 --> 00:33:48,478
Come on, Mary. They won't help us.

330
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:14,333
Is that you?

331
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:19,142
Before my mother died, back in Ireland.

332
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:22,540
- Is that when you came here?
- Yeah.

333
00:34:22,714 --> 00:34:25,842
- When I was 8.
- When things was good.

334
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:30,048
We were starving,
but we were starving in fresh air.

335
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:34,188
I was thinking...

336
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,227
...we ain't never gonna earn enough
to satisfy the Nichols boys...

337
00:34:38,397 --> 00:34:40,558
...and feed our own mouths.

338
00:34:42,234 --> 00:34:45,397
You said those men...

339
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,539
...who took the rich artist man
and her as well...

340
00:34:48,707 --> 00:34:52,666
You said they was clean-shaven,
and their clothes was neat.

341
00:34:53,378 --> 00:34:55,676
- Right.
- They weren't criminals, then.

342
00:34:56,315 --> 00:34:58,806
They weren't the Nichols boys.

343
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:00,678
They was unusual.

344
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:02,543
Perhaps even official.

345
00:35:02,888 --> 00:35:04,583
What are you getting at?

346
00:35:06,224 --> 00:35:10,820
Maybe we could go with the papers,
get paid for the story.

347
00:35:11,229 --> 00:35:12,526
"Where's Ann Crook?"

348
00:35:12,597 --> 00:35:16,226
The papers are always desperate
for things bad about the government.

349
00:35:16,335 --> 00:35:17,893
It's a mystery, to boot.

350
00:35:18,003 --> 00:35:20,233
Not a bad plan. What do you think, Mary?

351
00:35:20,372 --> 00:35:23,830
We should talk to that inspector,
the one at Polly's funeral.

352
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:25,636
Fuck me! No.

353
00:35:25,844 --> 00:35:29,541
If we go to the papers, they might hurt Ann
even worse. Or hurt the baby.

354
00:35:29,715 --> 00:35:33,742
Worse than what'll happen to her
in Whitechapel when she sprouts teats?

355
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:35,513
I don't know for sure.

356
00:35:35,687 --> 00:35:38,656
But I think we're better off
talking to that inspector.

357
00:35:38,757 --> 00:35:41,385
Lord, you are young after all.

358
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:45,921
Four bitches.

359
00:35:46,264 --> 00:35:47,731
That's what I thought.

360
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:49,958
You only paid for one person.

361
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:51,797
- They're my guests.
- Guests?

362
00:35:52,037 --> 00:35:54,403
Let me welcome your guests.

363
00:35:55,874 --> 00:35:59,275
Go on! Get out!

364
00:35:59,511 --> 00:36:02,002
Get out of here, you bloody whores.

365
00:36:02,848 --> 00:36:04,816
When you have four pence...

366
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:09,420
...you can come back
with your ladies in waiting, Your Grace.

367
00:36:09,921 --> 00:36:11,411
Shut up.

368
00:36:13,425 --> 00:36:14,892
Back to work then.

369
00:36:14,993 --> 00:36:16,927
Let's try and stay together.

370
00:36:17,062 --> 00:36:20,896
- We can't. You know that.
- Then stay good and clear of Nichol Street.

371
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,958
Come on.

372
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:26,064
All right, Annie?

373
00:36:27,038 --> 00:36:28,437
Bloody bastard.

374
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,974
- How's your head?
- Very funny.

375
00:38:30,428 --> 00:38:31,452
Boo!

376
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:37,367
I didn't frighten you, did I?

377
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,103
I've been looking for you.

378
00:38:40,171 --> 00:38:42,071
Been looking all over for you.

379
00:38:42,274 --> 00:38:44,174
You've been looking for me?

380
00:38:44,709 --> 00:38:47,542
Not for me. On behalf of my gentleman.

381
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:50,713
A very fine gentleman.
He sent me to find you.

382
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:53,612
Your gentleman sent you to find me?

383
00:38:53,818 --> 00:38:57,720
Get off! I might be unfortunate,
but I'm not a blithering idiot.

384
00:38:57,822 --> 00:39:00,222
It's the truth! The God's truth.

385
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:03,289
He's seen you. He likes you.

386
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:06,591
He said, tonight, only you'll do.

387
00:39:07,866 --> 00:39:12,894
He said to find you, take you to
Hanover Street where he's waiting for you.

388
00:39:13,104 --> 00:39:14,867
You're very pretty.

389
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,242
Go on. Get in, I'll take you there.

390
00:39:22,714 --> 00:39:25,979
I almost forgot.
My gentleman got you a present.

391
00:39:26,418 --> 00:39:28,886
- You like grapes?
- Yeah.

392
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:38,854
Your gentleman, he must be very refined.

393
00:39:39,164 --> 00:39:41,428
- Very refined indeed.
- Get in.

394
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,964
- I'll take you there.
- All right.

395
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:56,369
Here we are.

396
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:07,684
- I'm a lucky lady.
- You are, lady.

397
00:40:08,293 --> 00:40:11,490
Your gaffer,
does he want anything special?

398
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,889
Just the usual, I expect.

399
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:17,728
This alley takes you to the yard.

400
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:21,896
My gentleman is quiet.
He doesn't like disturbances.

401
00:40:22,707 --> 00:40:26,643
What I want to know is, a toff like him...

402
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:28,938
...how much is he offering?

403
00:40:30,315 --> 00:40:32,306
Here, £2 for now.

404
00:40:32,651 --> 00:40:34,482
That'll do me.

405
00:40:34,653 --> 00:40:36,245
Let me see you.

406
00:40:37,622 --> 00:40:41,285
- Down there?
- Straight down to the door at the end.

407
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:48,231
Straight down there, right?

408
00:41:19,431 --> 00:41:21,331
You watch your mouth!

409
00:41:22,934 --> 00:41:26,062
Any more information?
My readers want to know.

410
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:29,805
Is it true you found a piece
of leather apron in her mouth?

411
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:35,104
No. But if it's your fancy, I'd be delighted
to stuff your mouth with leather.

412
00:41:36,114 --> 00:41:39,709
Give us a tidbit, Sergeant.
We'll put your picture on the front page.

413
00:41:41,586 --> 00:41:44,214
Do something about this.
This is ridiculous.

414
00:41:45,423 --> 00:41:48,984
There's a bloody murderer on the loose.
What about my wife?

415
00:42:20,892 --> 00:42:22,359
This is Annie.

416
00:42:23,294 --> 00:42:26,024
Yes. Another of the circle of friends.

417
00:42:26,231 --> 00:42:27,858
Annie Chapman.

418
00:42:28,032 --> 00:42:32,526
Dark Annie, they called her.
You still say this isn't the Nichols boys?

419
00:42:34,806 --> 00:42:38,435
Did the constable show you the bit
of leather found by the waterspout?

420
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,944
Could be part of a butcher's apron.

421
00:42:41,513 --> 00:42:46,143
Leather apron. Dear God,
we could be looking for a butcher after all.

422
00:42:46,951 --> 00:42:48,248
I saw her.

423
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:51,584
- This one?
- Yeah, last night.

424
00:42:53,725 --> 00:42:55,317
I saw her face.

425
00:43:00,498 --> 00:43:04,798
- Don't trample over this area.
- Let us see the body!

426
00:43:04,936 --> 00:43:07,268
- Come on, let us see.
- Oh, God.

427
00:43:07,338 --> 00:43:09,101
There's your typical Londoner...

428
00:43:09,174 --> 00:43:12,769
...imbued with the Christian spirit
of sympathy for his fellow man.

429
00:43:12,877 --> 00:43:15,072
Or fellow whore, in this case.

430
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,307
He's really outdone himself this time.

431
00:43:17,415 --> 00:43:19,349
He not only severed the intestines...

432
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:23,147
...he's carefully arranged them
around the neck and shoulders.

433
00:43:23,321 --> 00:43:25,482
I think he's taken more organs this time.

434
00:43:31,563 --> 00:43:34,259
Grapes again. Why grapes?

435
00:43:35,466 --> 00:43:38,435
Only Polly and Dark Annie
were given grapes.

436
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:41,862
Only they were disemboweled
in such a meticulous fashion.

437
00:43:42,574 --> 00:43:44,735
This ain't killing for profit.

438
00:43:46,244 --> 00:43:47,973
This is ritual.

439
00:43:48,146 --> 00:43:49,841
Yeah, but why grapes?

440
00:43:59,324 --> 00:44:01,986
So they'll trust whatever he offers.

441
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:14,434
I've never fully understood that tradition.

442
00:44:14,772 --> 00:44:16,239
They're for the ferryman.

443
00:44:17,008 --> 00:44:20,967
The ferryman who takes the body
across the river into the land of the dead.

444
00:44:21,045 --> 00:44:23,479
If she don't have the money to pay him...

445
00:44:23,681 --> 00:44:27,674
...she'd have to wander,
forever lost between the two worlds.

446
00:44:35,393 --> 00:44:37,486
I need to consult a doctor.

447
00:44:37,629 --> 00:44:39,358
Are you ill, Inspector?

448
00:44:39,864 --> 00:44:41,695
A surgeon, to be specific.

449
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:45,431
The killer removed
the victim's uterus and its attachments.

450
00:44:45,737 --> 00:44:48,433
My God. He's out of his mind.

451
00:44:48,973 --> 00:44:51,134
That's very astute of you, sir.

452
00:44:51,276 --> 00:44:54,268
I don't appreciate sarcasm, Inspector.

453
00:44:54,445 --> 00:44:56,572
I'm sorry, sir. I meant nothing by it.

454
00:44:56,714 --> 00:44:59,478
You already have a surgeon
at your disposal.

455
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:03,151
I need a man with a strong stomach
and a sober mind.

456
00:45:03,488 --> 00:45:05,319
The police surgeon has neither.

457
00:45:05,957 --> 00:45:08,221
- No. Request denied.
- Why?

458
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:10,324
Are you questioning my decision?

459
00:45:10,461 --> 00:45:12,326
No, sir. I simply want to know why.

460
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:15,593
There's already too much nonsense
and gossip in the press.

461
00:45:15,967 --> 00:45:20,301
You start consulting doctors, and
all sorts of wild notions will be printed.

462
00:45:20,505 --> 00:45:23,065
No one else is to see the bodies.

463
00:45:24,842 --> 00:45:26,332
It is my honor...

464
00:45:26,577 --> 00:45:31,241
...to present this unique
medical phenomenon.

465
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,549
Until last week, Mr. Joseph Merrick...

466
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,848
John Merrick.

467
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:38,513
I beg your pardon.

468
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:43,720
Mr. John Merrick was an attraction
at a side show.

469
00:45:44,896 --> 00:45:49,526
Now he's being cared for
at England's leading hospital.

470
00:45:49,867 --> 00:45:55,066
With your generosity,
we will be able to continue to do so.

471
00:45:56,341 --> 00:45:58,901
Ladies and gentlemen...

472
00:45:59,043 --> 00:46:01,807
...Mr. John Merrick.

473
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:06,280
Turn around.

474
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,590
It should've been killed at birth.

475
00:46:28,306 --> 00:46:29,796
Good health!

476
00:46:38,383 --> 00:46:41,352
That will be the last one,
Your Royal Highness.

477
00:46:58,236 --> 00:46:59,601
...a psychotic patient.

478
00:47:00,038 --> 00:47:02,063
Pardon me, sir. Are you Dr. Ferral?

479
00:47:02,173 --> 00:47:03,197
I am.

480
00:47:04,008 --> 00:47:06,499
I'm Inspector Abberline,
assigned to Whitechapel.

481
00:47:06,711 --> 00:47:09,373
Oh, my Lord! You're the Ripper case.

482
00:47:09,514 --> 00:47:11,209
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

483
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:12,611
Jolly good.

484
00:47:12,884 --> 00:47:16,752
You've come to the perfect place.
We've got butchers aplenty here.

485
00:47:17,422 --> 00:47:18,446
I see.

486
00:47:18,523 --> 00:47:22,357
I could certainly use your expertise
to help solve this case.

487
00:47:22,627 --> 00:47:25,460
They tell me you're
the best young surgeon in London.

488
00:47:25,563 --> 00:47:26,587
Really?

489
00:47:27,432 --> 00:47:31,766
I don't see how a reputable surgeon
could know anything about it.

490
00:47:32,336 --> 00:47:35,965
This country's overrun
with foreigners, Orientals.

491
00:47:36,808 --> 00:47:38,537
Jews.

492
00:47:38,776 --> 00:47:43,008
Socialists trying to stir things up
against our monarchy.

493
00:47:43,748 --> 00:47:47,411
That's who you should be pursuing,
don't you think?

494
00:47:48,186 --> 00:47:51,815
Excuse me.
You don't belong here, do you?

495
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:57,657
I'm afraid Dr. Ferral suffers
from the surgeon's malady.

496
00:47:58,896 --> 00:48:00,557
What's that, sir?

497
00:48:01,332 --> 00:48:02,765
Want of feeling.

498
00:48:03,267 --> 00:48:07,431
He knows everything about anatomy
and nothing about the soul.

499
00:48:08,573 --> 00:48:10,564
How may I assist you, Inspector?

500
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:12,905
Forgive my ignorance, but...

501
00:48:13,444 --> 00:48:15,071
...are you a surgeon?

502
00:48:15,279 --> 00:48:16,541
I was.

503
00:48:17,115 --> 00:48:20,573
Unfortunately,
I suffered a brain seizure six months ago.

504
00:48:20,785 --> 00:48:25,882
- I'm sorry to hear that, sir.
- Yes, these days I limit myself to teaching.

505
00:48:26,491 --> 00:48:31,155
So you see, I'm accustomed
to answering questions, Inspector.

506
00:48:34,465 --> 00:48:38,367
Could you tell me
what sort of a knife this would be?

507
00:48:46,177 --> 00:48:49,169
I think you mean to draw a Liston knife.

508
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,813
It's named for Liston,
who was a surgeon in the Crimean War.

509
00:48:52,984 --> 00:48:55,646
Because there was
no anesthetic on the battlefield...

510
00:48:55,786 --> 00:48:59,381
...he had to carry out
his amputations very quickly.

511
00:49:00,091 --> 00:49:03,356
Do you, by any chance,
have the police surgeon's report available?

512
00:49:03,728 --> 00:49:06,162
- Yes, I do, sir.
- May I?

513
00:49:06,964 --> 00:49:09,159
You must keep this confidential.

514
00:49:09,233 --> 00:49:10,666
Of course.

515
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,098
Thank you.

516
00:49:29,353 --> 00:49:32,083
Wouldn't someone
have heard their screams?

517
00:49:32,156 --> 00:49:33,919
Not if he cut their throats first.

518
00:49:37,328 --> 00:49:41,128
How can you be sure they wouldn't
react to seeing the Liston knife?

519
00:49:41,732 --> 00:49:42,892
Grapes.

520
00:49:44,235 --> 00:49:46,032
He offers them grapes first.

521
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:51,701
- Grapes are very tempting.
- They'd gobble them up.

522
00:49:51,776 --> 00:49:55,007
He might offer them a drink
to ease them down.

523
00:49:55,146 --> 00:49:57,080
A drink laced with laudanum.

524
00:49:58,716 --> 00:50:00,547
How do you know that?

525
00:50:00,685 --> 00:50:03,483
I found a sprig of grapes
on both victims' bodies.

526
00:50:03,554 --> 00:50:05,852
And I smelled the laudanum on their lips.

527
00:50:06,157 --> 00:50:09,615
Laudanum is a derivative of opium.

528
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:13,523
Apart from doctors and addicts,
not many would recognize it.

529
00:50:17,535 --> 00:50:20,663
How long have you chased the dragon,
Inspector?

530
00:50:25,476 --> 00:50:27,842
These should help with the headaches.

531
00:50:30,581 --> 00:50:35,109
Opium leaches minerals out of the body,
so I've also given you a tonic.

532
00:50:35,486 --> 00:50:37,750
That'll help to restore your appetite.

533
00:50:38,522 --> 00:50:40,683
Thank you very much, sir.

534
00:50:43,461 --> 00:50:47,158
- I'm a fool.
- I don't think you're a fool.

535
00:50:47,698 --> 00:50:49,063
Far from it.

536
00:50:49,267 --> 00:50:52,930
I ought to have known that you're
physician ordinary to the royal family.

537
00:50:53,104 --> 00:50:57,336
It's certainly an honor, but it's an honor
bestowed on many doctors.

538
00:50:57,508 --> 00:51:02,036
Now, about our friend here.
He cut their throats from left to right.

539
00:51:02,113 --> 00:51:04,377
Therefore, he's right-handed.

540
00:51:04,582 --> 00:51:06,277
Excuse me.

541
00:51:06,484 --> 00:51:10,352
He had to slice
through four layers of tissue...

542
00:51:10,588 --> 00:51:12,886
...and up to an inch of subcutaneous fat.

543
00:51:13,024 --> 00:51:14,548
After that...

544
00:51:15,426 --> 00:51:20,193
...he entered the abdominal cavity, so he
would've used more than the Liston knife.

545
00:51:20,431 --> 00:51:24,731
Perhaps he was carrying
a portable amputation kit similar to this.

546
00:51:26,037 --> 00:51:27,732
What do you think?

547
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,476
Is it possible that the killer
is an educated man?

548
00:51:38,949 --> 00:51:43,545
Perhaps someone who studied medicine,
but who is not a surgeon himself?

549
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:48,684
The intestines are simple enough,
but the uterus?

550
00:51:49,126 --> 00:51:52,391
The liver, very hard to locate,
unless you know what you're doing.

551
00:51:52,463 --> 00:51:54,931
And he was working quickly, in the dark.

552
00:51:55,132 --> 00:51:57,498
I had held out hope that this...

553
00:51:57,968 --> 00:52:01,460
...monster was a veterinarian or a furrier...

554
00:52:01,539 --> 00:52:04,997
...or an especially well-educated butcher.

555
00:52:05,543 --> 00:52:07,807
No, I must admit, if I were you...

556
00:52:09,013 --> 00:52:13,177
...l'd look for someone with
a thorough knowledge of human anatomy.

557
00:52:14,452 --> 00:52:16,010
Damn him.

558
00:52:45,182 --> 00:52:47,207
Want me to suck it?

559
00:52:47,284 --> 00:52:49,377
I can suck the Thames dry.

560
00:52:50,521 --> 00:52:52,751
Don't be frightened, dearie.

561
00:53:08,205 --> 00:53:11,902
How far advanced
is our grandson's malady?

562
00:53:15,312 --> 00:53:17,940
No lesions have appeared.

563
00:53:18,382 --> 00:53:21,681
There is some neural damage,
slight trembling of the right hand...

564
00:53:21,752 --> 00:53:25,745
...but I'm more than hopeful,
the treatment will arrest the disease.

565
00:53:26,257 --> 00:53:30,353
He seems, to us,
to be suffering greatly in his mind.

566
00:53:30,995 --> 00:53:33,555
Is the disease affecting his emotions?

567
00:53:34,031 --> 00:53:36,693
Yes, of course, his mood is depressed...

568
00:53:36,834 --> 00:53:40,634
...because of the news of the diagnosis.

569
00:53:41,138 --> 00:53:44,699
But that should improve
as he regains his strength.

570
00:53:44,842 --> 00:53:47,868
You are a true physician, Sir William.

571
00:53:48,112 --> 00:53:51,912
In all ways,
you attend to the health of our empire.

572
00:53:52,082 --> 00:53:53,845
We are grateful.

573
00:53:54,118 --> 00:53:56,086
Thank you, ma'am.

574
00:54:10,234 --> 00:54:14,933
This is the beginning of a five-pointed star.

575
00:54:16,106 --> 00:54:19,041
- Like the bloody Jewish star!
- Withers.

576
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:22,438
The Inspector is talking,
which means you are what?

577
00:54:22,546 --> 00:54:24,480
- I'm listening, sir.
- Yes.

578
00:54:26,417 --> 00:54:29,443
This area would form a likely point.

579
00:54:29,687 --> 00:54:33,054
I want double shifts
within these streets until further notice.

580
00:54:33,123 --> 00:54:35,921
And don't only worry
about Jews and butchers.

581
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:38,392
Stop anyone suspicious...

582
00:54:38,562 --> 00:54:41,087
...including well-dressed gentlemen.

583
00:54:41,265 --> 00:54:42,755
By the way, Withers...

584
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,292
...the Star of David has six points.

585
00:54:48,439 --> 00:54:51,738
Right! "Once more unto the breach,
dear friends."

586
00:54:53,511 --> 00:54:54,944
Dismissed!

587
00:55:03,787 --> 00:55:07,587
Why have you called me here?

588
00:55:09,093 --> 00:55:10,993
It's just...

589
00:55:11,896 --> 00:55:15,559
It's just,
you say three more have to be killed.

590
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:18,432
I can't take it, sir.

591
00:55:18,936 --> 00:55:20,767
It's everywhere.

592
00:55:20,938 --> 00:55:22,872
It's in all the papers.

593
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:27,673
I'm just a simple chap, sir.

594
00:55:27,845 --> 00:55:30,313
I'm not a great man like you.

595
00:55:31,515 --> 00:55:35,144
I just don't know where I am at anymore.

596
00:55:36,854 --> 00:55:38,879
There, there, Netley.

597
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:42,623
I shall tell you where we are.

598
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:50,494
We are in the most extreme
and utter region of the human mind.

599
00:55:52,136 --> 00:55:57,164
A radiant abyss,
where men meet themselves.

600
00:55:58,342 --> 00:56:00,606
I don't understand that.

601
00:56:00,878 --> 00:56:03,244
I don't understand, sir.

602
00:56:05,382 --> 00:56:07,680
Hell, Netley.

603
00:56:10,087 --> 00:56:11,714
We're in Hell.

604
00:56:23,334 --> 00:56:26,963
Let me go! Get your hands off me!

605
00:56:32,176 --> 00:56:34,110
Sorry about that, Inspector.

606
00:56:34,244 --> 00:56:37,907
She's madly in love with me,
although she hides it well.

607
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:43,085
You said McQueen killed your two friends.
What are you doing here?

608
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:46,417
I see. Women are butchered
right and left in your district...

609
00:56:46,523 --> 00:56:49,287
...and you can't do piss about it,
and I'm the fool?

610
00:56:49,426 --> 00:56:53,522
We're watching. Can't arrest them
without evidence, so we watch them.

611
00:56:53,731 --> 00:56:56,723
- What else can we do?
- I'll testify.

612
00:56:56,934 --> 00:57:00,529
If you keep meself and me friends alive,
I'll testify.

613
00:57:00,704 --> 00:57:02,103
To what, precisely?

614
00:57:02,473 --> 00:57:05,237
McQueen said he'd cut me
unless I pay him £1 a week.

615
00:57:05,342 --> 00:57:07,503
- No.
- What do you mean, "No"?

616
00:57:07,745 --> 00:57:10,737
You asked me to testify.
Are you worried I'll let you down?

617
00:57:10,948 --> 00:57:13,473
I won't. I promise I won't.

618
00:57:14,418 --> 00:57:17,717
You testify against McQueen,
maybe he goes in for a year or two.

619
00:57:17,921 --> 00:57:22,119
But his boys, they'll take their revenge
on you and your friends.

620
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,189
I can't let you do it.

621
00:57:30,934 --> 00:57:33,494
It's your round this time!

622
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:38,668
I confess, I have an appetite.

623
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:44,609
One day, I'll be a great big, round woman
with a skinny little man for a husband.

624
00:57:45,115 --> 00:57:48,016
And a dozen plump children, I imagine.

625
00:57:49,053 --> 00:57:50,782
Do you think that's funny?

626
00:57:50,854 --> 00:57:52,947
An unfortunate like me
being a decent mother?

627
00:57:53,123 --> 00:57:55,023
No, I didn't mean that at all.

628
00:57:55,192 --> 00:57:57,160
You'll be a wonderful mother someday.

629
00:57:57,294 --> 00:57:59,319
Honest, I can see it.

630
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:02,724
I see you in a little cottage by the sea...

631
00:58:03,033 --> 00:58:04,660
...surrounded by children.

632
00:58:05,202 --> 00:58:07,693
I can see it, Mary, clear as day.

633
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:14,144
- I really do have visions, you know.
- Are you serious?

634
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:18,108
Sgt. Godley calls it my intuition.

635
00:58:19,183 --> 00:58:22,812
As a matter of fact,
I have one about you in this case.

636
00:58:23,954 --> 00:58:25,945
You have visions about me?

637
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:27,821
What might those be?

638
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:33,854
I want you to think carefully.

639
00:58:33,997 --> 00:58:36,932
Besides McQueen,
besides these awful murders...

640
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,903
...has anything happened to you or your
friends that's a bit out of the ordinary?

641
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:47,098
Ben Kidney?
That's Special Branch she's describing.

642
00:58:47,377 --> 00:58:50,642
What would Ben Kidney and Special Branch
be doing in Whitechapel?

643
00:58:50,748 --> 00:58:51,772
Wait a minute.

644
00:58:52,015 --> 00:58:54,916
She's Irish-born, isn't she?
There's your answer.

645
00:58:55,085 --> 00:58:58,885
A secret Irish rebel.
That's why they'd be after her, right?

646
00:58:59,223 --> 00:59:03,353
They were after Ann Crook, who was
having an affair with a wealthy gentleman.

647
00:59:03,761 --> 00:59:05,456
A man she bore a child...

648
00:59:05,829 --> 00:59:09,265
...a child that's now missing,
along with its grandparents.

649
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:11,965
Great.

650
00:59:12,236 --> 00:59:14,636
Drive on, please, driver.

651
00:59:17,441 --> 00:59:21,605
You do not fuck with Special Branch.
They fuck with you.

652
00:59:29,186 --> 00:59:32,815
I don't know what you're thinking,
and I don't care to know.

653
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:43,325
- Mr. Kidney wants to see me.
- Mr. Kidney's gone, sir.

654
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,664
Didn't say where. Could be for the night.

655
00:59:45,736 --> 00:59:48,569
No. He said he'd be back before 11:00,
and I should wait.

656
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:50,435
Where are you going?

657
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:53,801
He said I should wait in his office.

658
00:59:55,012 --> 00:59:57,674
And what floor is Mr. Kidney's office on?

659
00:59:59,283 --> 01:00:03,617
I don't know what floor, because
I haven't been to his fuckin' office, have I?

660
01:00:03,987 --> 01:00:08,151
He told me the desk man'd let me up,
but I'm happy to stand here like a knob...

661
01:00:08,458 --> 01:00:11,393
...because you disobeyed
Ben Kidney's order.

662
01:00:12,329 --> 01:00:15,560
- It's the second floor on the right.
- Thanks.

663
01:01:58,268 --> 01:01:59,565
Free Ireland!

664
01:02:01,939 --> 01:02:03,804
Free Ireland!

665
01:02:07,844 --> 01:02:08,902
Get inside, sir!

666
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:25,020
Just some gunpowder, that's all.
Little more than a firework.

667
01:02:25,963 --> 01:02:27,692
Anyone go in or out?

668
01:02:28,031 --> 01:02:32,991
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir, there's
an Inspector Abberline in your office.

669
01:02:43,981 --> 01:02:46,472
No, there's nothing missing here.

670
01:02:47,484 --> 01:02:50,180
Webster dossier seems to be complete.

671
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:55,416
The bastards have been in here, sir.
I can smell them.

672
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,079
- No.
- Yes.

673
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:20,809
No, not together. Too suspicious.

674
01:03:21,651 --> 01:03:25,212
You wait for me, and if she's in there,
you can visit her on your own.

675
01:03:25,322 --> 01:03:28,849
I'm going with you right now,
or I'm going to the newspapers.

676
01:03:30,794 --> 01:03:32,193
I mean it.

677
01:03:40,337 --> 01:03:44,603
There are a number of mental disorders
for which it is necessary to remove...

678
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:47,074
...the front part of the brain.

679
01:03:47,277 --> 01:03:50,212
Her records indicate that she was violent...

680
01:03:50,313 --> 01:03:54,249
...threatening to do harm to herself
and others.

681
01:03:54,518 --> 01:03:58,010
- Does she have any relations?
- No, she's a ward of the state.

682
01:03:58,188 --> 01:04:00,452
- That's a lie.
- Listen to me.

683
01:04:00,524 --> 01:04:03,584
You're under arrest,
and here to assist my investigation.

684
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,424
- Keep your mouth shut! Is that clear?
- Sorry, sir.

685
01:04:07,164 --> 01:04:08,188
Good.

686
01:04:09,132 --> 01:04:11,066
What else do you know about her?

687
01:04:11,134 --> 01:04:14,433
All we know is
that she was an unfortunate...

688
01:04:14,604 --> 01:04:17,129
...who lived in the Whitechapel district.

689
01:04:18,208 --> 01:04:20,267
I'd like to ask her a few questions.

690
01:04:21,611 --> 01:04:24,079
You won't get any sense out of her.

691
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:26,548
I'm used to that.

692
01:04:39,996 --> 01:04:41,020
Hello.

693
01:04:41,832 --> 01:04:43,629
I brought Mary Kelly.

694
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,563
Do you remember Mary Kelly?

695
01:04:47,571 --> 01:04:51,337
Ann, you know me,
I'm your best friend in all the world.

696
01:04:52,109 --> 01:04:53,371
Go away.

697
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:55,475
Go away.

698
01:04:58,181 --> 01:05:01,708
I'm going to find baby Alice.
I'm going to take care of her.

699
01:05:02,786 --> 01:05:04,947
Alice is laughing to me.

700
01:05:07,557 --> 01:05:09,889
Laughing to me all day long.

701
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:12,689
It's all right, darling.

702
01:05:13,363 --> 01:05:14,762
What about her father?

703
01:05:16,366 --> 01:05:18,698
Have you seen Alice's father, Ann?

704
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:22,868
He's a prince.

705
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:25,007
A prince.

706
01:05:27,978 --> 01:05:29,536
And I'm a queen.

707
01:05:34,985 --> 01:05:37,010
How do you know he was a painter?

708
01:05:37,154 --> 01:05:39,816
He hired us to pose as artist's models.

709
01:05:39,923 --> 01:05:42,756
What exactly does that entail,
artist's models?

710
01:05:43,627 --> 01:05:46,255
We stood very still, so he could paint us.

711
01:05:47,063 --> 01:05:49,588
What's the matter?
You think I was born a whore?

712
01:05:49,699 --> 01:05:52,099
I'm sorry, I'm an unfortunate, not a whore.

713
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:54,102
England doesn't have whores...

714
01:05:54,204 --> 01:05:57,071
...just a great mass
of very unlucky women.

715
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:59,842
So Ann Crook...

716
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:03,001
...and the painter became lovers.
Is that it?

717
01:06:03,146 --> 01:06:06,172
He married her in a lovely Catholic church.

718
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:09,512
Saint Savior's.
I was a witness, as a matter of fact.

719
01:06:09,653 --> 01:06:11,848
Married her in a Catholic church?

720
01:06:13,523 --> 01:06:16,321
What do you think they've done
to baby Alice?

721
01:06:19,296 --> 01:06:21,821
Special Branch dumped her
in Bishopsgate?

722
01:06:22,132 --> 01:06:24,623
Yeah, as an unknown.

723
01:06:25,035 --> 01:06:26,229
Why?

724
01:06:26,803 --> 01:06:29,033
When I find out, I'll tell you.

725
01:06:29,739 --> 01:06:33,004
- Take me to her. You have to.
- No. Not yet.

726
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:34,839
I need to know more first.

727
01:06:36,947 --> 01:06:38,278
Look...

728
01:06:38,748 --> 01:06:43,208
...I promise that I'll help you
with baby Alice, but not yet.

729
01:06:43,753 --> 01:06:46,813
You've got to trust me, Mary,
at least a little bit.

730
01:06:48,325 --> 01:06:51,317
I do. I do trust you.

731
01:06:51,661 --> 01:06:52,685
Good.

732
01:06:54,531 --> 01:06:56,863
Do you have little ones, Inspector?

733
01:06:57,133 --> 01:06:58,157
No.

734
01:07:02,138 --> 01:07:04,732
A year ago... No, two years...

735
01:07:05,909 --> 01:07:08,207
I'm sorry, more than two years...

736
01:07:08,878 --> 01:07:12,211
...my wife passed away...

737
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:15,514
...giving birth to what I'm told was a son.

738
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:17,884
I'm sorry.

739
01:07:19,155 --> 01:07:20,383
Thanks.

740
01:07:25,895 --> 01:07:28,728
I want to show you some paintings
on the way out.

741
01:07:28,832 --> 01:07:32,359
- You're going to take me into the gallery?
- Why not?

742
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:34,767
Come on.

743
01:07:57,694 --> 01:08:01,061
- Did you see the look on her face?
- I think she stopped breathing.

744
01:08:06,269 --> 01:08:07,600
She's a fright.

745
01:08:08,104 --> 01:08:09,799
Look at those cold eyes.

746
01:08:10,707 --> 01:08:13,608
I feel like someone's walking
over my grave.

747
01:08:13,743 --> 01:08:16,268
There's one more painting
I want you to see.

748
01:08:34,597 --> 01:08:36,531
You know him, don't you?

749
01:08:37,434 --> 01:08:41,370
"Those whom God has joined together,
let no man put asunder."

750
01:08:42,272 --> 01:08:45,867
I pronounce that they be man and wife.

751
01:09:01,057 --> 01:09:05,118
- Sir William Gull, please.
- Sir William isn't receiving visitors.

752
01:09:07,864 --> 01:09:12,198
Sir William? It's Inspector Abberline.
I need to speak with you, sir.

753
01:09:12,535 --> 01:09:15,766
Sir William is ill.
He can't receive any visitors.

754
01:09:18,908 --> 01:09:20,170
I said...

755
01:09:21,511 --> 01:09:23,342
...you can't go in.

756
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:26,313
It's all right, Dr. Ferral,
I don't mind company.

757
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:29,010
Have Anna bring us some tea,
would you please?

758
01:09:35,058 --> 01:09:39,825
I wish I could tell you
that your story was fantastical.

759
01:09:42,132 --> 01:09:43,895
Unhappily, I cannot.

760
01:09:45,402 --> 01:09:49,498
I know for a fact that the Prince
has a taste in unfortunate women.

761
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:53,208
And I suppose
that it's more than possible...

762
01:09:53,276 --> 01:09:55,972
...he concocted this elaborate deception...

763
01:09:56,312 --> 01:09:59,611
...to have some privacy
while he indulged in his secret life.

764
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:03,344
But I know one reason I have for stating...

765
01:10:03,753 --> 01:10:08,247
...that Prince Edward being Jack the Ripper
is just incomprehensible.

766
01:10:09,526 --> 01:10:10,891
What's that, sir?

767
01:10:13,997 --> 01:10:17,831
If you repeat what I'm about to tell you,
both our lives are in jeopardy.

768
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:20,699
Indeed, I hope for your sake
that what I'm about to say...

769
01:10:20,804 --> 01:10:23,705
...will steer you clear
of the very real danger you're in.

770
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:26,537
I think I'm well past
the point of safe return, sir.

771
01:10:28,978 --> 01:10:30,707
Prince Edward has syphilis.

772
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:37,477
Not a pleasant state secret, but a vital one.

773
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:39,451
That proves it.

774
01:10:39,856 --> 01:10:43,417
I couldn't understand why the Prince
was killing Ann Crook's friends...

775
01:10:43,493 --> 01:10:47,987
...especially so savagely,
but he's not merely killing them...

776
01:10:49,432 --> 01:10:51,093
...he's punishing them.

777
01:10:51,568 --> 01:10:53,866
He wants revenge. Don't you see, sir?

778
01:10:53,937 --> 01:10:56,303
No, Inspector, I don't see.

779
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:01,137
I'm afraid your wild speculations
about the Prince's mental state...

780
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:05,671
...clever though they may be,
can't overcome the physical impossibility...

781
01:11:05,782 --> 01:11:07,579
...of his committing these crimes.

782
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:12,587
The disease is far enough along
that his hands tremble uncontrollably.

783
01:11:13,022 --> 01:11:17,755
He's very weak, and the killings
of Jack the Ripper require sure hands...

784
01:11:17,961 --> 01:11:19,622
...and considerable vigor.

785
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:23,494
And have you forgotten
the most telling fact?

786
01:11:24,634 --> 01:11:26,534
Whatever else the Prince may be...

787
01:11:26,603 --> 01:11:29,367
...he knows little or nothing
of human anatomy.

788
01:12:08,578 --> 01:12:11,547
...to the center of the lodge
and force him to kneel...

789
01:12:11,614 --> 01:12:13,741
...for the benefit of prayer.

790
01:12:19,322 --> 01:12:22,814
Vouchsafe Thy name,
almighty Father of the universe...

791
01:12:22,892 --> 01:12:25,383
...to this, our present convention.

792
01:12:27,397 --> 01:12:28,796
Who is this?

793
01:12:29,532 --> 01:12:32,126
A poor candidate in a state of darkness.

794
01:12:32,702 --> 01:12:36,468
He comes of his own free will,
perfectly prepared...

795
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,931
...humbly soliciting to be admitted...

796
01:12:40,109 --> 01:12:43,169
...into the mysteries and privileges.

797
01:12:43,479 --> 01:12:48,644
In all cases of danger and distress,
in whom do you put your trust?

798
01:12:49,452 --> 01:12:50,646
In God.

799
01:12:51,654 --> 01:12:54,555
How did he find out
about the unfortunate and her child?

800
01:12:55,224 --> 01:12:59,456
He has that kind of cleverness you'll
sometimes find in the middle classes.

801
01:12:59,996 --> 01:13:03,693
A cheap sort of intelligence,
but effective nevertheless.

802
01:13:06,002 --> 01:13:08,470
Thank God that's not something
you're burdened by.

803
01:13:08,538 --> 01:13:09,596
Yes, thank God.

804
01:13:09,939 --> 01:13:11,634
Recite the solemn oath.

805
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:15,171
"Never to reveal our secrets...

806
01:13:15,445 --> 01:13:20,178
"...under no less a penalty
than my throat be cut across...

807
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:23,948
"...my tongue be torn out by its root...

808
01:13:24,654 --> 01:13:28,647
"...and that I be buried in sand
a cable's length from shore."

809
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,951
You don't think
Gull has confided in him, do you?

810
01:13:33,129 --> 01:13:35,893
The old fellow isn't as far gone
as all that, is he?

811
01:13:36,799 --> 01:13:37,857
No.

812
01:13:38,368 --> 01:13:40,359
He's not that foolish.

813
01:13:44,607 --> 01:13:46,905
Let the brother receive the light.

814
01:13:59,822 --> 01:14:02,814
- I keep on hearing...
...no time to scream...

815
01:14:03,526 --> 01:14:05,551
Another beautiful murder.

816
01:14:07,096 --> 01:14:09,360
Fear me. Jack the Ripper.

817
01:14:10,366 --> 01:14:11,993
They're rubbish. You know that.

818
01:14:12,068 --> 01:14:14,366
Yes, I agree. They're rubbish.

819
01:14:14,437 --> 01:14:17,702
But why you believe
that red-headed jezebel, I'll never know.

820
01:14:17,774 --> 01:14:21,232
Has it occurred to you
that she likes to make up stories?

821
01:14:21,344 --> 01:14:24,245
Particularly about men.
She is after all, a whore.

822
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:25,972
She's a woman who...

823
01:14:28,785 --> 01:14:30,878
"A rose by any other name"?

824
01:14:31,788 --> 01:14:32,982
Is that it?

825
01:14:34,323 --> 01:14:37,986
Frederick, my dear chum,
no one is more delighted than I am...

826
01:14:38,094 --> 01:14:42,428
...that you decided to resume your interest
in the fairer sex, but please remember...

827
01:14:42,498 --> 01:14:46,298
...a woman like that can make a man feel
whatever she wants him to feel.

828
01:14:46,402 --> 01:14:47,892
- Sgt. Godley.
- Yes, sir.

829
01:14:48,004 --> 01:14:49,631
Arrest the Nichol Street gang.

830
01:14:49,739 --> 01:14:52,401
- Right away.
- I tried to stop them, Inspector.

831
01:14:52,475 --> 01:14:54,466
This arrived in this afternoon's post.

832
01:14:56,646 --> 01:15:00,173
"I send you half the kidney I took
from one woman preserved for you...

833
01:15:00,316 --> 01:15:04,218
"...the other piece I fried and ate.
It was very nice."

834
01:15:04,387 --> 01:15:07,481
We demand something be done,
and done tonight.

835
01:15:07,857 --> 01:15:09,449
"From Hell."

836
01:15:10,626 --> 01:15:12,856
At least they got the address right.

837
01:15:13,963 --> 01:15:16,591
It can't be. Are you sure he was the same?

838
01:15:16,666 --> 01:15:19,294
I know him. I posed for him twice meself.

839
01:15:19,402 --> 01:15:22,769
I stood there naked as a babe,
watching him paint me for hours.

840
01:15:22,839 --> 01:15:25,569
And he was with Ann for what,
over a year?

841
01:15:25,675 --> 01:15:27,074
Nearly two.

842
01:15:29,879 --> 01:15:32,609
Here you are. Hello, girls.

843
01:15:32,949 --> 01:15:35,247
I told you to wait for me.

844
01:15:35,318 --> 01:15:38,583
I can't stay in a pub and not have a drink.

845
01:15:38,688 --> 01:15:41,452
It's cruel. But look who I bumped into.

846
01:15:41,624 --> 01:15:43,114
Remember Ada?

847
01:15:44,927 --> 01:15:46,394
She's from France.

848
01:15:46,496 --> 01:15:47,520
Bruxelles.

849
01:15:52,201 --> 01:15:54,396
She is pretty, isn't she?

850
01:15:56,372 --> 01:15:58,966
Not in public, love.

851
01:15:59,175 --> 01:16:02,576
Would you give us a minute alone?
We need to speak with Liz.

852
01:16:02,779 --> 01:16:05,942
Ada, you stay where you are.

853
01:16:06,415 --> 01:16:09,009
Come on, Mary, get the drinks in.

854
01:16:19,395 --> 01:16:22,523
You don't have to worry
about Nichol Street for at least a week.

855
01:16:22,598 --> 01:16:25,863
- I can keep them that long.
- That's something, anyway.

856
01:16:25,968 --> 01:16:27,196
Thank you.

857
01:16:28,204 --> 01:16:30,900
What about baby Alice?
Are you sure she's all right?

858
01:16:31,007 --> 01:16:33,908
She's all right.
We'll get her out after this is over.

859
01:16:34,343 --> 01:16:35,640
"We'll get her"?

860
01:16:36,012 --> 01:16:37,309
Listen.

861
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:41,282
I want you and your friends off the street
until I can sort this thing out.

862
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,978
- For how long?
- A few days at least.

863
01:16:44,086 --> 01:16:48,250
You better throw us in jail because
we have no money for food or a doss.

864
01:16:48,691 --> 01:16:50,283
All right, take this.

865
01:16:51,427 --> 01:16:54,396
Buy some food, get a room, and stay there.

866
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:57,722
Don't tell anyone where you're going.
I don't want to know.

867
01:16:58,601 --> 01:17:03,163
In three days, come to the Ten Bells,
I'll leave a message with the barkeep.

868
01:17:07,977 --> 01:17:09,001
What?

869
01:17:09,712 --> 01:17:11,043
It's not enough?

870
01:17:11,147 --> 01:17:14,639
I wish I could show you the little village
where I was born.

871
01:17:14,817 --> 01:17:16,478
It's so lovely there.

872
01:17:17,787 --> 01:17:20,585
It's by the sea,
where you said you saw me.

873
01:17:21,424 --> 01:17:24,655
I used to think it too small
to spend a life in...

874
01:17:25,328 --> 01:17:27,387
...but now I'm not so sure.

875
01:17:32,568 --> 01:17:33,592
Don't.

876
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:35,794
What?

877
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,539
Do you think I'm paying you back?

878
01:17:38,774 --> 01:17:41,004
I didn't mean it as business.

879
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:42,407
I'm still a woman.

880
01:17:42,511 --> 01:17:45,446
They haven't taken that away from me,
not yet anyways.

881
01:17:58,661 --> 01:17:59,821
Enough of that.

882
01:18:01,964 --> 01:18:03,727
Now, lad, at least take...

883
01:18:06,369 --> 01:18:07,563
Sorry, sir.

884
01:18:30,526 --> 01:18:32,050
One more turn.

885
01:18:34,196 --> 01:18:36,061
And curtsy.

886
01:18:38,634 --> 01:18:39,794
And we're done.

887
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:51,408
Don't be modest, girl.

888
01:18:52,014 --> 01:18:53,606
They don't care what we do.

889
01:19:01,357 --> 01:19:03,382
I paid for your supper, remember.

890
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,787
Stop shaking your head at me, you slag!

891
01:19:07,863 --> 01:19:10,855
- Leave her alone!
- She's my business, not yours!

892
01:19:10,967 --> 01:19:15,768
- Liz, just be quiet for one bloody night.
- No, I fucking won't keep my voice down!

893
01:19:16,439 --> 01:19:19,670
Don't go out tonight, it's not safe.

894
01:19:19,775 --> 01:19:22,141
I'll just get something to sustain myself.

895
01:19:22,244 --> 01:19:24,610
- I'll be right back!
- Don't be so fucking stupid!

896
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:29,140
- Do without for a night.
- No. I want a fucking drink.

897
01:19:33,055 --> 01:19:34,249
Here we are.

898
01:19:34,323 --> 01:19:35,381
Service records.

899
01:19:35,491 --> 01:19:40,019
"Grenadier Guards. Lt. Benjamin Kidney."

900
01:19:40,863 --> 01:19:41,887
There.

901
01:19:42,565 --> 01:19:44,089
Just as you suspected.

902
01:19:45,468 --> 01:19:47,663
Before he joined Special Branch...

903
01:19:47,903 --> 01:19:50,167
...Ben Kidney served
in the Grenadier Guards.

904
01:19:50,373 --> 01:19:53,570
Part of his duties included
assisting a field surgeon.

905
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:57,138
Let me tell you something of which
I am absolutely certain.

906
01:19:57,246 --> 01:20:01,080
Assisting an expert is a different thing,
a very different thing...

907
01:20:01,183 --> 01:20:02,707
...from doing it oneself.

908
01:20:02,852 --> 01:20:05,821
Think about it.
Someone's got to clean up after the Prince.

909
01:20:06,022 --> 01:20:08,820
Whose job is it to take care
of the widow's messes?

910
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:11,457
You've turned into Othello,
do you know that?

911
01:20:11,627 --> 01:20:14,653
Everything is a suspicion.
And like that tragic Moor...

912
01:20:14,764 --> 01:20:17,358
...all your suspicions will end up
in your own demise.

913
01:20:17,466 --> 01:20:20,594
Heaven's sake,
these women aren't just being silenced.

914
01:20:20,669 --> 01:20:24,400
They're being murdered most brutally.
Why would Ben Kidney do that?

915
01:20:24,473 --> 01:20:25,963
To scare people.

916
01:20:26,142 --> 01:20:28,940
- To keep their mind off the real point.
- Which is?

917
01:20:29,245 --> 01:20:31,372
Think what's at stake for Special Branch.

918
01:20:31,547 --> 01:20:34,880
Prince Edward married Ann Crook,
a commoner and a Catholic.

919
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:39,046
Married her in a Catholic church,
they had a baby, a legitimate baby...

920
01:20:39,121 --> 01:20:42,887
...who is in fact
heir to the throne of England.

921
01:20:42,958 --> 01:20:44,619
All these women were there.

922
01:20:45,094 --> 01:20:47,927
All these women were eyewitnesses
to an event...

923
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:51,263
...that could rip the empire to pieces.

924
01:20:58,474 --> 01:21:02,103
Once she starts drinking,
she'll go all night, you know that.

925
01:21:02,244 --> 01:21:06,544
- She knows how dangerous it is.
- She don't believe you about the Prince.

926
01:21:06,715 --> 01:21:10,446
She thinks you're feeding that copper
candies to keep him interested.

927
01:21:17,093 --> 01:21:18,526
Hello, sir.

928
01:21:19,762 --> 01:21:22,731
Is anything wrong, my dear?

929
01:21:22,898 --> 01:21:26,834
No, sir. For a moment,
I thought you were someone else.

930
01:21:29,672 --> 01:21:31,037
Thirsty?

931
01:21:38,681 --> 01:21:40,012
Always parched, sir.

932
01:21:42,017 --> 01:21:45,248
Perhaps there is somewhere nearby
that we might go...

933
01:21:45,321 --> 01:21:48,620
...while my coachman keeps watch.

934
01:21:48,858 --> 01:21:49,916
Yeah.

935
01:21:53,295 --> 01:21:54,489
This way.

936
01:21:54,897 --> 01:21:55,989
Follow me.

937
01:22:25,127 --> 01:22:26,389
It's this way.

938
01:22:27,596 --> 01:22:28,790
Follow me.

939
01:22:32,168 --> 01:22:33,829
I dropped my grapes.

940
01:22:52,888 --> 01:22:53,912
No!

941
01:22:55,591 --> 01:22:57,525
What the fuck are you looking at?

942
01:23:01,630 --> 01:23:02,654
Shut up!

943
01:23:28,691 --> 01:23:31,216
I hear someone coming, sir.

944
01:23:31,327 --> 01:23:32,385
Sir!

945
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,649
It's one of them, isn't it?

946
01:24:00,589 --> 01:24:02,557
The throat's cut the same way.

947
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:03,915
Yeah.

948
01:24:04,994 --> 01:24:06,484
He didn't finish.

949
01:24:07,796 --> 01:24:09,787
She's no less dead for that.

950
01:24:11,734 --> 01:24:13,861
He won't be satisfied by this.

951
01:24:18,307 --> 01:24:19,638
Wilkins.

952
01:24:21,777 --> 01:24:24,905
Fetch the ambulance. Go on, run along.

953
01:25:08,424 --> 01:25:10,449
Excuse me, miss.

954
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,158
You could be dead...

955
01:25:53,936 --> 01:25:55,130
...right now.

956
01:25:56,271 --> 01:25:58,831
But then there would be
too many bloody questions.

957
01:26:02,044 --> 01:26:04,205
Ignore the old man's blathering.

958
01:26:04,713 --> 01:26:08,911
Find a scapegoat,
or next time we won't care who asks:

959
01:26:09,351 --> 01:26:12,320
"Whatever happened
to Inspector Abberline?"

960
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:41,549
We should hurry up, sir. It's clearing up.

961
01:26:43,218 --> 01:26:45,778
Do you have a piece of chalk, Netley?

962
01:26:46,588 --> 01:26:48,078
Chalk, sir?

963
01:26:49,057 --> 01:26:52,026
They found another one in Mitre Square!

964
01:27:16,885 --> 01:27:20,719
Nice work, Inspector.
You've encouraged him to do two a night.

965
01:27:20,789 --> 01:27:22,882
Out of the fucking way.

966
01:27:30,999 --> 01:27:32,660
Catherine Eddowes.

967
01:27:34,236 --> 01:27:36,966
There's some writing on the wall,
just down the road.

968
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:38,734
You should have a look at it.

969
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:44,004
"The Jews are the men
that will not be blamed for nothing."

970
01:27:44,313 --> 01:27:46,941
It's hardly Shakespeare, but it'll do.

971
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:54,284
Madam, slow down.

972
01:27:54,923 --> 01:27:57,289
Make sure you get the apron as well.

973
01:28:08,203 --> 01:28:10,364
It was written by the killer, sir.

974
01:28:10,973 --> 01:28:12,736
And how do you know that?

975
01:28:13,075 --> 01:28:15,873
I was here three quarters of an hour ago.

976
01:28:16,311 --> 01:28:19,508
This building, mostly Jews live here.
Is that right?

977
01:28:19,715 --> 01:28:21,148
Yeah, that's right.

978
01:28:21,216 --> 01:28:22,376
Ready now, sir.

979
01:28:22,484 --> 01:28:24,975
Put that away,
and get out of here immediately.

980
01:28:27,656 --> 01:28:28,987
Abberline?

981
01:28:29,658 --> 01:28:31,626
- Wash that off.
- What?

982
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,990
- You heard me.
- It's evidence, sir.

983
01:28:34,096 --> 01:28:35,324
Listen to me.

984
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:39,958
In another hour, there will be
1,000 people poking about in here.

985
01:28:40,168 --> 01:28:43,763
If those words are seen,
not a Jew in London will be safe.

986
01:28:43,906 --> 01:28:47,103
We'll have mayhem on the streets,
so wash it off.

987
01:28:47,643 --> 01:28:51,579
That's an educated hand, sir.
An educated man wrote that.

988
01:28:51,713 --> 01:28:54,944
- Look for yourself.
- I don't have to look, I've seen it.

989
01:28:55,951 --> 01:28:58,852
An educated man
knows how to spell "Jews."

990
01:28:58,921 --> 01:29:00,445
I don't know what this refers to...

991
01:29:00,522 --> 01:29:04,583
...but I'm sure it's got nothing to do
with the people who live around here.

992
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:11,293
Sergeant, I want two constables
to wash that off.

993
01:29:12,668 --> 01:29:14,568
What are you looking to him for?

994
01:29:14,803 --> 01:29:16,236
Wash it off!

995
01:29:16,572 --> 01:29:17,869
Yes, sir.

996
01:29:19,975 --> 01:29:23,308
Six men have seen it already,
the Sergeant has copied it down.

997
01:29:23,412 --> 01:29:25,903
I'll remember these words
for as long as I live.

998
01:29:26,014 --> 01:29:29,006
So all you're doing
is destroying its value as evidence.

999
01:29:29,084 --> 01:29:32,815
No, all I am doing is taking charge
of an investigation...

1000
01:29:32,888 --> 01:29:37,757
...that you have bungled to the point
of gross inefficiency, and I've had enough.

1001
01:29:38,594 --> 01:29:41,062
You are suspended from duty, Abberline.

1002
01:29:42,898 --> 01:29:45,389
Inspector Abberline is suspended.

1003
01:29:46,401 --> 01:29:48,631
All of his privileges are cancelled.

1004
01:30:05,153 --> 01:30:07,246
You have not seen her, then?

1005
01:30:08,223 --> 01:30:10,885
If she comes around, give her this.

1006
01:30:13,228 --> 01:30:14,593
Long letter, eh?

1007
01:30:16,798 --> 01:30:18,265
This is for your trouble.

1008
01:30:20,302 --> 01:30:22,566
The letter's private, you understand?

1009
01:30:22,838 --> 01:30:24,328
I understand.

1010
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:16,616
Who is this?

1011
01:31:21,863 --> 01:31:23,854
Recite the solemn oath.

1012
01:31:23,965 --> 01:31:25,990
"Never to reveal our secrets..."

1013
01:31:45,954 --> 01:31:47,615
Grapes again.

1014
01:31:49,224 --> 01:31:50,555
Why grapes?

1015
01:31:51,593 --> 01:31:53,083
This ain't killing for profit.

1016
01:31:53,595 --> 01:31:55,392
He's not that foolish.

1017
01:31:55,597 --> 01:31:58,361
- Are you questioning my decision?
- Find a scapegoat.

1018
01:32:00,035 --> 01:32:02,026
"...my throat be cut across..."

1019
01:32:02,304 --> 01:32:03,635
This is ritual.

1020
01:33:12,641 --> 01:33:17,578
"Jubela, Jubelo, Jubelum."

1021
01:33:18,847 --> 01:33:19,871
Jews.

1022
01:33:51,479 --> 01:33:54,039
It's me, Ada. Only me.

1023
01:33:55,383 --> 01:33:58,045
I bring everything for supper.

1024
01:34:01,089 --> 01:34:03,148
You little thief, I need this money.

1025
01:34:03,258 --> 01:34:07,695
I just take some money and buy food,
for me and for you. Is that bad, Mary?

1026
01:34:09,464 --> 01:34:12,490
It's fine, dear.
You're a good person, but listen...

1027
01:34:13,401 --> 01:34:16,564
...until I go away from London,
it's not safe for you to go out.

1028
01:34:16,838 --> 01:34:18,135
Understand?

1029
01:34:19,407 --> 01:34:21,068
I stay with Mary.

1030
01:34:21,710 --> 01:34:23,200
Beautiful Mary.

1031
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:27,537
It's all right, darling.
You don't have to pay for your food.

1032
01:34:27,749 --> 01:34:28,773
Pardon?

1033
01:34:31,786 --> 01:34:33,686
Here's to our feast.

1034
01:35:09,024 --> 01:35:12,152
I'm so sorry to greet you like this,
Inspector...

1035
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,187
...but I'm late for an appointment.

1036
01:35:14,262 --> 01:35:17,891
Will you excuse me
if I finish dressing while we talk?

1037
01:35:18,033 --> 01:35:19,967
- Please, go on.
- Thank you.

1038
01:35:21,870 --> 01:35:24,839
I'd like to speak to you
about the Freemasons, if I might.

1039
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:25,964
Yes.

1040
01:35:27,809 --> 01:35:31,370
The arrangement of the coins
at Dark Annie's feet...

1041
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:35,909
...and also the locations of the bodies...

1042
01:35:37,319 --> 01:35:39,150
...form a pentacle star.

1043
01:35:39,521 --> 01:35:42,581
A pentacle star is the symbol
of the Freemasons, is it not?

1044
01:35:42,657 --> 01:35:43,715
Yes.

1045
01:35:45,927 --> 01:35:48,122
And the way that these women
were killed...

1046
01:35:48,229 --> 01:35:50,629
...throats cut left to right...

1047
01:35:52,133 --> 01:35:54,124
...their organs removed.

1048
01:35:56,237 --> 01:35:59,070
They're reenactments, aren't they?

1049
01:36:01,209 --> 01:36:03,040
Reenactments of what?

1050
01:36:03,778 --> 01:36:05,006
The Jews.

1051
01:36:06,414 --> 01:36:09,508
The traitors who killed Hiram Abiff,
founder of the Masons.

1052
01:36:09,651 --> 01:36:11,676
That's how they were executed.

1053
01:36:11,853 --> 01:36:15,380
Yes, so the Great Book tells us.

1054
01:36:16,758 --> 01:36:20,387
So Jack the Ripper
isn't just merely killing whores.

1055
01:36:21,596 --> 01:36:23,564
He's executing traitors.

1056
01:36:24,032 --> 01:36:26,523
He's a Mason fulfilling a duty.

1057
01:36:26,868 --> 01:36:29,063
Yes, I'm afraid, Inspector...

1058
01:36:29,137 --> 01:36:31,537
...that you won't be permitted
to arrest him.

1059
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:34,337
I don't want to arrest him.

1060
01:36:37,412 --> 01:36:40,074
The Ripper has one more traitor
yet to kill...

1061
01:36:40,715 --> 01:36:42,808
...and I will stop him.

1062
01:36:48,289 --> 01:36:50,189
Did they come to you, sir...

1063
01:36:51,393 --> 01:36:53,054
...as a loyal Mason?

1064
01:36:54,496 --> 01:36:58,159
Did they ask you to help them
cover up the Prince's secret marriage?

1065
01:37:01,469 --> 01:37:03,460
That's how it started, yes.

1066
01:37:04,439 --> 01:37:07,272
And then you discovered
the Prince had syphilis.

1067
01:37:09,010 --> 01:37:11,570
He's going to die of it, Inspector.

1068
01:37:13,381 --> 01:37:16,373
Would you like a tour
of the syphilis wards?

1069
01:37:19,154 --> 01:37:22,487
You're physician in ordinary to the Queen...

1070
01:37:24,125 --> 01:37:27,652
...entrusted with the well-being
of the heir to the throne.

1071
01:37:28,797 --> 01:37:33,496
Only you had reason to believe
that these unfortunates...

1072
01:37:34,335 --> 01:37:36,030
...these whores...

1073
01:37:36,638 --> 01:37:38,970
...these traitors...

1074
01:37:40,675 --> 01:37:42,802
...destroyed your life's work.

1075
01:37:51,653 --> 01:37:54,053
Below the skin of history...

1076
01:37:55,090 --> 01:37:57,217
...are London's veins.

1077
01:37:57,959 --> 01:38:00,655
These symbols, the mitre...

1078
01:38:01,229 --> 01:38:02,821
...the pentacle star...

1079
01:38:03,465 --> 01:38:08,300
...even someone as ignorant
and degenerate as you...

1080
01:38:09,204 --> 01:38:13,573
...can sense that they course
with energy and meaning.

1081
01:38:17,145 --> 01:38:18,908
I am that meaning.

1082
01:38:21,316 --> 01:38:22,908
I am that energy.

1083
01:38:30,892 --> 01:38:34,123
One day, men will look back...

1084
01:38:36,131 --> 01:38:39,726
...and say I gave birth to the 20th century.

1085
01:38:46,641 --> 01:38:48,871
You're not going to see the 20th century.

1086
01:39:30,652 --> 01:39:32,552
Roll up his sleeve.

1087
01:39:37,692 --> 01:39:39,250
Don't struggle.

1088
01:39:40,595 --> 01:39:42,586
You'll only make this more painful.

1089
01:41:05,346 --> 01:41:07,007
Are you all right?

1090
01:41:07,282 --> 01:41:09,409
There's someone under there.

1091
01:43:07,769 --> 01:43:08,963
Dr. Gull?

1092
01:43:13,107 --> 01:43:15,667
You were describing the human heart.

1093
01:43:23,584 --> 01:43:25,643
The human heart...

1094
01:43:26,287 --> 01:43:28,778
...is a dense and powerful muscle...

1095
01:43:30,458 --> 01:43:33,450
...much like the organic equivalent
of mahogany...

1096
01:43:34,595 --> 01:43:39,362
...and notoriously difficult to burn.

1097
01:43:43,204 --> 01:43:45,035
It's about the size of a fist.

1098
01:43:47,008 --> 01:43:50,375
It provides the motor power
for the circulatory system.

1099
01:43:52,046 --> 01:43:57,040
The heart contains two atria,
two ventricles and four valves.

1100
01:43:59,053 --> 01:44:02,284
It is, in effect, a single pump...

1101
01:44:03,257 --> 01:44:05,919
...powering a double circuit.

1102
01:44:07,862 --> 01:44:12,526
In the adult, the heart rate averages
70 to 80 beats a minute.

1103
01:44:15,570 --> 01:44:18,095
Such is the force of the heart beat...

1104
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:25,878
...that if the body's largest artery,
the aorta, is severed...

1105
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:29,177
...a six-foot jet of blood...

1106
01:44:30,618 --> 01:44:32,677
...is released.

1107
01:45:14,862 --> 01:45:16,420
...fear no God.

1108
01:45:17,265 --> 01:45:18,493
Arise.

1109
01:45:19,934 --> 01:45:21,902
Your faith is well-founded.

1110
01:45:57,538 --> 01:45:59,028
Another murder!

1111
01:46:01,442 --> 01:46:03,467
Don't go in there. There's no need.

1112
01:46:04,111 --> 01:46:05,635
How bad is it?

1113
01:46:07,548 --> 01:46:09,539
She's in pieces, sir.

1114
01:46:10,117 --> 01:46:12,278
Sergeant, he can go in.

1115
01:46:24,498 --> 01:46:26,022
Give him to me.

1116
01:46:26,133 --> 01:46:28,158
He'll be taken care of. I swear.

1117
01:46:28,235 --> 01:46:31,727
- I want him.
- It's over. He's done. I give you my word.

1118
01:46:31,839 --> 01:46:32,863
Fuck your word!

1119
01:46:32,974 --> 01:46:36,375
I'll bring every last one
of you fucking cunts down.

1120
01:46:36,510 --> 01:46:38,478
You and your fucking brothers.

1121
01:46:38,613 --> 01:46:39,978
Listen to me.

1122
01:46:40,147 --> 01:46:44,243
Your difficult situation
has been thoroughly discussed.

1123
01:46:44,652 --> 01:46:48,520
You are reinstated.
Indeed, you are promoted.

1124
01:46:51,459 --> 01:46:54,155
No! This is not helping anything.

1125
01:46:56,063 --> 01:46:59,055
Don't be a fool, Inspector.

1126
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:02,736
You will be very closely watched.

1127
01:47:02,970 --> 01:47:06,497
You're all there now.
Where were you when this was happening?

1128
01:47:06,641 --> 01:47:09,769
All right for you, standing around chatting.
What about us?

1129
01:47:10,277 --> 01:47:13,212
Inspector Abberline is in charge.

1130
01:47:13,614 --> 01:47:16,640
Give him all the assistance he requires.

1131
01:47:25,559 --> 01:47:27,720
Remember, you're being watched.

1132
01:47:28,763 --> 01:47:31,960
Men, clear this passage. Move them away.

1133
01:47:32,166 --> 01:47:33,531
Move back. Make way, you.

1134
01:47:40,875 --> 01:47:43,173
Shall we proceed, Inspector?

1135
01:48:03,264 --> 01:48:05,323
Body lies in middle of bed.

1136
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:09,896
Shoulders flat,
but axis of body inclined toward right.

1137
01:48:10,705 --> 01:48:12,935
The left arm is close to the body.

1138
01:48:13,474 --> 01:48:17,604
The forearm flexed at a right angle,
resting across the abdomen.

1139
01:48:18,546 --> 01:48:22,710
The right arm is slightly abducted
from the body.

1140
01:48:23,150 --> 01:48:27,985
It rests on the mattress with
the elbow bent and the forearm supine.

1141
01:48:29,023 --> 01:48:32,891
The fingers are clenched,
indicating a struggle as she died.

1142
01:48:34,328 --> 01:48:36,387
Notice something, Inspector?

1143
01:48:37,665 --> 01:48:38,825
No.

1144
01:48:40,601 --> 01:48:41,932
No, go on.

1145
01:48:47,341 --> 01:48:50,640
Came in not long before dawn,
in a bit of a rush.

1146
01:48:50,811 --> 01:48:52,506
Left this for you.

1147
01:49:00,187 --> 01:49:02,382
"I know you asked me to wait.

1148
01:49:02,523 --> 01:49:06,653
"If I'm to be murdered,
I'd like at least to die in my village.

1149
01:49:07,194 --> 01:49:10,220
"I'm going to the orphanage
to collect baby Alice.

1150
01:49:10,498 --> 01:49:12,830
"Here's an address where you can find us.

1151
01:49:12,933 --> 01:49:15,026
"We'll wait for you eagerly.

1152
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:19,835
"I know in my heart,
we can be happy living by the sea.

1153
01:49:20,107 --> 01:49:22,075
"Just as you saw.

1154
01:49:22,743 --> 01:49:25,268
"I hope to be with you soon, dearest.

1155
01:49:25,646 --> 01:49:28,171
"All my love, Mary."

1156
01:49:40,528 --> 01:49:43,429
We are deeply distressed, Lord Hallsham.

1157
01:49:43,931 --> 01:49:48,595
We asked Sir William to remove a threat
to our family and throne.

1158
01:49:49,036 --> 01:49:52,096
Not to engage in these ghastly rituals.

1159
01:49:52,673 --> 01:49:56,507
Of course not, Your Majesty.
That was unexpected.

1160
01:49:56,877 --> 01:49:59,744
On the other hand,
he has fulfilled his duties.

1161
01:49:59,914 --> 01:50:02,144
The threat is past, Your Majesty.

1162
01:50:02,650 --> 01:50:05,710
In his way, Sir William has been loyal.

1163
01:50:06,153 --> 01:50:08,519
And we are grateful for that.

1164
01:50:08,889 --> 01:50:11,585
The rest is in your hands, Lord Hallsham.

1165
01:50:12,126 --> 01:50:15,027
We wish to hear nothing further of this.

1166
01:50:16,530 --> 01:50:18,361
Knight of the East.

1167
01:50:18,632 --> 01:50:21,157
We are gathered here,
beneath the God of love...

1168
01:50:21,402 --> 01:50:25,099
...and before the sight
of the Great Architect, to judge this case.

1169
01:50:25,940 --> 01:50:30,468
You stand accused of mayhems that
have placed our brotherhood in jeopardy.

1170
01:50:30,644 --> 01:50:34,273
You stand before your peers,
Masons and doctors both.

1171
01:50:34,748 --> 01:50:37,342
I have no peers present here.

1172
01:50:37,451 --> 01:50:38,713
What?

1173
01:50:39,053 --> 01:50:42,022
No man amongst you is fit to judge...

1174
01:50:42,389 --> 01:50:45,153
...the mighty art that I have wrought.

1175
01:50:46,227 --> 01:50:50,926
Your rituals are empty oaths
you neither understand nor live by.

1176
01:50:54,635 --> 01:50:57,035
The Great Architect speaks to me.

1177
01:50:57,805 --> 01:51:01,468
He is the balance,
where my deeds are weighed and judged.

1178
01:51:03,310 --> 01:51:04,800
Not you.

1179
01:51:06,213 --> 01:51:07,612
Knight of the East...

1180
01:51:08,082 --> 01:51:09,947
...hear our judgment.

1181
01:52:00,467 --> 01:52:02,560
They're not watching you anymore.

1182
01:52:07,241 --> 01:52:10,506
I'm telling you, it's safe to go to her.

1183
01:52:11,278 --> 01:52:13,041
They think she's dead.

1184
01:52:13,213 --> 01:52:16,148
If I disappear,
or change my routine suddenly...

1185
01:52:16,483 --> 01:52:18,644
...they might wonder why.

1186
01:52:19,253 --> 01:52:21,517
You know who you're going to turn into?

1187
01:52:21,689 --> 01:52:24,988
That old bugger in the pub
that nobody wants to sit beside...

1188
01:52:25,092 --> 01:52:29,426
...because as soon as he's had a few drinks,
he goes on about the girl who got away.

1189
01:52:29,496 --> 01:52:30,963
Is that what you want?

1190
01:52:31,165 --> 01:52:34,066
Do you want to live the rest of your life
like a ghost?

1191
01:52:34,735 --> 01:52:36,100
No.

1192
01:52:38,072 --> 01:52:40,700
What I want is to go to her.

1193
01:52:41,909 --> 01:52:45,936
But at the slightest hint she's alive,
they will spare no expense...

1194
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:47,747
...and no trouble.

1195
01:52:48,215 --> 01:52:49,773
So I'll stay.

1196
01:52:50,551 --> 01:52:51,916
And watch them.

1197
01:53:29,556 --> 01:53:31,922
Alice!

1198
01:53:32,393 --> 01:53:34,224
Come here, darling.

1199
01:53:38,999 --> 01:53:40,660
Coming, Mother.

1200
01:54:24,611 --> 01:54:25,805
Get up.

1201
01:54:27,748 --> 01:54:30,342
Get up! Come on.

1202
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:21,995
"Good night, sweet prince."
