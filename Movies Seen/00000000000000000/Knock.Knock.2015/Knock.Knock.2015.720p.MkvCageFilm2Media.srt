358
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,170
We were gonna spend Father's Day there,
but, uh, work happened.

359
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,687
Oh, my God, you are all
alone on Father's Day.

360
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,360
Poor Evan, we'll keep you company!

361
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,329
BOTH: Hugs!

362
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,165
No, it's fine.
We celebrated this morning.

363
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,567
Whoa, you're not 43.

364
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,324
You must work out, like, every day.

365
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,522
Yeah, I keep in shape.

366
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,411
Not like when I was
in my 20s, but, uh...

367
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,489
Come on, any guy that ripped
is more into his own ass than yours.

368
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,329
Yeah, I mean, like, seriously,
is that all you do?

369
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,290
Oh, my God, I remember
I fucked this model once,

370
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,204
and while we were having sex
I caught him doing crunches in the mirror.

371
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,443
- (CHUCKLES)
- It was the gayest thing ever.

372
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,331
I'd take somebody that's older
and more experienced

373
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,960
over an Abercrombie model any day.

374
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,690
GENESIS: Yeah.

375
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,570
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

376
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,087
Well, hopefully one day
you'll find both.

377
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,121
I don't know.

378
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,290
Underwear models are the kind of guys
you fuck when you're 14.

379
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,602
That's a statement.

380
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,408
- This is your wife?
- Yup.

381
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,130
BEL: I want to see it.

382
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,167
Wow! She's so pretty.

383
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,290
She's beautiful. You're a lucky guy.

384
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,010
Yeah, I certainly am.

385
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,530
I'm just an architect, but, uh,
she's the real deal.

386
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,008
Most of what you see is hers.

387
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,444
- She made all these?
- Yeah.

388
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,165
GENESIS: Wow.

389
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,926
They're so pretty.

390
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,163
I love these colors.

391
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,725
Red's my favorite.

392
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,245
This is amazing.

393
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,249
I actually studied art history.

394
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,801
I'm no expert, I was only
there for a semester, but,

395
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,366
this...

396
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,522
This is like a Gaudi building, but small.

397
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,968
Yeah, my wife loves Gaudi.

398
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,562
She was, uh, she was born in Barcelona.

399
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,290
BEL: Like me?

400
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,047
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

401
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,210
English, English.
You guys sound too sexy.

402
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,284
That's about the extent
of my Spanish anyway.

403
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,642
My kids speak it perfectly.

404
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,282
Your wife's an amazing artist.

405
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,886
Why are these sculptures here?

406
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,762
They should be in like, MOMA.

407
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,128
Actually, um...

408
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,842
It's not exactly MOMA...

409
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,364
But she's having a
big gallery show in LA.

410
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,011
Karen Alvarado.
That's such a pretty name.

411
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,924
An architect and an artist.

412
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,128
You guys are like the perfect couple.

413
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,647
And she's so hot.

414
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,768
You must have sex, like, all day.

415
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,251
- Bel!
- What?

416
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,930
I would.

417
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,081
That's Belly for you.

418
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,447
She sees a hot girl
and chases after her.

419
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,251
Well, it's okay. I have no complaints.

420
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,322
Sorry, I was just being honest.

421
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,728
No, no. It's fine.

422
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,611
Um, but, uh...

423
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,168
I must say

424
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,881
I'm not used to girls just
being so open about that.

425
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,445
About what?

426
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,840
Sex?

427
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,207
No, I mean... Yes.

428
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,204
- Yeah.
- Yes.

429
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,730
It's just sex.

430
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,406
Right.

431
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,283
Now you seem old.

432
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,925
Sorry. So sorry.

433
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,204
Twenty minutes away.

434
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,766
How long have you
and your wife been together?

435
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,243
I was 29 and she was 20.

436
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,686
It's been awhile.

437
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,011
So you haven't been with anyone else
in all those years?

438
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,844
Fourteen years, nope.

439
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,286
Wow.

440
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,051
How is that even possible?

441
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,926
Well, when you love someone...

442
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,081
GENESIS: Come on, Evan.

443
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,806
Humans are the only species
that practice monogamy.

444
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,850
I mean, we're animals.
We're more animals than animals.

445
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,126
It's in our DNA.

446
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,765
Like, being with one person
your whole life,

447
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,446
is going against your own nature.

448
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,685
Look.

449
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,085
It's like this.

450
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,924
I understand men.

451
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,844
I know whenever I get married,

452
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,401
my husband is gonna want to be
with other girls.

453
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,962
So, I want to get comfortable
with having threesomes now,

454
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,886
because I know that's the only way
he'll never cheat on me.

455
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,729
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

456
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,882
Wow.

457
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,690
(EVAN LAUGHS)

458
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,288
So, are you guys... What do you guys do?

459
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,047
I mean, are you...
Are you in school or something?

460
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,004
I mean...

461
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,162
Actually, we're flight attendants.

462
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,401
Really?

463
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,847
What would you like
for your entree, sir?

464
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,286
We have chicken...

465
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,881
And pasta.

466
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,361
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

467
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,008
Please buckle your seatbelt, sir.

468
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,606
We may be encountering some turbulence.

469
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,444
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

470
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,725
EVAN: So...

471
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,285
Where you guys based out of?

472
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,726
(SIGHS) Everywhere.

473
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,486
Last weekend we were in
New Zealand for 24 hours.

474
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,880
It was awesome.

475
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,930
Wow, how was that jet lag?

476
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,610
We don't sleep.

477
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,128
GENESIS:
It's like being a fake rock star.

478
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,328
You know, you fly
around the world first class,

479
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,290
drinks are on the house
and they pay you for it.

480
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,250
I'm jealous.

481
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,161
I once got offered a tour
when I was a DJ.

482
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,164
Not like you guys, but, uh,
Tri-State area.

483
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,370
Yeah, well, I think traveling is
the best way to get life experience.

484
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,483
Especially when you're
only there for 24 hours.

485
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,768
You really make the most of it.

486
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,160
GENESIS: Yeah, we make the most of it.

487
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,443
Unlike that fucking
starfish we work with. Ugh.

488
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,360
BEL: (SOFTLY) Ugh, starfish.

489
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,841
- Starfish?
- This girl we work with...

490
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,729
She doesn't have to do anything in bed,

491
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,167
she just lies there
like a fucking starfish.

492
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,527
Hence, starfish.

493
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,125
I mean, who'd want to fuck that?

494
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,647
- (CHUCKLES)
- BEL: I don't understand girls like that.

495
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,046
When I'm with a guy,
I want him to have the time of his life.

496
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,361
- No rules.
- None.

497
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,887
Nothing's off limit, sexually.

498
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,441
Sex with boundaries isn't really sex.

499
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,961
If our bodies are capable of doing it,

500
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,441
then we were meant to. Right?

501
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,009
(THUNDER CRACKING)

502
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,805
Oh, Evan? Can I use your bathroom?

503
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,161
Of course. It's, uh, down
the hall on the right.

504
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,845
Thanks.

505
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,688
I don't know any of these.

506
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,006
Well, I have pretty eclectic taste.

507
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,568
You have Spanish music.

508
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,929
Chilean, actually.

509
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,481
My wife loves her, Fran Valenzuela.

510
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,090
Can you put it on?

511
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,605
Sure.

512
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,844
She's really talented.

513
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,401
She started composing when she was 13.

514
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,291
This is her third album.

515
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,488
(MUSIC PLAYING)

516
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,810
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

517
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,327
Wow!

518
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,562
How did you know that would mix?

519
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,331
DJ'ing is like mixing a drink.

520
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,091
First you find the right ingredients,

521
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,129
then you find the blend.

522
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,846
Evan, I have something to confess.

523
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,721
Yes?

524
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,360
I'm glad we knocked on your door.

525
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,564
I'm having a way better time here

526
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,929
then at that stupid party
we were supposed to go to.

527
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,690
Well, I have to confess,
it's not usually this exciting around here

528
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,484
at 1:30 in the morning.

529
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,369
It's like destiny
that we were meant to meet.

530
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,161
Do you believe in destiny, Evan?

531
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,604
I'm an architect.

532
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,651
So obviously I believe
that things happen by your own design.

533
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,482
Well, I do.

534

1425
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:05,210
For a moment, I thought
you were the one who'd say no.

1426
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:09,523
And now we have to play
a game with someone else.

1427
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:13,251
You know what's funny?
They never say no.

1428
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,004
No matter who they are.

1429
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:19,164
No matter how much
they love their families.

1430
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,045
You're all the same.

1431
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,567
Bye, Evan.

1432
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,689
You were my favorite.

1433
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,765
GENESIS: Oh!

1434
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,521
Wish me happy birthday.
I turn 22 next week.

1435
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:37,250
Yeah.

1436
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,448
BEL: I freaked out when I turned 18.

1437
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,001
But you made me feel 15 again.
Thanks, Evan.

1438
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:43,880
(GIGGLING)

1439
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,644
Let's get out of here.

1440
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,849
Oh, I almost forgot. Yes, your phone.

1441
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,561
You know you really should be
more careful with Facebook.

1442
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,371
If you don't log out someone
could do terrible things with it.

1443
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:01,966
Post something really personal
for all your friends to see.

1444
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,764
Look closely. So you'll remember us.

1445
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,124
GENESIS: (RECORDED) Yes, Evan, fuck her!

1446
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,247
BEL: Fuck me, Daddy!

1447
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,640
EVAN: Okay.

1448
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,884
GENESIS: Attaboy, Evan. Fuck her!

1449
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,523
BEL: Fuck me! Fuck me!

1450
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,490
I'm sure you'll get
a lot of likes though.

1451
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,205
GENESIS: Doggy style, Belly!

1452
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,725
Enjoy!

1453
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:26,961
(BEL HOWLING)

1454
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,531
BEL: Oh!

1455
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:32,241
Bye, Evan! Muah! We'll miss you!

1456
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,125
Oh!

1457
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,010
No!

1458
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,202
(MOANING AND CRYING OUT FROM PHONE)

1459
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,362
Oh, no!

1460
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:49,565
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1461
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,611
(GROANING)

1462
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:18,488
Fuck me, Daddy!

1463
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,881
God, God!

1464
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,965
(PANTING)

1465
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,443
(GRUNTS)

1466
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,363
KAREN: Take your bags to your rooms.
Then go use the bathroom.

1467
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:07,171
And then we're gonna
go see Monkey, okay?

1468
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,364
- Are you guys tired?
- BOTH: Yeah!

1469
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,204
LISA: Monkey?

1470
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,328
Monkey?

1471
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,963
Daddy had a party.
