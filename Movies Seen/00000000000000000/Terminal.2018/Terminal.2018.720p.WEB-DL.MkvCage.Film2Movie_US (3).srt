00:01:16,257 --> 00:01:21,794
<i>There is a place
like no other on Earth.</i>

3
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:24,897
<i>A land full of wonder,</i>

4
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:26,365
<i>mystery,</i>

5
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:27,637
<i>and danger.</i>

6
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:33,873
<i>Some say to survive it,</i>

7
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:37,910
<i>you need to be
as mad as a hatter,</i>

8
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:40,746
<i>which luckily...</i>

9
00:01:40,748 --> 00:01:42,417
<i>I am.</i>

10
00:01:48,357 --> 00:01:51,391
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

11
00:01:51,393 --> 00:01:52,861
Easy, sweetheart.

12
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,635
I don't think you're
supposed to smoke in here.

13
00:02:01,637 --> 00:02:03,370
Guess I've sinned
again then.

14
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:05,941
What is it that you want?

15
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:14,747
You know exactly what I want.

16
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:19,385
I want your work,
your contracts, all of it.

17
00:02:19,387 --> 00:02:21,420
I'm afraid
you're out of luck.

18
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:25,891
I've been recommended another
interested party to handle my...

19
00:02:25,893 --> 00:02:28,427
liquidations.

20
00:02:28,429 --> 00:02:31,298
I'll make you a wager.

21
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,767
These other interested parties,

22
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:38,372
I'll set them on one another
like starving rats in a cage,

23
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:40,841
and you can
watch through the bars.

24
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:42,376
Give me a fortnight.

25
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:44,544
I'll have them both dead
at your feet.

26
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:47,880
If I win, I get your work.

27
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:49,283
All of it.

28
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:51,852
If you win,

29
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:55,521
you get to make me the
interested party that's dead.

30
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,790
Deal?

31
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:59,392
Deal.

32
00:02:59,394 --> 00:03:00,796
Wait.

33
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,299
I need a little favor.

34
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:08,404
I need you
to find someone for me.

35
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:39,361
Let the games begin.

36
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:15,728
Filet steaks and a robust red
for supper, is it?

37
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,997
Fuck off, you punk.

38
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:19,132
Don't do that.
It's dangerous.

39
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:21,134
I've got an open blade here.

40
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:23,905
Stick it in your mouth.
Maybe it will keep you quiet.

41
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:29,776
Why are you shaving?

42
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:31,177
Two weeks we've been in here
all day and all night,

43
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:32,946
and suddenly
you're putting your face on.

44
00:05:32,948 --> 00:05:33,947
What's all that about?

45
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:36,115
I've got a date later.

46
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:38,951
Have you? Bollocks.

47
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:41,822
Only date you've got is with
a camp bed and your right hand,

48
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:43,759
you wanker.

49
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:27,266
No trains till tomorrow now.

50
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:29,235
404 going north,

51
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:32,172
calling all stations
until termination.

52
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,040
Have a pleasant trip.

53
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:36,742
I'm not going north.
I just need a train.

54
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:37,913
Train?

55
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:41,113
- Yes.
- Where you going?

56
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:42,949
Nowhere.
I just need a train.

57
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:44,817
- Why?
- Never you mind!

58
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,988
There's no need for rudeness.

59
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:53,192
I'm so sorry.
That was, um...

60
00:06:53,194 --> 00:06:54,728
That was unnecessary.

61
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,230
A man...

62
00:06:57,232 --> 00:06:58,798
who needs a train...

63
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,600
but not the journey...

64
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:04,036
is a man with a problem.

65
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:05,704
Indeed.

66
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:07,240
Are there any freight trains
coming through here

67
00:07:07,242 --> 00:07:09,576
- between now and then?
- Naw.

68
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:11,011
No freight trains here.

69
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,846
Of course.

70
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:14,113
Yeah.

71
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:16,682
404 going north,

72
00:07:16,684 --> 00:07:21,987
calling all stations
until termination.

73
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:24,089
Well, the 404
seems like an age away,

74
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:26,761
and it's not time
I'm trying to kill.

75
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:32,865
End of the Line Cafe

76
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:35,168
situated on
the station concourse,

77
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,202
open 24 hours a day.

78
00:07:37,204 --> 00:07:41,273
Why not purchase one of
our delicious sticky buns?

79
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,175
Only 30 pence.

80
00:07:43,177 --> 00:07:44,744
You're peculiar.

81
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:47,613
And you're staring
at an empty platform

82
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:51,184
in a deserted station
in the middle of the night,

83
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:56,058
waiting for a train
that isn't coming.

84
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:59,259
Touché.

85
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,763
End of the Line it is.

86
00:08:27,254 --> 00:08:29,389
Give us your money,
you old bastard, or I'll do you!

87
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:31,290
What? No! Absolutely not!

88
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:33,393
- You think I'm kidding?
- I didn't say that.

89
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:36,129
I just feel like
you lack preparation is all.

90
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:38,731
How's this for preparation?

91
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:42,268
Now give him your wallet
and your watch. Now!

92
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,638
I'll tell you what.
I'll buy the gun off you.

93
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,306
I've got a fiver here,
a crisp five pound note.

94
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:47,907
Take it or leave it.

95
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:49,908
Raymond, hurry up!

96
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,144
What do you want me
to do, Lenny?

97
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:53,379
- He's not cooperating.
- Lenny?

98
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:55,048
- You are?
- Raymond.

99
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,982
Raymond. Now listen to me
very, very carefully.

100
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:59,351
I've made what I believe to be
a perfectly reasonable offer.

101
00:08:59,353 --> 00:09:01,254
Now you're going
to make a few quid,

102
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:02,355
and I'm in need of a gun.

103
00:09:02,357 --> 00:09:03,990
Now, is it loaded?

104
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:05,258
What do you mean,
is it loaded?

105
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,126
I mean, are there
any bullets in it?

106
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:09,162
Of course it's loaded!

107
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:10,633
Really?

108
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,899
No, it's not loaded.

109
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,168
- Ah.
- Ray!

110
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,870
- For Christ's sakes!
- What?

111
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:17,903
It's not, is it?

112
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:19,706
This is ridiculous.

113
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,073
- Hey, where you going?
- Stay there you or I'll...

114
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:22,442
Or what? What, Lenny?

115
00:09:22,444 --> 00:09:25,378
You going to butter me
to death?

116
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,947
I'm very disappointed
in both of you.

117
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:30,984
You've let me down,
and you've let yourselves down.

118
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:33,219
Something to think about,
isn't it?

119
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:34,657
Good night.

120
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:39,926
Fucking piss me off sometimes,
you do.

121
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:41,827
Why did you tell him
there were no bullets for?

122
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:08,189
You can't smoke in here.

123
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:13,826
Well, there's
no one else in here.

124
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:16,495
They're not smoking either,
are they?

125
00:10:16,497 --> 00:10:21,267
Can I have another cup
of coffee then? This one's cold.

126
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:24,336
That's because you've been
playing with it for 20 minutes.

127
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:27,273
- Can I have another one?
- Sure. 40 pence.

128
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:28,942
Have a heart.
I just got mugged.

129
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:31,977
39 then.
I'm in a giving mood.

130
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,185
So shines a good deed
in a naughty world.

131
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:40,186
Naughty?

132
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:43,123
As in spank me gently,
I've been a naughty girl?

133
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,158
No, not that kind of naughty.

134
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,262
As in tie me to the bedposts
because I've been so naughty?

135
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:52,331
I think that qualifies
as the same kind of naughty.

136
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,033
I know.

137
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:57,740
I just enjoy watching you fidget
when I say "naughty."

138
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,174
Have we met before?

139
00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:04,878
Why? Do I look familiar?

140
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,917
Are you all right?

141
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,186
Do you need your medicine?

142
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:15,488
Well, tell me which one.

143
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,322
You've got to be kidding me.

144
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:19,458
Medicinal purposes.

145
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,863
Nice. Go on then.

146
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:35,844
How about that coffee?

147
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:52,859
Listen to this.

148
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:54,561
"Curvaceous,
cream-skinned belle

149
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:57,529
seeks sleek Romeo
for candlelit romance

150
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:59,566
and walks in the moonlight.

151
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:02,000
City based."

152
00:12:02,002 --> 00:12:04,203
See, that's code, that is.

153
00:12:04,205 --> 00:12:06,908
That's deviants' code.
Pervert poetry.

154
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:11,110
Translates to "Fat bird
wants outside seeing-to

155
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:12,946
late at night." See?

156
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:15,114
Well, that is funny.

157
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:17,583
"Slight, retiring
young gentleman

158
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:21,988
seeks decisive, practical lady
to draw him from his shell.

159
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,490
Friendship and romance.
Suburban residence."

160
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:27,360
Translation:

161
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:29,461
Skinny pencil-dick
seeks dominatrix

162
00:12:29,463 --> 00:12:31,230
for abuse and humiliation.

163
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:33,131
Has own dungeon.

164
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,168
World's gone to shit,
and all anyone can think about

165
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,272
is their next dirty one
down the docks.

166
00:12:39,274 --> 00:12:41,607
There it is, though.

167
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:45,547
There it is
in black and white.

168
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,626
So...

169
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:02,895
what's wrong with you?

170
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:04,464
I beg your pardon?

171
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:07,166
You're hardly the picture
of health. What's wrong?

172
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:08,567
You don't want to know.

173
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:10,403
I'm fascinated.

174
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:13,072
- Tell me.
- What's wrong with you?

175
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:16,609
I have an unquenchable bloodlust
for darkness and depravity.

176
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:18,577
That's nice.

177
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:19,946
Is it cancer?

178
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:22,447
No, no.

179
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:26,052
Has anyone ever introduced you
to the concept of small talk?

180
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:29,389
Well, what is it
if it's not cancer?

181
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,190
They don't know.

182
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,326
No way.

183
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:35,294
That is brilliant.

184
00:13:35,296 --> 00:13:36,995
You're a bit odd, aren't you?

185
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:39,599
Unquestionably, but death
is by far the best bit.

186
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:41,634
- Of what?
- Of life!

187
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:44,070
Did you read that
in a birthday card?

188
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:45,607
You're funny.

189
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:49,642
All right,
let's examine the facts.

190
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:53,479
It's terminal, your sides hurt,
and you cough badly.

191
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:55,380
All signs point to
malignant tumor damage.

192
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:57,517
You're not in denial about it,
are you?

193
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,220
You're not desperately searching
for another explanation?

194
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:03,322
I'm dying?

195
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:05,026
Yeah.

196
00:14:06,227 --> 00:14:08,327
No, thanks.

197
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:12,667
But you don't know...
why or how?

198
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:15,400
No.

199
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:17,602
Will it be painful?

200
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:19,404
Oh, no.

201
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:23,109
Well, how can you be sure?

202
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:24,476
Painkillers.

203
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,082
Is there anything else?

204
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,753
Lolly?

205
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:36,221
It's definitely not cancer.

206
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:38,591
Okay. I don't want to
waste my time diagnosing you

207
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:40,592
if it's going to be some
run of the mill cancer thing.

208
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:42,461
Who says I need diagnosing?

209
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:44,029
You're dying.

210
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,298
Painfully, apparently.

211
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,100
And they don't know
why or what of.

212
00:14:48,102 --> 00:14:49,568
It just sounds
pretty undiagnosed to me.

213
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,437
We're all dying, you realize.

214
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:56,042
Slowly, painfully.
Just a matter of time, friend.

215
00:14:56,044 --> 00:14:58,644
See now, that's the spirit!

216
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:00,178
Are you scared?

217
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,381
I try not to think about it.

218
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:03,615
How's that working out
for you?

219
00:15:03,617 --> 00:15:05,384
Not very well.

220
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:06,753
Are you being survived?

221
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:08,721
I have no idea
what that means.

222
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:10,123
Wife, kids?

223
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,256
Okay, you can't say that.

224
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:12,591
It's "survived by."

225
00:15:12,593 --> 00:15:14,126
It has no other
grammatical context.

226
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:16,361
Jesus, what are you,
a dying English teacher?

227
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:17,663
Yeah.

228
00:15:17,665 --> 00:15:19,231
Oh.

229
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,400
That's fair enough, I suppose.

230
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:23,469
Conjugate me
to your heart's content.

231
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:25,804
- Conjugation's different...
- Shut up.

232
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:27,275
Okay.

233
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,418
Are you sure
we haven't met before?

234
00:15:37,684 --> 00:15:40,385
I don't know. Have we?

235
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:42,687
One shouldn't answer a question
with a question.

236
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:46,192
One shouldn't be such
a pompous prat, but here we are.

237
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,663
I think I would definitely
remember you if we'd met before.

238
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:53,434
You would think so,
wouldn't you?

239
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,790
What the fuck is going on?

240
00:16:16,657 --> 00:16:18,459
Who the hell are you?

241
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,364
Untie me.

242
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:24,730
Now!

243
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:30,302
Listen to me.

244
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:33,773
You've made a mistake.
A big one.

245
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:38,677
But it is a redeemable error.

246
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,379
You're gonna put on
the rest of your clothes,

247
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:41,480
you're gonna
gather your things,

248
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:43,548
you're gonna give me the key,

249
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,221
and then you're going
to run for your life.

250
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:51,657
You've no idea who I am,

251
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:54,559
what I do,

252
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:56,662
or who I work for.

253
00:16:56,664 --> 00:17:01,366
Au contraire,
Mr. Nigel Illing.

254
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:04,170
I know exactly who you are.

255
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:06,638
I know exactly
what it is you do.

256
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,843
And I know exactly
who you work for.

257
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:14,814
I also know that you're 44,
5'11", 12 stone,

258
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:16,516
AB Negative,
a drinker and a smoker,

259
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:17,817
and you have a healthy appetite

260
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,122
for young hookers
in kinky suspenders.

261
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,726
And when you combine
the information

262
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:28,394
I have gathered on you
and your habits,

263
00:17:28,396 --> 00:17:31,230
one can deduce exactly
how many drops of laudanum

264
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:32,899
it requires to render you
unconscious

265
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:34,703
and relatively docile.

266
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,306
I need a teeny-weeny bit
of information from you

267
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:43,545
and a small donation.

268
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:46,711
Okay, what do you want?

269
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:48,446
You want money?

270
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:51,851
You want the car?
Listen, you can take it.

271
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:54,854
You can take it.
Take whatever you want.

272
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:57,522
Oh, that's a very poor
choice of words.

273
00:17:57,524 --> 00:18:00,292
Help! Help!

274
00:18:00,294 --> 00:18:02,194
Help!

275
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:17,246
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

276
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:24,349
So there's this guy, right?

277
00:18:24,351 --> 00:18:25,917
He's creeping
through this house.

278
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,788
It's dark, sinister, creepy.
You get the picture.

279
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,256
Pulls out his gun,

280
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:31,891
and he goes into the room
with it

281
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:35,627
held arm's length
in front of him, Vince.

282
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:37,565
I don't know what to tell you.
It's the pictures.

283
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:42,667
Right. You walk
into the room, right?

284
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:44,737
In like a shot.
You clear your corners.

285
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:46,771
Cleared.
The room is yours, easy.

286
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:49,842
You don't fucking ease
your gun into the room

287
00:18:49,844 --> 00:18:51,376
without being able
to see anything,

288
00:18:51,378 --> 00:18:53,378
waiting to be shot.

289
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,880
It's stupid.

290
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:57,549
It's a film, Alf.
It's make-believe.

291
00:18:57,551 --> 00:19:00,853
It's factually inaccurate.
They actually make it up.

292
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:03,288
It's not as though they've got
some hit man consultant

293
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,589
talking them through
the finer points

294
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:06,592
of assassinating
other fictitious people.

295
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:07,960
Yes, but why not?

296
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:11,364
It would be factually accurate
if they did.

297
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:12,431
I just realized something.

298
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:14,634
You're a fucking moron.

299
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:16,405
Two teas, love!

300
00:19:17,938 --> 00:19:19,675
Oy, bottle blonde!

301
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:22,578
Two teas.

302
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:26,447
What's the magic word?

303
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:34,753
To be fair,
you didn't say "please."

304
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:38,490
Please, could we have
two tea cups of lovely tea,

305
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:41,326
a little bit of milk,
two sugars, both builder's,

306
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:42,461
please, if you don't mind?

307
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,898
Thank you very much.

308
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:47,400
It will be my pleasure.

309
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:48,337
Wanker.

310
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:50,806
Watch this.

311
00:19:56,743 --> 00:20:00,346
Excuse me.
Could I have one of your...

312
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:02,914
lovely-looking
sticky buns, please?

313
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,584
It's dinner and drinks
at the very least

314
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:08,354
before you get your hands
on my buns, handsome.

315
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:11,324
I mix a mean martini,
sugarplum.

316
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:13,358
In that case,
I'll even butter them for you.

317
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,628
Alfred, would you mind terribly
rejoining me at the table,

318
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,029
pretty please?

319
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:20,665
Before I break
your fucking neck.

320
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:21,933
Duty calls.

321
00:20:21,935 --> 00:20:24,272
On the job, are you?

322
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:29,642
Is there the remotest chance

323
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:33,078
that you could possibly
calm down a bit?

324
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,980
And what kind of a shithole
is this then, eh?

325
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:38,483
You said somewhere quiet,
off the beaten track.

326
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:40,419
So you find the only
late night cafe

327
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:41,753
open this side
of the precinct.

328
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:43,422
It's genius.

329
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:45,924
I thought it might be nice
if we had a cup of tea

330
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:47,495
while we talked.

331
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:51,466
Enjoy my buns.

332
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:57,903
Are you fucking drunk
or something?

333
00:20:57,905 --> 00:20:59,672
<i>No. Why?</i>

334
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:03,142
<i>Just shut the fuck up!
That's why.</i>

335
00:21:03,144 --> 00:21:05,678
<i>What is
so cloak and dagger</i>

336
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,748
that you couldn't just
tell me over the phone?

337
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,915
A job's coming.

338
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,084
Yeah?

339
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:13,986
Guttering, is it?
Window cleaning?

340
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:15,755
Yeah, keep up the cheek, son.

341
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:17,722
You know, you're gonna
get clipped round the ear.

342
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:19,557
In fact,
you're gonna get a clip

343
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,126
straight in
the fucking forehead.

344
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:23,496
Understand?

345
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:25,397
All right.

346
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:26,932
I'm listening.

347
00:21:26,934 --> 00:21:30,905
So there's a message
on the answering service.

348
00:21:33,707 --> 00:21:36,808
<i>It tells me,
"Go to the terminal</i>

349
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,380
<i>and open locker 125."</i>

350
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:49,590
- <i>Is there a key?</i>
- <i>No, there's no key.</i>

351
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,928
<i>So what was in it?</i>

352
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:12,546
"La Lapin Blanche."

353
00:22:13,713 --> 00:22:15,114
What's that?

354
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:16,816
Well, it's French.

355
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:19,818
Yes, I know, thank you.

356
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,020
I simply don't understand
the relevance of it.

357
00:22:22,022 --> 00:22:23,721
Are you going
to ruin this for me?

358
00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:26,791
Are you going to suck
all the fucking alluring mystery

359
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:29,694
out of this fucking
situation for me?

360
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:31,766
So it's a clue.

361
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:36,167
- A trail of breadcrumbs.
- Yes, apparently.

362
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:38,837
Someone has a <i>pen-chaunt</i>
for the amateur dramatics.

363
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,472
It's pronounced <i>penchant.</i>

364
00:22:40,474 --> 00:22:41,973
It's pronounced
<i>shut your fucking mouth</i>

365
00:22:41,975 --> 00:22:46,511
is how it's pronounced.

366
00:22:46,513 --> 00:22:49,548
Hang on a second.

367
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,749
Black briefcase.

368
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:52,651
Mm-hmm.

369
00:22:52,653 --> 00:22:54,586
In a locker.

370
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:56,654
A clue.
A trail of breadcrumbs.

371
00:22:56,656 --> 00:22:58,790
Vince, that's the touch, mate.

372
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:01,096
That is a job
from Mr. Franklin.

373
00:23:03,563 --> 00:23:05,163
<i>A Mr. Franklin job?</i>

374
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:07,499
This is massive!

375
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:08,634
All right.

376
00:23:08,636 --> 00:23:11,005
<i>Don't get moist.</i>

377
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:14,973
I thought
he always used Illing.

378
00:23:16,644 --> 00:23:17,846
Apparently not.

379
00:23:20,748 --> 00:23:22,080
Now, have I whet your appetite?

380
00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:23,249
I'm salivating.

381
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:26,588
Let's go rabbit on him.

382
00:23:33,627 --> 00:23:36,295
We've got to play our cards
right on this one, Vincent.

383
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:39,731
No one fucks
with Mr. Franklin.

384
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:41,267
It is a once in a blue moon,

385
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:44,236
once in a fucking lifetime
opportunity.

386
00:23:44,238 --> 00:23:45,804
It's keys to the kingdom.

387
00:23:45,806 --> 00:23:47,740
All right, Alfred,
it's Mr. Franklin,

388
00:23:47,742 --> 00:23:49,810
not the fucking second coming.

389
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:53,878
Well, I guess
this is the place.

390
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,713
What gave it away?

391
00:23:55,715 --> 00:24:00,920
Was it the 20-foot neon sign
with the fucking rabbit on it?

392
00:24:03,691 --> 00:24:05,790
Pinch me, I'm dreaming.

393
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:08,961
I bet they charge
a good-priced cover.

394
00:24:30,818 --> 00:24:33,085
Hello, handsome,
dangerous men.

395
00:24:33,087 --> 00:24:34,819
Hello, beautiful,
semi-clad girl.

396
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:37,021
Business or pleasure?

397
00:24:37,023 --> 00:24:39,357
Is the real question
do I want to pay you

398
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,660
to writhe around on top of me
for a couple of songs,

399
00:24:41,662 --> 00:24:44,096
get me hot all under the collar
and take me into the back room

400
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:46,030
for an overpriced hand job?

401
00:24:46,032 --> 00:24:47,365
'Cause if it is,
the answer's no, fuck off.

402
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:49,768
You are no gentleman.

403
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,639
But you, on the other hand...

404
00:24:53,107 --> 00:24:57,142
I'm Conejo. Welcome.
What is it you seek?

405
00:24:57,144 --> 00:24:58,943
We're here to meet someone.

406
00:24:58,945 --> 00:25:00,645
- Who?
- We don't know.

407
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:02,280
About what?

408
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:04,650
- We don't know.
- Oy!

409
00:25:04,652 --> 00:25:07,789
You need to see Bunny.
Follow me.

410
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:18,096
So where's this Bunny then, eh?

411
00:25:18,098 --> 00:25:20,068
You'll see.

412
00:25:23,236 --> 00:25:24,769
Conejo.

413
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:26,805
What a beautiful name.

414
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:29,407
I bet it means "waterfall"
or "sunset"

415
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:31,242
or something exotic like that.

416
00:25:31,244 --> 00:25:34,646
It means "rabbit," tit.

417
00:25:34,648 --> 00:25:36,147
Oh, yeah.

418
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:37,650
Get your head
in the fucking game, mate.

419
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:39,652
You're becoming
a fucking liability.

420
00:25:39,654 --> 00:25:42,221
And part of my job is to
dispose of fucking liabilities.

421
00:25:42,223 --> 00:25:43,888
What do you mean,
I've become a fucking liability?

422
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,324
<i>It's Bunny!</i>

423
00:25:47,293 --> 00:25:50,028
- Shut up.
- We all play the game.

424
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:54,199
Shut up. Look at her.

425
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:57,368
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

426
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:12,084
Yeah? I'll show you game.

427
00:26:12,086 --> 00:26:14,185
Yeah, are you
the famous Bunny?

428
00:26:14,187 --> 00:26:16,255
How abrupt.

429
00:26:16,257 --> 00:26:18,957
Well, I'm not here
for conversation or culture.

430
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,425
I'm here for information.

431
00:26:20,427 --> 00:26:22,961
Maybe a filthy lap dance,
if I can get one.

432
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:25,698
Then you're in
the right place, Vincent.

433
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,269
How do you know my name?

434
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,003
Bottle blonde!

435
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:34,239
What the fucking hell
are you doing here?

436
00:26:34,241 --> 00:26:35,809
Girl's got to eat.

437
00:26:38,378 --> 00:26:40,378
Is there somewhere
we can go and talk?

438
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,350
That depends.
Have you got something for me?

439
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:48,155
I was thinking more of
an envelope stuffed with money.

440
00:26:57,764 --> 00:27:00,332
Now, I bet that's gonna buy me
a few filthy lap dances.

441
00:27:00,334 --> 00:27:02,134
Probably a lot more than that.

442
00:27:02,136 --> 00:27:03,367
Come and find out.

443
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:06,340
Both of you,
down the rabbit hole.

444
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:08,809
Curiouser and curiouser.

445
00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:17,117
They're with me, boys.

446
00:27:22,255 --> 00:27:23,955
We've been sent here...
we don't know why...

447
00:27:23,957 --> 00:27:25,289
to see you, apparently.

448
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,892
You're supposed to
give us something,

449
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:28,259
though why you couldn't
have given it to us

450
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:30,962
at the pissin' cafe
is way beyond me.

451
00:27:30,964 --> 00:27:32,263
Then we leave.

452
00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:33,267
Sound like a plan?

453
00:27:35,502 --> 00:27:37,038
So.

454
00:27:38,305 --> 00:27:39,438
So?

455
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,508
Look, I'm just the middleman.

456
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,375
Think of me as
a half-naked waitress

457
00:27:44,377 --> 00:27:46,411
delivering goods
from one anonymous party

458
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:48,814
to another anonymous party
for a fee.

459
00:27:48,816 --> 00:27:53,117
Or slightly less anonymous
in your case, Vincent.

460
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,288
- What's the combination?
- No idea.

461
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,390
Well, what good's a briefcase
if we ain't got the combination?

462
00:27:58,392 --> 00:28:00,061
No idea.

463
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,400
Huh. Doesn't even need
a combination.

464
00:28:07,134 --> 00:28:09,201
Thank you, Miss Bunny.
We'll be on our way.

465
00:28:09,203 --> 00:28:11,170
Hang on.

466
00:28:11,172 --> 00:28:13,538
There's something different
about you, bottle blonde.

467
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,174
Besides my stocking suspenders,
plunging cleavage,

468
00:28:16,176 --> 00:28:18,076
and full face
of harlot's makeup?

469
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,579
Yeah, yeah, besides that.

470
00:28:21,581 --> 00:28:23,984
Time to go, Vince.

471
00:28:25,152 --> 00:28:26,818
No.

472
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,988
I want my lap dance first
before I go anywhere.

473
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,925
I'm ready if you are.

474
00:28:33,927 --> 00:28:35,928
I'll let the dog
see the rabbit.

475
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,933
<i>Let's go, Vince.
Floor show's over.</i>

476
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,106
Let me show you chaps
the quick way out, shall I?

477
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:54,479
I'm gonna get that filthy lap
dance off of you, bottle blonde,

478
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:56,818
one way or another.

479
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:05,092
Come back again soon, handsome.

480
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,326
Alfred?

481
00:29:08,328 --> 00:29:10,531
I'll even show you my tail.

482
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,368
Don't bring him.

483
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:22,109
Wow.

484
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,544
Oh, Jesus Christ.

485
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:29,080
One sniff of a whore's perfume,
you think you're in love.

486
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:30,548
I mean wow.

487
00:29:31,952 --> 00:29:34,122
She looked better
as a waitress.

488
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,588
Wow!

489
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,525
You really are a twat,
you know that?

490
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:49,667
It's the waiting
that's doing me in.

491
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:52,403
Just, um...

492
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:56,407
sitting around,
waiting to stop breathing.

493
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:58,846
My mom went in a house fire.

494
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:02,213
No waiting around there,
I suppose.

495
00:30:02,215 --> 00:30:04,082
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

496
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:06,451
You are utterly self-involved
at the moment,

497
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:08,220
completely wrapped up
in yourself.

498
00:30:08,222 --> 00:30:10,221
Steady on.
Just 'cause I'm on my way out

499
00:30:10,223 --> 00:30:12,324
doesn't mean I've turned
into a complete bastard.

500
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:13,991
Why not?

501
00:30:13,993 --> 00:30:15,559
It's your prerogative.

502
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:17,362
That is your hard-won
silver lining.

503
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:18,529
I don't follow.

504
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:20,464
Okay, well, think of it
this way.

505
00:30:20,466 --> 00:30:22,034
It's moral carte blanche.

506
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:24,036
It's an open invitation
to anarchy.

507
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:26,672
You can spend
your last days on Earth

508
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:28,573
doing whatever you want.

509
00:30:28,575 --> 00:30:29,942
Rape away.

510
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:31,676
Smite to your heart's content.

511
00:30:31,678 --> 00:30:33,511
Pillage the precinct
till the gutters run red,

512
00:30:33,513 --> 00:30:34,980
and none of it will matter

513
00:30:34,982 --> 00:30:37,182
because you'll be dead
by Sunday.

514
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:38,683
So go nuts!

515
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:43,124
You know, dry roasted,
sniper in the clock tower nuts.

516
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,092
Did something happen to you
as a child?

517
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:49,126
Besides my mother dying in agony
in a blazing inferno?

518
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:51,430
Oh, I am so sorry.
That was...

519
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,499
Don't apologize.
Rub my nose in it.

520
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:55,733
Come on, pillage me!

521
00:30:55,735 --> 00:30:58,338
Sorry. Was that a bit naughty?

522
00:31:00,573 --> 00:31:03,010
What happened to your thumb?

523
00:31:04,377 --> 00:31:05,346
Oh, that.

524
00:31:06,413 --> 00:31:08,680
An exercise in self-control.

525
00:31:08,682 --> 00:31:11,249
Ah. It went well then.

526
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:15,619
Look, all I'm saying is

527
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:18,390
this seems like
a really good opportunity

528
00:31:18,392 --> 00:31:20,192
to do whatever
the hell you want.

529
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:23,194
Well, what if I want to
mope around in all-night cafes,

530
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:25,196
feeling sorry for myself?

531
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:27,365
Then, frankly,
I might as well do you in now

532
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:29,768
and save myself from
your self-indulgent tripe.

533
00:31:32,438 --> 00:31:33,704
Well...

534
00:31:33,706 --> 00:31:36,141
Well, I would appreciate that.

535
00:31:36,143 --> 00:31:38,042
Annie.

536
00:31:38,044 --> 00:31:39,179
Bill.

537
00:31:49,623 --> 00:31:51,690
That's not your locker!

538
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:53,692
You're going to give me
a fucking heart attack!

539
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:56,294
It is a criminal offense
to interfere with

540
00:31:56,296 --> 00:31:59,397
either municipal storage
or precinct property.

541
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:02,099
Any suspicious activity
must be reported

542
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:04,504
to the appropriate
authorities immediately.

543
00:32:08,308 --> 00:32:10,575
Why don't you piss off,
old man?

544
00:32:10,577 --> 00:32:13,345
Mind your own business.

545
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:16,213
Supervisor.
Night Supervisor.

546
00:32:16,215 --> 00:32:18,316
Duties to include sweeping
of concourse and platform,

547
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:19,683
maintenance
and attendance of all...

548
00:32:19,685 --> 00:32:20,687
Shut up!

549
00:32:22,755 --> 00:32:24,355
Tell me something.

550
00:32:24,357 --> 00:32:27,425
Do I look to you like
the sort of individual

551
00:32:27,427 --> 00:32:29,728
that creeps into the station
in the dead of night,

552
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,229
breaks open a locker,

553
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:33,298
removes a suspicious-looking
briefcase,

554
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,703
and then lets
the fucking cleaner...

555
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:42,339
sorry, night supervisor...

556
00:32:42,341 --> 00:32:44,776
run off and tell tall tales
about it?

557
00:32:44,778 --> 00:32:46,510
Do I not strike you
more as the sort of

558
00:32:46,512 --> 00:32:49,614
highly motivated,
highly vicious individual

559
00:32:49,616 --> 00:32:52,550
that would not kill
said night supervisor

560
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:55,086
and stuff him
into the fucking locker?

561
00:32:55,088 --> 00:32:58,789
Acceptable forms of payment
at the terminal are as follows:

562
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:01,226
cash, banker's drafts,

563
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:04,298
certified checks up to the
value of the return journey.

564
00:33:11,437 --> 00:33:14,506
I like you. You're funny.

565
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:17,174
All right, all right,
I'll clear it.

566
00:33:17,176 --> 00:33:19,376
- Oh.
- Mum's the word, Supe.

567
00:33:19,378 --> 00:33:20,545
Okay.

568
00:33:20,547 --> 00:33:24,115
- Oh!
- Ten, twenty, thirty.

569
00:33:24,117 --> 00:33:26,053
We all right, son?

570
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:32,891
When rich villains
have need of poor ones,

571
00:33:32,893 --> 00:33:36,431
poor ones make
what price they will.

572
00:33:39,465 --> 00:33:40,664
Come again?

573
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:43,234
I want more money.

574
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:45,269
Yeah.

575
00:33:45,271 --> 00:33:47,207
Oh, yeah.

576
00:33:48,774 --> 00:33:51,576
You know, when rich villains
get pissed off

577
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:53,545
with poor ones
overcharging them,

578
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:55,547
they go round their house,

579
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:58,853
they burn it,
they murder their family.

580
00:34:00,753 --> 00:34:05,190
Terminal Train Lines
thanks you for your business

581
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:08,463
and wishes you
a pleasant evening.

582
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:17,405
What a fucking crook!

583
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:35,486
- Yo, you better give me your...
- Fuck off!

584
00:34:35,488 --> 00:34:36,955
I just wanted to know
the time, mate.

585
00:34:36,957 --> 00:34:38,323
My bad.

586
00:34:38,325 --> 00:34:39,624
Yeah, that's it,
fucking walk on.

587
00:34:39,626 --> 00:34:41,725
Yeah, yeah, you better run.

588
00:34:41,727 --> 00:34:43,196
Dickhead.

589
00:34:47,434 --> 00:34:49,301
- Just for you.
- Thanks.

590
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,937
Evening, bottle blonde.

591
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:54,673
Hello, Prince Charming.

592
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,475
- Alfred.
- Vince.

593
00:34:57,477 --> 00:34:59,377
You want to put her down, mate.

594
00:34:59,379 --> 00:35:02,316
You don't know where she's been.
You'll catch something.

595
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,283
Duty calls.

596
00:35:05,285 --> 00:35:08,222
Well, it was lovely
seeing you again, handsome.

597
00:35:15,528 --> 00:35:17,597
Can't say the same
for you, Vincent.

598
00:35:20,734 --> 00:35:22,734
You want to get your head
in the game, mate?

599
00:35:22,736 --> 00:35:24,539
You're getting sloppy.

600
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:27,504
I'll see you around,
bottle blonde,

601
00:35:27,506 --> 00:35:29,006
if I don't shoot you first.

602
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:30,977
Ooh.

603
00:35:34,847 --> 00:35:35,882
Vince!

604
00:35:39,419 --> 00:35:40,655
Bang.

605
00:35:43,923 --> 00:35:45,756
Wanker.

606
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,341
This was in the briefcase.

607
00:36:03,343 --> 00:36:07,448
Press play.
I'm gonna stretch my legs.

608
00:36:11,852 --> 00:36:14,451
<i>I am Mr. Franklin.</i>

609
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:17,055
<i>I have no doubt
you know who I am</i>

610
00:36:17,057 --> 00:36:19,723
<i>and what my business is worth.</i>

611
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:22,926
<i>I have an offer, a contract.</i>

612
00:36:22,928 --> 00:36:26,698
<i>I want you
to kill someone for me.</i>

613
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,433
<i>You will lie in wait
in the apartment</i>

614
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:31,535
<i>I have provided for you.</i>

615
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:34,805
<i>You will be on call
24 hours a day,</i>

616
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:36,875
<i>seven days a week,</i>

617
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:39,944
<i>until I contact you to...</i>

618
00:36:39,946 --> 00:36:41,845
<i>execute.</i>

619
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:43,381
Jesus.

620
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:44,948
<i>Before you commence,</i>

621
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,653
<i>I require one of you to
attend a face-to-face meeting.</i>

622
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:52,424
<i>Only one.
I do not like crowds.</i>

623
00:36:52,426 --> 00:36:54,325
<i>That is all.</i>

624
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:56,630
Fucking perfect.

625
00:37:25,124 --> 00:37:27,661
Evening, bottle blonde.

626
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:33,401
Out for a casual stroll?

627
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:21,382
Well, for fuck's sake.

628
00:38:25,118 --> 00:38:27,752
You know what?
I'm getting a little bit old

629
00:38:27,754 --> 00:38:30,725
for all these parlor games,
bottle blonde.

630
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,549
Evening, gorgeous.

631
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:59,053
These are for you.

632
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:03,154
You're in trouble, Alfred.

633
00:39:03,156 --> 00:39:05,022
I'm always in trouble,
sugarplum.

634
00:39:05,024 --> 00:39:07,691
Spare me the heroics.
You're in real trouble.

635
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:09,060
Targeted,
shot in the back of the head

636
00:39:09,062 --> 00:39:10,928
unless you pay attention
trouble.

637
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,897
I'm listening.

638
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:16,133
Good, because I like you.

639
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:18,937
You're handsome,
and you're chivalrous,

640
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,537
and I like your jaw.

641
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:22,707
It's manly.

642
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:24,875
I want to keep you.

643
00:39:24,877 --> 00:39:27,180
- Well, I think you're...
- Shut up.

644
00:39:28,247 --> 00:39:30,048
Understood.

645
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,750
There's someone here to see you.

646
00:39:32,752 --> 00:39:35,553
Listen to what he's got to say
or that handsome face of yours

647
00:39:35,555 --> 00:39:39,189
will have a gaping exit wound
slap bang in the middle of it.

648
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:41,558
- Okay.
- Good.

649
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,897
Come on out.
He's not gonna bite.

650
00:39:48,234 --> 00:39:50,100
Hello?

651
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:18,196
<i>Good evening, Vincent.</i>

652
00:40:18,198 --> 00:40:20,665
Mr. fucking Franklin,
I presume.

653
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:23,100
- <i>The very same.</i>
- Let me get this straight.

654
00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:24,636
You drag me out
in the middle of the night,

655
00:40:24,638 --> 00:40:27,037
halfway across the city,
freezing cold,

656
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,140
up 20 flights of rickety stairs

657
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:31,609
just so that you can speak to me
on the fucking phone?

658
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:34,578
<i>Who says mystery's a lost art?</i>

659
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,046
Yeah, fair enough.

660
00:40:36,048 --> 00:40:38,249
<i>Now, the contract.</i>

661
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:40,919
<i>You and your partner
start tomorrow.</i>

662
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:43,687
<i>The target will be
lured to this window.</i>

663
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:46,823
<i>It faces the apartment
where you will be waiting.</i>

664
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:48,959
<i>One shot to the head.</i>

665
00:40:48,961 --> 00:40:51,796
<i>A clean kill. No mistakes.</i>

666
00:40:51,798 --> 00:40:57,134
<i>Now, I have another deal,
a side part, for you.</i>

667
00:40:57,136 --> 00:40:59,136
<i>Okay, go on.</i>

668
00:40:59,138 --> 00:41:01,138
<i>When you've
executed the contract,</i>

669
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:05,642
<i>I want you
to kill your partner.</i>

670
00:41:05,644 --> 00:41:07,044
Why?

671
00:41:07,046 --> 00:41:08,580
<i>I don't like crowds.</i>

672
00:41:08,582 --> 00:41:12,649
<i>And I like loyalty I can buy.</i>

673
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:16,022
<i>Double the original offer,
in cash.</i>

674
00:41:18,925 --> 00:41:22,026
What you want,
his head on a silver platter?

675
00:41:22,028 --> 00:41:25,997
<i>His ID papers and
trigger finger will suffice.</i>

676
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:29,801
<i>I'm offering you double
the money and a one way split.</i>

677
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:34,037
<i>I believe I can trust
your mercenary greed.</i>

678
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:36,943
<i>Now, do we have a deal?</i>

679
00:41:38,845 --> 00:41:40,211
Yeah.

680
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:41,912
Consider it done.

681
00:41:41,914 --> 00:41:44,017
<i>Good.</i>

682
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:50,787
Where'd you get ahold
of that there thing?

683
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:53,091
Where the fuck
did you get that?

684
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,093
Stop it, Alfred.
He's just the messenger.

685
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,694
Who is about to get very shot
on the count of three.

686
00:41:57,696 --> 00:41:59,997
One, two...

687
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:02,933
Locker!
Locker in the terminal!

688
00:42:02,935 --> 00:42:05,035
Black briefcase.

689
00:42:05,037 --> 00:42:06,104
Note inside.

690
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,071
A man...
A man paid me.

691
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:10,908
An envelope with money.

692
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,176
Please don't kill me!

693
00:42:12,178 --> 00:42:14,013
Three.

694
00:42:17,182 --> 00:42:19,750
Now fuck off.

695
00:42:19,752 --> 00:42:21,220
Go on.

696
00:42:25,691 --> 00:42:27,193
Fuck!

697
00:42:29,896 --> 00:42:33,698
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

698
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
Fucker!

699
00:42:38,238 --> 00:42:40,171
Feel better?

700
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:45,843
It's all bullshit, isn't it?

701
00:42:45,845 --> 00:42:48,379
No job, no hit.

702
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:50,250
Oh, no, handsome.

703
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:55,388
There most definitely was a hit.

704
00:42:57,856 --> 00:42:59,022
Me?

705
00:42:59,024 --> 00:43:00,792
Not anymore.

706
00:43:00,794 --> 00:43:03,129
We can find a new target.

707
00:43:04,897 --> 00:43:06,296
We?

708
00:43:06,298 --> 00:43:09,200
Now tell me something,
sugarplum.

709
00:43:09,202 --> 00:43:12,837
Why should I trust you, eh?

710
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:16,207
Aren't you part of
this whole conspiracy?

711
00:43:16,209 --> 00:43:18,879
I told you.

712
00:43:19,946 --> 00:43:22,279
I like you.

713
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:25,151
I need someone
to butter my buns for.

714
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:35,826
Well, I suppose I do need
a new partner now, don't I?

715
00:43:35,828 --> 00:43:40,464
My old one seems to have
become rather untrustworthy.

716
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:42,433
But I will warn you, Alfred.

717
00:43:42,435 --> 00:43:45,870
I'll need a firm hand and a
regular lash of the tongue.

718
00:43:45,872 --> 00:43:49,272
I can't wait
to have you under me.

719
00:43:49,274 --> 00:43:51,008
Good.

720
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:54,078
Let's have a cup of tea
and plot our bloody revenge.

721
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:58,482
You tidy that up.
I'll put the kettle on...

722
00:43:58,484 --> 00:43:59,919
partner.

723
00:44:10,196 --> 00:44:13,897
The way I see it,
you've got two options.

724
00:44:13,899 --> 00:44:14,932
Go on.

725
00:44:14,934 --> 00:44:16,834
Option A: suicide.

726
00:44:16,836 --> 00:44:18,502
I see. And B?

727
00:44:18,504 --> 00:44:21,037
Well, you've got to hear
the case for Option A first.

728
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:23,207
- I do?
- You do.

729
00:44:23,209 --> 00:44:24,475
I'm all ears.

730
00:44:24,477 --> 00:44:26,310
- You're dying.
- Apparently.

731
00:44:26,312 --> 00:44:28,912
- You're not happy about it.
- Not really.

732
00:44:28,914 --> 00:44:30,413
You're miserable, touchy.

733
00:44:30,415 --> 00:44:32,783
Quite frankly,
not great company.

734
00:44:32,785 --> 00:44:34,051
Oh, thank you.

735
00:44:34,053 --> 00:44:35,553
Want my advice?

736
00:44:35,555 --> 00:44:36,890
No.

737
00:44:38,857 --> 00:44:40,558
Just end it.

738
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,361
Have you ever considered
counseling?

739
00:44:43,363 --> 00:44:45,062
Every minute of every day,

740
00:44:45,064 --> 00:44:46,830
you're bombarded with
a series of hazardous

741
00:44:46,832 --> 00:44:49,566
and potentially life-ending
situations to choose from.

742
00:44:49,568 --> 00:44:51,569
Jump in front of a bus.

743
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:53,136
Have a bath with your toaster.

744
00:44:53,138 --> 00:44:54,504
Fall on your butter knife.

745
00:44:54,506 --> 00:44:56,506
Tall buildings,
rivers, bridges, trains.

746
00:44:56,508 --> 00:44:58,142
There are more ways
to end your life

747
00:44:58,144 --> 00:45:00,410
than there are ways to live it.

748
00:45:00,412 --> 00:45:02,412
All this pissing around
in train stations

749
00:45:02,414 --> 00:45:04,048
in the middle of the night
would be over.

750
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:07,484
End this nothing,
and all it takes is some balls.

751
00:45:07,486 --> 00:45:10,187
And my immortal soul?

752
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:11,923
Overrated.

753
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:14,457
Overrated?

754
00:45:14,459 --> 00:45:19,800
Have you done something to put
your immortal soul in jeopardy?

755
00:45:24,604 --> 00:45:28,939
Well, there you go then.
Nothing to worry about.

756
00:45:28,941 --> 00:45:30,174
Are you Catholic?

757
00:45:30,176 --> 00:45:31,375
Yeah.

758
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,412
Religious?

759
00:45:37,584 --> 00:45:40,984
Oh, fuck me.
Oh, sorry. Um...

760
00:45:40,986 --> 00:45:43,486
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

761
00:45:43,488 --> 00:45:45,923
To be honest, I can't recall
the last time I took confession.

762
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:49,926
I think it's more than 10,
but less than 20.

763
00:45:49,928 --> 00:45:51,194
Days?

764
00:45:51,196 --> 00:45:55,265
Months?
Not years, surely.

765
00:45:55,267 --> 00:45:57,000
Don't get pissed off at me
for telling you the truth.

766
00:45:57,002 --> 00:45:58,970
That's just mean.

767
00:45:58,972 --> 00:46:01,104
If I'd known you were like this,
I would've just said three days

768
00:46:01,106 --> 00:46:03,441
and taken my chances
with the Almighty.

769
00:46:03,443 --> 00:46:05,278
Sorry.

770
00:46:06,613 --> 00:46:09,082
That was uncalled for.
I apologize.

771
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:13,484
Are you still there?

772
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,955
I know you're there.
I can smell sherry.

773
00:46:19,158 --> 00:46:20,558
Define religious.

774
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,995
Lolly?

775
00:46:23,562 --> 00:46:26,464
I'll take that
as a big fat no.

776
00:46:26,466 --> 00:46:28,933
Maybe it's divine retribution.

777
00:46:28,935 --> 00:46:31,602
Oh, yeah, that sounds tasty.

778
00:46:31,604 --> 00:46:34,604
You know,
my sins revisiting me

779
00:46:34,606 --> 00:46:37,375
and my past
coming back to haunt me...

780
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,977
I'm all ears, William.

781
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:43,050
Let me hear your confession.

782
00:46:51,457 --> 00:46:53,993
Repent and thou shalt be saved!

783
00:46:55,528 --> 00:46:57,194
That's not even from the Bible.

784
00:46:57,196 --> 00:46:59,062
Okay, that is the graffiti

785
00:46:59,064 --> 00:47:01,933
that's written on the bus stop
opposite the terminal.

786
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:03,500
That's disappointing.

787
00:47:03,502 --> 00:47:06,002
That's pretty much my entire
knowledge of scripture.

788
00:47:06,004 --> 00:47:08,038
Try this one:
Repent, turn back,

789
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,374
and thy sins
will be blotted out.

790
00:47:10,376 --> 00:47:12,209
Not really as catchy, is it?

791
00:47:14,046 --> 00:47:15,680
How's my case
for suicide progressing?

792
00:47:15,682 --> 00:47:17,214
Am I quaking your foundations?

793
00:47:17,216 --> 00:47:19,116
You're giving me a headache.

794
00:47:19,118 --> 00:47:21,118
Oh, how's this for a headache?

795
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,687
Take a pencil,
jam into tabletop,

796
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:27,024
slam head down onto pencil,
dead in five seconds.

797
00:47:27,026 --> 00:47:28,725
- That's foul.
- Isn't it?

798
00:47:28,727 --> 00:47:30,261
And every time
I suggest this to someone,

799
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:31,729
they think it goes
up your nose.

800
00:47:31,731 --> 00:47:33,497
You've suggested this
more than once?

801
00:47:33,499 --> 00:47:35,499
It can't go up your nose.
That's impossible.

802
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:37,468
Think about
the trajectory involved.

803
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,102
It would go in your eyeball,
right?

804
00:47:39,104 --> 00:47:40,738
Through the socket,
into your brain.

805
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,441
I... Well, it depends on the
angle of the head, I suppose.

806
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:46,142
Let's test the theory.

807
00:47:46,144 --> 00:47:49,013
It's not very sharp, is it?

808
00:47:49,015 --> 00:47:50,117
Use your fancy pen then.

809
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,517
It's heavier.

810
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:56,419
Nib's sharper than yours.

811
00:47:56,421 --> 00:47:59,458
Probably get it further into
the table, better purchase.

812
00:48:01,127 --> 00:48:03,194
It would feel more proper,
wouldn't it?

813
00:48:03,196 --> 00:48:04,562
More ceremonial.

814
00:48:04,564 --> 00:48:08,064
A pen does have more purpose
than a pencil.

815
00:48:08,066 --> 00:48:09,232
More stature.

816
00:48:09,234 --> 00:48:10,700
Definitely a better choice.

817
00:48:10,702 --> 00:48:13,671
Definitely,
and how resonantly poetic.

818
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:17,040
The English professor found
impaled on his own fountain pen.

819
00:48:17,042 --> 00:48:18,042
It's epic.

820
00:48:18,044 --> 00:48:19,075
It's inspired.

821
00:48:19,077 --> 00:48:20,410
We've cracked it!

822
00:48:20,412 --> 00:48:24,080
Time, place, method,
it's all there.

823
00:48:24,082 --> 00:48:26,082
Don't you think
it'd be a bit painful?

824
00:48:26,084 --> 00:48:27,584
You're missing the point.

825
00:48:27,586 --> 00:48:29,053
Hmm?

826
00:48:29,055 --> 00:48:30,620
Get it?

827
00:48:30,622 --> 00:48:32,790
- Brilliant.
- God, you're not very keen.

828
00:48:32,792 --> 00:48:34,524
Do you want to
kill yourself or not?

829
00:48:34,526 --> 00:48:35,725
I'm not so sure now.

830
00:48:35,727 --> 00:48:37,660
Oh, pathetic.

831
00:48:37,662 --> 00:48:39,662
Can I have that pen then?
I never had one like that.

832
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:41,232
- No.
- Why?

833
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:43,566
Because it's mine.

834
00:48:43,568 --> 00:48:45,201
Thought you were
about to top yourself?

835
00:48:45,203 --> 00:48:46,736
What do you need a pen for?

836
00:48:46,738 --> 00:48:48,705
Come on, please. It'll be
like you left it for me.

837
00:48:48,707 --> 00:48:50,540
- Bequeathed it, not left.
- Oh, my God.

838
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:52,308
Shut up!
I'm taking the pen.

839
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:54,278
You've got no use for it,
and I want it.

840
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,446
Here, you can have my pencil
to make up for your loss, okay?

841
00:48:56,448 --> 00:48:58,551
Done, swapped, over.

842
00:49:20,106 --> 00:49:22,709
<i>How long have
we been stuck in here?</i>

843
00:49:24,843 --> 00:49:29,145
<i>12 days, 13 hours,
and 27 minutes. Why?</i>

844
00:49:29,147 --> 00:49:30,714
<i>Just wondering.</i>

845
00:49:30,716 --> 00:49:32,383
<i>You missing
your bottle blonde?</i>

846
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:34,852
Geez, you're like
a hormonal teenager.

847
00:49:34,854 --> 00:49:37,654
She's gonna be the death of you,
that fucking girl.

848
00:49:37,656 --> 00:49:39,823
- Cards.
- Yeah?

849
00:49:39,825 --> 00:49:42,493
- Great. Hold 'em.
- Three-card brag.

850
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:44,361
Fuck off.
That's a pouf's game.

851
00:49:44,363 --> 00:49:46,162
Fine. Hold 'em it is.

852
00:49:46,164 --> 00:49:47,865
Fair enough. Let's go!

853
00:49:47,867 --> 00:49:49,466
That's more like it.

854
00:49:49,468 --> 00:49:51,102
Oh, give 'em here.

855
00:49:51,104 --> 00:49:52,368
You're gonna fucking
hurt yourself. Come on.

856
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:53,807
Just give 'em to me.

857
00:49:55,774 --> 00:49:57,274
For fuck's sake, Alf.

858
00:49:57,276 --> 00:49:59,745
There's fucking
barely half a deck.

859
00:50:03,515 --> 00:50:05,316
We could always play snap.

860
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:07,620
I'll snap your fucking neck
in a minute!

861
00:50:09,856 --> 00:50:12,689
How do you play solitaire?

862
00:50:12,691 --> 00:50:16,560
Quietly, on your own,
in the other fucking room.

863
00:50:16,562 --> 00:50:19,162
- You really are becoming a...
- Yeah, a fucking liability.

864
00:50:19,164 --> 00:50:21,067
I know. Hear it all the time.

865
00:50:26,772 --> 00:50:29,540
Boss, look at this.

866
00:50:29,542 --> 00:50:30,841
What is it?

867
00:50:30,843 --> 00:50:32,609
Something for me
to beat you to death with?

868
00:50:32,611 --> 00:50:33,680
No.

869
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,250
"The time has come,
the walrus said,

870
00:50:39,252 --> 00:50:40,850
to talk of many things.

871
00:50:40,852 --> 00:50:45,622
<i>Of shoes
and ships and sealing wax,</i>

872
00:50:45,624 --> 00:50:47,658
of cabbages and kings."

873
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:52,165
"And why the sea is boiling hot
and whether pigs have wings."

874
00:50:53,499 --> 00:50:54,832
I don't get it.

875
00:50:54,834 --> 00:50:57,167
It's gibberish.

876
00:50:57,169 --> 00:50:59,470
It's all like this,
the whole bloody book.

877
00:50:59,472 --> 00:51:01,337
It's just fucking drivel.

878
00:51:01,339 --> 00:51:04,375
Well, I'm sure Lewis Carroll
will be suitably apologetic

879
00:51:04,377 --> 00:51:07,544
when he finds out
how upset you are.

880
00:51:07,546 --> 00:51:09,647
Why don't you fuck off
into the other room

881
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,818
and leave me alone, eh?

882
00:51:31,336 --> 00:51:33,370
Want a drink?

883
00:51:33,372 --> 00:51:35,272
A proper drink, I mean.

884
00:51:35,274 --> 00:51:37,144
Oh, no doubt.

885
00:51:40,946 --> 00:51:43,714
Bill, it's time
we explore Option B.

886
00:51:43,716 --> 00:51:44,982
Oh, goody, there's more.

887
00:51:44,984 --> 00:51:46,250
There is.

888
00:51:46,252 --> 00:51:49,720
Option B: assisted suicide.

889
00:51:50,957 --> 00:51:53,424
I believe they call that
"euthanasia."

890
00:51:53,426 --> 00:51:54,758
Eutha-what?

891
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,595
It was very popular at one time
with the Swiss.

892
00:51:57,597 --> 00:51:58,629
What's a Swiss?

893
00:52:00,499 --> 00:52:01,999
Doesn't matter.

894
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:03,767
All I'm saying is,

895
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:06,236
if you haven't got the peanuts
to do it yourself,

896
00:52:06,238 --> 00:52:08,238
just get someone
to do it for you.

897
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,307
Are you saying I take
a contract out on myself?

898
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:12,008
Exactly.

899
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,444
Do they have an assassins
section in the classifieds?

900
00:52:14,446 --> 00:52:16,680
"Wanted: tall, dark,
anonymous stranger.

901
00:52:16,682 --> 00:52:18,249
Must have own rifle."

902
00:52:18,251 --> 00:52:19,649
My new boyfriend's
a contract killer.

903
00:52:23,256 --> 00:52:24,955
And, talk about
getting lucky,

904
00:52:24,957 --> 00:52:26,357
he's getting off
a job today.

905
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:27,924
Serendipity, indeed.

906
00:52:27,926 --> 00:52:29,859
We could give him
a brief, you know,

907
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:31,962
suggest a few ways
you wouldn't mind being killed,

908
00:52:31,964 --> 00:52:34,365
let him pick the best one.

909
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:36,267
Try this on for size.

910
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:39,303
You're just going about your
daily business, then one day,

911
00:52:39,305 --> 00:52:41,473
you're on your way home from
a long day in the classroom...

912
00:52:42,607 --> 00:52:44,741
Shot in the head.

913
00:52:44,743 --> 00:52:46,709
Last thing
you would've expected.

914
00:52:46,711 --> 00:52:49,479
I think it's safe to say
if I'd paid somebody to kill me,

915
00:52:49,481 --> 00:52:52,616
I'd be expecting to be killed
most of the time.

916
00:52:52,618 --> 00:52:55,551
You just have to, you know,
try not to think about it.

917
00:52:55,553 --> 00:52:57,854
- Oh, okay, I'll do that then.
- Right.

918
00:52:57,856 --> 00:52:59,689
Can we bank long distance
head shots then?

919
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:01,825
Quick, anonymous, painless.

920
00:53:01,827 --> 00:53:03,426
- Sounds like a keeper.
- Great.

921
00:53:03,428 --> 00:53:04,895
Let's brainstorm
a few more ways to die.

922
00:53:04,897 --> 00:53:05,865
Let's!

923
00:53:09,669 --> 00:53:11,769
- Stabbing?
- No, I don't like knives.

924
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,037
It sounds very,
sort of messy and painful.

925
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:16,439
That's the sort of thing
he's gonna need to know.

926
00:53:16,441 --> 00:53:18,642
- Who?
- Our possibly fictitious,

927
00:53:18,644 --> 00:53:19,910
but possibly real hit man,

928
00:53:19,912 --> 00:53:20,977
who happens to be
my new boyfriend.

929
00:53:20,979 --> 00:53:22,578
Oh, okay.

930
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,948
Ooh, what about a hit and run?

931
00:53:30,656 --> 00:53:33,589
Oh, now, I have a problem
with that.

932
00:53:33,591 --> 00:53:35,692
- Go on.
- What if I just get mangled?

933
00:53:35,694 --> 00:53:38,861
He'd have to reverse
back over me.

934
00:53:38,863 --> 00:53:41,098
That's just horrifying.

935
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,933
Hmm.

936
00:53:42,935 --> 00:53:45,336
- Pushing?
- I don't follow.

937
00:53:45,338 --> 00:53:47,337
Off a tall building,
for the sake of argument,

938
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,406
or in front of a train.

939
00:53:49,408 --> 00:53:53,644
I must say I have explored
the idea of trains somewhat.

940
00:53:53,646 --> 00:53:55,781
Hey!

941
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:00,084
Short, sticky, and sweet.
Before you know it,

942
00:54:00,086 --> 00:54:02,352
you're strawberry jam
and dental fillings.

943
00:54:02,354 --> 00:54:03,921
You really can
paint a picture, Annie.

944
00:54:03,923 --> 00:54:05,823
Only downside's the whole
closed casket thing.

945
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,758
Granted, but I am starting
to like the idea of falling.

946
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,894
It sounds almost accidental.

947
00:54:10,896 --> 00:54:12,763
Can we bank it, pushing?

948
00:54:12,765 --> 00:54:14,430
Yeah, let's have it.

949
00:54:14,432 --> 00:54:16,066
To imminent death.

950
00:54:16,068 --> 00:54:17,667
To the 404.

951
00:54:31,484 --> 00:54:32,485
What's up?

952
00:54:33,919 --> 00:54:35,118
What?

953
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,854
Is there anything
you want to say?

954
00:54:37,856 --> 00:54:39,325
No.

955
00:54:48,401 --> 00:54:49,866
I'm seriously fucking bored.

956
00:54:49,868 --> 00:54:51,535
You want to play a game?

957
00:54:51,537 --> 00:54:53,569
Do I look like I play
Snakes and Ladders to you?

958
00:54:53,571 --> 00:54:55,675
Well, you did do that jigsaw.

959
00:54:58,510 --> 00:54:59,709
I fucking hate puzzles.

960
00:54:59,711 --> 00:55:01,547
You did do that crossword book.

961
00:55:03,182 --> 00:55:05,084
- You trying to be funny?
- What about chess?

962
00:55:07,952 --> 00:55:10,654
- Are you trying to be funny?
- No, Boss.

963
00:55:10,656 --> 00:55:13,656
So I don't have to come over and
teach you some fucking manners.

964
00:55:13,658 --> 00:55:15,158
- No, Boss.
- Because if I do

965
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,729
you're gonna fucking regret it,
you understand me?

966
00:55:18,731 --> 00:55:20,499
Yes, Boss.

967
00:55:26,604 --> 00:55:27,539
Good.

968
00:55:31,577 --> 00:55:34,144
Don't fancy Monopoly then?

969
00:55:34,146 --> 00:55:36,647
God, keep it up.

970
00:55:36,649 --> 00:55:39,683
I'm going to put you six feet
under the fucking ground, mate.

971
00:55:39,685 --> 00:55:42,122
Are you?

972
00:55:43,955 --> 00:55:46,156
You know, I don't know
why I bother on you.

973
00:55:46,158 --> 00:55:48,459
I should just shoot you
in the face,

974
00:55:48,461 --> 00:55:49,859
get myself another apprentice.

975
00:55:49,861 --> 00:55:51,928
I thought I was
a junior partner.

976
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:55,799
Oh, that's just the flash way
of saying "apprentice."

977
00:55:55,801 --> 00:55:57,033
I'm a valuable asset.

978
00:55:57,035 --> 00:55:59,903
You're a fucking liability.

979
00:55:59,905 --> 00:56:02,538
I already told you what I do
with fucking liabilities.

980
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:05,107
If it wasn't for me,
who'd make the tea,

981
00:56:05,109 --> 00:56:07,678
collect the cash,
sort the jobs?

982
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,716
You know, do the fucking work!

983
00:56:13,752 --> 00:56:16,456
Good lad.
Now you're getting it.

984
00:56:38,843 --> 00:56:41,111
Oh, cracking.

985
00:56:41,113 --> 00:56:43,247
Pathetic fallacy.

986
00:56:43,249 --> 00:56:45,249
Whinging librarian.

987
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:47,149
Excuse me?

988
00:56:47,151 --> 00:56:50,153
No, that's what that's called,
when emotional turmoil

989
00:56:50,155 --> 00:56:52,723
is reflected
in tangible surroundings.

990
00:56:52,725 --> 00:56:56,692
Like two lovers go their
separate ways in a rainstorm,

991
00:56:56,694 --> 00:56:59,962
or lightning strikes
as the murderer's revealed.

992
00:56:59,964 --> 00:57:01,564
It adds gravitas.

993
00:57:01,566 --> 00:57:03,165
It would hardly be
as nerve-wracking

994
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:05,002
if the serial killer
stabbed his victim to death

995
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,569
in a sunny park, would it?

996
00:57:06,571 --> 00:57:10,707
Much better in a dark alley
in a mist.

997
00:57:10,709 --> 00:57:14,310
My God, you are wasted
as a teacher.

998
00:57:14,312 --> 00:57:17,080
You should be published.

999
00:57:17,082 --> 00:57:18,749
You should be preaching.

1000
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:21,183
You should be inciting
bloody revolution.

1001
00:57:21,185 --> 00:57:23,854
And yet here I am,
a lamenting English teacher

1002
00:57:23,856 --> 00:57:26,022
coughing his spleen
out through his nose,

1003
00:57:26,024 --> 00:57:29,258
wishing the earth
would swallow him whole.

1004
00:57:36,135 --> 00:57:37,537
Come with me.

1005
00:57:39,972 --> 00:57:41,107
Really?

1006
00:57:42,207 --> 00:57:43,243
Bill!

1007
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,515
Oh!

1008
00:57:56,287 --> 00:57:58,087
Where are we going?

1009
00:57:58,089 --> 00:58:02,625
To explore gravitas
and pathetic fallacy.

1010
00:58:02,627 --> 00:58:04,062
Chop, chop!

1011
00:58:10,903 --> 00:58:12,935
Well, this seems
like a great idea.

1012
00:58:12,937 --> 00:58:16,372
Come on, Bill.
Where's your sense of adventure?

1013
00:58:16,374 --> 00:58:19,711
Warm and dry
and congealing with my coffee.

1014
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:41,365
What the hell is that?

1015
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:43,100
It's an old ventilation shaft

1016
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,301
from when the city actually
used to work properly.

1017
00:58:45,303 --> 00:58:47,069
It's condemned now.

1018
00:58:47,071 --> 00:58:49,872
Just a hole
dropping into nowhere.

1019
00:58:49,874 --> 00:58:53,910
Down and down and down.

1020
00:58:53,912 --> 00:58:56,979
Well, that's just about the most
terrifying thing I've ever seen.

1021
00:58:56,981 --> 00:58:58,714
You come here often, do you?

1022
00:58:58,716 --> 00:59:01,151
Oh, yes, I love it here.

1023
00:59:01,153 --> 00:59:03,754
- Here, come stand on the edge.
- No, I...

1024
00:59:03,756 --> 00:59:05,692
Close your eyes.

1025
00:59:06,925 --> 00:59:09,162
Feels amazing.

1026
00:59:10,729 --> 00:59:13,663
Annie, come on back.

1027
00:59:13,665 --> 00:59:14,798
Oh, my God!

1028
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:21,437
Well?

1029
00:59:21,439 --> 00:59:23,173
Well, what?

1030
00:59:23,175 --> 00:59:25,174
You said you wanted the earth
to swallow you whole

1031
00:59:25,176 --> 00:59:26,877
not five minutes ago.

1032
00:59:26,879 --> 00:59:28,278
There you go.

1033
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,982
You're welcome.

1034
00:59:31,249 --> 00:59:32,816
You want me to jump in there?

1035
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:34,316
Pathetic fallacy.

1036
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:36,819
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

1037
00:59:36,821 --> 00:59:39,756
Emotional turmoil reflected
in tangible surroundings.

1038
00:59:39,758 --> 00:59:41,457
I'm in a deep, dark hole.

1039
00:59:41,459 --> 00:59:43,794
It's perfect.

1040
00:59:43,796 --> 00:59:45,261
Let's test your gravitas.

1041
00:59:45,263 --> 00:59:48,031
- Or gravity, more like.
- Exactly!

1042
00:59:48,033 --> 00:59:50,399
Look, I'm not gonna throw
myself into a yawning chasm

1043
00:59:50,401 --> 00:59:52,269
just because it fits neatly
into a metaphor!

1044
00:59:52,271 --> 00:59:55,004
Why not?
Quick, clean, painless.

1045
00:59:55,006 --> 00:59:56,839
Poetically resonant.

1046
00:59:56,841 --> 00:59:59,709
You are insane, certifiably.

1047
00:59:59,711 --> 01:00:01,111
Unquestionably.
You get close to the edge,

1048
01:00:01,113 --> 01:00:02,245
and then I can push you...

1049
01:00:02,247 --> 01:00:04,781
Time out! Time out, okay?

1050
01:00:04,783 --> 01:00:06,719
Okay, fine, fine.

1051
01:00:10,122 --> 01:00:12,388
What the fuck was that?

1052
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:14,057
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

1053
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:16,125
What is the worst that
could've happened, Bill?

1054
01:00:16,127 --> 01:00:18,828
You'd be dead.
It would all be over.

1055
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:20,897
No more pain,
no more suffering.

1056
01:00:20,899 --> 01:00:22,899
No more waiting for a train
that isn't coming.

1057
01:00:22,901 --> 01:00:25,301
What if I had just let you fall?

1058
01:00:25,303 --> 01:00:27,136
None of this would be happening.

1059
01:00:27,138 --> 01:00:30,040
This conversation,
your smoldering anger,

1060
01:00:30,042 --> 01:00:32,241
your eloquent
bloody resentment.

1061
01:00:32,243 --> 01:00:33,843
Nothing.

1062
01:00:33,845 --> 01:00:36,412
Not like that.
I do not want to go like that.

1063
01:00:36,414 --> 01:00:38,214
Like what, Bill?

1064
01:00:38,216 --> 01:00:41,921
Trains, cars, gunshots,
it's all the same end product.

1065
01:00:44,923 --> 01:00:48,390
I think the question
really is,

1066
01:00:48,392 --> 01:00:52,294
do you want to go at all?

1067
01:00:52,296 --> 01:00:56,366
Standing on the edge really
makes you think, doesn't it?

1068
01:00:56,368 --> 01:00:58,033
I'll shoot you in the face.

1069
01:00:58,035 --> 01:01:01,037
I wish you bloody would,
but you won't.

1070
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:05,075
Stop thinking, Bill.

1071
01:01:05,077 --> 01:01:08,011
Stop reasoning.

1072
01:01:08,013 --> 01:01:10,446
Just close your eyes.

1073
01:01:10,448 --> 01:01:14,950
Take a last breath
and just walk.

1074
01:01:18,856 --> 01:01:20,857
Clock's ticking.

1075
01:01:20,859 --> 01:01:22,424
It's quiet out there.

1076
01:01:22,426 --> 01:01:25,298
It's like
a fucking apocalypse.

1077
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:36,506
Just one round.

1078
01:01:36,508 --> 01:01:37,841
What?

1079
01:01:37,843 --> 01:01:39,875
I said there's no one around.

1080
01:01:39,877 --> 01:01:41,481
Yeah, it's dead.

1081
01:01:43,314 --> 01:01:46,049
Like a corpse.

1082
01:01:53,258 --> 01:01:54,491
Was that loaded?

1083
01:01:56,127 --> 01:01:57,593
Yeah.

1084
01:01:57,595 --> 01:01:59,197
You're dead.

1085
01:02:04,269 --> 01:02:06,071
Milk, two sugars.

1086
01:02:07,138 --> 01:02:09,175
What are you waiting for?

1087
01:02:26,457 --> 01:02:27,894
That's it.

1088
01:02:38,336 --> 01:02:40,337
No. No, I can't.

1089
01:02:42,406 --> 01:02:44,843
How disappointing.

1090
01:02:47,578 --> 01:02:49,145
Disappointing?

1091
01:02:51,515 --> 01:02:54,084
Disappointing?

1092
01:02:54,086 --> 01:02:56,888
This is all a fucking game
to you, isn't it?

1093
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:01,491
Get this through
your little skull, okay?

1094
01:03:01,493 --> 01:03:03,026
I am dying.

1095
01:03:03,028 --> 01:03:05,395
I am...
I am going to die!

1096
01:03:05,397 --> 01:03:07,930
To me, all this is real!

1097
01:03:07,932 --> 01:03:11,234
The fucking hole
in the ground is real!

1098
01:03:11,236 --> 01:03:15,537
I'm not standing on the edge.
I am already falling down!

1099
01:03:15,539 --> 01:03:18,375
What are you, like, 23, 24?

1100
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:21,444
Young, fit as a fiddle,
immortal?

1101
01:03:21,446 --> 01:03:23,613
All your death nonsense
is exactly that.

1102
01:03:23,615 --> 01:03:26,683
A load of fucking nonsense!

1103
01:03:26,685 --> 01:03:30,319
Step into the light more,
enjoy nice things.

1104
01:03:30,321 --> 01:03:32,522
Stop skulking around
big holes in the ground

1105
01:03:32,524 --> 01:03:35,225
and wasting your life
in all-night cafes.

1106
01:03:35,227 --> 01:03:38,928
Enough with the facade,
this idle fucking fantasy!

1107
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:41,564
Go on, Bill. Go on, rage.

1108
01:03:41,566 --> 01:03:44,466
Rage against the dying
of the fucking light!

1109
01:03:44,468 --> 01:03:46,972
Did all this death stuff
start when mommy died?

1110
01:03:48,372 --> 01:03:49,571
Ah, yeah.

1111
01:03:49,573 --> 01:03:52,308
What was it,
an absent father?

1112
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:53,977
A concerned priest, perhaps?

1113
01:03:53,979 --> 01:03:56,111
Did you find it was easier
to get attention

1114
01:03:56,113 --> 01:03:58,113
if you were the freak,
the weirdo,

1115
01:03:58,115 --> 01:04:02,151
the angel-faced kid
with a heart of darkness?

1116
01:04:02,153 --> 01:04:05,120
I bet you were a cutter,
weren't you?

1117
01:04:05,122 --> 01:04:07,189
I bet you loved
a good razor blade.

1118
01:04:07,191 --> 01:04:10,192
Somewhere obvious where
everyone could see the scars.

1119
01:04:10,194 --> 01:04:12,428
Did you have a little friend,
a little accomplice?

1120
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:14,698
Somebody you could go off
behind the bike shed with

1121
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,066
and burn each other
with cigarettes?

1122
01:04:17,068 --> 01:04:19,468
Another little orphan helper
built in your own image,

1123
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:21,370
the two of you
egging each other on?

1124
01:04:21,372 --> 01:04:24,040
Fuck! It's textbook, Annie!

1125
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:25,508
Textbook!

1126
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:27,977
You're two a penny!

1127
01:04:27,979 --> 01:04:29,578
I have taught dozens of you
over the years.

1128
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:34,183
I have known silly little girls
like you all my life!

1129
01:04:34,185 --> 01:04:39,522
Naughty, naughty little girls
just like you!

1130
01:04:43,095 --> 01:04:44,263
Naughty.

1131
01:04:48,232 --> 01:04:50,700
I just enjoy watching
you fidget when I say...

1132
01:04:50,702 --> 01:04:52,437
Naughty.

1133
01:04:54,339 --> 01:04:55,274
Gotcha.

1134
01:04:56,508 --> 01:04:57,643
Oh, God!

1135
01:04:59,577 --> 01:05:01,613
Have we met before?

1136
01:05:03,115 --> 01:05:05,080
You remember now.

1137
01:05:05,082 --> 01:05:07,116
Don't you,
Mr. Braithwaite?

1138
01:05:07,118 --> 01:05:09,752
I think I would definitely
remember you if we'd met before.

1139
01:05:09,754 --> 01:05:12,622
You would thing so,
wouldn't you?

1140
01:05:12,624 --> 01:05:15,660
You remember this
naughty little girl?

1141
01:05:17,328 --> 01:05:20,263
You remember punishing me,
Mr. B?

1142
01:05:20,265 --> 01:05:22,198
Silly, naughty little girls,
enough!

1143
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:25,567
Maybe it's divine retribution.
You know, my sins revisiting me.

1144
01:05:25,569 --> 01:05:27,136
I'm sorry.

1145
01:05:27,138 --> 01:05:31,107
After lights out,
our little secret.

1146
01:05:31,109 --> 01:05:34,580
Did something happen to you
as a child?

1147
01:05:36,714 --> 01:05:40,151
I've waited all night
for you to remember me.

1148
01:05:41,352 --> 01:05:43,819
All fucking night,

1149
01:05:43,821 --> 01:05:47,490
not two feet away,

1150
01:05:47,492 --> 01:05:51,394
just waiting for you
to connect the dots.

1151
01:05:51,396 --> 01:05:53,763
Do you wanna know why
you don't have the balls

1152
01:05:53,765 --> 01:05:57,133
to kill yourself,
Mr. Braithwaite?

1153
01:05:57,135 --> 01:06:01,604
Because you know exactly where
you're going when you die.

1154
01:06:05,209 --> 01:06:08,611
Orphans always make the best
victims, don't they, William?

1155
01:06:08,613 --> 01:06:10,312
But chalk-stained fingers
leave indelible marks

1156
01:06:10,314 --> 01:06:12,150
on little girls' panties.

1157
01:06:13,484 --> 01:06:16,088
Consider this
divine retribution.

1158
01:06:24,729 --> 01:06:26,665
Burn in hell.

1159
01:06:35,841 --> 01:06:39,642
Was that gun loaded,
the one you pointed at me?

1160
01:06:39,644 --> 01:06:42,444
<i>Impossible to say
either way.</i>

1161
01:06:45,617 --> 01:06:47,716
- What's that?
- It's the fucking phone.

1162
01:06:47,718 --> 01:06:48,686
All right.

1163
01:06:53,725 --> 01:06:55,290
Yes?

1164
01:06:55,292 --> 01:06:57,359
Okay.

1165
01:06:57,361 --> 01:06:58,329
Got it.

1166
01:07:01,533 --> 01:07:03,669
That was Mr. fucking Franklin.
It's on.

1167
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:12,745
Yeah.

1168
01:07:20,385 --> 01:07:21,750
Yes?

1169
01:07:21,752 --> 01:07:24,256
<i>Is this phone in range?</i>

1170
01:07:28,526 --> 01:07:30,292
Where's the fucking target?

1171
01:07:30,294 --> 01:07:31,828
Why aren't you
taking a shot?

1172
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:33,562
There is no shot.

1173
01:07:33,564 --> 01:07:35,298
Take the shot, Vince.
What's the problem?

1174
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,635
Shut up!

1175
01:07:39,271 --> 01:07:40,770
Bottle blonde!

1176
01:07:40,772 --> 01:07:42,805
Fuck hell's she doing here?

1177
01:07:42,807 --> 01:07:45,176
<i>Gotcha.</i>

1178
01:07:49,414 --> 01:07:51,749
Put the gun down, Boss.

1179
01:07:59,624 --> 01:08:01,491
What the fucking hell's
going on?

1180
01:08:01,493 --> 01:08:04,894
This is what we call
in the trade "a double-cross."

1181
01:08:04,896 --> 01:08:07,229
<i>Now put the gun down.</i>

1182
01:08:07,231 --> 01:08:10,502
<i>And now sit at the table,
hands where I can see them.</i>

1183
01:08:15,307 --> 01:08:16,438
You all right, bottle blonde?

1184
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,340
<i>Took your time, sweetheart.</i>

1185
01:08:18,342 --> 01:08:20,343
<i>Thought you actually were
gonna let him have a pop at me.</i>

1186
01:08:20,345 --> 01:08:22,978
Oh, I think he's been trying
that quite enough recently.

1187
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:24,279
<i>Stop it, Alfred.</i>

1188
01:08:24,281 --> 01:08:25,415
Don't be naughty.

1189
01:08:25,417 --> 01:08:26,782
<i>Sorry, sugarplum.</i>

1190
01:08:26,784 --> 01:08:28,751
Now get yourself over here.

1191
01:08:28,753 --> 01:08:31,757
Come and savor
this moment with me.

1192
01:08:35,293 --> 01:08:37,426
I see you finally lost
your virginity then.

1193
01:08:37,428 --> 01:08:39,431
Congratulations.

1194
01:08:46,503 --> 01:08:47,839
Hi, handsome.

1195
01:08:51,976 --> 01:08:53,443
You smell different.

1196
01:08:53,445 --> 01:08:54,844
My new perfume.

1197
01:08:54,846 --> 01:08:56,411
It's intoxicating.

1198
01:08:56,413 --> 01:08:58,413
Oh, Jesus Christ, kill me now.

1199
01:08:58,415 --> 01:08:59,482
With pleasure.

1200
01:08:59,484 --> 01:09:02,618
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1201
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:04,687
Tell me something.

1202
01:09:04,689 --> 01:09:06,525
What have I ever
done to you, eh?

1203
01:09:08,693 --> 01:09:10,960
Vincent Escariot.

1204
01:09:10,962 --> 01:09:12,894
Tut, tut, tut.

1205
01:09:12,896 --> 01:09:14,630
You'd sell your own partner
down the river

1206
01:09:14,632 --> 01:09:16,566
for 30 pieces of silver.

1207
01:09:16,568 --> 01:09:19,001
I like loyalty I can buy.

1208
01:09:19,003 --> 01:09:21,339
You traitor, you.

1209
01:09:22,841 --> 01:09:25,474
What the fuck's it got
to do with you?

1210
01:09:25,476 --> 01:09:29,011
Now, now, Vince,
don't be rude.

1211
01:09:29,013 --> 01:09:31,014
I think you've been
quite rude enough

1212
01:09:31,016 --> 01:09:32,982
to my other half recently.

1213
01:09:32,984 --> 01:09:34,983
Your girlfriend's doing all
your thinking now, is she?

1214
01:09:34,985 --> 01:09:37,487
Well, fuck you...

1215
01:09:37,489 --> 01:09:39,855
and your fucking whore.

1216
01:09:39,857 --> 01:09:43,059
Don't you misunderstand
the situation you're in

1217
01:09:43,061 --> 01:09:45,295
for one second, Vincent.

1218
01:09:45,297 --> 01:09:46,996
You'll keep a civil tongue
in your head,

1219
01:09:46,998 --> 01:09:48,598
or it won't be quick and easy.

1220
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,500
It'll be slow and messy.

1221
01:09:50,502 --> 01:09:53,368
You are a fucking
pain in my ass!

1222
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:54,636
As well as being
a double-crossing,

1223
01:09:54,638 --> 01:09:58,340
backstabbing,
turncoat traitor.

1224
01:09:58,342 --> 01:10:00,542
But guess what.

1225
01:10:00,544 --> 01:10:02,812
I've got a new partner now,
Vincent.

1226
01:10:02,814 --> 01:10:05,415
And unlike with you,

1227
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:08,951
I just love it
when she fucks me.

1228
01:10:08,953 --> 01:10:11,586
This is your doing,
isn't it, bottle blonde?

1229
01:10:11,588 --> 01:10:13,755
Oh, yes, Vincent.

1230
01:10:13,757 --> 01:10:16,024
I'm the master villain.

1231
01:10:16,026 --> 01:10:18,995
Fucking crazy.

1232
01:10:18,997 --> 01:10:22,098
The pair of you,
you're both mad, delusional.

1233
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,401
Fuck you
and your fucking whore!

1234
01:10:25,403 --> 01:10:28,307
You don't have to let him
talk to us like that, handsome.

1235
01:10:31,042 --> 01:10:32,910
No.

1236
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:40,886
Your eyes. I saw them...

1237
01:10:43,654 --> 01:10:46,022
Bye, Vince.

1238
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:52,064
- That was fun.
- It was brilliant.

1239
01:10:54,598 --> 01:10:57,367
Right. I need a shower
and a change of clothes,

1240
01:10:57,369 --> 01:10:59,434
and then I'm taking you
out to dinner.

1241
01:10:59,436 --> 01:11:00,702
My treat.

1242
01:11:00,704 --> 01:11:03,773
Our first proper date.

1243
01:11:03,775 --> 01:11:05,878
Bye-bye, sugarplum.

1244
01:11:11,449 --> 01:11:13,385
Bye, handsome.

1245
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:43,749
Ah! Cleaning service.

1246
01:11:45,516 --> 01:11:47,783
I'll have the works,
please, mate.

1247
01:11:47,785 --> 01:11:50,489
The full spit and polish.

1248
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:55,627
Here's a cherry on top.

1249
01:11:56,694 --> 01:11:59,461
Call it an apologetic token

1250
01:11:59,463 --> 01:12:02,467
for the little overreaction
the other night, eh?

1251
01:12:05,869 --> 01:12:09,140
See you later, Supe.

1252
01:12:17,515 --> 01:12:18,784
Ohh...

1253
01:12:30,794 --> 01:12:32,495
Hi, handsome.

1254
01:12:32,497 --> 01:12:34,098
Hello, sugarplum.

1255
01:12:39,904 --> 01:12:41,970
Did you get
your homework done?

1256
01:12:41,972 --> 01:12:44,740
- Top of the class.
- Smart girl!

1257
01:12:44,742 --> 01:12:47,643
I've got a little
surprise for you.

1258
01:12:47,645 --> 01:12:50,078
Are you wearing that stripper
getup under that red coat?

1259
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,516
Stockings, suspenders?

1260
01:12:54,785 --> 01:12:58,489
You know, you really do
have such a lovely jaw.

1261
01:13:01,758 --> 01:13:04,594
Wait right here.

1262
01:13:04,596 --> 01:13:06,464
Yeah.

1263
01:13:33,223 --> 01:13:34,193
Hello?

1264
01:13:43,066 --> 01:13:44,168
Sugarplum.

1265
01:13:47,105 --> 01:13:48,106
Sugarplum.

1266
01:13:51,275 --> 01:13:54,109
I really hate that nickname.

1267
01:13:54,111 --> 01:13:57,712
Drop the gun,
hands up where I can see them.

1268
01:13:57,714 --> 01:13:59,549
One wrong move, handsome,

1269
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:01,216
you'll have that gaping
exit wound in your face

1270
01:14:01,218 --> 01:14:03,219
we talked about.

1271
01:14:03,221 --> 01:14:04,756
Drop it.

1272
01:14:06,925 --> 01:14:08,526
Kick it away.

1273
01:14:10,861 --> 01:14:12,196
Good boy.

1274
01:14:13,664 --> 01:14:15,063
I thought we were partners.

1275
01:14:15,065 --> 01:14:16,767
I've already got a partner.

1276
01:14:18,302 --> 01:14:21,269
Cripple?

1277
01:14:21,271 --> 01:14:23,072
So all of this was, what?

1278
01:14:23,074 --> 01:14:26,175
An overelaborate scheme
perpetrated mercilessly upon you

1279
01:14:26,177 --> 01:14:29,144
by highly motivated, highly
intelligent individuals...

1280
01:14:29,146 --> 01:14:31,680
With a penchant
for amateur dramatics.

1281
01:14:31,682 --> 01:14:32,717
It's pronounced <i>penchant.</i>

1282
01:14:34,151 --> 01:14:36,719
You are correct, Alfred.

1283
01:14:36,721 --> 01:14:39,621
Two weeks you had me
in that fucking apartment,

1284
01:14:39,623 --> 01:14:42,858
waiting to kill someone
who was waiting to kill me.

1285
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,960
- Why?
- Because we like to have

1286
01:14:44,962 --> 01:14:46,895
all our dollies
lined up on the shelf.

1287
01:14:46,897 --> 01:14:48,197
Shit!

1288
01:14:48,199 --> 01:14:50,765
Our starving rats
locked in a cage,

1289
01:14:50,767 --> 01:14:53,238
tearing each other apart
just for our pleasure.

1290
01:14:54,771 --> 01:14:58,640
And... you never
really liked me?

1291
01:14:58,642 --> 01:15:00,846
Me? No.

1292
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:04,779
Has anyone ever told you

1293
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:07,215
that you are a two-faced,

1294
01:15:07,217 --> 01:15:09,885
treacherous, manipulative,

1295
01:15:09,887 --> 01:15:12,787
callous little bitch?

1296
01:15:12,789 --> 01:15:15,726
Oh, you have no idea.

1297
01:15:19,364 --> 01:15:23,001
Annie, darling, I don't
suppose you'd consider...

1298
01:15:26,837 --> 01:15:27,972
No.

1299
01:15:36,748 --> 01:15:39,648
Look, I know
you wanted to keep him,

1300
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:42,417
but we got bigger
fish to fry, okay?

1301
01:15:42,419 --> 01:15:45,623
I've got the ID papers.
Give me his gun.

1302
01:15:48,426 --> 01:15:51,093
Stand and deliver!

1303
01:15:51,095 --> 01:15:52,995
Oh, Christ!

1304
01:15:52,997 --> 01:15:55,200
You nearly gave me
a heart attack.

1305
01:15:57,935 --> 01:16:00,402
You're early.

1306
01:16:00,404 --> 01:16:02,203
Give me that gun.

1307
01:16:02,205 --> 01:16:04,309
Where'd you put Vincent?

1308
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:08,814
What you gonna do
with them both?

1309
01:16:11,048 --> 01:16:14,050
Can we chuck them
in the river?

1310
01:16:14,052 --> 01:16:15,287
No.

1311
01:16:17,187 --> 01:16:19,757
I've got a better idea.
Give me a hand.

1312
01:16:38,943 --> 01:16:41,443
Ah, for a fool such as this.

1313
01:16:41,445 --> 01:16:45,214
I shall think nothing
of tumbling downstairs.

1314
01:16:45,216 --> 01:16:47,953
Curiouser and curiouser.

1315
01:16:51,855 --> 01:16:53,389
See you around, Supe.

1316
01:16:53,391 --> 01:16:54,559
Oh, good day.

1317
01:19:42,493 --> 01:19:43,895
Yes?

1318
01:19:45,162 --> 01:19:48,063
<i>It's done, Mr. Franklin.</i>

1319
01:19:48,065 --> 01:19:50,131
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Both of them.

1320
01:19:50,133 --> 01:19:51,367
<i>Good.</i>

1321
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:55,270
And the little favor,
the teacher?

1322
01:19:55,272 --> 01:19:57,305
I'm forever in your debt.

1323
01:19:57,307 --> 01:19:59,474
Did you have fun, sweetie?

1324
01:19:59,476 --> 01:20:01,143
It was like jelly and ice cream.

1325
01:20:01,145 --> 01:20:02,611
<i>The cripple was very useful.</i>

1326
01:20:02,613 --> 01:20:04,979
End of the Line cafe.

1327
01:20:04,981 --> 01:20:06,648
- He's just the messenger.
- Mum's the word.

1328
01:20:06,650 --> 01:20:08,483
- All right, son?
- Cleaning service.

1329
01:20:08,485 --> 01:20:10,286
He has his uses.

1330
01:20:10,288 --> 01:20:12,991
Are you suitably impressed,
Mr. Franklin?

1331
01:20:14,557 --> 01:20:16,024
Most definitely.

1332
01:20:16,026 --> 01:20:17,292
<i>Good.</i>

1333
01:20:17,294 --> 01:20:19,361
So I can rely
on your business then?

1334
01:20:19,363 --> 01:20:22,697
I have a limited
range of choice.

1335
01:20:22,699 --> 01:20:26,237
You've suppressed
the competition admirably.

1336
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:31,340
How do I know you're not
going to double-cross me?

1337
01:20:31,342 --> 01:20:33,142
<i>You seem very adept at it.</i>

1338
01:20:33,144 --> 01:20:35,544
<i>How, indeed. But remember,</i>

1339
01:20:35,546 --> 01:20:37,645
<i>I like loyalty I can buy,</i>

1340
01:20:37,647 --> 01:20:40,482
<i>and you are unique.</i>

1341
01:20:40,484 --> 01:20:43,385
<i>You're one of a kind.</i>

1342
01:20:43,387 --> 01:20:45,891
You have proved
your value to me.

1343
01:20:47,658 --> 01:20:52,594
So is this the start of
a beautiful relationship then?

1344
01:20:52,596 --> 01:20:55,133
Most definitely.

1345
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,636
- Good night.
- <i>Good night.</i>

1346
01:21:17,154 --> 01:21:18,987
404.

1347
01:21:18,989 --> 01:21:20,324
Excellent.

1348
01:21:39,709 --> 01:21:41,443
What do you want?

1349
01:21:41,445 --> 01:21:43,077
There are two things in life

1350
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:45,417
for which we are never
truly prepared.

1351
01:21:48,552 --> 01:21:49,487
Twins.

1352
01:21:58,262 --> 01:22:01,599
Well, well, well, he lives.

1353
01:22:03,667 --> 01:22:07,338
I'm sorry, Mr. Franklin,
is the light bothering you?

1354
01:22:12,342 --> 01:22:13,742
Where am I?

1355
01:22:13,744 --> 01:22:16,181
You like what we've
done with the place?

1356
01:22:26,589 --> 01:22:29,390
A woman's touch
is what was needed.

1357
01:22:29,392 --> 01:22:32,161
How... How the fuck did you...

1358
01:22:32,163 --> 01:22:35,096
Look through the looking glass,
Mr. Franklin.

1359
01:22:35,098 --> 01:22:37,733
Or shall we call you...

1360
01:22:37,735 --> 01:22:39,434
Clinton?

1361
01:22:39,436 --> 01:22:41,502
A rose by any other name.

1362
01:22:41,504 --> 01:22:43,772
You've tumbled down
the rabbit hole

1363
01:22:43,774 --> 01:22:46,541
far beyond hope
or rhyme or reason,

1364
01:22:46,543 --> 01:22:48,609
flushed away
in a river of tears.

1365
01:22:48,611 --> 01:22:51,546
You're mad!
Stark raving mad!

1366
01:22:51,548 --> 01:22:53,282
Oh, we can't help that,
said the cat.

1367
01:22:53,284 --> 01:22:54,582
We're all mad here.

1368
01:22:54,584 --> 01:22:56,186
I'm mad. You're mad.

1369
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,853
Have you ever read it?

1370
01:22:58,855 --> 01:23:00,090
It's our favorite book.

1371
01:23:01,425 --> 01:23:04,225
Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

1372
01:23:04,227 --> 01:23:06,394
Mommy used to read it to us
every night.

1373
01:23:06,396 --> 01:23:08,096
We know it front to back,
cover to cover.

1374
01:23:08,098 --> 01:23:09,564
Inside and out.

1375
01:23:09,566 --> 01:23:11,532
If you gave us
a page and a line,

1376
01:23:11,534 --> 01:23:14,103
we could give you the words,
verbatim.

1377
01:23:14,105 --> 01:23:15,470
We hear tell it's hereditary.

1378
01:23:15,472 --> 01:23:16,671
Like eye color.

1379
01:23:16,673 --> 01:23:18,474
Or homicidal impulse.

1380
01:23:18,476 --> 01:23:20,408
Blood will out.

1381
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:23,778
May we tell you a story,
Mr. Franklin?

1382
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:27,381
Are you sitting comfortably?

1383
01:23:27,383 --> 01:23:29,686
- Then let us begin.
- Then let us begin.

1384
01:23:31,387 --> 01:23:35,590
A long time ago in a place
not dissimilar to this,

1385
01:23:35,592 --> 01:23:39,460
as a point of fact,
identical to this,

1386
01:23:39,462 --> 01:23:45,134
there lived a young woman
called Chloe Merriweather.

1387
01:23:45,136 --> 01:23:48,636
Now, Chloe Merriweather
had a gleam in her eye.

1388
01:23:48,638 --> 01:23:52,140
She wanted adventure.

1389
01:23:52,142 --> 01:23:55,611
One night in the aptly named
Anything Goes,

1390
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:58,147
Chloe Merriweather
succumbed to the wiles

1391
01:23:58,149 --> 01:24:01,183
of one Clinton Sharp,
a low-level criminal

1392
01:24:01,185 --> 01:24:03,652
with aspirations of grandeur,

1393
01:24:03,654 --> 01:24:06,688
who whispered sweet nothings
in her ear

1394
01:24:06,690 --> 01:24:10,759
and kept her drink topped up
and his powder dry.

1395
01:24:10,761 --> 01:24:14,795
Theirs was a knee-trembling
relationship.

1396
01:24:14,797 --> 01:24:18,332
Then for a time, very little
was heard of Chloe Merriweather

1397
01:24:18,334 --> 01:24:21,335
until a year or so later
she reappeared.

1398
01:24:21,337 --> 01:24:24,872
She'd grown up,
like all little girls do.

1399
01:24:24,874 --> 01:24:28,309
She waited tables by day,

1400
01:24:28,311 --> 01:24:30,578
and she danced on them
by night.

1401
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:34,683
For Chloe had a secret
that nobody knew

1402
01:24:34,685 --> 01:24:37,585
buried deep within
her heart of hearts.

1403
01:24:37,587 --> 01:24:41,322
She had two little girls
at home.

1404
01:24:41,324 --> 01:24:42,890
Twins.

1405
01:24:42,892 --> 01:24:46,230
The result of her passionate
tryst with Mr. Sharp.

1406
01:24:48,766 --> 01:24:50,468
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

1407
01:24:53,803 --> 01:24:56,871
But Chloe Merriweather knew
better than to involve Clinton

1408
01:24:56,873 --> 01:24:58,907
in her daughters' lives,

1409
01:24:58,909 --> 01:25:02,544
for she had seen
the shadow in his soul,

1410
01:25:02,546 --> 01:25:04,414
the murder in his eyes.

1411
01:25:07,717 --> 01:25:09,984
She kept them hidden
from the world

1412
01:25:09,986 --> 01:25:12,487
and from Clinton Sharp.

1413
01:25:12,489 --> 01:25:15,624
Deliciously sweet
were those times.

1414
01:25:15,626 --> 01:25:18,727
But life is cruel,
and the world is small,

1415
01:25:18,729 --> 01:25:21,630
and fate laughs mercilessly
at us all.

1416
01:25:21,632 --> 01:25:25,767
One deep, dark night,

1417
01:25:25,769 --> 01:25:30,538
Chloe Merriweather saw something
she ought not to have seen.

1418
01:25:33,409 --> 01:25:35,779
Clinton Sharp working.

1419
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,854
Chloe Merriweather
ran for her life

1420
01:25:46,856 --> 01:25:49,860
through that deep, dark night.

1421
01:25:51,494 --> 01:25:54,662
But it wasn't long
before Clinton Sharp

1422
01:25:54,664 --> 01:25:57,366
came calling for Chloe

1423
01:25:57,368 --> 01:25:59,667
with a canister of petrol

1424
01:25:59,669 --> 01:26:01,705
and his cigarette lighter.

1425
01:26:06,877 --> 01:26:10,578
Rumor has it
he whistled while he worked.

1426
01:26:15,686 --> 01:26:18,553
But Chloe Merriweather
was a fighter,

1427
01:26:18,555 --> 01:26:20,822
a wildcat with fierce tears,

1428
01:26:20,824 --> 01:26:23,591
unwilling to go gently
into that good night.

1429
01:26:23,593 --> 01:26:25,893
Chloe saved her little girls,

1430
01:26:25,895 --> 01:26:29,363
but the wildcat could not
get herself to safety.

1431
01:26:39,043 --> 01:26:43,411
And so it was we found ourselves
wards of the precinct,

1432
01:26:43,413 --> 01:26:45,647
taken into the mercy
and kindness

1433
01:26:45,649 --> 01:26:48,483
of St. Catherine's Orphanage.

1434
01:26:48,485 --> 01:26:51,886
To the welcoming arms of
the priests and the teachers

1435
01:26:51,888 --> 01:26:54,855
with their wandering hands
and their sticky fingers.

1436
01:26:54,857 --> 01:26:58,794
Here we learned how to close
our eyes and bite our lips.

1437
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:01,462
We learned how to go elsewhere
in our hearts and our heads

1438
01:27:01,464 --> 01:27:03,564
when the lights went out.

1439
01:27:03,566 --> 01:27:05,567
As soon as our legs
would carry us,

1440
01:27:05,569 --> 01:27:07,902
we ran far, far away.

1441
01:27:07,904 --> 01:27:10,538
Survival was
all we hoped for.

1442
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:12,474
A feral existence.

1443
01:27:12,476 --> 01:27:15,510
Until one day,
who should we see

1444
01:27:15,512 --> 01:27:19,014
shuffling by with his cart
and his broom and his limp,

1445
01:27:19,016 --> 01:27:20,549
but Clinton Sharp.

1446
01:27:24,387 --> 01:27:27,822
In all his crippled glory.

1447
01:27:27,824 --> 01:27:30,125
That selfsame whistle

1448
01:27:30,127 --> 01:27:33,397
that had haunted
our nightmares for so long.

1449
01:27:37,767 --> 01:27:40,068
So we hunted you, Daddy,

1450
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:44,038
and before long, we discovered
your clever little secret.

1451
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:49,377
Mr. Franklin,
a master villain marionette.

1452
01:27:49,379 --> 01:27:52,613
The legendary black briefcases,
the infamous voice messages,

1453
01:27:52,615 --> 01:27:55,149
the lost art of mystery.

1454
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:57,051
What's in it?

1455
01:27:57,053 --> 01:27:59,019
Another fucking
locker number.

1456
01:27:59,021 --> 01:28:02,758
Oh, you gotta love
Mr. Franklin, don't you?

1457
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:05,059
Who says mystery's a lost art?

1458
01:28:05,061 --> 01:28:07,129
Who says
mystery's a lost art?

1459
01:28:07,131 --> 01:28:10,732
And we let you track us, Daddy,
as we tracked you.

1460
01:28:10,734 --> 01:28:13,768
Inch by inch,
we laid our plans against you.

1461
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:16,773
We baited our traps
and cast our lures.

1462
01:28:19,109 --> 01:28:22,577
We pulled the strings
that made you dance.

1463
01:28:22,579 --> 01:28:25,580
We knew exactly
what would get your attention

1464
01:28:25,582 --> 01:28:31,185
and that you couldn't resist
hearing our confession.

1465
01:28:31,187 --> 01:28:36,090
I need a teeny, weeny donation,
Mr. Nigel Illing.

1466
01:28:36,092 --> 01:28:40,127
<i>Mr. Franklin, I must confess,
I've been a naughty girl.</i>

1467
01:28:40,129 --> 01:28:42,430
<i>Meet me at
St. Catherine's Church.</i>

1468
01:28:42,432 --> 01:28:45,032
This is
a well-conceived venue.

1469
01:28:45,034 --> 01:28:48,469
I want your work,
your contracts, all of it.

1470
01:28:48,471 --> 01:28:50,104
I'm afraid you're out of luck.

1471
01:28:50,106 --> 01:28:53,809
I've been recommended
another interested party

1472
01:28:53,811 --> 01:28:55,143
to take care of my problems.

1473
01:28:55,145 --> 01:28:57,813
I'm better.

1474
01:28:57,815 --> 01:28:59,814
I highly doubt it.

1475
01:28:59,816 --> 01:29:04,853
You men, with your bad suits
and your pumiced hair,

1476
01:29:04,855 --> 01:29:07,855
you're utterly predictable.

1477
01:29:07,857 --> 01:29:10,125
I reckon to the point
of carelessness.

1478
01:29:10,127 --> 01:29:11,526
Yes.

1479
01:29:11,528 --> 01:29:12,893
Me?

1480
01:29:12,895 --> 01:29:15,831
I'm the switchblade
in the garters,

1481
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:18,834
the stiletto in the stilettos.

1482
01:29:18,836 --> 01:29:22,603
I'm the surprise
they never see coming.

1483
01:29:22,605 --> 01:29:25,607
Who says mystery's a lost art?

1484
01:29:25,609 --> 01:29:27,509
Who'd have thought?

1485
01:29:27,511 --> 01:29:29,446
We're Daddy's little girls,
after all.

1486
01:29:35,052 --> 01:29:37,518
And now we stand on
the brink of our vengeance,

1487
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,557
on the cusp
of the wildest of justice.

1488
01:29:41,691 --> 01:29:44,960
You are my daughters, yeah?

1489
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:47,595
In blood only, Daddy.

1490
01:29:47,597 --> 01:29:49,197
Don't get too attached.

1491
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,666
Mommy has to be avenged.

1492
01:29:51,668 --> 01:29:54,702
Tell us, Daddy, are you familiar
with the science of lobotomy?

1493
01:29:54,704 --> 01:29:56,705
Much maligned
in this day and age,

1494
01:29:56,707 --> 01:29:59,573
but somehow rather
fitting in this scenario,

1495
01:29:59,575 --> 01:30:00,575
don't you think?

1496
01:30:00,577 --> 01:30:02,510
Please, girls.

1497
01:30:02,512 --> 01:30:04,712
Anything.
I'll do anything.

1498
01:30:04,714 --> 01:30:07,215
But not this, please!
Not this.

1499
01:30:07,217 --> 01:30:10,585
I beseech you
in your mother's name!

1500
01:30:10,587 --> 01:30:12,019
I am your father!

1501
01:30:12,021 --> 01:30:15,290
No, no, no.
Far too little, far too late.

1502
01:30:15,292 --> 01:30:17,626
Shh, Daddy, easy.

1503
01:30:17,628 --> 01:30:20,127
I've got you.
Try not to fight.

1504
01:30:20,129 --> 01:30:22,130
The time has come,
the walrus said,

1505
01:30:22,132 --> 01:30:24,064
to speak of many things,

1506
01:30:24,066 --> 01:30:27,768
like shoes and ships
and sealing wax,

1507
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:30,173
cabbages and kings.

1508
01:30:37,146 --> 01:30:39,781
An eye for an eye, Daddy.

1509
01:30:47,324 --> 01:30:49,758
The coup de grâce
is yours, dear sister.

1510
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,561
The nail in the coffin.

1511
01:30:55,565 --> 01:30:57,934
Send Mr. Franklin
to Wonderland.

1512
01:31:06,743 --> 01:31:08,044
Night-night, Daddy.

1513
01:31:18,922 --> 01:31:20,889
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

1514
