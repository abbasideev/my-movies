00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:56,869
I just... I have spells.

340
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:00,077
I have spells. I lose time. I can't...

341
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,667
I can't remember nothing.

342
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:13,303
Why did you run from the police, Aaron,
if you didn't do anything wrong?

343
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,095
Well, when...

344
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,268
When I woke up, I was covered in blood.

345
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:25,436
I didn't know what to do.
I got scared. I heard sirens, so I ran.

Look, I know how it looks, Mr. Vail,
but I swear...

347
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,069
Yeah, I don't need you
to try to convince me, Aaron.

348
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,742
I just want you to answer my questions.

349
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,365
But I didn't do this.
You've got to believe me.

No, I don't have to believe you.

Stamp/er was flushed by the police

363
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,660
from his hiding place in the bushes
behind the cathedral.

364
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,587
The police chased him through the train
yard, just north of McCormick Place,

365
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,416
almost losing him
as he scrambled over tracks

366
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,502
before an oncoming train,
separating him from the police.

at the Maxwell Street Precinct...

00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:43,100
After a brief chase across the rail yard
behind Saint Michael's Cathedral,

371
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,308

REPORTER 1: Can you tell us anything
about the altar-boy group

378
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,417
-that Aaron Stamp/er was part of?
- SHAUGHNESSY: Not much at this time.

379
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,789
REPORTER 2: Have you
ruled out the involvement

380
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,495
of any of the other altar boys?

381
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,251
SHAUGHNESSY: We have no reason
to suspect anyone other than Stamp/er.

382
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,379
He had access
to the Archbishop's quarters.

383
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,551
He was caught fleeing the area
of Saint Michael's.

384

Tommy, you're gonna have to try harder

00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,456
to get the word "allegedly"
into your vocabulary,

- Here you go.

- Tommy, you want coffee?
- No. No, thanks.

00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,213
All right. He admits he was in the room
when the killing occurred,

405
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,135

- No.

407

He was returning a book
to the Archbishop.

408
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,888
He heard loud noises in the bedroom.

409
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,390
He went in. He sees a figure,

410
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,475
someone in the shadows
kneeling over the body. He blacks out.

411

I didn't say that.
I said it was in his pocket.

Is that it?

418

Yep.

That's... That's bullshit, Marty.

420
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,587
That's the worst bullshit story
I've ever heard in my entire life.

421
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,640
Now it's our bullshit story.
Okay, let's get to work.

422
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,932
Now, the name of the game here
is motive,

423
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,933
as in, the prosecution doesn't have one.

424
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,435
So what we have to do here

425
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,564
is prove that someone else
could have committed the crime.

426
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,565
Then we can establish
reasonable doubt.

427

So I want to know everything I can
about this guy, everything he was into.

428

go to Hall of Records, IRS files.

- So-called?

- Allegedly.
- No.

436
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,802
That was a fact,
but I appreciate the effort, Tommy.

and asked me who was my best man,

I trust, Mr. Shaughnessy,
if I am to prosecute this case,

451
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,092
I'll be given the authority
which comes with the assignment.

452
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:08,677
You're the one trying the case, but
let's establish one thing at the outset.

453

I want the death penalty.

454
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,765
I'd like an opportunity
to go over the case

455
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,099
before we make a determination

456
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,684
on whether or not
to seek the death penalty.

457
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,519
I'm open to anything
you have to say, Janet,

458
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,106
but in my mind there's no debate.

459
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,701
Did he say anything,
the boy they picked up?

460
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,653
Yeah. He didn't do it.

461
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,531

Hey, that's what we pay you for.

465
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,837
...but if it's as open and shut
as you say it is, then you don't need me.

00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:06,307
That's my job.

837
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:09,435
This city doesn't burn
because I won't permit it.

838
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:12,017
I'm the great negotiator.

839
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,977
You think people get that?

840
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,780
Truth is, they don't care.
Dumb bastards don't even vote.

841
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,107
All they want to do is eat,
sleep, watch TV

842
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,910
and occasionally fuck their wives.

843
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,283
Guess we should all thank you.

844
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:25,613
(LAUGHS)

845
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,535
You're welcome.

846
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:31,498
John, you need some new material.

847
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:35,002
I've heard this "great city" speech
10 times already.

848
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:41,588
Your boy Pinero's not honoring
his side of the deal.

849
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,264
Is that what this dinner was about?
Pinero?

850
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,590
In part.

851
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:45,766
(CLEARS THROAT)

852
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:50,097
I told him what the deal is.
He's a grownup. What's the other part?

853
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,728
I understand your assistant's
been digging around

854
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,935
in the Archbishop's financial affairs.

855
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,236
(CHUCKLES)

856
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:58,905
Yeah. Well...

857
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,284
How much did you lose

858
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,457
when he pulled the plug
from South River, John?

859
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,128
Let me tell you something.

860
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,579
It's a mistake to stick your thumb

861
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,132
in the eyes of the most powerful people
in the city.

862
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,801
It's not their eyes I'm aiming for.

863
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,928
Do not fuck with me, Marty.

864
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,361
Pipes are bursting again, John.

865
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:04,095
In the most anticipated murder trial
in recent Chicago history,

866
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,299
former State 's Attorney prosecutor
Martin Vail will lead

867
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:10,385
with his opening statement
on behalf of Aaron Stamp/er...

868
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,140
The prosecution 's case is headed

869
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:14,723
by Assistant State 's Attorney
Janet Venable. Venable was...

870
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:17,650
JANET: Richard Rushman
was a man of God.

871
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:21,695
He spent his life giving
to the people of Chicago.

872
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,113
He was a beacon of inspiration,

873
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,192
not only as a spiritual leader,
but as a citizen.

874
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,698
...will deliver his opening statement
tomorrow on behalf of defendant...

875
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,575
VAIL: My name is Martin Vail,

876
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,784
and the reason I'm here,
and the reason you're here,

877
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,619
is to make sure
that the whole truth is known.

878
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,876
Now, we can begin to learn the truth

879
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:42,049
by talking about What the prosecution
does not want you to hear.

880
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,422
JANET: Do not be fooled

881
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:46,550
by the defendant's innocent
appearance and demeanor:

882
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,929
Aaron Stamp/er sat in judgment
of Archbishop Rushman

883
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,807
and determined that
not only should he die,

884
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,229
but he should die
the most brutal way possible.

885
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,557
VAIL: Aaron was arrested Within minutes
of the Archbishop's death.

886
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,734
We all know that.
We all saw it on television.

887
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:04,405
But why? Because he was convenient.

888
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,404
Because there was enormous pressure
on the police to solve this crime.

889
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:11,909
<i>JANET: The evidence will show
that Aaron Stamp/er stalked, ambushed</i>

890
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,240
and savagely murdered this great man.

891
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,166
VAIL: The prosecution does not want
you to hear

892
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,119
about the other altar boys
in the church choir

893
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,999
who have mysteriously disappeared.

894
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,706
JANET: At the close of evidence,
ladies and gentlemen,

895
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,918
you will learn that Aaron Stamp/er
had everything he needed

896
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,673
for the perfect assassination.

897
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:32,259
Using this knife,
Aaron Stampler repeatedly stabbed

898
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:37,062
at the Archbishop's chest,
his genitals, his eyes.

899
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:40,562
They don't want you to hear
that the Archbishop made investments

900
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,643
on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church

901
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:45,856
and that those investments
resulted in huge losses

902
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,065
for some very, very powerful people.

903
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,778
They don't want you to hear about
the 20 death threats this year alone

904
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:54,113
that the Archbishop received
prior to his death.

905
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:58,372
And they really don't want you to hear
about their theory of motive.

906
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,703
And why is that? Very simple.

907
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:05,007
They don't have one.

908
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,880
JAN ET: Inspector Woodside,
can you explain to the court

909
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,965
where these sneakers came from?

910
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,473
They were taken off the defendant
when he was apprehended.

911
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,646
And what was the result of
the bloodstain analysis done on them?

912
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,350
The result of the analysis
proved to be human blood

913
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,981
matching the blood type
and DNA characteristics

914
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,528
of Archbishop Rushman.

915
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:29,323
JAN ET: What do the bloody footprints
surrounding the body tell you?

916
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,401
The killer left a pattern
of bloody footprints

917
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,032
around the area of the struggle,

918
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,989
as indicated by the spread of blood
through the room.

919
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,700
VAIL: All right, yes or no, Inspector?

920
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:42,253
Could there have been a third person in
the Archbishop's quarters that morning?

921
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,921
WOODSIDE: There is no evidence
to suggest that.

922
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,169
But there's no evidence
to prove there wasn't.

923
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,341
No.

924
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,509
And after the struggle,
what happened then?

925
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:53,089
Well, analysis suggests that the killer
was startled during the mutilation

926
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,641
and ran from the bedroom
down the stairs.

927
00:55:55,727 --> 00:56:01,439
Is it possible, Inspector,
that the real killer, a third person,

928
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,606
who maybe was smart enough

929
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:08,029
not to tramp a whole freeway of blood
through the whole place here,

930
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:11,528
couldn't this third person have placed
the defendant's prints

931
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,030
on the knife while he was passed out?

932
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:16,032
Mr. Vail, anything is possible.

933
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:19,491
JANET: So, clearly, the victim suffered
a great number of stab wounds?

934
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:23,374
WEIL: Yes, he did, 78.
He tried to defend himself.

935
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:26,046
And that explains the cuts
on the hands and the forearms.

936
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:29,125
Doctor, isn't it a fact
that you can't be sure

937
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:35,056
whether more than one person inflicted
these 78 stab and incise wounds?

938
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,975
That's true, Counselor. It could've been
more than one person, but I doubt it.

939
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,769
From your analysis
of the knife wounds, Dr. Weil,

940
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:44,224
do you have an opinion whether the
killer was left-handed or right-handed?

941
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,060
Well, the incise wound to the throat
and most of the chest wounds

942
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,363
were made from an angle that strongly
suggests that a left-handed person

943
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:51,530
was using the knife.

944
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:53,699
To your knowledge,
is the defendant left-handed?

945
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:54,900
Yes, he is.

946
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,236
Well, then it's possible
that a right-handed person

947
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:01,199
could've deliberately used his left hand
to inflict some of these wounds.

948
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:02,704
Yes, I suppose that is possible.

949
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,081
Then it would be reasonable to assume

950
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:08,631
that there was, in fact,
a third person there at the crime scene?

951
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:11,630
Reasonable, no. But it is possible.

952
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,461
Then following opening statements,

953
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,466
it was a day of strong
and detailed testimony

954
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,594
from the prosecution 's first witnesses,

955
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,016
Cook County Forensics Chief
Harvey Woodside

956
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,515
and Cook County Medical Examiner
Emile Weil.

957
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,688
It was also a day of
tough cross-examination

958
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:25,936
of Woodside and Wei!

959
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:28,108
By Stamp/er defense attorney
Martin Vail.

960
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:29,651
By most accounts, though,
the prosecution...

961
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,904
JAN ET: Captain Stenner,
I would like to thank you

962
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,947
for all the time you've given us today,

963
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,321
but, finally,
I would like to turn your attention

964
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,779
to the symbol carved
into the Archbishop's chest.

965
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,286
Now would you please tell the jury
about that, Captain?

966
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:49,043
Yes. The letter
and the numbers 832.156

967
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,918
were carved into
the Archbishop's chest.

968
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,545
What you just described,

969
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:55,253
have you been able
to find an identical reference anywhere?

970
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:56,963
I believe so, yes.

971
00:57:57,057 --> 00:58:02,803
The symbol B32.156
is actually catalog code for a book

972
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,981
discovered in a private reading room
located in the church basement.

973
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:11,937
That particular number, the B32 part,
refers to a book,

974
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,988
The Scarlet Letter
by Nathaniel Hawthorne.

975
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:20,946
When we opened the book to Page 156,
we discovered an underlined passage.

976
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:26,458
Would you please read
this underlined passage to the court?

977
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:32,339
"No man, for any considerable period,

978
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:36,420
"can wear one face to himself
and another to the multitude

979
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:40,598
"without finally getting bewildered
as to which may be the true."

980
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,050
Thank you.

981
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,939
What does that passage
mean to you, Captain?

982
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:51,893
Objection. He's a policeman,
not an English professor.

983
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,729
His interpretation would be speculative
and irrelevant.

984
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:56,609
I didn't hear her ask
for an expert opinion.

985
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,782
The witness can answer.

986
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,027
Well, to me, it's simple.

987
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:05,035
The killer thought
that his victim was two-faced,

988
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,581
dishonest in some way.

989
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,500
In your experience, Captain,

990
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:12,376
do killers ever intentionally
leave clues to their motive?

991
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,878
STENNER: Not often, but it happens.

992
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,131
Thanks.

993
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,971
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, sure.

994
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:28,020
Did you underline that book?

995
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,689
- Did I what?
- Did you underline that book?

996
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:33,859
- No. No, Mr. Vail.
- No?

997
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:37,609
(STAMMERING) No. Mr. Vail.
I never even opened The Scarlet Letter.

998
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,691
I don't like Hawthorne.

999
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:43,244
I tried to read that one about the house
with the seven somethings

1000
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:46,413
in high school.
I couldn't even get past Page 10.

1001
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:52,253
I mean, I weren't the only one using
Bishop Rushman's library.

1002
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:54,998
You know what? Everybody borrowed
books from Bishop Rushman.

1003

(CHUCKLES) I don't know.

1333
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:54,332
What I know is, Aaron did not commit
first-degree murder.

- Marty, he stabbed him a billion times...
- No, not Aaron.

1335
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:02,341
To convict someone of a capital crime,
the State must prove intent.

1336
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:04,755
Roy had intent, Aaron didn't.

1337
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,217
Yeah, but the only way to prove that
is to change the plea to insanity,

1338
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:10,599
which we can't do mid-trial, unless
you're planning on a career change.

this whole abuse thing.

1349

No, actually, what it does is,
it turns this whole thing around.

of what Rushman did to this kid.

The Rushman Foundation was founded
by the late archbishop.

01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:50,527
In defense, Aaron's psyche splintered

1659
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:53,576
and helped him to create
two separate personalities.

1660
01:44:53,662 --> 01:44:55,699
- Your Honor.
- I didn't say it.

1661
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:58,452
- I did not say it...
- JUDGE: You've been warned twice now.

1662
01:44:58,542 --> 01:45:00,499
Do you really wanna pursue
this line of questioning?

1663
01:45:00,586 --> 01:45:04,045
And I suggest you think long and hard
before answering.

1664
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:09,254
Your Honor, just one last question.

1665
01:45:14,183 --> 01:45:16,220
All right, Dr. Arrington,

1666
01:45:17,686 --> 01:45:22,647
in your opinion,
is Aaron Stampler capable of murder?

1667
01:45:22,733 --> 01:45:24,565
No, he is not. He is far too traumatized

1668
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:26,814
to express normal anger and frustration.

1669
01:45:26,904 --> 01:45:28,986
He keeps his emotions repressed,

1670
01:45:29,073 --> 01:45:31,656
which is why he created Roy,
who is capable of such a crime.

1671
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:34,234
- Objection, Your Honor.
- JUDGE: That's enough, Mr. Vail.

1672
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:38,034
The jury will disregard this witness'
last statement, as will the court.

1673
01:45:38,123 --> 01:45:39,409
- Thank you very much.
- Madam Prosecutor,

1674
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,037
-do you wish to cross?
- You bet I do.

1675
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:46,662
Since you brought it up,
against the instructions of the court,

1676
01:45:46,757 --> 01:45:47,838
(INAUDIBLE)

1677
01:45:47,925 --> 01:45:49,336
I'm curious to know,

1678
01:45:49,426 --> 01:45:52,839
is multiple personality disorder
your primary area of expertise?

1679
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:54,967
It's not my primary field, no.

1680
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:58,595
Is forensic psychiatry
your primary area of expertise?

1681
01:45:59,103 --> 01:46:01,595
- No, I'm a neuropsychologist.
- I see.

1682
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:04,935
So you have no forensic experience,

1683
01:46:05,025 --> 01:46:08,609
and you're more of, let's say,
an academic?

1684
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:13,277
Then you will forgive
this rather academic question.

1685
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:16,989
I'm driving in my car,
somebody cuts me off.

1686
01:46:17,079 --> 01:46:19,036
I think to myself,
"I could just kill that guy,"

1687
01:46:19,123 --> 01:46:20,705
but I don't, now do I?

1688
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,623
- I would hope not.
- That's right.

1689
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:26,374
Things happen to us. People wrong us,

1690
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:28,921
but we don't all go around
inventing psychopaths

1691
01:46:29,008 --> 01:46:30,999
to do our dirty work for us,
now, do we, Doctor?

1692
01:46:31,093 --> 01:46:34,256
I'm not suggesting you suffer from
multiple personality, Miss Venable.

1693
01:46:34,346 --> 01:46:37,213
- I'm saying Mr. Stampler does.
- Yes, I know. We heard.

1694
01:46:39,184 --> 01:46:43,473
You have also testified
that you have met this...

1695
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:44,895
What was his name again?

1696
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:46,393
- MOLLY: Roy.
- Roy what?

1697
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:49,225
- He didn't give a last name.
- I see.

1698
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:53,405
Did this Roy tell you
that he had murdered the Archbishop?

1699
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:56,107
Mr. Vail was alone with him at the time.
I was watching through the window,

1700
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:59,364
but soon after that I was in the room
and saw both Roy

1701
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:01,787
and his transformation back to Aaron.

1702
01:47:02,666 --> 01:47:07,502
Did you happen to tape
this appearance of Aaron...

1703
01:47:07,588 --> 01:47:08,669
(LAUGHING)

1704
01:47:09,673 --> 01:47:14,167
(STAMMERING) I'm sorry. I am sorry.
I just cannot get used to this name.

1705
01:47:14,261 --> 01:47:16,673
- Roy.
- Did you?

1706
01:47:18,474 --> 01:47:21,182
- No, the tape was off.
- Off?

1707
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:28,390
So you have no record whatsoever
of his appearance.

1708
01:47:28,692 --> 01:47:29,932
- No.
- No.

1709
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:35,105
Does Aaron Stampler know
the difference between right and wrong?

1710
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:36,234
Yes, he does.

1711
01:47:36,325 --> 01:47:39,067
If Aaron Stampler butchered
the Archbishop, would he know...

1712
01:47:39,161 --> 01:47:40,276
VAIL: Objection, Your Honor.

1713
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:43,739
If Aaron Stampler
murdered the Archbishop,

1714
01:47:43,832 --> 01:47:48,247
-would he know he'd broken the law?
- Yes, he would, but it wasn't Aaron...

1715
01:47:48,379 --> 01:47:52,464
Yes, I know, Doctor. It was Roy.

1716
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:59,049
That's all.

re-open the Prosecution's case

1719
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:05,301
and call the State's psychiatrist,

1720
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:08,559
- I will certainly agree to it.
- No, I...

1721
01:48:08,649 --> 01:48:10,231
I don't think that's necessary,
Your Honor.

1722
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:12,058

1723

1724
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:20,904

1727
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:29,973
Aaron.

1728
01:49:33,942 --> 01:49:36,024
Could you tell us a little about
your relationship

1729
01:49:36,111 --> 01:49:37,977
with Archbishop Rushman?

1730
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:43,282
(STAMMERING) Well, he was like
a father to me. I loved him very much.

1731
01:49:43,368 --> 01:49:45,075
Why did you love him?

1732
01:49:45,662 --> 01:49:46,823
- Why?
- Uh-huh.

1733
01:49:48,123 --> 01:49:52,082
(STAMMERING) Well, he saved my life.

1734
01:49:52,336 --> 01:49:57,297
He was the only person who ever
treated me like I was worth anything.

1735
01:49:57,674 --> 01:50:00,416
(WHISPERS) Stop your whining,
you little girl. Be a man.

1736
01:50:04,181 --> 01:50:07,515
Now, we've all seen that tape
that you were in, Aaron.

1737
01:50:08,477 --> 01:50:09,842
How did that make you feel?

1738
01:50:09,937 --> 01:50:12,725
Did it change your feelings
about Archbishop Rushman?

1739
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:14,309
No. Uh-uh.

1740
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:18,188
He was a wonderful man.

1741
01:50:18,278 --> 01:50:19,894
So you didn't feel anger towards him

1742
01:50:19,988 --> 01:50:22,355
about being forced to perform
in that tape?

1743
01:50:23,033 --> 01:50:26,867
No, he did everything for me.

1744
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:30,120
There wasn't nothing else
I could do for him, and he needed it.

1745
01:50:30,207 --> 01:50:32,448
Do you know someone named Roy?

1746
01:50:35,504 --> 01:50:36,869
No, I don't.

1747
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:40,419
You heard Dr. Arrington's
testimony about

1748
01:50:40,509 --> 01:50:42,750
what she and I saw there at the jail.

1749
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:46,053
Aaron, some pretty strange things
going on there. Do you remember?

1750
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:48,507
I heard what she said,
but I don't remember any of that.

1751
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:50,432
- No recollection?
- No, sir.

1752
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:52,851
Did you kill Archbishop Rushman?

No, sir, I did not.

- You sure?

1758
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:28,467
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

1759
01:51:36,398 --> 01:51:40,517
Mr. Stampler, did you believe
that the Archbishop wore masks?

1760
01:51:43,655 --> 01:51:45,771
(STAMMERING) I'm sorry,
what did you say?

1761
01:51:46,074 --> 01:51:50,193
Do you think he acted one way
in public and another way in private?

1762
01:51:51,246 --> 01:51:53,237
No, I didn't think that.

1763
01:51:54,082 --> 01:51:56,449
Isn't that why you underlined
the Hawthorne passage?

1764
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:00,415
Mr. Stampler?

1765
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:05,340
No, I did not underline that book.

1766
01:52:05,427 --> 01:52:08,135
- You didn't underline it?
- No, ma'am.

1767
01:52:08,222 --> 01:52:11,760
And you didn't carve the numbers
referring to that passage into his chest?

1768
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:15,718
No, no, ma'am, I did not. I told you I...

1769
01:52:15,812 --> 01:52:17,302
You loved him.

1770
01:52:18,732 --> 01:52:20,848
You loved him like a father.

1771
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:24,644
Even though he made you
and your girlfriend

1772
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:28,151
perform demeaning sexual acts
for his own gratification.

1773
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:30,941
(STAMMERING)
No, you don't understand. He...

1774
01:52:31,995 --> 01:52:36,080
There was no other way for him
to cast out his own demons.

1775
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:38,703
- He needed it.
- He needed to get off, Aaron.

1776
01:52:38,794 --> 01:52:40,125
That's what he was doing.

1777
01:52:40,212 --> 01:52:44,422
That's what he needed you for,
to perform like a circus animal.

1778
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:47,216
- That was your function in his life.
-(STUTTERS) No.

1779
01:52:47,302 --> 01:52:51,091
Mr. Stampler, I'm gonna ask you
straight, because I am tired,

1780
01:52:51,181 --> 01:52:53,639
and I've had just about
all I can take of this sordidness,

1781
01:52:53,725 --> 01:52:54,931
and I wanna go home,

1782

and I wanna wash my hands,
and I wanna forget all about you

and Archbishop Rushman.

1784
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:05,359
Did the Archbishop force you
and your girlfriend and others

1785
01:53:05,445 --> 01:53:09,279
to perform sexual acts
while he watched? Yes or no?

1786
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:15,115
- Yes, he did, but...
- Yes. Yes, he forced you.

1787
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:19,203
He forced you using a threat
of expulsion from Savior House

1788
01:53:19,293 --> 01:53:23,662
and a life on the street with no heat
and no water and no food.

1789
01:53:23,755 --> 01:53:27,840
He put you in front of a camera!
He made you take off your clothes!

that's another side?

- Do you know what I would do

1793
01:53:34,975 --> 01:53:37,467

I would kill him. I wouldn't hesitate.

I would slash his throat open!

I would carve numbers into his chest!

1821
01:54:38,663 --> 01:54:40,279
(JAN ET PANTING)

1822
01:54:42,459 --> 01:54:44,826
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

1823
01:55:11,947 --> 01:55:14,609
Don't even think of lighting
that cigarette, Miss Venable.

1824
01:55:20,664 --> 01:55:23,326
- How's your neck?
- I'll live.

1825
01:55:23,542 --> 01:55:24,532
I could call a doctor.

1826
01:55:24,626 --> 01:55:25,616
Uh-uh.

1827
01:55:25,710 --> 01:55:30,796
Mr. Shaughnessy just called
to inform me there will be no mistrial,

1828
01:55:30,882 --> 01:55:33,214
-as if that was his right.
- I can't believe

1829
01:55:33,301 --> 01:55:35,668
that scumbag has the balls to call here.

1830
01:55:35,846 --> 01:55:37,007
No, thanks.

1831
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:39,881
What matters to me is
what you have to say.

1832
01:55:39,975 --> 01:55:42,387
Obviously,
your case has been damaged.

1833
01:55:43,937 --> 01:55:46,770
In fairness to the Prosecution,
I would declare a mistrial,

1834
01:55:46,857 --> 01:55:49,519
regardless of what
Monsieurs Shaughnessy and Vail think,

1835
01:55:49,609 --> 01:55:51,065
if that's what you want.

1836
01:55:51,153 --> 01:55:54,145
The Prosecution doesn't wanna try
this case again, even if it could,

1837
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:57,277
which it can't, at least not by me.

1838
01:55:57,367 --> 01:56:00,200
And I think I can guarantee you
there's no one

1839
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:05,706
in the DA's office who will,
so it's up to you.

1840
01:56:06,168 --> 01:56:08,660
I'm going to dismiss the jury
in favor of a bench trial

1841
01:56:08,753 --> 01:56:11,290
and a blind plea of not guilty
by reason of insanity.

1842
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:12,871
- Yes?
- Yeah.

1843
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:14,957
The defendant will be
remanded to Elgin

1844
01:56:15,051 --> 01:56:17,042
for an evaluation period of 30 days.

1845
01:56:17,137 --> 01:56:19,469
Let them decide
the term of his commitment.

1846
01:56:19,556 --> 01:56:21,012
Do either of you have
a problem with that?

1847
01:56:21,099 --> 01:56:22,760
JAN ET: Your Honor,
he'll be out in a month.

1848
01:56:22,851 --> 01:56:25,843
Take it up with the Legislature,
Miss Venable.

1849
01:56:28,857 --> 01:56:30,393
I'm going home.

1850
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:37,237
- Your Honor.
- No, Mr. Vail,

1851
01:56:37,324 --> 01:56:39,782
I am not refunding your contempt fine,

1852
01:56:39,868 --> 01:56:42,326
and the next time you wanna get
a client off on insanity,

1853
01:56:42,412 --> 01:56:43,868
you plead that way,

1854
01:56:43,955 --> 01:56:46,071
or I'll have you disbarred.

1855
01:57:14,694 --> 01:57:15,855
You okay?

1856
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:19,189
(CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY)
Am I okay? Do I seem okay?

1857
01:57:19,616 --> 01:57:22,984
I get attacked by this sick twist,
I've lost the case, I'm out of a job.

1858
01:57:23,078 --> 01:57:26,821
No, Marty. I'm not particularly okay,
but, hey, you won,

1859
01:57:26,915 --> 01:57:29,873
justice was done.
Who the hell cares, right?

1860
01:57:31,419 --> 01:57:33,001
Congratulations.

1861
01:57:39,386 --> 01:57:41,172
You knew, didn't you?

1862
01:57:41,555 --> 01:57:44,388
You knew if I went after him,
he'd wig out up there.

1863
01:57:44,474 --> 01:57:48,217
Well, I knew he'd come out
if he was threatened.

1864
01:57:48,311 --> 01:57:50,552
And who better to do that than me?

1865
01:57:51,815 --> 01:57:53,226
You used me.

1866
01:57:57,445 --> 01:57:59,561
Yeah, I did. I had no choice.

1867
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:05,613
What did I use, by the way,
that was so terrible?

1868
01:58:05,912 --> 01:58:09,746
I knew you'd do your job.
I knew you'd stand up to Shaughnessy.

1869
01:58:09,958 --> 01:58:12,871
I knew you'd try to win the case.
Now, what's wrong with that?

1870
01:58:12,961 --> 01:58:14,747
I lost my fucking job!

1871
01:58:14,838 --> 01:58:16,545
And that's good.
You should've left him years ago.

1872
01:58:16,631 --> 01:58:19,589
Christ, Marty, why is it you always think
you know what's right for me?

1873
01:58:19,676 --> 01:58:21,132
Because I'm arrogant.

1874
01:58:23,179 --> 01:58:24,544
I'm very,

1875
01:58:26,391 --> 01:58:28,348
very arrogant.

1876
01:58:39,195 --> 01:58:41,027
- You wanna dance?
- No.

1877
01:58:42,574 --> 01:58:43,985
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1878
01:58:47,287 --> 01:58:48,448
All you have to do is turn around.

1879
01:58:48,538 --> 01:58:49,699
(CHUCKLES)

1880
01:58:55,378 --> 01:58:56,413
No.

(HUMMING)

1882
01:58:58,340 --> 01:58:59,330
No.

(SNIFFLES)

1884
01:59:09,309 --> 01:59:11,266
I have to see my client.

1885
01:59:54,854 --> 01:59:57,221
- I'd like a minute alone with him.
- Are you sure?

1886
01:59:57,315 --> 01:59:59,022
Yeah. I'm sure.

1887

(DOOR LOCKS)

1888
02:00:10,829 --> 02:00:12,035
You okay?

1889
02:00:15,959 --> 02:00:17,449
(STUTTERS) My head hurts.

1890
02:00:19,003 --> 02:00:21,620
You don't remember
what just happened?

1891
02:00:24,968 --> 02:00:30,008
- No?
- I lost time again.

1892
02:00:31,057 --> 02:00:33,515
Well, I got some good news.

1893
02:00:34,644 --> 02:00:36,555
They've agreed to stop the trial.

1894
02:00:36,646 --> 02:00:39,229
They're gonna be sending you
to a hospital.

1895
02:00:39,733 --> 02:00:41,349
You can get the help you need.

1896
02:00:43,278 --> 02:00:48,148
Now, there's a very good chance
you can get out someday soon.

1897
02:00:51,619 --> 02:00:52,700
Yeah.

1898
02:00:57,417 --> 02:00:59,203
I can't believe it.

1899
02:01:00,170 --> 02:01:04,334
- I don't know what to say, Mr. Vail.
- That's all right, Aaron. That's okay.

1900
02:01:04,424 --> 02:01:07,291
I knew, the minute
you came into my cell,

1901
02:01:07,385 --> 02:01:10,127
I knew everything was gonna be okay.

1902
02:01:10,221 --> 02:01:12,838
(STAMMERING) You saved my life.

1903
02:01:16,853 --> 02:01:18,093
Yeah.

1904
02:01:19,898 --> 02:01:21,309
I got to go.

1905
02:01:23,693 --> 02:01:28,403
- When will I see you again?
- Well, that's up to the courts now.

1906
02:01:29,991 --> 02:01:33,780
I don't want you to worry, Aaron.
I'm gonna stay on top of this, okay?

1907
02:01:40,710 --> 02:01:42,041
Thank you.

1908
02:01:43,296 --> 02:01:46,129
All right. You give me a call
if you need to. Okay?

1909
02:01:46,216 --> 02:01:47,581
- I will.
- All right.

1910

- Hey, Mr. Vail?
- Yeah.

1911
02:01:54,724 --> 02:01:58,934
(STAMMERING) Will you tell
Miss Venable I'm sorry?

1912
02:02:00,772 --> 02:02:03,560
Tell her I hope her neck is okay.

1913

Yeah.

- What did you just say?
- What?

1915
02:02:27,715 --> 02:02:30,707
You told me you don't remember.
You black out.

1916
02:02:34,264 --> 02:02:36,676
So how do you know about her neck?

1917
02:02:51,990 --> 02:02:55,403
Well, good for you, Marty.

1918
02:02:57,078 --> 02:02:58,944
I was gonna let it go.

1919
02:02:59,122 --> 02:03:02,490
You was looking so happy just now.
I was thinking...

1920
02:03:03,626 --> 02:03:06,038
But to tell you the truth,
I'm glad you figured it,

1921
02:03:06,129 --> 02:03:08,496
'cause I have been dying to tell you.

1922
02:03:08,590 --> 02:03:09,625
(CHUCKLING)

1923
02:03:09,716 --> 02:03:11,673
I just didn't know who
you'd wanna hear it from, you know.

1924
02:03:11,759 --> 02:03:14,797
I mean, Aaron or Roy, or Roy or Aaron.

1925
02:03:15,263 --> 02:03:17,174
Well, I'll let you in on a little secret,

1926
02:03:17,265 --> 02:03:20,553
sort of a client-attorney privilege type
of a secret. You know what I mean?

1927
02:03:20,643 --> 02:03:21,724
Uh-huh.

1928
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:25,763
It don't matter who you hear it from.
It's the same story.

1929
02:03:30,403 --> 02:03:33,486
(STAMMERING) I just

1930
02:03:33,573 --> 02:03:35,655
had to kill Linda, Mr. Vail.

1931
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:39,777
That cunt just got what she deserved.

1932
02:03:43,166 --> 02:03:47,205
But cutting up
that son of a bitch Rushman,

1933
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:51,212
that was just a fucking work of art.

1934
02:03:51,299 --> 02:03:52,630
(LAUGHING)

1935
02:04:00,391 --> 02:04:02,723
You're good. You are really good.

1936
02:04:03,519 --> 02:04:06,352
Yeah, I did get caught, though, didn't I?

1937
02:04:10,568 --> 02:04:14,687
So there never...
There never was a Roy?

1938
02:04:16,032 --> 02:04:20,071
Jesus Christ, Marty. If that's
what you think, I'm disappointed in you.

1939
02:04:20,161 --> 02:04:21,777
I don't mind telling you.

1940
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:28,829
There never was an Aaron, Counselor.

1941
02:04:37,804 --> 02:04:40,171
Come on, Marty, I thought you had it
figured there at the end.

1942
02:04:40,264 --> 02:04:41,629
The way you put me
on the stand like that,

1943
02:04:41,724 --> 02:04:43,681
that was fucking brilliant, Marty.

1944
02:04:43,768 --> 02:04:45,350
And that whole thing,
that, "Act like a man,"

1945
02:04:45,436 --> 02:04:47,643
Jesus, I knew exactly
what you wanted from me.

1946
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:49,846
It was like we were dancing, Marty!

1947
02:04:49,941 --> 02:04:52,399
- Guard.
- Come on. Don't be like that, Marty.

1948
02:04:52,694 --> 02:04:53,775
(KEY TURNING IN LOCK)

1949
02:04:53,861 --> 02:04:58,401
We did it, man. We fucking did it.
We're a great team, you and me.

1950
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:01,441
You think I could've done this
without you?

1951
02:05:01,536 --> 02:05:03,026
You're just feeling a little anger here

1952
02:05:03,121 --> 02:05:05,954
because you started to care about
old Aaron. I can understand that,

1953
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:10,125
but, you know, love hurts, Marty.
What can I say?

1954
02:05:11,045 --> 02:05:14,663
Hey, I'm just kidding, bud!
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings!

1955
02:05:14,757 --> 02:05:17,089
What else was I supposed to do?

1956
02:05:17,427 --> 02:05:18,917
Hey, you're gonna thank me
down the road,

1957
02:05:19,012 --> 02:05:21,925
'cause this is gonna toughen you
right up, Martin Vail!

1958
02:05:22,557 --> 02:05:25,470
You hear me? That's a promise!
