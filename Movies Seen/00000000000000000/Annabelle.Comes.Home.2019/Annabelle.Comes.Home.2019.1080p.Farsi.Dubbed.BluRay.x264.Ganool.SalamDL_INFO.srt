2
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,907
It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.

3
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:54,675
And through that,

4
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:56,309
the inhuman spirit
tricked you.

5
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:59,046
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.

6
00:00:59,048 --> 00:01:01,348
What's an inhuman spirit?

7
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,416
It's something
that's never

8
00:01:02,418 --> 00:01:05,218
walked the earth
in human form.

9
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,720
It's something demonic.

10
00:01:06,722 --> 00:01:10,123
So,
the doll was never possessed?

11
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:13,027
No,
it was used as a conduit.

12
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:15,896
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

13
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:18,699
Demonic spirits
don't possess things.

14
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:20,768
They possess people.

15
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,170
It wanted to
get inside of you.

16
00:01:23,172 --> 00:01:26,273
And given
this unusual feature,

17
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:28,875
the doll will need to be
properly cared for.

18
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:30,277
- Cared for?
- Mmm-hmm.

19
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:31,948
It should be destroyed.

20
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,351
That would
only make things worse.

21
00:01:37,353 --> 00:01:39,789
We think it best
the doll come with us.

22
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:43,423
We'll keep it somewhere safe.

23
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:45,926
That sounds like
a great idea.

24
00:01:45,928 --> 00:01:47,262
She's all yours.

How much longer,
do you think?

33
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:14,020
Eh, about an hour.

34
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:15,923
Why don't you put your
head back? Get some rest.

35
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:19,092
No, you get lost coming home
from the supermarket.

36
00:02:19,094 --> 00:02:22,795
If I do that,
we might end up in California.

37
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:24,997
Well, so you wake up
to the sound of the Pacific.

38
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:27,067
Nothing wrong with that.

39
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:28,869
I'll pick up Judy
on the way.

40
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:31,337
Ah, that actually sounds
so nice, Ed.

41
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:32,975
We should plan on it.

42
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:34,377
Uh-oh.

43
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:37,279
What's this?

44
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:50,360
You folks need to turn around.
Pretty bad accident up ahead.

45
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:53,393
Uh, anything we can do?

46
00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:55,262
You a doctor or something?

47
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:56,800
Or something.

48
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:02,168
He just meant if you need
an extra set of hands.

49
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,436
Yeah.

50
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:05,240
We got it covered. Thanks.

51
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,182
Nice doll.

52
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:14,183
That's what you think.

53
00:03:16,518 --> 00:03:19,353
All right, you're gonna head
three miles back to the last exit.

54
00:03:19,355 --> 00:03:22,555
You'll hop on 26,
that'll loop you around.

55
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:24,424
- 26. Got it.
- Thank you, Officer.

56
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:29,499
A guy and his doll.

57
00:03:46,147 --> 00:03:48,080
I think we missed our turn.

58
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:50,584
We didn't miss it.
Bridgewater's just up ahead.

59
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:52,418
Bridgewater?
Old Ridge Road.

60
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,889
Where did you get
Bridgewater from?

61
00:03:55,857 --> 00:03:58,128
Well, you know what?
I think we missed our turn.

62
00:04:00,295 --> 00:04:02,829
I'll keep my eye out
for the Pacific.

63
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:06,236
Ed?

64
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:10,038
- Ed?
- Hang on, hang on.

65
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:21,785
- Come on.
- What just happened?

66
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:25,387
Uh... I'll pop the hood
and find out.

67
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:31,426
Well, be careful.

68
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:46,475
There we go.

69
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:06,119
I like your doll.

70
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:30,012
I feel cold.

71
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:45,561
You were
just in an accident.

72
00:06:48,262 --> 00:06:49,431
I was?

73
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:54,504
Sorry. Wires crossed.

74
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:12,421
That should do it.

75
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:16,992
Honey, you okay?

76
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,138
Ed!

77
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:34,644
I'm okay.

78
00:07:36,678 --> 00:07:37,876
I'm so sorry!

79
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:40,112
All of a sudden it was like
somebody took over my truck.

80
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:42,248
I had no control.
Are you okay?

81
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,286
I'm fine.

82
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,991
It's the doll, Ed.

83
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:52,729
It's a beacon
for other spirits.

84
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,089
Over here.

85
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:49,611
Father, sooner the better.
Yeah?

86
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:51,146
Yeah.

87
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:06,560
Be not wise
in thine own eyes.

88
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:09,863
Fear the Lord
and depart from evil.

89
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:16,235
The curse of the Lord is
in the house of the wicked.

90
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:20,342
But He blesseth
the habitation of the just.

91
00:10:21,443 --> 00:10:24,444
Surely,
He scorneth the scorners,

92
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:28,681
but He giveth grace
unto the lowly.

93
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:31,917
The wise shall inherit
the glory,

94
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,159
but shame shall be
the promotion of fools.

95
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,231
Amen.

96
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,784
We need another
barrier of protection.

97
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:03,785
A holy one.

98
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:06,389
I agree.

99
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:09,725
The blessing
will only do so much.

100
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:14,728
That chapel glass

101
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,663
we got from Trinity Church
before it was torn down,

102
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:18,733
where is that?

103
00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:40,887
"Let us forgive those

104
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:42,489
who trespass against us

105
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:44,492
and lead us
not into temptation,

106
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:46,526
but deliver us from evil."

107
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:47,529
Amen.

108
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:00,976
Did it work?

109
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:09,751
Hmm. The evil is contained.

You're my hero.

131
00:14:23,485 --> 00:14:24,683
The pizza money
is on the counter

132
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:25,984
and numbers are by the phone.

133
00:14:25,986 --> 00:14:27,019
Perfect.

134
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:28,153
And we'll be back
early tomorrow morning.

135
00:14:28,155 --> 00:14:31,590
Well, and take your time,
we'll be fine. Right, Judy?

136
00:14:31,592 --> 00:14:33,526
Yeah.

137
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:35,595
- So, you'll...
- Behave? Yes.

138
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:36,696
And you'll remember
to go to...

139
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:37,830
Remember to go to bed
on time.

140
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:39,532
Absolutely.

141
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:41,099
- All right, don't forget to...
- To have fun.

142
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:42,141
- I know.
- That, too.

143
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:46,806
Did you guys rehearse that,
or what?

144
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,656
Earth to Judy!

145
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:04,794
What's wrong?

146
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:06,558
Nothing.

147
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,662
I'm fine.

148
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:11,498
Well, it's just a couple more
hours until the weekend.

149
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,599
I'm gonna run to the market

150
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:13,666
for supplies
during my free period.

151
00:15:13,668 --> 00:15:14,828
I'll pick you up after, okay?

152
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:18,640
Sounds super.

153
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:24,847
Bye, Judy!

154
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:29,018
Have a good day!

155
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:30,843
Mrs. Faley,
it's right over here.

156
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:31,847
Let me show you.

157
00:16:34,582 --> 00:16:35,648
How could you not tell me

158
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,816
what the Warrens did
for a living?

159
00:16:36,818 --> 00:16:38,317
Shouldn't you be
in math class?

160
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:39,918
Mary Ellen!

161
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,921
I babysat the Smiths
for over two years

162
00:16:41,923 --> 00:16:43,122
and never told you
what they did.

163
00:16:43,124 --> 00:16:44,691
Oh, what do they do?

164
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:46,091
They're podiatrists.

165
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:47,759
So not the same.

166
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:49,762
Well, obviously,
I'm coming over later.

167
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:51,229
We do have
that social studies project

168
00:16:51,231 --> 00:16:52,898
- that we need to work on.
- Uh...

169
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,334
We don't have any project.

170
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:55,770
Okay, but how would
they know?

171
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,670
She's psychic.

172
00:16:57,672 --> 00:16:59,806
Then, they're heroes.

173
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:01,373
I think
they're concerned parents

174
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,874
who wouldn't want
negative influences

175
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:04,009
around their child.

176
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:05,677
What negative influence?

177
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,613
'Cause I sometimes
stay out past curfew?

178
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:09,815
Among other things.

179
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:11,317
So, what's it like
inside the house?

180
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,785
Is it all creepy music
and cobwebs?

181
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:15,355
No. No, it's boring suburbia.

182
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:17,026
The inside
of your locker is scarier.

183
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:23,196
Wait. Whose party,
and why wasn't I invited?

184
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:24,363
Judy's birthday is coming up,

185
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:26,232
so we're gonna
celebrate early.

186
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:29,101
You really are the best
babysitter, you know that?

187
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:31,204
Compliments will
get you nowhere.

188
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:32,371
What about threats?

189
00:17:32,373 --> 00:17:35,675
Did you, uh, happen to notice
who's working checkout?

190
00:17:35,677 --> 00:17:37,644
- Have a good one.
- Will do.

191
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:39,044
- Thank you so much.
- See you soon.

192
00:17:39,046 --> 00:17:40,178
You wouldn't.

193
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,781
You know what they call him,
right?

194
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:43,686
- Have a good one.
- What?

195
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:50,023
Bob's-Got-Balls.

196
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:51,157
How you doing?

197
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:52,261
Hi, Daniela.

198
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:01,199
Uh...

199
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:04,670
- Hi, Mary Ellen.
- Is this everything?

200
00:18:04,672 --> 00:18:06,839
- I think so.
- Oh, cool.

201
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:08,073
You live near the Warrens,
don't you, Bob?

202
00:18:08,075 --> 00:18:09,109
Uh...

203
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:12,177
Yeah, Mary Ellen's babysitting
for them tonight.

204
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,714
Yeah. Yeah, I live
right across the street.

205
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:17,050
Do you ever see
anything scary over there?

206
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:18,885
Like a ghost, maybe?

207
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:20,119
Bob...

208
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:21,154
Mrs. Faley went ahead

209
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:23,689
and dropped a can
of tomato sauce in aisle five,

210
00:18:23,691 --> 00:18:26,826
and it looks like a crime
scene, so get the mop.

211
00:18:26,828 --> 00:18:28,093
Ladies. Did you find
everything okay?

212
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:29,128
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yes, sir.

213
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,230
Bob here is not giving you
any trouble, is he?

214
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:32,197
- No.
- No.

215
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,465
- Yeah, I got it. Thanks, Dad.
- All right.

216
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,267
I'll do it right after.

217
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:36,671
So, what'd you see?

218
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:39,839
At the Warrens'?

219
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:41,407
Uh, nothing. Nothing.

220
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:44,010
Um, your total is $3.50, so...

221
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:45,014
Oh.

222
00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:48,147
But you knew
what the Warrens did?

223
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:50,750
There were rumors,
I guess, but...

224
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:52,350
Rumors. Interesting.

225
00:18:52,352 --> 00:18:55,221
Did you know there's a rumor
going around about you, Bob?

226
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:57,490
- Wait, really?
- What is it about?

227
00:18:57,492 --> 00:18:59,058
Uh, it's about a girl
who has a...

228
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,996
Fine. You can come.
Stop.

229
00:19:02,796 --> 00:19:04,796
- Oh. Sorry.
- Sorry.

230
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:07,065
- That's totally my fault.
- It's okay.

231
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:09,202
Um... So, what...

232
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:10,436
Bye, Bob. Thanks.

233
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:11,439
Bye.

234
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:15,343
Uh, she forgot her eggs, so...

235
00:19:16,076 --> 00:19:17,443
Here.

236
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:18,947
She likes you.

237
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,453
There's been an accident.

238
00:19:35,964 --> 00:19:37,099
Don't touch her.

239
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:39,432
You'll get obsessed.

240
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:41,367
- It's "possessed."
- That's what I said.

241
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:43,836
Anyways, if you know so much,

242
00:19:43,838 --> 00:19:44,704
why don't you tell us

243
00:19:44,706 --> 00:19:46,375
if you can catch cooties
from a ghost?

244
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:48,241
You can't.

245
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:49,942
Well, then how'd you get 'em?

246
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:51,476
Anthony Rios!

247
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:53,114
Don't make me
get your sister.

248
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,013
Please don't.

249
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:57,516
Then go. All of you.
Come on.

250
00:19:57,518 --> 00:19:59,952
Come on. Let's go!

251
00:19:59,954 --> 00:20:02,124
I'm sorry I can't come
to your birthday party, Judy.

252
00:20:03,824 --> 00:20:05,358
You can't either?

253
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,025
My parents said
I'm not really prepared

254
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:08,296
to process death yet.

255
00:20:10,297 --> 00:20:11,997
It's a birthday party.

256
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:13,034
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:28,214
Hey, how long
has that been happening?

258
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:30,319
Since everyone heard about
the article this week.

259
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:32,885
Please don't tell my parents.

260
00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:35,487
I won't.
I won't as long as you do.

261
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:37,490
- I don't want them to worry.
- They're parents.

262
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:38,558
They're worried
about everything

263
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,062
whether they need to be
or not.

264
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:47,833
Are you sure the bullying is

265
00:20:47,835 --> 00:20:49,467
the only thing
that's bothering you?

266
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:50,969
That isn't bothering me.

267
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:52,273
You know what I mean.

268
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:00,448
And remember our deal.
No secrets.

269
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:02,849
I know.

270
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:04,052
I don't have any.

271
00:21:05,553 --> 00:21:07,222
What did you get
at the store?

272
00:21:07,956 --> 00:21:09,321
A surprise.

273
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:12,224
- You said no secrets.
- A surprise isn't a secret.

274
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:15,397
- What is it then?
- It's a surprise.

275
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:23,301
<i>♪ I remember
Finding out about you ♪</i>

276
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:33,181
You're gonna make a mess.

277
00:21:38,052 --> 00:21:39,551
Hey! Save some for the cake.

278
00:21:39,553 --> 00:21:40,956
No.

279
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:50,064
I think
there's someone at the door.

280
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:05,911
I was knocking on the door
for, like, ten minutes.

281
00:22:05,913 --> 00:22:08,046
How did you even get in?

282
00:22:08,048 --> 00:22:10,249
Back door.
Is this a spirit bell?

283
00:22:10,251 --> 00:22:11,917
What's a spirit bell?

284
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,352
It tells you if you're in
the presence of any spirits.

285
00:22:14,354 --> 00:22:16,155
- So, it is one.
- No.

286
00:22:16,157 --> 00:22:18,557
It's just a bell.
My mom collects them.

287
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,095
Oh.

288
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:22,093
Who are you?

289
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:25,164
She's Daniela,
and she leaves after cake.

290
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,499
Oh, good!

291
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:27,636
I love cake.

292
00:22:29,036 --> 00:22:31,102
So, Judy.

293
00:22:31,104 --> 00:22:35,176
Don't your parents, like, keep
any creepy stuff around?

294
00:22:37,078 --> 00:22:38,444
No.

295
00:22:38,446 --> 00:22:40,882
They keep it all locked away
in a room.

296
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:45,350
Well, can we at least
go in and look?

297
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:46,487
No!

298
00:22:48,121 --> 00:22:50,425
It's not really good
for anyone to go in there.

299
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:52,260
How come?

300
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:54,630
Just isn't.

301
00:22:56,197 --> 00:22:57,198
Wait.

302
00:22:58,565 --> 00:23:00,099
Here.

303
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:01,102
Birthday present.

304
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:06,272
What is it?

305
00:23:06,274 --> 00:23:07,441
Look inside.

306
00:23:14,614 --> 00:23:16,215
How did you
even afford those?

307
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:17,349
They're my old ones.

308
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:19,217
But I only ever used them once
'cause I broke my arm

309
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:21,219
the first time I put them on.

310
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:22,355
You're kidding.

311
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:25,256
She looks
way more coordinated.

312
00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:26,692
They're gonna ruin the floors.

313
00:23:26,694 --> 00:23:29,028
Can we go around
the block, then?

314
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,730
- I don't think...
- Good idea.

315
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:31,830
You guys go.

316
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:33,936
I'll watch the cake
and make sure it doesn't burn.

317
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:38,137
Fine. But don't snoop.
Don't touch.

318
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:40,071
Don't do anything. Please?

319
00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:42,044
Stay in the kitchen.
Promise me.

320
00:23:42,543 --> 00:23:43,712
I promise.

321
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:25,451
Fuck it.

322
00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:28,290
I am calling out to the
spirits on the other side.

323
00:24:29,357 --> 00:24:31,526
Please unlock this door
and let me in.

324
00:24:46,173 --> 00:24:47,341
Shit.

325
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:14,261
Please don't judge me.

326
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:19,266
Amen.

327
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:39,621
Whoa.

328
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:51,365
Whoa.

329
00:28:09,476 --> 00:28:11,545
What'd you do
to get in there?

330
00:30:14,034 --> 00:30:16,571
If there is a presence here
in this room,

331
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,474
please give me a sign.

332
00:30:24,477 --> 00:30:25,679
Any sign at all.

333
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:32,519
Dad?

334
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:46,433
This is stupid.

335
00:32:28,101 --> 00:32:29,102
Shit.

336
00:33:02,835 --> 00:33:04,770
You burnt the cake? Daniela.

337
00:33:04,772 --> 00:33:06,304
Only the top.

338
00:33:06,306 --> 00:33:08,639
Just put frosting on it.

339
00:33:08,641 --> 00:33:10,108
She'll never know.

340
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,142
How'd it go with the skates?

341
00:33:11,144 --> 00:33:12,778
She loved them until she fell
on the way back

342
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,245
and skinned her knee.

343
00:33:14,247 --> 00:33:15,813
Better than breaking her arm.

344
00:33:15,815 --> 00:33:17,014
Where is she anyway?

345
00:33:17,016 --> 00:33:19,184
She's out
feeding the chickens.

346
00:33:19,186 --> 00:33:21,019
They have chickens?

347
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,226
Hey. How's your knee?

348
00:33:26,826 --> 00:33:27,993
Oh.

349
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:31,163
Looks like your jeans will
at least need some stitches.

350
00:33:31,165 --> 00:33:32,296
It's okay.

351
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:33,734
Accidents happen.

352
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,774
So, are you scared yet?

353
00:33:40,841 --> 00:33:42,808
Scared? What? No.

354
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,609
Who says they're scared?

355
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:46,677
Kids in my class.

356
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,379
Anthony Rios started it.

357
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:49,715
I hate him.

358
00:33:49,717 --> 00:33:52,120
Wait. Tony Rios started it?

359
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,589
Do you know him?

360
00:33:55,121 --> 00:33:57,923
Yeah, he's my brother.

361
00:33:57,925 --> 00:34:01,025
Anthony Rios is your brother?

362
00:34:01,027 --> 00:34:03,294
Yeah, I know.
Don't hold it against me.

363
00:34:03,296 --> 00:34:05,763
I don't like him either.

364
00:34:05,765 --> 00:34:07,669
You know,
he still wets the bed.

365
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:10,135
You didn't hear it from me.

366
00:34:10,137 --> 00:34:11,839
Or maybe you did,
I don't care.

367
00:34:12,405 --> 00:34:14,071
Still, just...

368
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:15,776
go a little easy on him.

369
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,780
It's been a tough year.

370
00:34:21,948 --> 00:34:24,651
You lost somebody,
didn't you?

371
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,921
My dad. Uh...

372
00:34:28,722 --> 00:34:30,658
Did Mary Ellen tell you?

373
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:33,061
No.

374
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:35,162
I just knew.

375
00:34:37,296 --> 00:34:39,430
Um, for delivery.

376
00:34:39,432 --> 00:34:42,267
Could I do one large, please?

377
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:45,740
Um, it's gonna be
3506 Wayman Street.

378
00:34:46,907 --> 00:34:48,642
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

379
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:54,445
Coming.

380
00:34:56,883 --> 00:34:58,385
Hold your horses.

381
00:35:07,927 --> 00:35:09,162
Who is it?

382
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:16,336
Hello?

383
00:35:18,005 --> 00:35:19,340
Daniela?

384
00:35:27,947 --> 00:35:29,383
Is Annabelle there?

385
00:35:37,224 --> 00:35:38,923
Who?

386
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:41,061
Can Annabelle
come out to play?

387
00:35:55,175 --> 00:35:56,408
I think you have
the wrong house.

388
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,112
There's no Annabelle here.

389
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,347
Yes, she is.

390
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:04,385
She's right behind you.

391
00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:18,195
People are just...
They're really weird about death.

392
00:36:18,197 --> 00:36:20,465
That's probably why the kids
pick on you at school.

393
00:36:20,467 --> 00:36:22,367
It scares them.

394
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:24,836
They treat it like it's some
disease they don't wanna get,

395
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:26,707
even though
everyone already has it.

396
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:29,774
But here's the thing.

397
00:36:29,776 --> 00:36:31,443
I used to think
it was fatal and whammo.

398
00:36:31,445 --> 00:36:32,778
It's, like, out.

399
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,945
Like turning off a TV.

400
00:36:34,947 --> 00:36:36,247
Then I learned
about your parents

401
00:36:36,249 --> 00:36:37,349
and their whole exploration

402
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:39,119
into the afterlife
and stuff...

403
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:42,923
and they gave me hope.

404
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:47,427
That maybe
life goes on somehow.

405
00:36:49,162 --> 00:36:50,164
Maybe...

406
00:36:51,164 --> 00:36:54,936
my darling dad
is still out there somewhere.

407
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,369
"Darling dad"?

408
00:36:57,371 --> 00:36:59,171
It was a thing.

409
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:02,176
He was darling dad,
and I was darling Daniela...

410
00:37:03,276 --> 00:37:04,345
Stupid.

411
00:37:06,012 --> 00:37:07,781
He's still out there,
you know.

412
00:37:08,948 --> 00:37:10,548
You think so?

413
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,486
My parents
would say he is, too.

414
00:37:33,173 --> 00:37:34,872
Where are you going?

415
00:37:34,874 --> 00:37:36,244
Be right back.

416
00:37:48,354 --> 00:37:49,523
Dad?

417
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,008
Daniela?

418
00:38:17,617 --> 00:38:19,550
Daniela!

419
00:38:19,552 --> 00:38:22,553
Where did she go?

420
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:23,555
What are you doing?

421
00:38:23,557 --> 00:38:26,060
Daniela, you're not supposed
to go down there!

422
00:38:28,195 --> 00:38:30,564
- What are you doing?
- I thought I saw something.

423
00:38:33,566 --> 00:38:34,835
What did you see?

424
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:39,970
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

425
00:41:11,724 --> 00:41:12,726
Judy?

426
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:22,669
Judy?

427
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,642
Judy?

428
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,184
Judy?

429
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:44,222
In thee, O Lord,
do I put my trust.

430
00:41:44,224 --> 00:41:45,823
Let me never be
put to confusion.

431
00:41:45,825 --> 00:41:47,624
Deliver me into
Thy righteousness

432
00:41:47,626 --> 00:41:49,294
and cause me to escape.
Incline Thine ear...

433
00:41:49,296 --> 00:41:51,162
Hey! Hey, Judy! Judy.

434
00:41:51,164 --> 00:41:52,600
What's going on? What's wrong?

435
00:41:54,568 --> 00:41:56,102
What's going on?

436
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:00,741
What happened?

437
00:42:01,874 --> 00:42:03,043
Nothing.

438
00:42:03,376 --> 00:42:04,512
Judy...

439
00:42:06,813 --> 00:42:08,613
I just got scared.

440
00:42:08,615 --> 00:42:10,517
Scared of what?

441
00:42:14,354 --> 00:42:15,656
Sometimes...

442
00:42:16,655 --> 00:42:18,356
I see things.

443
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:20,361
Like how my mom sees things.

444
00:42:24,631 --> 00:42:27,101
You mean like ghosts?

445
00:42:31,905 --> 00:42:33,707
Where do you see them?

446
00:42:35,675 --> 00:42:37,311
Everywhere I go.

447
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,718
Judy...

448
00:42:46,418 --> 00:42:48,753
Ghosts used to be people.

449
00:42:48,755 --> 00:42:51,392
And not every person
you meet is bad...

450
00:42:52,892 --> 00:42:56,229
so maybe not all ghosts
are bad, either.

451
00:43:06,439 --> 00:43:07,441
Daniela.

452
00:43:08,575 --> 00:43:10,508
- You have to see this.
- What?

453
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,744
It's this case the Warrens
investigated about this girl

454
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:14,812
who was terrorized by
something called the Ferryman.

455
00:43:14,814 --> 00:43:16,648
Here's a picture
of the girl he killed.

456
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:17,916
Look familiar?

457
00:43:17,918 --> 00:43:19,753
I mean,
you two could be sisters.

458
00:43:22,822 --> 00:43:25,825
Here's the rest of the file,
if you want to take a look.

459
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:34,901
Look at all this stuff.

460
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:42,740
How cool.

461
00:43:42,742 --> 00:43:45,410
Okay, this is the file
on the Black Shuck.

462
00:43:45,412 --> 00:43:46,445
The Black Shuck?

463
00:43:46,447 --> 00:43:48,379
It was a case
the Warrens investigated

464
00:43:48,381 --> 00:43:50,618
about a hellhound that
possessed a man in England.

465
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:53,920
He terrorized the shit
out of this town.

466
00:44:04,231 --> 00:44:05,799
What's with the coins
over their eyes?

467
00:44:06,932 --> 00:44:07,934
What?

468
00:44:09,668 --> 00:44:11,001
Oh, I don't know.
I didn't get that far.

469
00:44:11,003 --> 00:44:13,370
They used to put them
over the eyes of the dead

470
00:44:13,372 --> 00:44:14,439
to pay the Ferryman,
so he could

471
00:44:14,441 --> 00:44:16,374
take their souls
to the underworld.

472
00:44:16,376 --> 00:44:17,742
It was his toll.

473
00:44:17,744 --> 00:44:19,811
Okay, we should go.

474
00:44:19,813 --> 00:44:22,512
It's okay. I sometimes
like to snoop, too.

475
00:44:22,514 --> 00:44:24,948
Do you know
what this does, Judy?

476
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:27,253
I think it's called
a Mourner's Bracelet.

477
00:44:29,622 --> 00:44:32,726
It helps you contact
your lost loved ones.

478
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:42,966
- What's that?
- Um...

479
00:44:42,968 --> 00:44:45,606
It's a case my parents
investigated recently.

480
00:44:46,472 --> 00:44:47,905
The wedding dress.

481
00:44:47,907 --> 00:44:49,510
It haunts people.

482
00:44:50,577 --> 00:44:53,380
And it makes them violent.

483
00:44:55,014 --> 00:44:56,546
Where is the dress now?

484
00:44:56,548 --> 00:44:57,908
Down the hall
in the artifact room.

485
00:45:01,354 --> 00:45:03,991
I mean, that's where
all this stuff is.

486
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:05,524
Right, Judy?

487
00:45:05,526 --> 00:45:07,761
- That's what you said earlier.
- Oh, um...

488
00:45:08,028 --> 00:45:09,359
Yeah.

489
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:11,595
My dad says
that everything in there

490
00:45:11,597 --> 00:45:14,999
is either haunted, cursed,

491
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:18,436
or used in some
ritualistic practice.

492
00:45:18,438 --> 00:45:19,870
What about the doll
that's in there?

493
00:45:19,872 --> 00:45:21,305
Because I read this interview
with your dad...

494
00:45:21,307 --> 00:45:22,309
No.

495
00:45:24,677 --> 00:45:26,313
Don't talk about her.

496
00:45:29,515 --> 00:45:30,517
Why not?

497
00:45:34,753 --> 00:45:36,956
She's in a case for a reason.

498
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:40,024
Okay, we should go.

499
00:45:40,026 --> 00:45:41,091
I wonder what's on this.

500
00:45:41,093 --> 00:45:42,827
No, Daniela! Wait!

501
00:45:44,631 --> 00:45:47,398
<i>I command you,
unclean spirit,</i>

502
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,033
<i>along with all your minions...</i>

503
00:45:49,035 --> 00:45:50,635
<i>I command you</i>

504
00:45:50,637 --> 00:45:52,706
<i>to obey me to the letter!</i>

505
00:45:57,343 --> 00:46:00,378
Okay, show's over.
Let's go do something else.

506
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,414
Do something that's
actually appropriate.

507
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:04,448
Come on,

508
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,330
don't you at least wanna hear
about the samurai?

509
00:46:12,858 --> 00:46:14,358
What about this one?

510
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,059
I don't remember that one.

511
00:46:16,061 --> 00:46:17,330
How do you play?

512
00:46:17,863 --> 00:46:19,733
Let's find out.

513
00:46:26,572 --> 00:46:28,740
Okay. Okay,
so you draw a card

514
00:46:28,742 --> 00:46:30,041
and whatever picture
it has on it

515
00:46:30,043 --> 00:46:31,376
is the object you try to find

516
00:46:31,378 --> 00:46:33,044
by feeling around
inside the box.

517
00:46:33,046 --> 00:46:34,979
If the object you pull out
matches the picture,

518
00:46:34,981 --> 00:46:35,983
then you get a point.

519
00:46:38,885 --> 00:46:40,385
You go first.

520
00:46:40,387 --> 00:46:41,455
Okay.

521
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,856
You gonna get that?

522
00:47:17,023 --> 00:47:18,655
Yeah.

523
00:47:18,657 --> 00:47:20,758
Sorry, you guys keep playing.

524
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,794
Oh, got a point.

525
00:47:23,662 --> 00:47:24,664
Nice.

526
00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:48,155
Hello?

527
00:48:06,206 --> 00:48:07,441
Hi, Mary Ellen.

528
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:09,707
Hi.

529
00:48:09,709 --> 00:48:11,242
Remember how, at the store,

530
00:48:11,244 --> 00:48:13,176
Daniela said that
you were babysitting here?

531
00:48:13,178 --> 00:48:14,479
Yeah. Yeah.

532
00:48:14,481 --> 00:48:15,515
Me, too.

533
00:48:16,215 --> 00:48:18,151
Anyways, that's why I'm here.

534
00:48:18,651 --> 00:48:19,684
Oh.

535
00:48:19,686 --> 00:48:24,254
Bob, they don't really want me
having boys over.

536
00:48:24,256 --> 00:48:26,724
No, that's not what I meant.
I don't wanna come in.

537
00:48:26,726 --> 00:48:28,091
I just, uh...

538
00:48:28,093 --> 00:48:29,160
I mean, I would, but...

539
00:48:29,162 --> 00:48:31,131
Well...

540
00:48:32,164 --> 00:48:35,198
I just knew you were
gonna be here,

541
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,503
and I just wanted to come by
and talk to you

542
00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:40,171
without my stupid dad
or somebody interrupting.

543
00:48:40,173 --> 00:48:42,138
Bob's-Got-Balls!

544
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,544
Nice.

545
00:48:45,278 --> 00:48:46,780
You two sharing some pizza?

546
00:48:48,747 --> 00:48:50,684
- I should get the money.
- Yeah.

547
00:48:52,785 --> 00:48:54,818
Are you two, like...

548
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,988
I... I wish.

549
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:59,959
You know you need to, like,
woo her, right?

550
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,827
- Woo her?
- Yeah.

551
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:07,030
Guys like Mary Ellen,
they need to be wooed.

552
00:49:07,032 --> 00:49:09,166
You mean
girls like Mary Ellen.

553
00:49:09,168 --> 00:49:10,600
What did I say?

554
00:49:10,602 --> 00:49:11,702
Guys.

555
00:49:13,006 --> 00:49:14,872
So, how do I woo her?

556
00:49:14,874 --> 00:49:17,541
There's only one way to woo.

557
00:49:17,543 --> 00:49:18,811
It's obvious.

558
00:49:19,278 --> 00:49:20,947
Rock and roll.

559
00:49:24,217 --> 00:49:25,615
Here. Keep it.

560
00:49:25,617 --> 00:49:26,550
Sweet.

561
00:49:26,552 --> 00:49:29,186
Thanks, and that means
you can keep this.

562
00:49:29,188 --> 00:49:32,023
Minus one slice.

563
00:49:32,025 --> 00:49:34,191
I enjoyed that in the car.

564
00:49:34,193 --> 00:49:35,562
See you later, Balls.

565
00:49:36,662 --> 00:49:39,062
I would invite you in,
but like I said...

566
00:49:39,064 --> 00:49:40,698
No, yeah, it's cool.

567
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,203
I thought I'd just stop by
and say hi, I guess, so...

568
00:49:44,202 --> 00:49:45,671
I'm glad you did.

569
00:49:46,305 --> 00:49:47,673
Me, too.

570
00:49:50,742 --> 00:49:53,144
Hey, Bob, um...

571
00:49:53,146 --> 00:49:54,814
How come they call you that?

572
00:49:56,215 --> 00:49:57,648
Um...

573
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:59,649
Well, you know how
I'm the equipments manager

574
00:49:59,651 --> 00:50:00,686
for the basketball team?

575
00:50:01,588 --> 00:50:02,754
- Yeah.
- That's why.

576
00:50:02,756 --> 00:50:05,789
There's not really, like,
a story or anything behind it.

577
00:50:05,791 --> 00:50:07,124
Just like,
"Hey, I need balls."

578
00:50:07,126 --> 00:50:09,794
I'm, like,
"I got it. Balls. Got 'em."

579
00:50:13,298 --> 00:50:14,865
I'll see woo later.

580
00:50:14,867 --> 00:50:16,200
You. You. I'll see you later.

581
00:50:16,202 --> 00:50:17,803
I'm gonna go.

582
00:50:18,905 --> 00:50:20,070
Bye, Bob.

583
00:50:20,072 --> 00:50:21,173
Bye.

584
00:50:32,619 --> 00:50:33,818

640
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:38,832
No!

641

Bob?

642
00:54:51,142 --> 00:54:52,075
He left.

643
00:54:52,077 --> 00:54:54,912
Hmm, hopefully he went home
to practice.

644
00:54:54,914 --> 00:54:56,546
Okay. Back up to bed.

645
00:54:56,548 --> 00:54:57,983
- Daniela.
- Yeah, yeah.

646
00:55:04,657 --> 00:55:06,256
I'd feel better
if you let me stay.

647
00:55:06,258 --> 00:55:07,390
I can wake up early.

648
00:55:07,392 --> 00:55:08,925
We don't even
have to tell Judy.

649
00:55:08,927 --> 00:55:10,126
No. No, it's fine.

650
00:55:10,128 --> 00:55:11,130
Go home.

651
00:55:12,264 --> 00:55:13,463
But...

652
00:55:13,465 --> 00:55:15,265
But what?

653
00:55:15,267 --> 00:55:16,666
Thank you for coming.

654
00:55:16,668 --> 00:55:19,470
I actually think
it helped Judy a lot.

655
00:55:19,472 --> 00:55:20,970
Sorry you didn't get to see
any cobwebs

656
00:55:20,972 --> 00:55:22,071
or hear any creepy music.

657
00:55:22,073 --> 00:55:24,441
Well, the Bob thing
was kind of creepy, at least.

658
00:55:25,577 --> 00:55:28,412
But if Bob comes knocking
on this door late at night,

659
00:55:28,414 --> 00:55:30,546
forget you're you for a minute
and let him in.

660
00:55:33,251 --> 00:55:35,188
Call me tomorrow
and tell me the details.

661
00:55:36,188 --> 00:55:37,590
There will be
no details to tell.

662
00:56:03,081 --> 00:56:04,083
Shit.

663
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,269
How'd her dad die?

664
00:57:32,037 --> 00:57:34,506
I don't know if that's
the best bedtime story.

665
00:57:35,508 --> 00:57:37,474
Look who my parents are.

666
00:57:37,476 --> 00:57:38,711
I'm used to it.

667
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:41,311
Well,

668
00:57:41,313 --> 00:57:45,448
the short of it is that
he died in a car accident.

669
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:48,121
And the long of it is that...

670
00:57:48,753 --> 00:57:50,723
Daniela was driving.

671
00:57:52,124 --> 00:57:53,724
Was it her fault?

672
00:57:53,726 --> 00:57:55,258
No.

673
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,459
There's only one person

674
00:57:56,461 --> 00:57:58,364
who actually thinks
it was her fault.

675
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:52,412
Okay.

676
00:59:53,211 --> 00:59:54,680
Let's try this again.

677
00:59:57,916 --> 00:59:59,850
If there is
a presence here...

678
01:00:39,224 --> 01:00:40,226
Dad?

679
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,794
Dad?

680
01:01:55,334 --> 01:01:56,432
You did this to me!

681
01:01:56,434 --> 01:01:58,901
It's all your fault!

682
01:01:58,903 --> 01:02:00,771
Get back here!

683
01:02:00,773 --> 01:02:02,472
You did this to me!

684
01:02:44,483 --> 01:02:45,816
No, no, no. Please.

685
01:02:45,818 --> 01:02:46,916
Please, no, no. Don't go.

686
01:02:46,918 --> 01:02:47,919
Don't go.

687
01:02:55,494 --> 01:02:56,760
No, no, no. No, come here.

688
01:02:56,762 --> 01:02:58,430
Come here, come here.
No. No.

689
01:03:09,073 --> 01:03:10,443

713
01:08:55,954 --> 01:09:00,390

we both woke up to a noise.</i>

714
01:09:00,392 --> 01:09:03,262

715
01:09:05,162 --> 01:09:06,732

717
01:09:11,969 --> 01:09:13,438

718
01:09:14,807 --> 01:09:18,277

01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:35,391
<i>It was like he was...</i>

724
01:09:35,393 --> 01:09:38,761
<i>Like he was calling me.</i>

725
01:09:38,763 --> 01:09:40,331
<i>Have you ever seen
the Ferryman?</i>

726
01:09:42,299 --> 01:09:44,900
<i>If you don't pay his toll,</i>

727
01:09:44,902 --> 01:09:46,136
<i>he'll take your soul.</i>

728
01:09:48,506 --> 01:09:51,240
<i>If you don't pay his toll,
he'll take your soul.</i>

729
01:09:52,344 --> 01:09:54,377
<i>If you don't pay his toll,</i>

730
01:09:54,379 --> 01:09:55,511
<i>he'll take your soul.</i>

731
01:09:56,781 --> 01:10:00,048
<i>If you don't pay his toll,
he'll take your soul.</i>

732
01:10:01,318 --> 01:10:03,418
<i>If you don't pay his toll,
he'll take your soul.</i>

733
01:13:55,219 --> 01:13:57,121
Shit! Shit! Shit! No.

734
01:14:53,545 --> 01:14:55,414
Judy! Judy!

735
01:14:56,513 --> 01:14:57,814
Judy!

736
01:14:59,384 --> 01:15:01,350
Judy!

737
01:15:01,352 --> 01:15:03,488
Judy! Open the door, Judy!

738
01:16:50,594 --> 01:16:52,597
I like your dolls.

739
01:16:59,804 --> 01:17:01,306
Judy! Judy!

740
01:17:09,781 --> 01:17:11,783
Go out the back!

741
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:20,325
We're trapped.

742
01:17:25,929 --> 01:17:28,263
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Oh, thank God. Mrs. Warren?

743
01:17:28,265 --> 01:17:30,498
- Mom?
- <i>Mary Ellen? Judy?</i>

744
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,001
<i>Is everything okay?
What's going on?</i>

745
01:17:32,003 --> 01:17:34,002
Judy's fine. Um...

746
01:17:34,004 --> 01:17:36,838
Something is happening
inside your house

747
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,373
and I don't think
it's safe to go outside.

748
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:40,178
We're not really sure
what to do.

749
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:43,581
<i>Can I speak to Annabelle?</i>

750
01:17:47,652 --> 01:17:48,950
I'm sorry?

751
01:17:48,952 --> 01:17:51,322
<i>You need to give her
a soul, dear.</i>

752
01:17:53,491 --> 01:17:56,626
- What?
- <i>A soul. She wants her soul.</i>

753
01:17:57,795 --> 01:17:59,729
<i>Give me her soul.</i>

754
01:19:34,459 --> 01:19:36,359
Wait! Don't!

755
01:19:36,361 --> 01:19:37,927
I'm so sorry.

756
01:19:37,929 --> 01:19:39,462
What are you doing here?

757
01:19:59,817 --> 01:20:01,150
Annabelle.

758
01:20:01,152 --> 01:20:03,922
The doll. She's the one
who's doing all of this.

759
01:20:04,789 --> 01:20:06,555
A doll?

760
01:20:06,557 --> 01:20:09,327
She wants a soul.

761
01:20:16,067 --> 01:20:18,670
I just wanted
to see him again.

762
01:20:20,937 --> 01:20:23,773
What did you do?

763
01:20:23,775 --> 01:20:26,411
I wanted to tell him
I'm sorry.

764
01:20:27,178 --> 01:20:29,381
I know it was my fault.

765
01:20:30,046 --> 01:20:31,549
Daniela...

766
01:20:32,183 --> 01:20:33,618
what did you do?

767
01:20:36,754 --> 01:20:38,523
I let her out.

768
01:20:39,456 --> 01:20:41,625
What else did you touch?

769
01:20:45,463 --> 01:20:46,764
Everything.

770
01:20:53,771 --> 01:20:56,006
Run! Run! Go!

771
01:21:02,946 --> 01:21:05,114
Mary Ellen!

772
01:21:05,116 --> 01:21:07,716
It's her asthma.
She's having an attack.

773
01:21:07,718 --> 01:21:09,054
The inhaler's in her car.

774
01:21:09,754 --> 01:21:10,988
I'll go get it.

775
01:21:12,823 --> 01:21:14,058
No! Let me!

776
01:22:44,549 --> 01:22:45,917
Judy! Run!

777
01:23:07,071 --> 01:23:08,073
Mary Ellen!

778
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,842
Here.

779
01:23:13,044 --> 01:23:14,179
Are you okay?

780
01:23:20,017 --> 01:23:23,319
Where's Daniela?
She came after you.

781
01:23:23,321 --> 01:23:24,653
Mary Ellen?

782
01:23:24,655 --> 01:23:26,754
Judy? I'm up here.

783
01:23:26,756 --> 01:23:29,160
No. That's not Daniela.

784
01:23:30,695 --> 01:23:32,375
Something has a hold of her.
I can feel it.

785
01:23:38,035 --> 01:23:39,168
What do we do?

786
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:40,739
We have to find Annabelle.

787
01:23:41,772 --> 01:23:43,575
We have to put her back
in the case.

788
01:23:44,207 --> 01:23:45,809
Do you know where she is?

789
01:23:48,745 --> 01:23:49,747
No.

790
01:24:17,707 --> 01:24:19,076
Wait, wait, Judy, don't.

791
01:24:25,415 --> 01:24:27,251
Not all ghosts are bad.

792
01:24:28,753 --> 01:24:29,754
Right?

793
01:24:48,738 --> 01:24:50,578
Not all ghosts are bad.

794
01:24:51,776 --> 01:24:53,178
Not all ghosts are bad.

795
01:24:54,879 --> 01:24:56,180
Not all ghosts are bad.

796
01:24:57,348 --> 01:24:59,050
Not all ghosts are bad.

797
01:25:52,135 --> 01:25:53,671
What did you say?

798
01:25:54,237 --> 01:25:55,740
Come on, let's go.

799
01:26:21,499 --> 01:26:22,934
Come on.

800
01:26:37,947 --> 01:26:39,084
I'll get her.

801
01:26:45,188 --> 01:26:47,758
No, no, no.
No! Just stop!

802
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,293
Where do your parents
keep the key?

803
01:26:51,295 --> 01:26:52,731
I don't know.
It's never locked.

804
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:18,756
I know where the key is.

805
01:27:24,195 --> 01:27:26,097
- I'll get it.
- No! No, don't.

806
01:27:27,397 --> 01:27:28,766
I'll do it.

807
01:27:43,379 --> 01:27:44,381
Judy!

808
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,352
I got it.

809
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:22,583
Our Father, who art in heaven
hallowed be Thy name.

810
01:29:41,231 --> 01:29:42,599
Oh, my God.

811
01:30:24,474 --> 01:30:25,640
Give us this day
our daily bread,

812
01:30:25,642 --> 01:30:26,675
and forgive us
for our trespasses

813
01:30:26,677 --> 01:30:29,043
as we forgive those
who trespassed against us.

814
01:30:38,655 --> 01:30:39,724
Mary Ellen?

815
01:30:47,464 --> 01:30:48,466
Go!

816
01:30:55,671 --> 01:30:56,771
Daniela.

817
01:30:56,773 --> 01:30:58,293
Daniela, please!

818
01:31:09,186 --> 01:31:10,552
Daniela, stop!

819
01:31:16,727 --> 01:31:18,196
Stop!

820
01:31:30,506 --> 01:31:32,386
<i>I command you, unclean spirit,</i>

821
01:31:33,143 --> 01:31:34,842
<i>along with all your minions,</i>

822
01:31:34,844 --> 01:31:36,677
<i>now attacking
this servant of God.</i>

823
01:31:36,679 --> 01:31:39,681
- <i>I command you to obey me to the letter.</i>
- Judy, run!

824
01:31:39,683 --> 01:31:42,284
<i>In his name,
they will take up serpents...</i>

825
01:31:43,487 --> 01:31:45,656
<i>...with his hands
and condemn all evil.</i>

826
01:31:47,156 --> 01:31:50,158
<i>I command you,
unclean spirit,</i>

827
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:53,160
<i>along with all your minions,</i>

828
01:31:53,162 --> 01:31:56,631
<i>- To obey me to the letter.
- No, no.</i>

829
01:31:56,633 --> 01:31:58,300
<i>I, who am a servant of God...</i>

830
01:31:58,302 --> 01:32:01,168
<i>I command you,
unclean spirit,</i>

831
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:03,305
<i>along with all your minions,</i>

832
01:32:03,307 --> 01:32:05,376
<i>now attacking
this servant of God...</i>

833
01:32:30,299 --> 01:32:31,369
Judy!

834
01:32:48,785 --> 01:32:50,752
Judy! Judy. Judy.

835
01:32:50,754 --> 01:32:51,819
Get the doll!

836
01:32:59,729 --> 01:33:02,299
- Close it!
- I'm trying!

837
01:33:03,733 --> 01:33:05,367
Hurry!

838
01:33:10,473 --> 01:33:13,542
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

839
01:33:13,544 --> 01:33:14,943
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

840
01:33:14,945 --> 01:33:16,410
on earth as it is in heaven.

841
01:33:16,412 --> 01:33:17,811
Put her in!

842
01:33:17,813 --> 01:33:19,547
Give us this day
our daily bread,

843
01:33:19,549 --> 01:33:20,583
and forgive us
for our trespasses,

844
01:33:20,585 --> 01:33:23,450
as we forgive those
who trespassed against us,

845
01:33:23,452 --> 01:33:24,886
lead us not into temptation,

846
01:33:24,888 --> 01:33:26,357
but deliver us from evil...

847
01:33:30,259 --> 01:33:31,262
Amen.

848
01:33:39,937 --> 01:33:41,439
Is it over?

849
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:46,177
The evil has been contained.

850
01:33:52,415 --> 01:33:53,748
Bob?

851
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:56,517
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah. We're okay.

852
01:33:58,421 --> 01:33:59,620
- Are you okay?
- No!

853
01:33:59,622 --> 01:34:01,259
There was a werewolf outside!

854
01:34:01,857 --> 01:34:03,494
You saw the werewolf?

855
01:34:04,327 --> 01:34:05,793
Yeah.

856
01:34:05,795 --> 01:34:07,497
He saved me from it.

857
01:34:09,799 --> 01:34:10,800
You did?

858
01:34:13,336 --> 01:34:14,903
Yeah. Yeah.

859
01:34:14,905 --> 01:34:16,503
Kind of.

860
01:34:16,505 --> 01:34:18,543
Maybe we should talk
about this somewhere else.

861
01:34:42,933 --> 01:34:44,532
<i>Good morning
from the staff</i>

862
01:34:44,534 --> 01:34:47,401
<i>of WPKW-PV6</i>

863
01:34:47,403 --> 01:34:49,837
<i>in Hartford, Connecticut.</i>

864
01:34:49,839 --> 01:34:52,842
<i>This is Hartford, Connecticut,
the land of steady habits...</i>

865
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:54,342
My parents.

866
01:34:54,344 --> 01:34:55,543
Shit! You're not supposed
to have boys over.

867
01:34:55,545 --> 01:34:57,611
I think that's the least of
our concerns right now, Bob.

868
01:34:57,613 --> 01:34:59,446
Yeah, yeah. I should
probably still get going.

869
01:34:59,448 --> 01:35:01,548
Hey, listen, um,
so Homecoming is coming up

870
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:03,385
- and I would really like...
- Yes. I'll... I'll go.

871
01:35:03,387 --> 01:35:04,319
With me?

872
01:35:04,321 --> 01:35:06,453
Yes, if the Warrens
don't kill me first.

873
01:35:08,392 --> 01:35:09,690
We tell them everything.

874
01:35:14,497 --> 01:35:15,530
Mom!

875
01:35:15,532 --> 01:35:18,065
Judy! What are you
doing up so early?

876
01:35:18,067 --> 01:35:19,833
Don't get mad...

877
01:35:19,835 --> 01:35:21,805
What happened
to your car?

878
01:35:26,843 --> 01:35:28,476
Here we go.

879
01:35:28,478 --> 01:35:30,248
We'll have
our own party, huh?

880
01:35:36,952 --> 01:35:39,689
- What?
- Can you please take that off?

881
01:35:47,464 --> 01:35:50,332
It won't always be like this,
I promise.

882
01:35:50,334 --> 01:35:51,865
You know,
and sooner or later,

883
01:35:51,867 --> 01:35:54,034
you'll find people
who understand.

884
01:35:54,036 --> 01:35:56,437
And as for young Anthony,

885
01:35:56,439 --> 01:35:58,409
he better hope I don't
run into him anytime soon.

886
01:35:58,709 --> 01:36:00,475
Ed.

887
01:36:13,622 --> 01:36:14,724
Happy birthday, Judy.

888
01:36:15,925 --> 01:36:16,927
Thank you.

889
01:36:17,626 --> 01:36:18,662
Happy birthday.

890
01:36:21,932 --> 01:36:25,402
I, uh, had a little talk
with my brother.

891
01:36:25,701 --> 01:36:27,068
Thanks.

892
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:28,837
Come in.

893
01:36:28,839 --> 01:36:31,342
Is it okay
if my boyfriend joins?

894
01:36:32,075 --> 01:36:33,075
Sure.

895
01:36:34,878 --> 01:36:35,843
Um...

896
01:36:35,845 --> 01:36:38,581
- Hi, uh, thanks for having us.
- Hey.

897
01:36:39,448 --> 01:36:40,782
Bob's-Got-Balls.

898
01:36:40,784 --> 01:36:42,449
No kidding.

899
01:36:42,451 --> 01:36:44,586
- Hi, Judy!
- Happy birthday, Judy!

900
01:36:44,588 --> 01:36:46,154
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

901
01:36:46,156 --> 01:36:48,890
- Hello, Judy, happy birthday.
- Hey, guys, welcome.

902
01:36:48,892 --> 01:36:50,691
Keep comin'.

903
01:36:50,693 --> 01:36:52,159
Happy birthday, Judy.

904
01:36:52,161 --> 01:36:53,721
- Anthony?
- I'm really sorry.

905
01:36:54,563 --> 01:36:56,534
Am I still invited?

906
01:36:58,034 --> 01:36:59,070
Sure.

907
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:05,942
Daniela?

908
01:37:06,977 --> 01:37:08,776
I have something for you.

909
01:37:08,778 --> 01:37:09,979
For me?

910
01:37:21,791 --> 01:37:23,792
You found out the hard way

911
01:37:23,794 --> 01:37:27,194
that there is a lot of evil
in this room.

912
01:37:27,196 --> 01:37:29,599
But you know
what I actually like about it?

913
01:37:31,867 --> 01:37:34,638
All the evil in here...

914
01:37:35,906 --> 01:37:39,443
reminds me of all the good
that's out there.

915
01:37:55,491 --> 01:37:57,093
Darling Daniela.

916
01:38:02,531 --> 01:38:04,199
Did Judy tell you that?

917
01:38:04,201 --> 01:38:06,504
No. Your dad did.

918
01:38:11,107 --> 01:38:14,478
He also tells me
that he misses you.

919
01:38:16,745 --> 01:38:19,881
And to stop being
so hard on yourself,

920
01:38:19,883 --> 01:38:22,115
'cause it was
not your fault.

921
01:38:32,161 --> 01:38:33,830
Thank you.

922
01:38:35,698 --> 01:38:37,164
Um...

923
01:38:37,166 --> 01:38:38,233
I'm sorry.

924
01:38:38,235 --> 01:38:39,601
Oh.

925
01:38:39,603 --> 01:38:40,901
It's okay.

926
01:38:40,903 --> 01:38:42,173
You're young.

927
01:38:46,910 --> 01:38:49,077
You know,
when I was about your age,

928
01:38:49,079 --> 01:38:52,247
I once ran off with
a boyfriend for three days

929
01:38:52,249 --> 01:38:54,084
without telling my parents.

930
01:38:56,952 --> 01:38:58,953
I unleashed a demon.

931
01:38:58,955 --> 01:39:00,558
So not the same thing.

932
01:39:01,525 --> 01:39:03,527
Well, okay. True.

933
01:39:09,732 --> 01:39:12,001
Does Mr. Warren know
about this boyfriend?

934
01:39:12,936 --> 01:39:14,572
He was the boyfriend.

935
01:39:19,075 --> 01:39:20,941
Anybody wanna
hear a song? Whoa!

936
01:39:20,943 --> 01:39:22,946
Yeah!

937
01:39:24,848 --> 01:39:26,750
All right, okay.
