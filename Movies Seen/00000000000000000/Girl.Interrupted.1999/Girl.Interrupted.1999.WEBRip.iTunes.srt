1
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,979
Have you ever confused
a dream with life?

2
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:50,152
Or stolen something
when you have the cash?

3
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,325
Have you ever been blue?

4
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:02,748
Or thought your train moving
while sitting still?

5
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,377
Maybe I was just crazy.

6
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,757
Maybe it was the '60s.

7
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,968
Or maybe I was just a girl...

8
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,888
...interrupted.

9
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,224
Put her in restraints.
Withdraw blood.

10
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,266
Hold on.

11
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,102
Give her five milligrams
of Valium, IV.

12
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,439
Turn her head so she doesn't aspirate.

13
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,690
There you go.

14
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,902
Aspirin fragments
and vodka, I think.

15
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,072
Don't tell me what you think.
Take it to the lab.

16
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,409
You should check my hand.
There's no bones in it.

17
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,619
A wrist banger.

18
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,666
-Is that why you did this?
-And other things.

19
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,377
Her parents are on the way.

20
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,255
Sometimes it's hard...

21
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,007
...for me to stay in one...

22
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,884
...place.

23
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,512
Susanna...

24
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,223
...if you had no bones
in your hand...

25
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,476
...how did you pick up the aspirin?

26
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,447
What is my mother doing?

27
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,700
Would you answer my question, please?

28
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:25,581
How did you pick up the aspirin
if you had no bones in your hand?

29
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,042
By then, they'd come back.

30
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,589
I see.

31
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,426
No, you don't.

32
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,886
Well...

33
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,306
...indulge me, then.

34
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,142
Explain it to me.

35
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,313
Explain what?

36
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:54,776
Explain to a doctor that the laws
of physics can be suspended?

37
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,113
That what goes up
may not come down?

38
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,745
Explain...

39
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,414
...that time...

40
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,792
...can move backwards and forwards...

41
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,046
...and now to then and back again...

42
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,632
...and you can't control it?

43
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,091
Why can't you control it?

44
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,430
What?

45
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,766
Why can't you control time?

46
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,790
Where were you?
Everyone is here. Come on.

47
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,630
-Mary, you remember Susanna.
-Yes, I do.

48
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,760
You're wearing this?

49
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,347
I didn't know it was so early.
I would've changed.

50
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,183
Everybody, look who's here.

51
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,061
-Happy birthday, Dad.
-Thanks, sweetie.

52
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,106
I'm sorry, I want to say hi to her.

53
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:19,444
Sweetie, would you hold this for me?
I just want to say hi to Susanna.

54
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,530
Excuse me. Susanna!

55
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,908
-Susanna!
-Professor Gilcrest's wife.

56
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,327
Barbara Gilcrest.
You remember me?

57
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,913
Bonnie's mom. I'm Bonnie's mom.

58
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,374
Your skin is so beautiful.

59
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,543
Wasn't Bonnie in your lit. class?

60
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,337
Yeah. How is she doing?

61
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,090
She just got accepted to Radcliffe.

62
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,842
What a conundrum.

63
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,594
I'm a Wellesley girl, myself.

64
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,431
But I think young women should
make up their own mind, don't you?

65
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,645
Are you stoned?

66
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,859
Do you smoke pot?

67
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,238
Take LSD?

68
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,202
No drugs?

69
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,335
How do you feel right now?

70
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,340
I...

71
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,676
...don't know.

72
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,387
I don't know what I'm feeling.

73
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,809
You need a rest.

74
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,063
Well, I'll go home, take a nap.

75
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:40,442
No. You need to go somewhere
where you can get a genuine rest.

76
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,028
And you're very lucky.

77
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,739
The best place
for someone like you...

78
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,742
...is less than
a half an hour from here.

79
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,994
You don't mean Claymoore?

80
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,082
Four days ago...

81
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,794
...you chased a bottle of aspirin
with a bottle of vodka.

82
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,840
I had a headache.

83
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,681
Your father is a friend of mine.

84
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,351
He's a colleague.
He asked me to see you...

85
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,437
...even though I don't do this anymore.

86
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,817
You're hurting everyone around you.

87
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,282
Now, Claymoore is a topnotch place.

88
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,243
A lot of people go there.

89
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,661
Even writers.

90
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,288
Like you.

91
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,334
Great.

92
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,643
Yes, I'd like a cab
at 1240 Milford, please.

93
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,938
My mother's here.

94
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,525
It'll be less emotional
if we do it this way.

95
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,445
Your parents and I talked about it.

96
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,693
Now make sure, no stops.

97
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,711
Susanna, you there?

98
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,510
I want to see you again.

99
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,929
It was a one-time thing, okay?

100
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,890
Just come to my office tonight.

101
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,600
We're opening the presents!

102
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,060
Tell them you're going to a friend's.

103
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,812
Who should I tell first?

104
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,899
My parents, the department chairman,
or your wife?

105
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:07,983
No.

106
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,408
What did you do?

107
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,536
What did you do?

108
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,040
Excuse me?

109
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,169
Well, you look normal.

110
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,590
I'm sad.

111
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,927
Well, everyone's sad.

112
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,388
I see things.

113
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,724
You mean, like tripping?

114
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:44,603
Kind of.

115
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,315
Then they should put
John Lennon away, huh?

116
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,653
I'm not John Lennon.

117
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,076
Don't get too comfortable.

118
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,504
Shouldn't my parents--?

119
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,548
You have to sign them, Miss Kaysen.

120
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,593
You're over 18.
This is your decision.

121
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,565
I didn't try to kill myself.

122
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:18,238
That's the kind of thing you talk
about in therapy, honey. Not here.

123
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,162
Miss Kaysen?

124
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:29,041
You have the distinction
of being the only senior...

125
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,168
...not going on to college.

126
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,342
May I ask what you plan to do?

127
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,970
I plan to write.

128
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,766
Well, what do you plan to do?

129
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:52,105
Look, I'm not gonna burn my bra or
drop acid or go march on Washington...

130
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,359
...I just don't want to end up
like my mother.

131
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,153
Women today have
more choices than that.

132
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,822
No, they don't.

133
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,783
And here.

134
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,412
You forgot one, dear. Here.

135
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:15,879
Speaking for Dr. Wick and myself,
welcome to Claymoore, Susanna.

136
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,678
This is the women's ward,
also known as South Bell.

137
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,765
This is where you'll be staying,
and this is where I work.

138
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,977
All right, this is the second floor.

139
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:34,064
I need you to stay close to me
because it's easy to get lost here.

140
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,572
This is our ward.

141
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,786
All right, let's start with this room.

142
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,249
This is the art room.

143
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:54,960
Polly.

144
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:56,712
What are you doing here?

145
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,215
I feel very musical today.

146
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,260
-Can I just, for just a second?
-Not today, honey.

147
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,772
That's Polly. Come on.

148
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:25,157
Margie, Polly was in
the art room by herself.

149
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,034
I'm sorry, Val.

150
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,247
The living room.

151
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,000
Everyone hates it.

152
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,221
And these are the phones.

153
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:50,641
To make a call, pick up
the handle, tell the nurse...

154
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,559
...she'll connect you.

155
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,355
This is the nurses' station,
which is self-explanatory...

156
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:59,775
...and this is the TV room,
where everyone hangs out.

157
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,069
I want my fucking clothes!

158
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:06,031
Then you'll have to
eat something, won't you?

159
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,742
The check-in board.

160
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,745
You check in here to take
a walk on the grounds.

161
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,664
Oh, lordy, pick a bale of hay

162
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,917
Gotta jump down, spin around
Pick a bale of cotton

163
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,378
Jump down, spin around
Pick a bale of hay

164
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,297
She thinks that bothers me.

165
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:25,342
You're an "R," which means
"restricted to the ward."

166
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:28,136
But soon you'll
move up to two-to-ones...

167
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,597
...which is two nurses
to every patient.

168
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,976
I won't be here that long.
I'm just here for a rest.

169
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:38,146
It's all right. Everybody gets
the same tour free of charge.

170
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:47,281
Georgina, this is Susanna,
your new roommate.

171
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,408
Oh, great. Hi.

172
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,661
You're lucky.
Georgina's an excellent roommate.

173
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,580
Why, thank you, Valerie.

174
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,540
You're welcome.

175
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,085
The cops are bringing Lisa.
She was at the park.

176
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,592
Will you excuse me?
I have business I have to attend to.

177
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,804
Georgina, will you take Susanna
to the dining room in a half-hour?

178
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,016
Yes means yes, Georgina.

179
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,143
I know.

180
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:33,827
Groovy box.

181
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:36,538
That.

182
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,291
Yeah, they're French.

183
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,419
The French Resistance
smoked them, I think.

184
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,470
You ever read this?

185
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,141
No. I saw the movie
a bunch of times, though.

186
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,936
The movie's based on the first book.

187
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:03,106
I read that one too, but there were
no ruby slippers in it originally.

188
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:06,527
They added that.
This takes place afterwards.

189
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,695
Dorothy doesn't really have
such a big part in this one.

190
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,577
Fucking pig.

191
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,748
Get off me!

192
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:33,220
Thanks, Gretta.

193
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,682
Hey, Dais, let anyone
in your room yet?

194
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,272
Hey, girls! Hey, sexy.

195
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,944
It's good to be home.

196
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,324
-Hey, Torch.
-Hey, Lisa.

197
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,702
-You miss me?
-Not much.

198
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,456
Get her to her room.
Gretta will do the strip search.

199
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,876
Who's that with Georgie-girl?

200
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,253
-Where's Jamie?
-I can't deal with this.

201
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,505
Don't give me a hard time.

202
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,966
Where is she? Where's Jamie?

203
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,181
Who are you?

204
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:21,018
Her name is Susanna, Lisa.
She smokes French cigarettes.

205
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:24,688
-Why is all your shit on her bed?
-Open the damn door!

206
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,398
Why? Where's Jamie?

207
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:29,610
I don't know what
you're talking about!

208
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,322
What the hell are you doing, Lisa?

209
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,116
Back off her.

210
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,036
Back off!
You've been gone for two weeks.

211
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:42,164
A lot of shit has gone down.
Back off!

212
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:43,540
How'd she do it?

213
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,459
How'd she do it?

214
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:47,878
How did she do it, Valerie?

215
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,963
Get the fuck off me!

216
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:53,800
You weak people. You're all weak
fucking people! You're victims!

217
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,552
You people are fucking sick!

218
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,514
What? No, no.
Val, please. Please!

219
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,603
Get her legs.

220
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:06,813
Get her feet!

221
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,232
-I got her.
-Get off!

222
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,569
Help!

223
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,452
We have got to cut those nails again.

224
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:30,462
My God! What the hell was that?

225
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,631
That was Lisa.

226
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,176
And Jamie was your roommate?

227
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,303
Jamie was Lisa's best friend.

228
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,223
She was sad because Lisa ran away...

229
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,684
...so she hung herself with
a volleyball net.

230
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,487
Meds!

231
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:59,825
Cynthia Crowley.

232
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,453
Susanna Kaysen.

233
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,291
Susanna Kaysen.

234
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:12,087
I am Mrs. McWilley,
and these are for you.

235
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,631
-What are they?
-They'll help you sleep.

236
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,926
-It's 10:30. I'm not gonna--
-For chrissake.

237
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:21,013
You can discuss it in the morning
with your doctor.

238
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,599
In the meantime,
we'll agree to disagree.

239
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,479
Take them here. Have some water.

240
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,735
Polly Clark.

241
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,029
You can go now.

242
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,410
Teresa McCullian.

243
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,418
Daisy Randone.

244
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,216
Angela Coury.

245
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,638
Jacqueline Lights.

246
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,267
Donna Smith.

247
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,642
Ryan Reed...

248
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:52,437
...yearbook editor and member
of the honour society.

249
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,898
Heading off to Tulane University.

250
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:56,650
Congratulations, son.

251
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:02,531
Andrea Jacobs, president of
the French club and honour society...

252
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:05,450
...and on her way to Sarah Lawrence.

253
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,955
Susanna Kaysen.

254
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,126
-What is she doing?
-Some kind of a stunt.

255
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,513
Wake up, freak.

256
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:29,725
Checks.

257
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,705
Why do they do that?

258
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,250
They're just doing checks.

259
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:58,629
They'll space them out
after you've been here awhile.

260
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:06,512
That girl, Polly.

261
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:09,640
How did she get all...?

262
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:13,060
When she was 10...

263
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:16,605
...her mother told her
she had to give away her puppy...

264
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:19,650
...because he was giving her a rash.

265
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:23,070
And so Polly went...

266
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:26,532
...and found her father's gas can...

267
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:30,827
...and she poured it all over
where she was getting the rash.

268
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,413
And then...

269
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,543
...she lit a match.

270
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:41,004
Oh, my God.

271
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,012
Well, what about you?
Why are you here?

272
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,766
Pseudologia fantastica.

273
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,978
What's that?

274
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:00,941
I'm a pathological liar.

275
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,873
-What are your plans this fall?
-What?

276
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:00,167
What are your plans this fall?

277
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,960
I don't have any.

278
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:04,671
I'm gonna be an ethnobotanist.

279
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,758
Full scholarship to M.I.T.

280
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,885
I'm going to join the Krishnas.

281
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:13,722
Hare Krishna?
That's interesting, actually.

282
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:16,016
I was kidding.

283
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,742
You're Susanna, right?

284
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:38,288
I'm Toby.
Andrea Jacobs' brother.

285
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:42,084
I was at graduation.

286
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:49,591
You're pretty when you sleep.

287
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:54,388
Checks. It's 7:00.

288
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:12,406
I mean, everybody thinks
about it at some point.

289
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:16,076
How would you do it?

290
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,913
I don't know.

291
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,792
I guess I haven't really
thought about it.

292
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:31,175
See, once it's
in your head, though...

293
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:34,720
...you become this...

294
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,222
...strange, new breed.

295
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:42,978
A life form that loves
to fantasize about its own demise.

296
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:46,440
Make a stupid remark, kill yourself.

297
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:51,195
You like the movie, you live.
You miss the train, kill yourself.

298
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:53,655
What?

299
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:57,367
Let's not talk about
this anymore, okay?

300
00:26:57,576 --> 00:26:59,036
Why?

301
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,000
Because it's...

302
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:07,836
...stupid.

303
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:16,720
What?

304
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:22,309
What are you doing?

305
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,773
What? Because I don't want to kill
myself? That's not cool to you?

306
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:30,943
I don't wanna die.
I was just talking.

307
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:34,196
Look, Susanna, the world
is fucked up, okay?

308
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,532
It's so fucked up that if some...

309
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:39,910
...draft zombie pulls my
birthday out of a barrel...

310
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:41,662
...I'm gonna die.

311
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,248
When's your birthday?

312
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,126
December 30th.

313
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,756
I'll pray for you.

314
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:56,260
Checks.

315
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:26,248
You asked for this?

316
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,260
Are you gonna watch?

317
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:43,974
Afraid so. That's why there's
so many fuzzy-legged women here.

318
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:51,023
Has anybody ever watched you shave?

319
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:54,860
I got two kids and one bathroom.
What do you think?

320
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,739
I think you should lock the door.

321
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:04,369
September 14th.

322
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:10,042
-Zero-zero-two.
-Bingo.

323
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:14,421
-Bingo. Bingo.
-December 30th.

324
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:17,341
Oh, my God.

325
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:20,010
-Bingo.
-Zero-zero-three.

326
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,681
A guy I know was just drafted.

327
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:26,850
What's his name?

328
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:30,437
Toby.

329
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,191
He's dead now.

330
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:42,199
Get out, Lisa!

331
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,743
I'm not in your room.
I'm right here.

332
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:47,955
-I was gonna offer you nail polish.
-Get out!

333
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,210
-You're looking better, Lisa.
-Why, thanks, Margie.

334
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:55,546
-How's the engagement?
-You know.

335
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:57,130
No, I don't.
I've been away.

336
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:00,926
Joe wants me to--
Before the wedding.

337
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,638
Fuck his brains out.
Use a rubber.

338
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,391
Gosh, hell, no.

339
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:28,954
Can I bum one?

340
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:31,415
Go ahead.

341
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:57,316
So have you had your
first Melvin yet?

342
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:58,734
Who's that?

343
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:01,987
Bald guy with a little pecker
and a fat wife.

344
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,198
Your therapist, sweet pea.

345
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:07,159
Unless...

346
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:09,661
...unless they're giving you shocks.

347
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:12,039
Or, God forbid, letting you out.

348
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,875
Then you'll see the great,
wonderful Dr. Dyke.

349
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:16,585
She means Dr. Wick.

350
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:21,381
I've seen his office
but haven't met him.

351
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:23,759
He's a she.
Dr. Wick's a girl.

352
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:26,803
That's right, M-G.
Wick's a chick.

353
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:29,056
Hence the nickname.

354
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:33,602
Hey, Lil.
When the fuck is my checkup?

355
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,272
It's now, Lisa.
You said you'd be in your room.

356
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:40,150
Can't sit too long
without popping the hood.

357
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,334
Asshole!

358
00:31:57,626 --> 00:32:01,088
You have Melvin in half an hour.
I'll take you there.

359
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:03,382
I'm sorry.

360
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:06,969
Why are you using the past tense?

361
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:09,388
What do you mean?

362
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,431
Well, he was...

363
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:15,936
...only drafted today,
so chances are, he's not dead yet.

364
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:19,940
He probably has several months...

365
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,234
...before he even reports.

366
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:28,490
He was just a nice guy, that's all.
And it made me feel bad.

367
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,784
You've been feeling bad in general.

368
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:34,288
Right?
You've been feeling depressed.

369
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:39,501
I haven't exactly been
a ball of joy, Melvin.

370
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,713
I understand you tried
to kill yourself last week.

371
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:46,133
Anything you want to
tell me about that?

372
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:48,302
I had a headache.

373
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:54,099
So I assume you took the recommended
aspirin dosage for a headache.

374
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,643
I didn't try to kill myself.

375
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:58,520
What were you trying to do?

376
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,064
I was trying to make the shit stop.

377
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:04,693
The time-jumps, the depression...

378
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:08,071
...the headaches, the thing
with your hand?

379
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,033
All of the above.

380
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:14,328
I see.

381
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:18,916
Paul is dead!

382
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:30,677
What is it?
Are you puzzled about something?

383
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,389
Yeah, I guess I am, Melvin.

384
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,060
I'm puzzled as to why
I have to be in a mental institution.

385
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,229
You put yourself here.

386
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,272
My parents put me here.

387
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:46,235
No, they didn't.

388
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,987
Everyone here's fucking crazy!

389
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:51,198
You wanna go home.

390
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:56,286
Same problem.

391
00:33:57,162 --> 00:34:00,040
M-G, look at me.

392
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,834
Play with me.

393
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:06,129
Don't be sad. Don't be sad.

394
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,431
Thank you.

395
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:53,467
-What are these?
-Colace. It's just a laxative.

396
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:55,721
I don't need them.

397
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:57,639
Are we going to have a problem?

398
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:02,019
Are we going to have a problem?

399
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:04,313
Are we going to have a problem?

400
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:06,398
May I see?

401
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:07,774
Thank you.

402
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:09,735
Surrender.

403
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:12,154
Are we going to have a problem?

404
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:16,074
No problem.

405
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,619
Phone call, booth one.

406
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,333
-Hello?
-Hold on.

407
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:28,420
-Susanna?
-Hi, Mom.

408
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,130
Hi, honey.
Your father's on too.

409
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,217
He's just back from reserves.
He got stuck at Dulles.

410
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:35,010
How are you, honey?

411
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:38,096
-I'm fine, Dad.
-You know, sweetheart--

412
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:44,353
If you can't give me Ex-Lax,
can I please have some Colace?

413
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:47,022
No. No more laxatives.

414
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,776
I can get her some prune juice.

415
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,070
Prune juice!

416
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:55,531
This is outrageous!

417
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:59,576
She was wondering if you'd
made new friends, and I said:

418
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:02,871
"No, Mom, this isn't Camp Winnetka."

419
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,544
-Daisy?
-Fuck off.

420
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:12,089
I have something you want.

421
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:20,180
Come in.

422
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:52,713
You're all packed up.

423
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,424
Yeah, I'm leaving in a month.

424
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:57,426
My dad got me an apartment.

425
00:36:57,676 --> 00:37:01,471
-Really? Where?
-It's near the airport.

426
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:05,893
One bedroom, two baths, eat-in chicken.
He fixed it up real nice for me.

427
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:07,519
You mean eat-in kitchen.

428
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:10,522
That's what I said, asshole.

429
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:12,941
So what do you have that I want?

430
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:19,239
Put it on the bed.

431
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:20,991
Put yours on the bed.

432
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:23,118
Oh, Jesus. Get out!

433
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:24,661
Get out!

434
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:27,331
Don't take advantage
just because she's new.

435
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:28,457
Pony up some Valium.

436
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,710
Get the fuck out,
or I'm calling Valerie! Valerie!

437
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,837
Why don't you call Valerie?

438
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:38,258
Call Valerie and ask her for some
Colace, like Susie Q's got in her hand.

439
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:40,219
Why does it stink in here?

440
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,471
I don't take Valium.

441
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:44,306
I know. That's the point.

442
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:47,184
They give them to you,
and you don't take them.

443
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:49,102
Are you gonna eat that?

444
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:50,687
Checks.

445
00:37:51,063 --> 00:37:52,689
You've got visitors, Daisy.

446
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,775
I want some fucking Colace.

447
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:57,402
Talk to Melvin tomorrow.

448
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:12,376
You know what I think?
I think you want to poop, Daisy.

449
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:14,461
I think it's been days.

450
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:17,256
Look, it's okay. I don't care.

451
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,508
I do! I do care.

452
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,391
So Daddy buys you a private,
and no one gets in, huh?

453
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:32,271
You never leave except when Valerie
makes you go to the cafeteria...

454
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:35,607
...where you never eat.
You're a laxative junkie.

455
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:41,780
I always thought you were like Janet,
but here you are with this chicken.

456
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,117
So what's with that, huh?

457
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:49,162
My dad owns a deli, asshole,
with a rotisserie.

458
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:53,250
I like my dad's chicken. When
I eat something else, I puke.

459
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:58,213
But why do you eat it here? Why don't
you like to go to the cafeteria?

460
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:00,382
Which do you like better?

461
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:02,843
Taking a dump alone
or with Valerie watching?

462
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:04,928
Alone.

463
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:08,557
Everyone likes to be alone
when it comes out.

464
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,642
I like to be alone when it goes in.

465
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:13,896
To me, the cafeteria's
like being with...

466
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:16,190
...20 girls all at once taking a dump.

467
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:19,318
That is fucked up, Daisy!

468
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:22,863
Come on.

469
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:30,412
All right, assholes.
Fine, here.

470
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:37,920
Here.

471
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:49,097
Lisa, don't!

472
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:50,474
No, please--

473
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:52,559
Dios-fucking-mio                 !

474
00:39:57,356 --> 00:39:59,274
That's how Daddy
knows she's eating.

475
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:03,779
When I get five, Valerie
makes me throw them away.

476
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:19,086
Scribble, scribble, scribble.

477
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:21,046
Written anything about me yet?

478
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:22,965
Don't do that.

479
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:36,812
Is Daisy really getting out?

480
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,985
She coughed up a big one.

481
00:40:43,694 --> 00:40:47,364
How can--?
I mean, she's insane.

482
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,284
That's what "ther-rape-me"
is all about.

483
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:54,538
That's why fucking Freud's
picture's on every shrink's wall.

484
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:59,751
He created an industry. You lie down,
confess your secrets, and you're saved.

485
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:04,590
The more you confess, the more they
think about setting you free.

486
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:07,342
But what if you don't have a secret?

487
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:11,555
Then you're a lifer, like me.

488
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:14,933
I was changing her diaper...

489
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:17,769
...and I turned to get the powder...

490
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:21,523
...and while my back was turned,
she rolled off the bed.

491
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:26,320
She rolled off the bed
and broke her leg.

492
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:31,658
The doctor put her in a body cast,
but also strapped her down.

493
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:34,286
-This has nothing--
-You never told me this.

494
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:36,622
Carl planned this trip
to Santa Monica.

495
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:41,210
He had a commitment at RAND.
So we took her with us.

496
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:45,047
On the back seat, strapped to this
board, 4000 miles.

497
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:48,759
If you like, Mrs. Kaysen,
we can discuss this...

498
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:51,637
...further on the way out.

499
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:54,681
Just how long is my daughter
going to be here?

500
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,725
With all due respect, Mr. Kaysen...

501
00:41:56,975 --> 00:42:01,188
...psychiatry and economics
are different.

502
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:04,608
The length of Susanna's stay
isn't fixed.

503
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:07,736
It depends on her response
to treatment.

504
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,906
For what? Depression?

505
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:15,786
It's almost Christmas. What do we say
to the people who care about her?

506
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:18,539
See, what's going on here is...

507
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:23,585
...my parents are having a little
holiday cocktail Christmas party crisis.

508
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:24,837
What?

509
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:29,675
What's the "borderline" business
you mentioned?

510
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,305
I don't think that's useful to Susanna.

511
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:37,808
-I mean, not--
-What "borderline business"?

512
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:39,935
-The mind--
-Borderline what?

513
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:42,396
Borderline between what and what?

514
00:42:43,564 --> 00:42:45,566
It's a condition, Susanna.

515
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:48,360
And it's called
Borderline Personality Disorder.

516
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,737
Oh, God.

517
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:52,990
It's not uncommon.

518
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:55,659
Especially among young women.

519
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:58,287
What causes it?

520
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:00,247
We're really not sure.

521
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:03,584
-Is it genetic?
-Oh, Christ!

522
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:07,129
It is five times more common...

523
00:43:07,462 --> 00:43:10,299
...among those with a borderline...

524
00:43:10,883 --> 00:43:11,925
...parent.

525
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:18,974
I can't do this. I'm sorry, I can't.
I can't do this.

526
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:37,534
"Razors pain you; rivers are damp;
acid stains you; drugs cause cramp.

527
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:39,995
Guns aren't lawful;
nooses give...

528
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:43,332
...gas smells awful;
you might as well live."

529
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:44,833
Gin.

530
00:43:56,762 --> 00:43:59,473
-Asshole.
-Fatso.

531
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:07,773
Call me a cab.

532
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:09,733
Okay, you're a cab.

533
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:17,699
Lisa said you got into Daisy's room.

534
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:21,119
And it was full of chickens.

535
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:23,580
Susanna, you have a phone call.

536
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:30,295
So what's your "diag-nonsense"?

537
00:44:30,546 --> 00:44:33,841
-Who is this?
-What'd he say to Mom and Pop?

538
00:44:42,641 --> 00:44:44,685
I have a borderline personality.

539
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:47,604
Well, that's nothing.
What else?

540
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:50,816
He didn't say. He thought
it would affect my recovery.

541
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:53,652
Tongue your meds tonight.

542
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:56,780
After 1:00 checks,
Gretta always goes for a smoke.

543
00:44:56,947 --> 00:45:00,534
Check the mirrors. If they're
clear, go to Hector's closet.

544
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:03,996
It's near the art room,
and it will be open.

545
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:21,597
Torch!

546
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:24,224
Come on.

547
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:46,121
This is how Lisa gets out
when she escapes!

548
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:54,046
We're under administration, so....
No good here.

549
00:45:54,463 --> 00:45:56,632
Good thing this place has
a sliding scale.

550
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:59,676
We get to mingle with
the lock-picking trash.

551
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,787
Good job!

552
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:30,666
Susanna, you're up!

553
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,669
No, no, no. I've only done
this once in my life.

554
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:35,087
-Come on.
-Please.

555
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:38,715
-We came all the way here.
-Come on!

556
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:57,276
All right!

557
00:47:30,392 --> 00:47:34,605
They put the tunnels in so the loons
didn't have to go out in the cold.

558
00:47:34,813 --> 00:47:36,940
I must've missed that in the brochure.

559
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:42,946
Hey, open the door.

560
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,378
What the fuck are you doing?

561
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:14,019
Dr. Wick's office.

562
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:30,494
All right. Georgina Tuskin.

563
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:44,675
Susanna Kaysen.

564
00:48:47,386 --> 00:48:49,096
Polly Clark.

565
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:54,309
Cynthia Crowley.

566
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,436
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

567
00:48:57,813 --> 00:48:59,523
Janet Webber.

568
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:04,069
Lisa Rowe.

569
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:39,813
Fuck you, Melvin.

570
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:46,361
Wanna see mine?

571
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:49,114
Let me see yours.

572
00:49:58,498 --> 00:50:01,168
"Lisa Rowe.

573
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:03,962
Highs and lows increasingly severe.

574
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:07,341
Controlling relationships with patients.

575
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:10,636
No appreciable response to meds.

576
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:15,140
No remission observed."
That was before you ran away.

577
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:17,601
We're very rare, and mostly men.

578
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:20,729
Lisa thinks she's hot shit
because she's a sociopath.

579
00:50:20,938 --> 00:50:22,898
-I'm a sociopath.
-No, you're a dyke.

580
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:26,318
"Borderline Personality Disorder.

581
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:30,239
An instability of self-image,
relationships and mood.

582
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:32,115
Uncertainty about goals.

583
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:35,661
Impulsive in activities
that are self-damaging...

584
00:50:35,827 --> 00:50:38,330
...such as casual sex."

585
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:39,998
I like that.

586
00:50:40,165 --> 00:50:42,668
"Social contrariness and a generally...

587
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:45,754
...pessimistic attitude
are often observed."

588
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:48,549
Well, that's me.

589
00:50:49,424 --> 00:50:50,592
That's everybody.

590
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:53,428
I mean, what kind of sex isn't casual?

591
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:56,223
They mean promiscuous.

592
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:58,517
I'm not promiscuous.

593
00:51:03,146 --> 00:51:05,023
I'm not.

594
00:51:22,457 --> 00:51:23,792
Jesus.

595
00:51:24,459 --> 00:51:25,961
Look at Janet.

596
00:51:26,545 --> 00:51:27,963
No. It's all right.

597
00:51:30,007 --> 00:51:34,136
You know, taking us
for ice creams in a blizzard...

598
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:37,014
...makes you wonder who
the real whack jobs are.

599
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:38,974
You know, I think it's
kind of nice.

600
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:43,562
I mean, I think it's nice to do
something nice on Daisy's last day.

601
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:13,509
Oh, fuck!

602
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:15,093
I'll have peppermint stick.

603
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:17,054
Me too.
Can I have peppermint stick?

604
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:18,722
Sure.

605
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:21,141
It's just called peppermint.

606
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:22,851
Peppermint dick!

607
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:25,979
Peppermint clit!

608
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:31,902
Okay. We're just gonna
have four cones.

609
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:33,529
Four cones.

610
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:36,698
Susanna, do you want anything?

611
00:52:36,865 --> 00:52:37,950
I'm fine.

612
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:45,123
Ronny.

613
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:46,500
Got any hot fudge?

614
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:48,460
Yes.

615
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:52,422
Can I have a vanilla sundae
with hot fudge...

616
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:56,176
...and sprinkles.
Rainbow, not chocolate.

617
00:52:57,636 --> 00:52:59,263
And...

618
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,894
...whipped cream, cherries...

619
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:08,522
...and....

620
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:10,399
Nuts?

621
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:21,618
Let's have a seat, ladies.

622
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:28,417
Melvin thought that I should
live in a halfway house.

623
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:32,713
But my father knew
that I deserved my own apartment.

624
00:53:33,172 --> 00:53:35,215
So he got me the prettiest apartment.

625
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:37,676
It has an eat-in chicken...

626
00:53:37,926 --> 00:53:42,264
...and all this beautiful
wicker furniture, which is fantastic.

627
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:43,724
Wicker butterflies.

628
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,852
My very favourite part...

629
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,021
...is like in the phone book.

630
00:53:49,271 --> 00:53:51,857
There's a sign
right outside that says:

631
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:53,942
"If you lived here...

632
00:53:54,276 --> 00:53:55,319
...you'd be home now."

633
00:53:55,944 --> 00:53:57,196
Hello, Susanna.

634
00:53:57,946 --> 00:53:59,114
Do you remember me?

635
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:03,202
-You must remember me.
-Yes. Mrs. Gilcrest.

636
00:54:03,952 --> 00:54:05,120
Susanna, you okay?

637
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,581
I'm fine.

638
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,293
-Hey, Bonnie. How's Radcliffe?
-Wellesley.

639
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:13,962
I'm enjoying it.
It's strong in art.

640
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:15,547
Going to the Sorbonne.

641
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:19,301
-That's great.
-You know, I know all about you...

642
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:22,262
...and I hope they put you away forever.

643
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,932
Is this the professor's wife?

644
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:26,308
What professor?

645
00:54:26,558 --> 00:54:28,101
So you told everybody.

646
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:30,979
Lady, back off.

647
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,940
-Was I talking to you?
-Let's go.

648
00:54:33,232 --> 00:54:35,984
No, you're spitting on me,
so mellow-fucking-out.

649
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:37,402
Don't tell me what to do.

650
00:54:37,611 --> 00:54:40,864
Look, she gave your husband
a rim job. Big fucking deal!

651
00:54:41,114 --> 00:54:44,117
He was begging for it,
and I heard it was like a pencil.

652
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:45,702
How dare you!

653
00:54:45,953 --> 00:54:49,790
Some advice: Don't point your
fucking finger at crazy people!

654
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:54,294
Let go of me!

655
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:56,672
Mother?

656
00:54:56,922 --> 00:54:58,966
Get that out of my face, asshole!

657
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:02,594
Let go!

658
00:55:03,053 --> 00:55:03,887
Now.

659
00:55:05,597 --> 00:55:06,807
Stop it!

660
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:11,103
"Rank" you!
Come again, Mrs. Professor!

661
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:13,856
You shared a man with that woman?

662
00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:23,490
-Did you enjoy the fresh air?
-Yeah, thanks.

663
00:55:23,657 --> 00:55:27,035
Good. Because it's the last time
you're leaving the ward.

664
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:30,914
Is that a dare or a double dare?

665
00:55:33,834 --> 00:55:38,130
Okay, raise your arms. Very good.
We're going to be trees.

666
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:41,925
Feel the strength in your arms
as the branches.

667
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:44,803
And reach those branches up to the sky.

668
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:48,599
Come on, Susanna, reach.
Very good!

669
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:50,684
Lisa, all right.

670
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:53,854
Reach your arms, girls.
Reach. Really lift.

671
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:55,939
Feel the stretch through the hip.

672
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:58,734
Very good.
Let your arms be branches.

673
00:55:58,942 --> 00:56:01,153
There's strength in those branches.

674
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:06,450
Reach, reach all the way up
into the sky. Very good.

675
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:10,662
Let the wind blow the leaves
and let your fingers be the leaves.

676
00:56:10,913 --> 00:56:13,415
Good, M-G, very good.
Feel the wind.

677
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:16,043
Good. Good, Lisa.

678
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:18,045
Very good.

679
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:21,715
Just lift up. Lift up.
Very good, girls.

680
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:24,343
Now feel your feet.
Feel your feet be rooted.

681
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:26,929
Go down into a pliÈ.
Very good.

682
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:29,848
Good, girls. Polly, very good.

683
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:33,685
Now stretch it. The wind's blowing
really hard this way.

684
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:37,481
That is not fair.
That is not fair!

685
00:56:37,648 --> 00:56:38,941
That is not fair!

686
00:56:40,359 --> 00:56:42,236
Seventy-four is the perfect weight!

687
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:47,491
Good luck, crazy bitch.

688
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:51,328
What kind of tree can you be
down there on the floor?

689
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:54,248
I'm a fucking shrub, all right?

690
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:19,791
Martin Luther King Jr. was killed
tonight in Memphis, Tennessee.

691
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:23,962
He was shot as he stood
on the balcony of his hotel room.

692
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:26,173
Last night, he said this:

693
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:28,842
I don't know what will happen now.

694
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:32,137
We've got some difficult days ahead.

695
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:36,058
But it really doesn't matter
with me now...

696
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:38,894
...because I've been
to the mountaintop.

697
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:52,908
Susanna, you have a visitor.

698
00:58:57,538 --> 00:58:58,747
What are you doing here?

699
00:59:03,627 --> 00:59:06,004
I ship out next week.

700
00:59:07,756 --> 00:59:08,924
Here.

701
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:27,901
Checks.

702
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:30,237
Sorry.

703
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:34,741
No. It's okay. We have
10 minutes till they come back.

704
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,420
Hey, Torch.

705
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:49,423
What you doing?

706
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,508
Nothing.

707
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:55,470
Well, why don't you go to
your room and do nothing?

708
01:00:06,356 --> 01:00:07,983
Checks.

709
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:11,486
Checks.

710
01:00:14,907 --> 01:00:16,158
Checks.

711
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:20,746
Hey, Margie.

712
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:22,956
-Hey, Lisa.
-What you doing?

713
01:00:23,165 --> 01:00:25,292
-Checks.
-How's Joe?

714
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:27,336
He's fine.

715
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:29,505
I have to do my checks.

716
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:32,966
Taking five minutes for me
would be a dereliction of duty?

717
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:36,136
What if I had a punctured artery?

718
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:38,597
You'd go on your rounds,
ignoring my wounds?

719
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:41,600
-Stop it.
-Stop what? Look at this.

720
01:00:42,017 --> 01:00:43,101
Go ahead. Go ahead.

721
01:00:43,393 --> 01:00:44,645
That's enough!

722
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:47,481
Take one step
and I'll jam this in my aorta!

723
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:48,857
Stop it.

724
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:50,943
Your aorta is in your chest.

725
01:00:52,986 --> 01:00:54,404
Good to know.

726
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:58,158
-I'll make a note of that.
-Good.

727
01:01:06,959 --> 01:01:09,753
You have grounds privileges.
Why don't you take a walk?

728
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:12,548
Go get a cup of coffee.

729
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,512
We should get out of here.

730
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,321
The cafeteria's this way.

731
01:01:36,572 --> 01:01:38,031
My wheels are here.

732
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:40,158
Wait. What are we doing?

733
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,913
We're going to Canada.

734
01:01:50,919 --> 01:01:52,713
You're not crazy.

735
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:55,424
Okay? You don't need to be here.

736
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:59,595
I tried to kill myself, Toby.

737
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:04,141
-You took some aspirin.
-I took a bottle of aspirin.

738
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:09,855
That buys you a year in this place?
That's bullshit, okay?

739
01:02:10,063 --> 01:02:11,190
They're breaking you.

740
01:02:11,648 --> 01:02:14,610
Come on. All right?
Everything's changing, man.

741
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:17,154
What do they know
about being normal?

742
01:02:19,948 --> 01:02:21,742
I have friends in here.

743
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:25,662
Who? Them?

744
01:02:26,038 --> 01:02:28,081
Those girls--
Susanna...

745
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:33,504
...they're eating grapes
off of the wallpaper.

746
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:35,422
They're insane.

747
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:38,509
If they are, I am.

748
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:44,556
No, baby.
Listen, come with me.

749
01:02:49,228 --> 01:02:50,437
Look...

750
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,815
...my dad gave me five grand.

751
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:58,362
Okay? We can go up there.
We can build a cabin in the woods.

752
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:03,033
Look, I know that this sounds crazy...

753
01:03:05,285 --> 01:03:07,120
...but I think I love you.

754
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:10,874
So come with me. Okay?

755
01:03:12,626 --> 01:03:14,419
Come with me.

756
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:25,931
You wanna leave, don't you?

757
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:27,307
Yes.

758
01:03:27,808 --> 01:03:29,810
I wanna leave.

759
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,023
But not with you.

760
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:40,487
Not with you.

761
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:43,824
I'm sorry.

762
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:47,995
Susanna, wait a second.

763
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:35,292
Why did you do that?

764
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:41,548
Fix the light bulb at night?

765
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:45,886
I'm not here in the morning...

766
01:04:46,303 --> 01:04:49,848
...and that's when you like to draw
your pictures and stuff.

767
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,225
So....

768
01:05:02,486 --> 01:05:03,487
John?

769
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:12,663
Why do you like me?

770
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:17,793
I just like you.

771
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:20,671
That's all.

772
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,424
I wish you were getting
better, though.

773
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:26,844
I would....

774
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:32,057
I'd take you out to go see
a movie or something.

775
01:05:34,685 --> 01:05:36,436
That'd be nice.

776
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,648
My face!

777
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:43,861
My face!

778
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:46,154
I'm okay. I'm okay.

779
01:05:46,405 --> 01:05:48,323
-Let her be. She's fine.
-My face!

780
01:05:48,574 --> 01:05:49,700
My face!

781
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:52,286
Seclusion.
Take her to Seclusion. Come on.

782
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:54,371
I got you.

783
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:58,709
-My face! Why?
-Open it.

784
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,670
My face!

785
01:06:01,837 --> 01:06:03,255
My face!

786
01:06:03,547 --> 01:06:07,926
Quieten down. Quieten down.
You're all right.

787
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:12,431
I'm ugly! My face!

788
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:16,018
I'm ugly! Why?

789
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:41,919
What happened to Polly?

790
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:47,382
What needs to happen?
No one's ever gonna kiss her.

791
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:52,554
They're building a new
Disneyland in Florida.

792
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,391
If I could have any job,
I'd be a professional Cinderella.

793
01:06:57,142 --> 01:06:58,852
You could be Snow White.

794
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:01,522
Polly could be Minnie Mouse and then...

795
01:07:01,772 --> 01:07:03,690
...she'd be hugged, kissed
and loved...

796
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:07,361
...and no one would know
what's inside that giant head.

797
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:10,656
Give me your keys.

798
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:38,809
Hey, Polly.

799
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,061
It's Susanna.

800
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:42,896
Just play something.

801
01:07:43,272 --> 01:07:46,567
If talking did shit,
we'd be out of here by now.

802
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:11,842
When you're alone
And life is making you lonely

803
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:15,220
You can always go

804
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:17,264
Downtown

805
01:08:25,606 --> 01:08:29,609
When you've got worries
All the noise and the hurry

806
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:33,404
Seems to help, I know

807
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:42,122
Downtown

808
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:46,251
Just listen to the music

809
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,129
In the traffic in the city

810
01:08:49,587 --> 01:08:54,009
Linger on the sidewalks
Where the neon lights are pretty

811
01:08:55,676 --> 01:08:57,386
How can you lose?

812
01:08:58,764 --> 01:09:01,683
The lights are much brighter there

813
01:09:01,934 --> 01:09:06,772
You can forget all your troubles
Forget all your cares and go downtown

814
01:09:07,064 --> 01:09:08,689
Back to your room, please.

815
01:09:08,941 --> 01:09:12,819
Things will be great when you're
Downtown

816
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:15,322
McWilley is gonna wake up.

817
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:16,907
Give me the guitar.

818
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:20,702
You're gonna get me fired.

819
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:24,456
You'll be dancing with him
Before the night is over

820
01:09:24,706 --> 01:09:26,582
-Give me the guitar.
-Happy again

821
01:09:28,252 --> 01:09:29,837
No. No.

822
01:09:30,212 --> 01:09:32,381
It's okay. It's okay.
Come here.

823
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:34,883
You'll get me fired.
You know that?

824
01:09:46,478 --> 01:09:49,189
Downtown

825
01:09:50,566 --> 01:09:53,109
Everything's great...

826
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:57,865
...when you're downtown

827
01:10:24,183 --> 01:10:25,684
I'm writing you up.

828
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:28,395
I am sick of this bullshit.

829
01:10:33,483 --> 01:10:35,235
Is she here?

830
01:10:35,777 --> 01:10:37,738
You can go in now.

831
01:10:44,203 --> 01:10:47,581
-What did she do?
-They drugged Nurse McWilley.

832
01:10:53,879 --> 01:10:56,381
-Good morning, Susanna.
-Good morning.

833
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:57,674
How are you?

834
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:01,762
I'm fine, I guess.

835
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:04,890
Sit down.

836
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:15,859
You look tired.

837
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:23,033
Polly freaked out last night and we
stayed up singing to her, Lisa and I.

838
01:11:24,868 --> 01:11:27,621
Have you become friends with Lisa?

839
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:31,250
Why? Is that bad?

840
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:34,294
-Does it feel bad?
-No.

841
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:38,215
Before you came here, did you
have many girlfriends?

842
01:11:38,799 --> 01:11:40,342
Not really.

843
01:11:42,386 --> 01:11:46,306
Would you say that before you came here,
your friends consisted mainly...

844
01:11:46,557 --> 01:11:47,975
...of boys, of men?

845
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,020
Does it say in there
that I'm promiscuous?

846
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:54,731
Why do you choose that word?

847
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:58,485
How many guys would I have to sleep
with to be considered promiscuous?

848
01:11:58,694 --> 01:12:00,863
Textbook promiscuous?

849
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:02,865
What do you think?

850
01:12:03,156 --> 01:12:06,493
Ten. Eight. Five.

851
01:12:07,286 --> 01:12:10,873
How many girls would a guy have to sleep
with to be considered promiscuous?

852
01:12:11,081 --> 01:12:13,041
Ten? 20? 109?

853
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:15,252
Someone who's compulsively
promiscuous...

854
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:18,881
...might engage in a sex act
with a guest in their room...

855
01:12:19,089 --> 01:12:24,219
...and then engage in another sex act
during the same day with an orderly.

856
01:12:28,557 --> 01:12:33,395
Am I in trouble for kissing an orderly
or giving my boyfriend a blowjob?

857
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,316
Melvin says...

858
01:12:37,566 --> 01:12:41,945
...you have some very interesting
theories about your illness.

859
01:12:42,154 --> 01:12:46,241
You believe there is
a mystical undertow in life.

860
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:49,703
"Quicksands of shadows."

861
01:12:49,912 --> 01:12:54,082
Another one of my theories is that you
people don't know what you're doing.

862
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:57,336
You acknowledge a problem
coping with this quicksand.

863
01:12:57,586 --> 01:13:01,548
I have a problem coping with this
hospital. I wanna leave.

864
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:04,676
I can't do that.

865
01:13:04,885 --> 01:13:07,513
I signed myself in,
I can sign myself out.

866
01:13:07,804 --> 01:13:11,308
You signed yourself into our care.
We decide when you leave.

867
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,435
You're not ready for it, Susanna.

868
01:13:13,977 --> 01:13:16,688
Your progress has plateaued.

869
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:20,526
Does that disappoint you?

870
01:13:20,984 --> 01:13:22,778
I'm ambivalent.

871
01:13:23,445 --> 01:13:25,697
In fact, that's my new favourite word.

872
01:13:25,906 --> 01:13:28,408
Do you know what that means,
ambivalence?

873
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:30,118
I don't care.

874
01:13:30,369 --> 01:13:32,371
If it's your favourite word,
I would've--

875
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:35,207
It means "I don't care."
That's what it means.

876
01:13:35,415 --> 01:13:38,001
On the contrary, Susanna.

877
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:43,173
Ambivalence suggests strong
feelings in opposition.

878
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:46,468
The prefix, as in ambidextrous...

879
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:48,220
...means "both."

880
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:52,432
The rest of it, in Latin,
means "vigour."

881
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:55,978
The word suggests that you are torn...

882
01:13:56,645 --> 01:13:59,147
...between two opposing courses
of action.

883
01:14:02,818 --> 01:14:04,987
Will I stay or will I go?

884
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:08,699
Am I sane or am I crazy?

885
01:14:09,032 --> 01:14:10,784
Those aren't courses of action.

886
01:14:11,577 --> 01:14:15,163
They can be, dear, for some.

887
01:14:15,414 --> 01:14:17,457
Well, then, it's the wrong word.

888
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:19,042
No.

889
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:21,420
I think it's perfect.

890
01:14:35,392 --> 01:14:38,145
"What world is this?

891
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:40,189
What kingdom?

892
01:14:41,481 --> 01:14:44,610
What shores of what worlds?"

893
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:49,907
It's a very big question
you're faced with, Susanna.

894
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:53,327
The choice of your life.

895
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:57,789
How much will you indulge
in your flaws?

896
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:02,002
What are your flaws?
Are they flaws?

897
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:07,966
If you embrace them, will you commit
yourself to hospital for life?

898
01:15:09,301 --> 01:15:13,055
Big questions, big decisions.

899
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:18,477
Not surprising you profess
carelessness about them.

900
01:15:25,442 --> 01:15:26,985
Is that it?

901
01:15:28,946 --> 01:15:30,572
For now.

902
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,792
This way, Susanna.

903
01:15:56,098 --> 01:15:58,559
John was moved to the men's ward.

904
01:16:00,143 --> 01:16:03,689
And Lisa never came back
from Dr. Wick's office.

905
01:16:31,717 --> 01:16:34,011
We live in a time of doubt.

906
01:16:35,262 --> 01:16:38,557
The institutions we once trusted
no longer seem reliable.

907
01:16:43,187 --> 01:16:46,565
Daisy sent us a postcard
all about her new apartment.

908
01:16:47,191 --> 01:16:49,359
She got a pussycat.

909
01:16:50,277 --> 01:16:52,321
Where's Lisa?

910
01:16:53,363 --> 01:16:55,449
You know where she is.

911
01:16:56,742 --> 01:16:59,244
They just put her in another ward.

912
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:13,342
I think you need to get up.

913
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:17,554
I'm just gonna rest for a while,
just a little while.

914
01:17:25,729 --> 01:17:26,647
What are you doing?

915
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,109
Fuck!

916
01:17:33,904 --> 01:17:35,447
Sorry, too cold?

917
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:39,535
What the fuck are you doing?
Get me the fuck out of this tub!

918
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:41,203
Get yourself out.

919
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:43,539
Where's Lisa?

920
01:17:44,623 --> 01:17:46,333
Where the fuck is Lisa?

921
01:17:46,917 --> 01:17:48,794
Can't hack it without her?

922
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:53,257
You banish her for singing to Polly.
We were trying to help her!

923
01:17:53,924 --> 01:17:58,804
We were trying to help her! This place
is a fucking fascist torture chamber!

924
01:17:59,012 --> 01:18:00,180
No.

925
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:04,309
I worked in state hospitals.
This place is a five-star hotel.

926
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:08,188
Oh, lordy, pick a bale of cotton

927
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:13,861
You know, I can take a lot of crazy
shit from a lot of crazy people...

928
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:15,195
...but you?

929
01:18:15,612 --> 01:18:17,281
You are not crazy.

930
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:19,283
Then what's wrong with me?

931
01:18:19,575 --> 01:18:22,452
What the fuck's going on
inside my head?

932
01:18:22,703 --> 01:18:25,289
Tell me Dr. Val, what's
your diag-nonsense?

933
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:29,543
You are a lazy, self-indulgent
little girl...

934
01:18:29,793 --> 01:18:32,629
...who is driving herself crazy.

935
01:18:35,632 --> 01:18:39,553
Is that your medical opinion? Huh?

936
01:18:39,761 --> 01:18:43,265
Is that what you've learned in your
studies at night school...

937
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:45,767
...for Negro welfare mothers?

938
01:18:46,518 --> 01:18:50,606
I mean, Melvin doesn't have a clue.
Wick is a psycho. And you...

939
01:18:50,898 --> 01:18:52,316
...pretend you're a doctor.

940
01:18:52,482 --> 01:18:56,820
You sign charts and dole out meds, but
you's ain't no doctor, Miss Valerie.

941
01:18:57,070 --> 01:19:00,157
You's ain't nothing
but a black nursemaid.

942
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:05,579
And you're just throwing it away.

943
01:19:31,813 --> 01:19:33,941
You still wanna go to Florida?

944
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:39,363
Lisa, we need money, don't we?

945
01:19:39,613 --> 01:19:42,407
-You've tongued your meds?
-Yeah, but I only have--

946
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:44,993
They gave me shocks again.

947
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:47,204
Jamie, I have to get out of here.

948
01:19:49,831 --> 01:19:51,667
I'm Susanna.

949
01:19:52,793 --> 01:19:55,003
I'm Susanna.

950
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:15,816
What are we doing?

951
01:20:18,735 --> 01:20:20,445
What is it?

952
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:25,325
"Dear sir, please give
Daisy Randone assistance...

953
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:29,204
...installing a telephone
at 23 Vicar Street."

954
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:31,123
I thought we were going to Florida!

955
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:34,418
We just need a place to crash
till we get plane tickets.

956
01:20:36,587 --> 01:20:37,921
Come on.

957
01:20:49,266 --> 01:20:51,101
Nice coat.

958
01:21:55,499 --> 01:21:56,792
What?

959
01:21:58,001 --> 01:22:00,420
You don't want me, Tony.

960
01:22:00,712 --> 01:22:02,673
Yes, I do, baby.

961
01:22:02,923 --> 01:22:05,551
No, you don't.
I'm a crazy girl.

962
01:22:05,843 --> 01:22:08,178
You're crazy, so we can't
have one night?

963
01:22:08,387 --> 01:22:11,515
I am a crazy girl. Seriously.

964
01:22:12,891 --> 01:22:15,727
-You've been in a hospital?
-Yes.

965
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:23,527
Do you see purple people?

966
01:22:25,195 --> 01:22:27,531
My friend, he saw purple people.

967
01:22:28,073 --> 01:22:31,201
And so the state came
and took him away.

968
01:22:32,327 --> 01:22:34,121
He didn't like that.

969
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:36,456
Some time went by...

970
01:22:36,874 --> 01:22:39,751
...and he told them he didn't see
purple people no more.

971
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,420
He got better.

972
01:22:42,171 --> 01:22:45,048
No. He still sees them.

973
01:22:47,968 --> 01:22:48,802
We gotta split.

974
01:22:49,011 --> 01:22:50,679
Somebody stop her!

975
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:53,307
She took my fucking wallet!

976
01:23:03,984 --> 01:23:05,986
Identify yourself.

977
01:23:06,695 --> 01:23:08,906
It's Susanna and--

978
01:23:09,114 --> 01:23:12,034
It's Susanna. Daisy?

979
01:23:18,582 --> 01:23:19,791
You got Valium?

980
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:37,267
Cool pad.

981
01:23:39,478 --> 01:23:41,063
Peace, man, peace.

982
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,607
I'm sorry for being a bitch.
I was a drag.

983
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:45,400
That's for you.

984
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,286
That's Ruby.

985
01:23:57,037 --> 01:23:58,956
My dad bought her for me.

986
01:24:01,124 --> 01:24:03,627
This is a Castro Convertible.

987
01:24:04,419 --> 01:24:06,171
-It pulls out.
-Cool.

988
01:24:06,964 --> 01:24:08,382
-Where's your bathroom?
-Right there.

989
01:24:12,594 --> 01:24:13,929
You don't have a tub.

990
01:24:14,179 --> 01:24:16,139
No, I don't.

991
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:18,851
-What about upstairs?
-Nope.

992
01:24:21,603 --> 01:24:24,481
So, what, did you two
escape or what?

993
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:27,317
Actually, we're going to Florida.

994
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:30,487
All you have is mustard
and your chickens.

995
01:24:31,113 --> 01:24:34,491
So what are you girls going
to do in Florida?

996
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:39,037
I'm gonna be Cinderella at
Walt Disney's new theme park.

997
01:24:39,663 --> 01:24:41,748
Susanna's gonna be Snow White.

998
01:24:42,249 --> 01:24:44,543
You can come if you want.

999
01:24:45,085 --> 01:24:47,963
You can be the cocker spaniel
that eats spaghetti.

1000
01:24:49,923 --> 01:24:51,216
I wanna make pancakes.

1001
01:24:51,633 --> 01:24:53,385
I'm tired.
I wanna go to bed.

1002
01:24:53,677 --> 01:24:55,971
I want to make pancakes
in the morning.

1003
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:57,723
There's a market on the corner.

1004
01:24:58,223 --> 01:25:00,309
Pans are under the sink.

1005
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:02,477
Silver's in that drawer.

1006
01:25:05,898 --> 01:25:07,524
Do you have any money?

1007
01:25:08,859 --> 01:25:11,945
Do you have some sort
of a safety net down there?

1008
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:16,283
People you know down there in Florida?

1009
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:18,410
Relatives?

1010
01:25:19,328 --> 01:25:22,164
Friends? Anything?

1011
01:25:33,091 --> 01:25:35,344
This is for your pancakes.

1012
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:39,515
Don't make a lot of noise
in the morning.

1013
01:25:40,474 --> 01:25:42,643
I like to sleep late.

1014
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:45,521
I'll come down when I'm ready.

1015
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:16,468
Give me the Valium.

1016
01:26:17,594 --> 01:26:19,638
We don't need your daddy's money.

1017
01:26:20,097 --> 01:26:22,015
Then leave it there.

1018
01:26:22,516 --> 01:26:25,143
Just give me the fucking Valium.

1019
01:26:31,066 --> 01:26:32,234
What's this?

1020
01:26:32,484 --> 01:26:33,652
-What's this?
-Let go.

1021
01:26:33,944 --> 01:26:36,905
-Trying out your new silver?
-Get the fuck off me.

1022
01:26:37,573 --> 01:26:38,866
Less appealing for Daddy.

1023
01:26:40,284 --> 01:26:42,244
Look at your own arm, asshole.

1024
01:26:42,494 --> 01:26:44,538
I'm sick, Daisy. We know that.

1025
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:48,750
But here you are in so-called
recovery, cut up like a ham.

1026
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:50,919
Just stop it, okay?

1027
01:26:52,171 --> 01:26:54,840
Help me understand.

1028
01:26:55,632 --> 01:26:59,011
I thought you didn't do Valium.
Tell me how this works.

1029
01:27:00,137 --> 01:27:03,640
Tell me that you don't drag that blade
across your skin...

1030
01:27:03,849 --> 01:27:07,561
...and pray for the courage
to press down.

1031
01:27:09,062 --> 01:27:13,150
Tell me how your daddy
helps you cope with that.

1032
01:27:13,609 --> 01:27:15,485
Illuminate me.

1033
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:20,240
My father loves me.

1034
01:27:22,826 --> 01:27:24,077
I bet.

1035
01:27:24,286 --> 01:27:27,289
With every inch of his manhood.

1036
01:27:27,497 --> 01:27:29,458
Oh, God.

1037
01:27:33,670 --> 01:27:35,714
I'm going to sleep now.

1038
01:27:45,057 --> 01:27:46,725
Please be gone in the morning.

1039
01:27:50,103 --> 01:27:52,022
You're just jealous, Lisa...

1040
01:27:53,398 --> 01:27:55,317
...because I got better.

1041
01:27:56,318 --> 01:27:58,237
Because I was released.

1042
01:27:59,321 --> 01:28:01,782
Because I have a chance.

1043
01:28:03,242 --> 01:28:04,952
And a life.

1044
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:09,456
They didn't release you
because you're better.

1045
01:28:09,915 --> 01:28:11,542
They just gave up.

1046
01:28:12,793 --> 01:28:14,586
You call this a life?

1047
01:28:14,878 --> 01:28:19,508
Taking Daddy's money? Buying your
dollies and your knickknacks?

1048
01:28:19,675 --> 01:28:23,637
Eating his fucking chicken?
Fattening up like a prize heifer?

1049
01:28:24,596 --> 01:28:26,723
You changed the scenery,
but not the situation...

1050
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:29,268
...and the warden makes house calls.

1051
01:28:29,518 --> 01:28:31,687
And everybody knows.

1052
01:28:32,145 --> 01:28:35,148
Everybody knows that he fucks you.

1053
01:28:36,567 --> 01:28:37,985
What they don't know...

1054
01:28:39,361 --> 01:28:40,779
...is that you like it.

1055
01:28:42,823 --> 01:28:45,450
-You like it.
-Shut the fuck up!

1056
01:28:45,617 --> 01:28:47,995
Man, it's cool. It's okay.

1057
01:28:48,245 --> 01:28:49,538
It's fucking fine!

1058
01:28:49,788 --> 01:28:53,333
A man is a dick is a man
is a dick is a chicken...

1059
01:28:53,584 --> 01:28:54,960
...is a dad...

1060
01:28:55,127 --> 01:28:58,881
...a Valium, a speculum, whatever.

1061
01:28:59,173 --> 01:29:00,799
Whatever.

1062
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:03,760
You like being Mrs. Randone.

1063
01:29:05,637 --> 01:29:07,639
Probably all you've ever known.

1064
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:13,312
Have fun in Florida.

1065
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:06,967
Has she come down yet?

1066
01:31:07,676 --> 01:31:08,719
No.

1067
01:31:10,304 --> 01:31:13,390
But she's been playing
that shit all morning!

1068
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:18,937
Why does my heart go on beating?

1069
01:31:21,773 --> 01:31:25,819
Why do these eyes of mine cry?

1070
01:31:28,822 --> 01:31:31,450
Don't they know

1071
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:35,162
It's the end of the world

1072
01:31:35,412 --> 01:31:38,624
It ended when you said

1073
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:42,878
Goodbye

1074
01:32:32,553 --> 01:32:33,929
Daisy?

1075
01:32:53,407 --> 01:32:55,409
Oh, my God!

1076
01:33:07,337 --> 01:33:09,173
What an idiot.

1077
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:21,852
-Yes, I need an ambulance.
-Make it a hearse.

1078
01:33:23,187 --> 01:33:27,191
Daisy Randone. She killed herself.

1079
01:33:29,401 --> 01:33:34,281
23 Vicar Street.
Yes. Please hurry!

1080
01:33:45,751 --> 01:33:48,879
You pressed her buttons.
Now you're taking her money.

1081
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:53,217
I didn't press shit.
She was waiting for an excuse.

1082
01:33:53,425 --> 01:33:54,927
Pack up.
We have to go.

1083
01:33:55,177 --> 01:33:57,387
All right?
We have to go!

1084
01:33:57,596 --> 01:33:59,431
Now we have money.

1085
01:34:03,143 --> 01:34:05,270
Don't be stupid.

1086
01:34:08,815 --> 01:34:11,527
All right, fine.
Be stupid.

1087
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:27,871
We should send someone
for a litter box.

1088
01:36:57,943 --> 01:36:59,820
Can I pet the kitty?

1089
01:37:02,573 --> 01:37:04,157
Be careful.

1090
01:37:07,828 --> 01:37:10,747
-Hello, puddy-cat.
-Kitty!

1091
01:37:11,623 --> 01:37:13,750
You are so cute.

1092
01:37:25,929 --> 01:37:27,723
Checks.

1093
01:37:29,433 --> 01:37:31,268
Where's Georgina?

1094
01:37:32,186 --> 01:37:34,438
She's staying with Polly tonight.

1095
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:37,482
They're playing with your cat.

1096
01:37:41,445 --> 01:37:43,488
Did they find Lisa?

1097
01:37:44,823 --> 01:37:45,866
No.

1098
01:38:04,593 --> 01:38:07,346
I couldn't stand up to her.

1099
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:15,020
A decent person would
have done something.

1100
01:38:17,397 --> 01:38:19,191
Shut her up.

1101
01:38:23,278 --> 01:38:25,364
Gone upstairs.

1102
01:38:26,073 --> 01:38:27,991
Talked to Daisy.

1103
01:38:30,744 --> 01:38:33,205
Melvin said you went upstairs.

1104
01:38:35,499 --> 01:38:37,125
Too late.

1105
01:38:39,628 --> 01:38:41,964
What would you have said to her?

1106
01:38:43,674 --> 01:38:45,467
I don't know.

1107
01:38:47,261 --> 01:38:49,263
That I was sorry.

1108
01:38:54,726 --> 01:38:57,688
That I'll never know what
it was like to be her.

1109
01:39:02,025 --> 01:39:05,946
But I know what it's like
to wanna die.

1110
01:39:10,075 --> 01:39:12,578
How it hurts to smile.

1111
01:39:14,538 --> 01:39:18,041
How you try to fit in,
but you can't.

1112
01:39:19,585 --> 01:39:22,838
How you hurt yourself
on the outside...

1113
01:39:23,046 --> 01:39:26,383
...to try to kill the thing
on the inside.

1114
01:39:28,635 --> 01:39:33,432
Susanna, it's all well and good
to tell me all this.

1115
01:39:34,433 --> 01:39:38,061
But you've got to tell
some of this to your doctors.

1116
01:39:44,401 --> 01:39:46,361
How am I supposed to recover...

1117
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:49,448
...when I don't even
understand my disease?

1118
01:39:50,449 --> 01:39:52,826
But you do understand it.

1119
01:39:53,076 --> 01:39:56,663
You spoke very clearly
about it a second ago.

1120
01:39:57,456 --> 01:40:00,626
But I think what you've got
to do is put it down.

1121
01:40:00,918 --> 01:40:03,295
Put it away.
Put it in your notebook.

1122
01:40:03,462 --> 01:40:05,464
But get it out of yourself.

1123
01:40:06,215 --> 01:40:10,177
Away, so you can't
curl up with it anymore.

1124
01:40:17,059 --> 01:40:19,561
Lisa thinks it's a gift.

1125
01:40:22,314 --> 01:40:25,192
That it lets you see the truth.

1126
01:40:28,403 --> 01:40:30,864
Lisa's been here for eight years.

1127
01:40:39,456 --> 01:40:41,667
I'm so sorry.

1128
01:40:42,084 --> 01:40:45,170
-I was a pig.
-It's all right. Listen.

1129
01:40:47,798 --> 01:40:50,300
Do not drop anchor here.

1130
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:52,469
Understand?

1131
01:41:05,941 --> 01:41:08,318
When you don't want to feel...

1132
01:41:09,236 --> 01:41:12,114
...death can seem like a dream.

1133
01:41:13,115 --> 01:41:15,868
But seeing death...

1134
01:41:16,451 --> 01:41:18,453
...really seeing it...

1135
01:41:18,829 --> 01:41:22,916
...makes dreaming about it
fucking ridiculous.

1136
01:41:23,792 --> 01:41:27,754
Maybe there's a moment,
growing up...

1137
01:41:27,921 --> 01:41:30,007
...when something peels back.

1138
01:41:30,465 --> 01:41:34,845
Maybe we look for secrets because
we can't believe our minds.

1139
01:41:35,053 --> 01:41:39,016
Though I missed Lisa,
life was easier without her.

1140
01:41:39,224 --> 01:41:41,518
A thought is a hard thing
to control.

1141
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:45,772
All I know is that
I began to feel again.

1142
01:41:45,981 --> 01:41:47,232
Crazy? Sane?

1143
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:52,070
Whatever I was, I knew there was
only one way back to the world...

1144
01:41:52,279 --> 01:41:54,823
...and that was to use the place...

1145
01:41:55,032 --> 01:41:56,533
...to talk.

1146
01:41:57,201 --> 01:42:01,163
So I saw the great and wonderful
Dr. Wick three times a week...

1147
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:04,333
...and I let her hear
every thought in my head.

1148
01:42:08,295 --> 01:42:12,049
Do you think maybe I have ESP
or something, that I'm gifted?

1149
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:14,593
Perhaps.

1150
01:42:26,855 --> 01:42:29,691
You think I can be home
by Thanksgiving?

1151
01:42:33,612 --> 01:42:36,365
Nothing's happened
in weeks, you know.

1152
01:42:37,115 --> 01:42:39,785
The point is control.

1153
01:42:39,993 --> 01:42:44,122
Yeah, and here I am,
in control, off meds...

1154
01:42:44,373 --> 01:42:47,626
...no headaches, sleeping sound.

1155
01:42:56,051 --> 01:42:58,345
Oh, will you help me?
Can you help me?

1156
01:42:58,554 --> 01:43:00,472
You don't need to be helped
any longer.

1157
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:02,933
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

1158
01:43:03,809 --> 01:43:04,768
I have?

1159
01:43:04,935 --> 01:43:06,562
Then why didn't you tell her before?

1160
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:09,064
Because she wouldn't have
believed me.

1161
01:43:09,314 --> 01:43:10,816
She had to learn it for herself.

1162
01:43:11,024 --> 01:43:13,110
What have you learned, Dorothy?

1163
01:43:17,781 --> 01:43:19,408
I think that it...

1164
01:43:19,616 --> 01:43:23,620
...that it wasn't enough just to want
to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em...

1165
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:28,584
...and if I ever go looking
for my heart's desire again...

1166
01:43:28,792 --> 01:43:31,962
...I won't look any further
than my own back yard.

1167
01:43:32,254 --> 01:43:34,715
Because if it isn't there...

1168
01:43:34,923 --> 01:43:38,177
...I never really lost it
to begin with.

1169
01:43:39,178 --> 01:43:41,597
-Is that right?
-That's all it is.

1170
01:44:02,993 --> 01:44:04,536
Thanks, Joe.

1171
01:45:06,223 --> 01:45:10,936
Go away. Go away!

1172
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:18,193
It's me.

1173
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:35,711
It's been a while...

1174
01:45:37,004 --> 01:45:39,882
...and I just wanted to say hey.

1175
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:45,470
You okay?

1176
01:45:46,763 --> 01:45:48,599
Fabulous.

1177
01:45:51,643 --> 01:45:54,438
You're gonna be late.
Gretta's waiting for you.

1178
01:45:58,817 --> 01:46:02,154
I gotta go. Dr. Wick.

1179
01:46:04,531 --> 01:46:06,533
They still fucking with you?

1180
01:46:10,204 --> 01:46:11,455
They're....

1181
01:46:13,665 --> 01:46:16,376
Actually, they're letting me out.

1182
01:46:20,172 --> 01:46:21,965
Oh, that's great.

1183
01:46:25,177 --> 01:46:27,012
You better go.

1184
01:46:44,321 --> 01:46:47,908
Well, my dad got me a job,
a part-time job...

1185
01:46:48,075 --> 01:46:50,369
...at a bookstore in Harvard Square.

1186
01:46:51,537 --> 01:46:54,414
And I got an apartment
with a phone so I can--

1187
01:46:54,623 --> 01:46:55,874
Stay in touch.

1188
01:46:57,584 --> 01:47:01,338
And I'll be seeing Sonia
twice a week.

1189
01:47:01,547 --> 01:47:05,425
Is that your long-term plan?
To work in retail?

1190
01:47:09,179 --> 01:47:11,598
My plan? No.

1191
01:47:12,099 --> 01:47:14,101
Then what do you plan to do?

1192
01:47:17,145 --> 01:47:18,647
I plan to write.

1193
01:47:26,488 --> 01:47:28,198
Polly Clark.

1194
01:47:29,241 --> 01:47:31,243
Cynthia Crowley.

1195
01:47:34,663 --> 01:47:36,832
Susanna Kaysen.

1196
01:47:39,126 --> 01:47:41,920
-I don't think I need--
-Sleeping pills, darling.

1197
01:47:42,129 --> 01:47:45,549
You want to be rested for tomorrow.
Last night's a long one.

1198
01:47:45,924 --> 01:47:48,385
Good girl. Katie Cooper.

1199
01:47:50,804 --> 01:47:52,306
Rosemary Jones.

1200
01:47:54,808 --> 01:47:57,060
Teresa McCullian.

1201
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:23,397
Ruby?

1202
01:50:04,354 --> 01:50:07,774
"If I spread my fingers out,
my hand looked more human.

1203
01:50:08,025 --> 01:50:09,484
So I did that.

1204
01:50:09,776 --> 01:50:13,780
But it wasn't tiring holding my
fingers apart, so I let them relax...

1205
01:50:14,072 --> 01:50:15,908
...and then, I turned my hand over.

1206
01:50:16,366 --> 01:50:17,993
The back wasn't much better.

1207
01:50:18,285 --> 01:50:20,579
My veins bulged."

1208
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,669
Shut up, I'm reading.
Shut up!

1209
01:50:29,838 --> 01:50:33,717
"I can honestly say that my memory
has been transformed....

1210
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:37,596
By Freud's definition,
I've achieved mental health.

1211
01:50:38,096 --> 01:50:40,557
And my discharge sheet
reads, 'recovered.'

1212
01:50:41,433 --> 01:50:42,851
Recovered."

1213
01:50:45,729 --> 01:50:47,689
Don't do this!

1214
01:50:48,524 --> 01:50:49,942
"Whatever it was...."

1215
01:50:55,864 --> 01:50:58,825
"Had I stopped arguing
with my personality?

1216
01:51:00,285 --> 01:51:01,495
Recovered."

1217
01:51:03,413 --> 01:51:07,167
We were reading your book.
We're having a little read-aloud...

1218
01:51:07,376 --> 01:51:10,212
...celebrate the wisdom you're
taking into the world.

1219
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:12,798
Try to learn something,
grow as people.

1220
01:51:14,132 --> 01:51:17,094
When you were a baby,
they strapped you to a board.

1221
01:51:17,761 --> 01:51:19,930
You think Georgina doesn't
wanna leave...

1222
01:51:20,138 --> 01:51:21,723
...and I'm criminally insane.

1223
01:51:22,057 --> 01:51:24,434
What are you guys doing here?

1224
01:51:24,685 --> 01:51:28,730
"Lisa's eyes, once so magnetic,
now just look empty."

1225
01:51:30,858 --> 01:51:32,818
That is mine.

1226
01:51:33,402 --> 01:51:35,237
That is mine.

1227
01:51:37,114 --> 01:51:39,908
"Georgina lies only to people
who keep her here.

1228
01:51:40,075 --> 01:51:42,703
Sometimes I think she wants
to live in Oz forever."

1229
01:51:42,953 --> 01:51:46,331
-How perceptive.
-You better erase that thing.

1230
01:51:46,915 --> 01:51:51,253
My father is the head of the CIA,
and he could have you dead in minutes!

1231
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:53,130
"In this world, looks are everything.

1232
01:51:53,338 --> 01:51:57,301
Sometimes I think Polly's sweetness
and purity aren't genuine at all...

1233
01:51:57,509 --> 01:52:00,637
...but a desperate attempt to make it
easier for us to look at her."

1234
01:52:01,138 --> 01:52:04,224
So nice of you to pass judgment on us
now that you're cured.

1235
01:52:04,808 --> 01:52:06,894
What the fuck are you doing, Lisa?

1236
01:52:07,561 --> 01:52:09,813
I'm playing the villain,
like you want.

1237
01:52:10,063 --> 01:52:12,482
-I give you everything you want.
-No, you don't.

1238
01:52:14,234 --> 01:52:15,569
You wanted your file?
I got it!

1239
01:52:15,777 --> 01:52:19,364
You wanted out, I got you out!
You needed money, I found you some!

1240
01:52:19,573 --> 01:52:22,659
I told you the truth!
I didn't write it in a book!

1241
01:52:22,826 --> 01:52:24,912
I told you to your face!

1242
01:52:25,162 --> 01:52:29,333
I told Daisy what everybody knew and
wouldn't say, and she killed herself.

1243
01:52:29,583 --> 01:52:31,210
I played the fucking villain.

1244
01:52:31,460 --> 01:52:32,586
Just like you wanted.

1245
01:52:32,836 --> 01:52:34,296
Why would I want that?

1246
01:52:35,923 --> 01:52:38,258
Because it makes you
the good guy, sweet pea.

1247
01:52:38,425 --> 01:52:42,596
You come back here, all sweetness
and light and sad and contrite...

1248
01:52:42,804 --> 01:52:47,684
...and everybody wrings their hands,
congratulating you on your bravery.

1249
01:52:48,101 --> 01:52:52,606
Meanwhile, I'm blowing guys at the
bus station for money!

1250
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:54,733
Stop it, Lisa. She's too--

1251
01:52:54,983 --> 01:52:56,193
Shut up, Polly!

1252
01:52:58,529 --> 01:52:59,780
Where are you going?

1253
01:53:00,572 --> 01:53:02,115
I'm talking to you!

1254
01:53:06,703 --> 01:53:09,665
Where are you going?
I'm talking to you!

1255
01:53:14,127 --> 01:53:15,754
You don't like me anymore?

1256
01:53:15,963 --> 01:53:17,923
No, I don't!

1257
01:53:19,299 --> 01:53:21,134
Because you're free?

1258
01:53:21,426 --> 01:53:23,053
You think you're free?

1259
01:53:23,846 --> 01:53:25,138
I'm free!

1260
01:53:25,597 --> 01:53:28,308
You don't know what freedom is!

1261
01:53:29,101 --> 01:53:30,477
I'm free!

1262
01:53:31,019 --> 01:53:33,522
I can breathe! And you...

1263
01:53:33,730 --> 01:53:36,859
...you'll go choke on your
average fucking mediocre life!

1264
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:51,498
There are too many buttons
in the world.

1265
01:53:51,748 --> 01:53:53,917
Too many buttons,
and they're just....

1266
01:53:55,711 --> 01:53:58,172
There's way too many,
begging to be pressed.

1267
01:53:58,463 --> 01:54:00,340
They're just begging to be pressed!

1268
01:54:00,549 --> 01:54:03,093
You know, they're just
begging to be pressed.

1269
01:54:03,844 --> 01:54:05,846
And it makes me wonder.

1270
01:54:06,263 --> 01:54:10,017
It makes me fucking wonder.
Why doesn't anybody ever press mine?

1271
01:54:10,225 --> 01:54:11,643
Why am I so neglected?

1272
01:54:11,894 --> 01:54:15,063
Why doesn't anybody reach in
and rip out the truth...

1273
01:54:15,272 --> 01:54:17,608
...and tell me
that I'm a fucking whore...

1274
01:54:17,983 --> 01:54:20,110
...and that my parents
wish I were dead?

1275
01:54:20,569 --> 01:54:23,363
Because you're dead already, Lisa!

1276
01:54:30,162 --> 01:54:32,623
No one cares if you die, Lisa...

1277
01:54:34,041 --> 01:54:36,668
...because you're dead already.

1278
01:54:37,336 --> 01:54:41,256
Your heart is cold!

1279
01:54:43,467 --> 01:54:45,761
That's why you keep
coming back here.

1280
01:54:47,596 --> 01:54:49,598
You're not free.

1281
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:53,852
You need this place.
You need it to feel alive.

1282
01:54:54,394 --> 01:54:55,354
It's pathetic.

1283
01:55:37,187 --> 01:55:40,023
I've wasted a year of my life.

1284
01:55:45,571 --> 01:55:48,824
And maybe everyone
out there is a liar.

1285
01:55:52,119 --> 01:55:55,289
And maybe the whole world...

1286
01:55:55,497 --> 01:55:59,042
...is stupid and ignorant.

1287
01:56:01,795 --> 01:56:04,256
But I'd rather be in it.

1288
01:56:06,133 --> 01:56:09,970
I'd rather be fucking in it...

1289
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:12,806
...than down here with you.

1290
01:56:31,450 --> 01:56:33,952
Don't. Don't.

1291
01:56:35,370 --> 01:56:36,788
Don't.

1292
01:56:47,549 --> 01:56:49,134
Oh, God.

1293
01:57:34,137 --> 01:57:35,180
Did you get it?

1294
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:41,728
I had to trade with a transvestite
in the men's ward.

1295
01:57:44,815 --> 01:57:46,191
Thanks.

1296
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:47,127
I'm not really dead.

1297
01:58:53,675 --> 01:58:55,177
I know.

1298
01:58:59,723 --> 01:59:02,184
I'm gonna miss you, Susie Q.

1299
01:59:04,728 --> 01:59:08,106
No, you're not.
You're gonna get out of here...

1300
01:59:08,273 --> 01:59:10,651
...and you're gonna come and see me.

1301
01:59:33,882 --> 01:59:35,676
Hey, Georgina.

1302
01:59:35,968 --> 01:59:38,804
You know all that stuff
I write in my journal...

1303
01:59:39,096 --> 01:59:41,181
...I don't know what I'm saying.

1304
01:59:42,015 --> 01:59:45,102
They're just thoughts.

1305
01:59:45,811 --> 01:59:47,813
Maybe I'm the liar.

1306
01:59:49,648 --> 01:59:51,316
Maybe not.

1307
01:59:59,950 --> 02:00:01,368
See you.

1308
02:00:12,254 --> 02:00:16,842
You think if I left Ruby here
you'd take care of her for me?

1309
02:00:17,259 --> 02:00:20,762
Let me play with her
when I come for my therapy?

1310
02:00:31,732 --> 02:00:33,108
Bye, Ruby.

1311
02:00:54,713 --> 02:00:57,007
Remember me when you shave your legs.

1312
02:01:27,496 --> 02:01:29,665
Declared healthy...

1313
02:01:29,873 --> 02:01:32,835
...and sent back into the world.

1314
02:01:33,168 --> 02:01:35,629
My final diagnosis:

1315
02:01:36,046 --> 02:01:38,507
A recovered borderline.

1316
02:01:39,591 --> 02:01:42,386
What that means, I still don't know.

1317
02:01:43,637 --> 02:01:45,639
Was I ever crazy?

1318
02:01:46,598 --> 02:01:48,392
Maybe.

1319
02:01:49,226 --> 02:01:51,728
Or maybe life is.

1320
02:01:53,355 --> 02:01:55,107
I remember you.

1321
02:01:57,484 --> 02:01:58,986
Where are you going?

1322
02:01:59,987 --> 02:02:02,281
17 Burlingame.

1323
02:02:02,447 --> 02:02:03,699
All right.

1324
02:02:05,033 --> 02:02:07,828
Crazy isn't being broken...

1325
02:02:08,161 --> 02:02:11,373
...or swallowing a dark secret.

1326
02:02:11,832 --> 02:02:13,917
It's you or me...

1327
02:02:14,168 --> 02:02:16,253
...amplified.

1328
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:19,506
If you ever told a lie...

1329
02:02:19,798 --> 02:02:21,717
...and enjoyed it.

1330
02:02:23,218 --> 02:02:27,472
If you ever wished you
could be a child forever.

1331
02:02:28,807 --> 02:02:31,101
They were not perfect...

1332
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:33,812
...but they were my friends.

1333
02:02:35,189 --> 02:02:37,482
And by the '70s...

1334
02:02:37,691 --> 02:02:39,568
...most of them were out...

1335
02:02:39,818 --> 02:02:41,820
...living lives.

1336
02:02:42,571 --> 02:02:44,656
Some I've seen...

1337
02:02:45,866 --> 02:02:48,368
...some, never again.

1338
02:02:49,703 --> 02:02:53,207
But there isn't a day my heart
doesn't find them.
