1
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:10,912
Thank you, Detective

2
00:01:18,053 --> 00:01:20,137
Any change?
Nothing since you left.

3
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:30,585
She seems to be looking for something.

4
00:01:30,988 --> 00:01:31,280
Camera?

5
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,064
She has a nice ass.

6
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,057
Stay focused on the mission.

7
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:15,238
Keep an eye on her, but don't get too close.

8
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,587
- Good morning
- Good morning

9
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:29,787
What can I get for you?

10
00:02:30,243 --> 00:02:31,757
Tea with milk and fresh orange juice-

11
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:34,448
and a croissant with butter,
I've already attended to it.

12
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:36,839
- Thank you
- No problem.

13
00:02:43,312 --> 00:02:47,237
- Do you have a visual?
- I've got visual, she's drinking her tea.

14
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:48,961
- Say again?
- She's drinking her tea!

15
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:54,403
- Can I get you a tea, sir?
- No, no thank you.

16
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:11,182
- Good morning, sir
- Good morning

17
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:14,127
- I'm looking for Elise Ward
- Ward, the lady.

18
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:16,083
Okay, thanks

19
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:22,027
- Good morning, Elise Ward?
- Yes, that's me.

20
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:23,605
I have a letter for you

21
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:24,933
She's talking to someone

22
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:26,539
A delivery boy

23
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:34,969
Scotland Yard, London

24
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:38,065
Yes?

25
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,615
She's at the usual cafe, she's speaking with a man,
it looks like a messenger...

26
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:46,612
But you said to call if anything
changed in her routine

27
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:53,929
Stay on his face. His face!

28
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:04,200
- Do you think it's Alexander Pierce?
- I think everybody's Pierce.

29
00:04:05,742 --> 00:04:07,762
No, it's okay.
It is a gift, you can keep it.

30
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:09,218
Thank you

31
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:25,625
- Here you go, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

32
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:25,660
Get him.

33
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:26,623
Alright, grab him.

34
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:30,742
Let's move.

35
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:33,913
Sir, sir! Sir, we are police.

36
00:04:35,768 --> 00:04:38,449
- What did I do?
- You're under arrest

37
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:42,254
- You're coming with us.
- What did I do? - Shh!

38
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:44,870
What are you arresting me for?

39
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,846
"Elise, you have no reason
to trust me any more..."

40
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:04,031
"But give me a chance to explain myself"

41
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,731
"I know the police are watching you,
we have to throw them off the trail"

42
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,484
"Board the 8:22 at the Gare De Lyon"

43
00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:15,663
"Pick someone my height and build,
and make them believe it is me"

44
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:24,833
"Burn this letter."

45
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:31,628
"It is important you follow my instructions precisely.
I love you, Alexander"

46
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:37,153
It's from him.

47
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,840
Save that letter, go in now.
Save that letter!

48
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,174
Go, now!

49
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:10,598
- No, stop! Police!
- What happened?

50
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:14,025
Well?

51
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:17,821
The letter is burned to shit.

52
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:20,894
Don't fucking touch it.

53
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:25,182
Collect the ashes, take them to the van.
I'll send you someone.

54
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:52,116
The road's too narrow,
we have to go around. Quick!

55
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:07,408
Turn right!
Quick, go!

56
00:07:35,514 --> 00:07:36,344
Let's go

57
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:51,681
Police, make way!

58
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:00,495
Damn!

59
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:12,014
Scotland Yard

60
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,419
Wednesday meeting.

61
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:31,614
So, Alexander Pierce has a new face
Just as you suspected

62
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:37,497
I'd have thought it must've taken quite a lot of the
money he stole from Reginald Shaw

63
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:41,113
To finance this transformation

64
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:46,684
Ahmed Toubali, bicycle
courier of Algerian descent

65
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:51,448
Not only has Pierce acquired a wife, and a child...

66
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:56,299
He is also 4 inches shorter
than the used to be.

67
00:08:56,622 --> 00:08:58,886
That must have been a
big item of expenditure?

68
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,353
Congratulations Acheson,
You have indeed cracked this case.

69
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:15,144
Sir, this morning she recieved a note...
and we have strong reason to believe -

70
00:09:15,374 --> 00:09:20,707
Alexander Pierce has 744 million in illegal assets

71
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:23,979
That given he is a British Subject,
we might seize.

72
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:29,445
This operation so far has cost me
eight million pounds.

73
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,608
If I thought there were more than a one in a hundred
chance you could be successful...

74
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:37,090
It would be rational for me to
continue this operation...

75
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,711
I do not.

76
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,217
... that's an amendment... yes...

77
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:57,352
Thank you, sir

78
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,716
8:22

79
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:07,895
- Sir, the projection for the faces you asked for
- Not now

80
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,076
"8:22 Lyon"

81
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:17,628
Are they meeting in Lyon
at eight twenty-two?

82
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:20,756
- Gare de Lyon, perhaps?
- Gare de Lyon...

83
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:31,030
That's it, Gare De Lyon!
The train station, she's getting on a 8:22 train.

84
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:32,106
Go!

85
00:11:39,444 --> 00:11:42,202
"Board the 8:22 at the Gare De Lyon"

86
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:01,113
"Pick someone my height and build,
and make them believe it is me"

87
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:14,891
- I'm sorry
- What for?

88
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:32,646
Do you mind me smoking?
It's not a real cigarette.

89
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:34,679
- What?
- It's electronic

90
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:39,994
It delivers the same amount of nicotine, but the smoke is water vapor.
Yeah, watch! (puffs)

91
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:42,672
LED light

92
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:46,804
That's somewhat disappointing.

93
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:50,645
Would you rather have me smoking for real?

94
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,730
No, I would rather you be a man
who did exactly as he pleased.

95
00:13:56,597 --> 00:13:59,214
- I'm Elise
- I'm Frank

96
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:03,143
- That's a terrible name
- (laughs) Yeah, that's the only one I've got.

97
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,415
- Maybe we can find you another...
- Okay

98
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:19,344
- You're British - Mmm
- I'm American - Hmm

99
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:24,322
What brings you to Venice?

100
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,003
You read spy novels.
I am a mysterious woman on a train..

101
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:32,306
You tell me what my story is.

102
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,815
Okay...

103
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:42,832
I think you would be a diplomat attaché.

104
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:48,262
Or maybe a girl from East Germany
whose father's been kidnapped

105
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:52,933
And they're blackmailing you into
stealing something for them...

106
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:55,770
Probably microfilm,
there's usually microfilm involved.

107
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:58,472
- What awaits me?
- Trouble, certainly

108
00:14:58,507 --> 00:15:00,382
- Danger?
- Oh, yeah.

109
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:03,230
You'll most likely be shot at in less than two chapters!

110
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:08,662
Is there a man in my life?

111
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,529
... have to wait and see.

112
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:17,602
- Invite me to dinner Frank
- What?

113
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:26,496
- Would you like to have the dinner?
- Women don't like questions

114
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:32,555
- Join me for dinner
- Too demanding

115
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:37,250
- Join me for dinner?
- Another question

116
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:46,633
I'm having dinner...
If you'd care to join me

117
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:07,422
Musician?

118
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:12,666
Bartender?

119
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:19,248
I give up.

120
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,620
Math, I teach maths.

121
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,949
I would not have guessed that.

122
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:30,918
I'd imagine you're a cool math teacher, though?

123
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:33,185
Still a math teacher.

124
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:51,994
- Can I take your picture?
- Sure

125
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:16,727
Urgent Message From:
Unit 17 To: John Acheson

126
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:39,895
- Could this be Pierce?
- We're still working on that

127
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:47,153
Well, I only have the sketches to go by, so...

128
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:52,733
Ectomorpheus, same basic phenotype

129
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,460
- Bottom line, could be him
- I knew we couldn't leave her

130
00:17:58,012 --> 00:18:01,696
Run a worldwide blind check on that face,
Bet you ten quid there's no match

131
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:05,248
Okay, but what case number
do you want to book it under?

132
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:10,319
- Just run it
- Do you really think it's Pierce?

133
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:12,047
Run it.

134
00:18:21,196 --> 00:18:23,125
Get me Italian Interpol.

135
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:41,695
I have a strange feeling that those
two people over there are watching us

136
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:54,057
Do you know something?
I think you're right

137
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,308
Really?

138
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,012
You're paranoid, math teacher

139
00:19:14,846 --> 00:19:15,856
Memorize this face

140
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:20,399
The train arrives in 10 minutes
Stop him when he descends.

141
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:43,130
So, what are you doing all
alone in the city of lovers?

142
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:46,162
Is there no one in your life?

143
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:52,890
- There was.
- What happened?

144
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:02,976
- She left me.
- I'm sorry to hear that, Frank

145
00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:22,502
"Arrival at train station Venezia
Santa Lucia in 10 minutes. End of the line"

146
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:26,195
Guess I should go get my suitcase and stuff.

147
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:35,761
- Goodbye
- Goodbye, thank you.

148
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:11,815
Oh shit.

149
00:21:25,588 --> 00:21:27,186
- Sir
- Wait

150
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:31,480
"Pick someone my height and build"

151
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,799
"And make them believe it's me"

152
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:42,110
We did get an exact match

153
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,302
He's a math teacher at
Madson Community College

154
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,112
Frank Tupelo

155
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,212
Lost his wife in a car crash three years ago

156
00:21:50,563 --> 00:21:51,854
He's a tourist

157
00:21:55,111 --> 00:21:56,088
Thank you

158
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,708
Get me Italian Interpol

159
00:22:26,267 --> 00:22:27,990
Yes?

160
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:31,335
Received

161
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,370
Abort. We go back to HQ quickly.

162
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,011
On the other side.

163
00:23:28,856 --> 00:23:32,528
- What are you doing?
- The Internet Fraud Report

164
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,673
So, this is what Alexander Pierce looks like?

165
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:42,769
It's above your clearance.
Get back to your work.

166
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:19,165
He's fluttering his eyelids like a girl,
that's his tell.

167
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,120
Go all in.

168
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,539
Damn.

169
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:32,005
Yes?

170
00:24:32,884 --> 00:24:35,060
I have a piece of information for Mr. Shaw

171
00:24:37,446 --> 00:24:39,499
It's concerning Alexander Pierce

172
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,580
Alexander Pierce has just arrived in Venice

173
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:47,416
With her.

174
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,506
- Aleri.
- Sir

175
00:24:56,855 --> 00:25:00,742
- Change of course, Venice
- Yes, sir

176
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:04,674
Now what do I own in Venice?

177
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:31,355
Hi

178
00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:35,610
- Do you want to come with me?
- What?

179
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:41,408
Oh yeah, sure, I mean,
I- I could use a lift, yeah.

180
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:44,178
Thank you very - that's very kind.

181
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,574
Welcome to Venice, Madam

182
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:26,343
Bags.

183
00:26:28,918 --> 00:26:29,656
Thank you

184
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,458
Oh, uh, my bags!

185
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,412
Are you coming?

186
00:26:44,072 --> 00:26:44,897
Thank you (speaking spanish)

187
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,475
Hello, Welcome to Hotel Danieri, Madam

188
00:26:53,783 --> 00:26:55,961
Elise Clifton-Ward, and husband

189
00:26:59,073 --> 00:27:01,110
We have arranged for you a wonderful suite...

190
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,670
with bathroom and with...

191
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:10,753
- May I have your documents, please?
- Yes

192
00:27:11,341 --> 00:27:12,186
Thank you

193
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:18,199
It will be my pleasure to show you up personally.
Please, this way.

194
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:18,721
Thank you

195
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,359
- Enjoy your stay, sir
- Thank you

196
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:39,028
Everything was arranged
according to the precise instructions.

197
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:42,065
I very much hope you
will not be disappointed.

198
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,276
We are entering the Doches Suite

199
00:27:45,025 --> 00:27:51,217
A room that has been a home away from home for
Marcel Proust and Honoré de Balzac

200
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:57,788
- Have a nice day, sir
- Thank you

201
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:06,828
Make yourself at home

202
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:51,532
This really is a very nice hotel, isn't it?

203
00:28:53,018 --> 00:28:55,005
They think of everything, don't they?

204
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:03,461
I know he will be with her.

205
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:08,352
They'll be staying at one of the grand hotels.
The Pretty, The Regina, The Danieli.

206
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:11,318
I want you to keep a watch on all of them.

207
00:30:12,455 --> 00:30:14,556
You can kill the girl,
but you can't kill him.

208
00:30:16,793 --> 00:30:18,994
Not until I have my money, that is.

209
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:23,242
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir - Let's go.

210
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:46,050
- You're ravenous.
- Do you mean ravishing?

211
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:47,576
...I do.

212
00:30:48,216 --> 00:30:50,928
- You're ravenous
- I am.

213
00:30:52,244 --> 00:30:52,863
Come on!

214
00:31:07,755 --> 00:31:14,318
- The, um, Skambian champagne risotto, please.
- Excellent choice, excellent.

215
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,730
He didn't say that to me
Did he not like my choice?

216
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,871
Your choice was excellent.

217
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:46,684
Who is he?

218
00:31:49,581 --> 00:31:54,413
Hotels don't give gifts like that, do they?
Who is he?

219
00:31:56,371 --> 00:31:59,986
- He's someone they used to be very important to me
- Used to?

220
00:32:03,474 --> 00:32:05,024
Are you meeting him in Venice?

221
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:07,807
I hope so.

222
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:13,445
- Part of me hopes I don't
- Why?

223
00:32:15,854 --> 00:32:23,152
Because I don't like being told what to do.
I don't like being "summoned".

224
00:32:25,581 --> 00:32:29,310
But it felt even worse not
hearing from him for two years.

225
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:48,406
It's the Roman god, Janus.

226
00:32:49,892 --> 00:32:51,584
My mother gave it to me when I was little.

227
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:57,693
She wanted it to teach me that people have two sides;
a good side, a bad side...

228
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,844
Past and future

229
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:05,805
And that we must embrace
both in someone we love.

230
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,584
And I tried...

231
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,975
What's he like?

232
00:33:26,334 --> 00:33:32,589
He's... different from anybody I know.

233
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,206
Different's good.

234
00:33:42,073 --> 00:33:46,376
Where I come from the highest compliment...
that you can offer a person...

235
00:33:47,513 --> 00:33:51,034
Is to say that they're down to earth...
Grounded.

236
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:54,672
I hate it. Drives me nutso.

237
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,731
Would you like another Americano?

238
00:34:08,073 --> 00:34:10,518
I don't know, would I?

239
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:18,340
It really was a very nice restaurant, wasn't it?
Oh. Very nice wine.

240
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:27,134
I'm making us a nice little drink.
Which is very nice of me, isn't it?

241
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:30,559
Thank you

242
00:34:31,426 --> 00:34:33,807
Were those flowers here when we checked in?

243
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,616
It is an invitation to a Ball,
two nights from now.

244
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,308
You've been "summoned"

245
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,656
It appears I have.

246
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:41,737
May I pay you a compliment?

247
00:35:43,223 --> 00:35:45,206
Another question you need never ask.

248
00:35:48,598 --> 00:35:53,732
You are the least down to
earth person I've ever met.

249
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:19,586
It's been a long day.
I do hope the couch will be comfortable.

250
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,007
Good night

251
00:39:51,454 --> 00:39:53,653
Sorry, sir. Good morning.

252
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,077
My name is Guido, your waiter.

253
00:39:57,976 --> 00:40:01,593
I'm Frank. What's this?

254
00:40:02,224 --> 00:40:03,641
It's your breakfast, sir.

255
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:10,066
- I didn't order any.
- The lady ordered it for you, when she left

256
00:40:18,255 --> 00:40:19,461
When she left?

257
00:40:46,016 --> 00:40:47,369
Have a nice day, sir.

258
00:41:18,077 --> 00:41:21,115
- Hi.
- Alexander let's go see an old friend

259
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:28,081
- I'm not sure he's Pierce
- The boss warned us about this

260
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:29,322
Get him!

261
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:47,070
- Hello, please help
- Hello, sir

262
00:41:47,489 --> 00:41:51,607
Hello, I'm in need of help there are two
men trying to break down the door

263
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:54,772
I see, what kind of problem do
you have with the door, sir?

264
00:41:55,315 --> 00:41:57,298
No, no, no, there are two men
with guns trying to break in!

265
00:41:57,563 --> 00:41:59,950
Two men carrying pistols
(speaking spanish)

266
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:02,556
- Your spanish is excellent, sir
- Thank you

267
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:05,931
- I gotta go!
- Sir?

268
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,269
Americans...

269
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:29,736
The boss wants him alive!

270
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:40,635
She's returned.

271
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,903
Get ready to intervene.

272
00:43:07,887 --> 00:43:08,619
Yes

273
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,200
Commander Acheson, two armed men are
chasing the American from yesterday.

274
00:43:12,438 --> 00:43:14,850
Shots have been fired.
Request permission to intervene.

275
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,259
Do you still have Elise?

276
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:22,067
We still have a visual on Elise Ward,
but the American is in imminent danger.

277
00:43:22,527 --> 00:43:26,272
You mean the mathematics teacher from Wisconsin?
I'd say not our mandate.

278
00:43:26,711 --> 00:43:28,900
Sir, this man is in real peril.

279
00:43:30,523 --> 00:43:33,489
This is exactly why she chose him,
to distract us.

280
00:43:34,255 --> 00:43:35,335
Stay with her

281
00:43:35,674 --> 00:43:39,907
Do not move unless she moves.
Am I making myself crystal clear?

282
00:43:40,483 --> 00:43:42,924
Sir, they will kill him.

283
00:43:45,936 --> 00:43:47,259
Not our mandate.

284
00:44:41,067 --> 00:44:43,797
- Look at that man!
- What the hell?

285
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,954
Center, send someone to the market!

286
00:44:50,845 --> 00:44:54,022
There is a nut trying to kill himself.
American, I bet.

287
00:44:55,169 --> 00:44:56,547
Stop, stop!

288
00:44:58,325 --> 00:44:59,608
Do not jump!

289
00:45:19,346 --> 00:45:21,729
- I'm so sorry
- Asshole!

290
00:45:22,247 --> 00:45:23,062
I'm sorry!

291
00:45:26,872 --> 00:45:29,271
- Stop him
- I'm sorry, sorry!

292
00:45:54,706 --> 00:45:56,397
- Answer the phone.
- Yes, sir.

293
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:15,542
- I think you need it more than I.
- "Thank you" (speaking spanish)

294
00:46:16,308 --> 00:46:17,544
"You're welcome" (speaking spanish)

295
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:21,153
Smoke?

296
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:25,399
No?

297
00:46:39,892 --> 00:46:43,254
- Now, you wish to report a murder?
- No.

298
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:46,888
Some people tried to kill me

299
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:49,740
I was told you are reporting a murder.

300
00:46:50,164 --> 00:46:52,445
Attempted murder.

301
00:46:53,752 --> 00:46:58,854
- That's not so serious.
- No, not when you downgrade it from murder.

302
00:46:59,963 --> 00:47:02,544
But when you upgrade it from room
service, it's quite serious.

303
00:47:02,775 --> 00:47:06,864
- So is assaulting a Police Officer.
- That was an accident.

304
00:47:07,188 --> 00:47:08,704
The Officer feels differently.

305
00:47:11,653 --> 00:47:13,330
...With all due respect, sir

306
00:47:14,423 --> 00:47:17,112
...I think maybe I should
be talking with someone

307
00:47:19,345 --> 00:47:22,623
...Someone not Italian.

308
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:27,430
- Like the Embassy, or Interpol.
- Interpol? <scoffs>

309
00:47:27,733 --> 00:47:30,096
I'm an American citizen.

310
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:32,833
- What does that mean?
- I do not know.

311
00:47:32,868 --> 00:47:35,589
But I was involved in something here and no offense,
this is not a local issue.

312
00:47:37,558 --> 00:47:39,593
What is it you think you're involved in?

313
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:48,427
It all started when I met a woman
on the train from Paris

314
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,511
- This already good!
- No, no.

315
00:47:51,762 --> 00:47:53,411
She took me to her hotel.

316
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,005
- Ah, wonderful!
- No, no.

317
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:58,491
...she's involved with another man,
I think she's in love...

318
00:47:59,522 --> 00:48:02,652
- Sorry to hear that
- I know

319
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:04,866
...Anyway

320
00:48:05,989 --> 00:48:11,411
This man, whatever his story is.
Some people are obviously trying to kill him.

321
00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:17,001
- How do you know this?
- Because they tried to kill me.

322
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,876
- They tried to kill you?
- Yes!

323
00:48:20,911 --> 00:48:24,856
Because they must have
thought that I was him.

324
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:33,880
- I like you Mr. Tupelo
- I like you too, sir

325
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:38,636
But surely you understand how
strange this all sounds.

326
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:44,762
Come with me

327
00:48:53,692 --> 00:48:54,639
Where are you taking me?

328
00:49:00,454 --> 00:49:02,197
Oh! You're going to lock me in there?

329
00:49:09,788 --> 00:49:14,040
Please don't do this.
Sir, I've done nothing wrong

330
00:49:17,302 --> 00:49:19,988
- Please!
- It's only until I check some facts

331
00:49:26,483 --> 00:49:27,123
Hi.

332
00:49:39,895 --> 00:49:42,830
Your facts checked out.
We have to leave.

333
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,237
- You're not safe here
- I don't understand

334
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:51,287
This has to look right.

335
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:55,537
Come on

336
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:01,456
The man you're talking about is
called Alexander Pierce

337
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,549
...who stole big money from a gangster.

338
00:50:05,638 --> 00:50:07,140
They came to Venice to find him

339
00:50:08,801 --> 00:50:10,071
They think you are him

340
00:50:11,493 --> 00:50:16,782
They placed a... how do you say...
bounty on your head.

341
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,485
That's why you're not safe.

342
00:50:29,832 --> 00:50:30,793
Wait here for a moment

343
00:50:56,688 --> 00:50:58,284
You've come to buy a key?

344
00:51:11,121 --> 00:51:13,044
Brand new bills, I appreciate it

345
00:51:22,811 --> 00:51:23,883
You think we cheat you?

346
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:26,355
Of course not, I just enjoy counting

347
00:51:36,007 --> 00:51:39,813
Well, gentlemen,
Alexander Pierce is all yours.

348
00:51:49,423 --> 00:51:50,282
Do not shoot him!

349
00:52:11,292 --> 00:52:12,171
I think we lost them!

350
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:15,724
I'd really like to take these off!

351
00:52:16,814 --> 00:52:18,556
We have to wait until we get to open waters

352
00:55:25,047 --> 00:55:28,066
It suits you perfectly, sir
You have a wonderful figure.

353
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:34,617
- You think it's a little loose?
- No, it's of the utmost magnificence

354
00:55:42,368 --> 00:55:44,199
Fourteen red, bet made.

355
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:47,570
Wager, sir?

356
00:55:50,399 --> 00:55:50,987
Forty-two red

357
00:55:54,998 --> 00:55:57,148
- They're back.
- Yeah, bring them in.

358
00:55:58,504 --> 00:56:00,859
- I'll come back tomorrow?
- No, no, no, stay.

359
00:56:11,173 --> 00:56:12,658
We tried everything, sir

360
00:56:14,512 --> 00:56:17,362
- But he got away.
- So I heard, so I heard.

361
00:56:18,698 --> 00:56:23,342
They're referring to the young man who
stole $2.3 billion dollars from me.

362
00:56:26,601 --> 00:56:29,861
You know, I worked very hard for
years so I wouldn't have to

363
00:56:29,896 --> 00:56:33,738
do the dirty work any more.
No more chasing traitors

364
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:35,791
...No more killing

365
00:56:38,126 --> 00:56:41,979
Now I employ people
to do those things for me

366
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:45,924
Except that you don't!

367
00:57:24,094 --> 00:57:27,698
- Does it look alright?
- Yes!

368
00:57:29,044 --> 00:57:31,935
- Like always.
- What's always?

369
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,672
Very good.

370
00:57:37,442 --> 00:57:39,827
Yes, I think it looks alright!

371
00:57:55,432 --> 00:57:57,040
Huh, so that's how you pick a lock.

372
00:57:57,758 --> 00:57:59,127
How do you know how to do that?

373
00:58:03,691 --> 00:58:07,014
Where's the owner of this boat?
Bottom of a canal?

374
00:58:08,055 --> 00:58:10,206
Sitting at a cafe with a pocketful of Euros

375
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:17,798
Why is this happening?
Why is everyone trying to kill me?

376
00:58:20,492 --> 00:58:22,198
Because I kissed you.

377
00:58:29,986 --> 00:58:31,995
Do I look that much like him?

378
00:58:36,069 --> 00:58:38,718
I am sorry I got you involved in all this.

379
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:41,051
Why are you involved in all this?

380
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:48,191
- Because I'm in love with him.
- Really? I'm not.

381
00:58:49,507 --> 00:58:52,076
...Seriously, help me understand why?

382
00:58:52,503 --> 00:58:55,010
I honestly didn't think he
would let it go this far.

383
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:57,338
I didn't think he would let Shaw get to you.

384
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:01,819
Shaw - that's the man who Pierce stole from?

385
00:59:03,309 --> 00:59:07,251
Reginald Shaw.
Alexander used to be his private banker.

386
00:59:09,903 --> 00:59:14,674
- I thought he was Russian or something like that.
- He surrounds himself with the Russians.

387
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:17,166
But he's as English as Alex and I.

388
00:59:19,237 --> 00:59:20,376
Give me your hand

389
00:59:21,589 --> 00:59:26,439
Now he owns most of the casinos and brothels
from here to Novus Brusk

390
00:59:28,901 --> 00:59:32,912
Once, he bragged to Alexander
that he had every man killed

391
00:59:33,203 --> 00:59:35,169
his wife had slept with before she met him.

392
00:59:36,709 --> 00:59:39,931
And when he found out how many there had been...
he killed her too.

393
00:59:42,184 --> 00:59:42,963
There you are.

394
00:59:47,069 --> 00:59:49,741
What made Pierce think he could
take on a guy like that?

395
00:59:52,054 --> 00:59:53,095
It's just who he is.

396
01:00:00,412 --> 01:00:02,471
Could you ever feel like that
about someone like me?

397
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:12,574
I don't regret it, you know. Kissing you.

398
01:00:15,803 --> 01:00:19,983
I have to go check the, umm... the thing...

399
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:42,922
Where are we going?

400
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:05,523
The airport?

401
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,664
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

402
01:01:13,249 --> 01:01:14,757
Tie us up, would you?

403
01:01:30,743 --> 01:01:32,902
I wish we'd met in another life, Frank.

404
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,334
Take the next flight back to America,
you'll find what you need in the bag.

405
01:01:43,387 --> 01:01:44,212
Be safe.

406
01:02:08,728 --> 01:02:10,045
But I'm in love with you...

407
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:39,741
Agent Elise Clifton-Ward.
Identification number "M, F, S, 98495, G"

408
01:03:50,913 --> 01:03:51,889
<b>Clearance Authorization Approved</b>

409
01:04:32,259 --> 01:04:33,942
Well, you've certainly blown your cover now.

410
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:36,024
I'm ready to give you Pierce.

411
01:04:49,957 --> 01:04:52,771
You're ready to give me Pierce?

412
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:55,884
Well that's interesting.

413
01:04:55,919 --> 01:04:59,371
So you're aren't here to beg me
to lift your suspension?

414
01:05:00,502 --> 01:05:02,758
You've actually come to do your job?

415
01:05:03,949 --> 01:05:07,598
Allow me to ask.
Why now?

416
01:05:11,921 --> 01:05:13,858
You live with a man for an entire year.

417
01:05:13,893 --> 01:05:17,806
During which time,
we don't get one single useable photograph.

418
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:21,462
Now you're ready to give him up?

419
01:05:25,405 --> 01:05:27,995
It's because of that tourist, isn't it?

420
01:05:30,308 --> 01:05:32,824
I want to put an end to this
before someone gets killed.

421
01:05:45,069 --> 01:05:47,653
...I wish I could understand your choice in men.

422
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:51,386
...The fugitive thief?

423
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:55,571
Well, that's exciting, perhaps

424
01:05:56,484 --> 01:06:01,305
But a school teacher from Wisconsin?

425
01:06:02,904 --> 01:06:06,083
Who'd have thought your
tastes were so provincial?

426
01:06:07,561 --> 01:06:11,493
- Do you want Pierce or not?
- Yes

427
01:06:13,558 --> 01:06:15,904
I'm meeting him at a ball. Tonight.

428
01:06:17,857 --> 01:06:20,238
You know you'll have to wear a wire?

429
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,786
Hello Madam

430
01:07:36,311 --> 01:07:38,282
"She's moving toward the southeast corner"

431
01:07:48,825 --> 01:07:49,967
Where've you been?

432
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,481
I thought you'd never get here.

433
01:07:56,078 --> 01:07:57,264
Really?

434
01:07:58,599 --> 01:07:59,740
"So tell me"

435
01:08:01,271 --> 01:08:02,688
Is that our man?

436
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,919
How could you be so sure I was coming?

437
01:08:07,594 --> 01:08:08,735
I just knew it.

438
01:08:10,672 --> 01:08:13,621
Fate wouldn't bring me to an
evening like this with no reason.

439
01:08:14,811 --> 01:08:17,653
As soon as you walked in,
I knew what the reason was.

440
01:08:21,595 --> 01:08:24,635
- No?
- No

441
01:08:30,684 --> 01:08:35,898
"Count Philipe Organza, land owner,
big reputation as a swordsman"

442
01:08:36,564 --> 01:08:38,777
Well, he won't be dueling tonight.

443
01:09:09,568 --> 01:09:10,392
Wait!

444
01:09:12,054 --> 01:09:14,456
Alexander!
Excuse me.

445
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:16,225
It's Pierce, he's here.

446
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:19,227
He just left her an envelope. Pull
up the footage, we have his face.

447
01:09:38,991 --> 01:09:40,862
I don't bloody believe this!

448
01:09:41,412 --> 01:09:43,290
Alright, get that moron out of here.

449
01:09:43,924 --> 01:09:46,454
You shouldn't be -
I can't, I'm sorry.

450
01:10:03,724 --> 01:10:05,692
Come on, you owe me a dance.

451
01:10:18,072 --> 01:10:19,197
You shouldn't be here.

452
01:10:20,008 --> 01:10:23,015
No, Elise. This is the only
place on earth I should be.

453
01:10:31,042 --> 01:10:32,592
How did you get in here?

454
01:10:32,921 --> 01:10:34,587
I told the doorman, you're my wife

455
01:10:34,622 --> 01:10:36,254
and I wanted to keep an eye on you.

456
01:10:36,515 --> 01:10:38,166
Italians are big on that kinda thing

457
01:10:41,167 --> 01:10:43,000
- Leave.
- No.

458
01:10:49,776 --> 01:10:52,707
Do you like the suit?
You paid for it.

459
01:10:55,871 --> 01:10:58,430
I've been thinking about your friend Pierce,
and his plan.

460
01:10:59,224 --> 01:11:03,107
So far, I'm thinking it hasn't worked out for him.

461
01:11:03,623 --> 01:11:04,658
No?

462
01:11:05,059 --> 01:11:08,126
No, take that gangster guy.

463
01:11:08,449 --> 01:11:10,729
- Shaw?
- Yeah, Shaw.

464
01:11:11,305 --> 01:11:15,305
I don't believe that Pierce was prepared for him
being here. The whole chase.

465
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,429
Will you please leave?

466
01:11:22,655 --> 01:11:24,415
You're kinda worried about me, aren't you?

467
01:11:24,631 --> 01:11:25,474
Yes.

468
01:11:26,074 --> 01:11:27,574
And I'm worried about you

469
01:11:32,626 --> 01:11:34,180
And I'm not leaving without you

470
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:41,326
You were part of the plan.
You were useful, that's all.

471
01:11:43,314 --> 01:11:46,506
Why do you think, I saw you on the
train and my heart stopped?

472
01:11:47,925 --> 01:11:49,192
Leave.

473
01:12:04,134 --> 01:12:05,209
This way please.

474
01:12:06,174 --> 01:12:07,807
Excuse me sir, I think you've made a mista--

475
01:12:30,534 --> 01:12:33,357
"Fondamenta San Giacomo 23, Tonight"

476
01:12:36,364 --> 01:12:37,732
What's it say?

477
01:12:42,904 --> 01:12:44,802
What's it say?

478
01:12:57,837 --> 01:12:59,288
Ms. Ward's boarding the boat.

479
01:13:01,492 --> 01:13:04,767
"It looks like they've called up her boat,
what should I do?"

480
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:08,884
She may just be playing with us, let's wait.

481
01:13:14,184 --> 01:13:16,539
Fondamenta San Giacomo 23, please

482
01:13:17,348 --> 01:13:19,479
Okay, good. We have the address.

483
01:13:19,961 --> 01:13:21,462
I'm going to follow her on the boat.

484
01:13:21,852 --> 01:13:24,037
I want snipers on all surrounding roofs

485
01:13:24,379 --> 01:13:26,026
and if you get a visual on Pierce first, call.

486
01:13:52,009 --> 01:13:53,009
The Commissioner wants a report.

487
01:14:10,917 --> 01:14:11,697
Hello?

488
01:14:13,743 --> 01:14:15,119
Let's have a little fun with him

489
01:14:16,099 --> 01:14:17,662
Please? (speaking spanish)

490
01:14:21,997 --> 01:14:24,297
Who are you people?
Where are we going?

491
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:30,361
Well, I don't know, Alexander.
Where are we going?

492
01:14:31,937 --> 01:14:35,811
I'm not Alexander, my name's Frank Tupelo.

493
01:14:36,398 --> 01:14:38,537
I'm an American citizen and I have rights

494
01:14:38,572 --> 01:14:41,084
I don't care what you call yourself these days

495
01:14:41,467 --> 01:14:44,415
Your name's Alexander Pierce
and you have no rights

496
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:48,932
Not until you pay us 744 million
pounds back taxes

497
01:14:50,183 --> 01:14:52,460
Seven hundred and forty-four million?

498
01:14:52,495 --> 01:14:55,264
Looks like someone else is following our target.

499
01:14:59,815 --> 01:15:04,543
Reginald Shaw.
Well, this could be fun.

500
01:15:04,932 --> 01:15:06,454
Alright, stay close but not too close

501
01:15:06,489 --> 01:15:08,822
- And get the office to send me an interpreter.
- Right.

502
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,733
Yes, 744 million

503
01:15:13,677 --> 01:15:17,294
You didn't think we knew about that
bank account in Liechtenstein.

504
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,808
I don't know what you are talking about

505
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:20,721
Listen

506
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:23,695
...You asshole.

507
01:15:25,779 --> 01:15:27,264
I know everything about you.

508
01:15:27,931 --> 01:15:29,726
I even know how much that face cost.

509
01:15:30,704 --> 01:15:32,575
24 million wired to a Brazilian surgeon

510
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:34,458
from a numbered Swiss bank account.

511
01:15:34,493 --> 01:15:36,306
I haven't been able to prove it

512
01:15:37,224 --> 01:15:38,654
...But now I don't have to.

513
01:15:40,835 --> 01:15:43,540
...Because I just lock you in a
box in the basement

514
01:15:43,575 --> 01:15:45,681
Until you tell me where the money is.

515
01:15:57,225 --> 01:15:58,365
It's alright.

516
01:15:58,908 --> 01:16:00,358
It's alright, Frank.

517
01:16:01,984 --> 01:16:03,709
I know you're not Alexander Pierce

518
01:16:04,815 --> 01:16:07,880
But you know who you are?
You're a moron.

519
01:16:08,924 --> 01:16:13,114
And you're a moron that almost
ruined my £8 million pound sting operation.

520
01:16:13,651 --> 01:16:14,526
Twice...

521
01:16:15,895 --> 01:16:18,343
So you're going to stay here
until this is all over.

522
01:16:18,654 --> 01:16:21,669
Please, you can't do this
I haven't done anything

523
01:16:22,087 --> 01:16:23,376
I shouldn't be here.

524
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:25,300
Know what I think?

525
01:16:26,152 --> 01:16:28,801
...I think that this is the one place on Earth

526
01:16:29,256 --> 01:16:31,081
You really should be.

527
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:38,334
How was your night at the hotel?

528
01:16:39,966 --> 01:16:42,702
She's quite something, I'm sure.

529
01:16:42,737 --> 01:16:45,602
Target is about 200 yards away from destination.

530
01:16:45,637 --> 01:16:47,722
- We are matching speed.
- Good.

531
01:16:47,757 --> 01:16:49,023
But don't get too close.

532
01:16:50,217 --> 01:16:52,107
I don't want to scare Pierce off again.

533
01:17:02,189 --> 01:17:03,333
We're here.

534
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:11,027
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

535
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:13,374
I won't be needing you any more this evening.

536
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:06,676
Magnificent.

537
01:18:09,772 --> 01:18:14,202
I've never really understood the love
that people devote to each other.

538
01:18:15,133 --> 01:18:17,512
Money, yes. Possessions, yes.

539
01:18:17,953 --> 01:18:22,770
But people are so unreliable,
they sicken decay and die.

540
01:18:23,606 --> 01:18:27,125
But this, this is worth dying for.

541
01:18:45,614 --> 01:18:46,907
"...such good taste"

542
01:18:49,101 --> 01:18:50,001
We're live.

543
01:18:55,183 --> 01:18:56,387
Oh, yes, do sit down.

544
01:18:58,291 --> 01:18:59,136
When are you going in?

545
01:19:00,116 --> 01:19:01,645
You're welcome to stay and watch

546
01:19:01,956 --> 01:19:03,524
If you can keep your mouth shut

547
01:19:04,252 --> 01:19:06,518
"You know, Alexander was like a son to me"

548
01:19:07,068 --> 01:19:07,838
I loved him.

549
01:19:09,271 --> 01:19:13,688
That brilliant, playful,
disrespectful young bastard.

550
01:19:16,207 --> 01:19:18,098
I even thought he and I were two of a kind.

551
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:23,232
I took great pleasure never knowing
what the scamp would do next.

552
01:19:26,652 --> 01:19:31,587
Until one day, what he did next...
didn't give me any pleasure at all.

553
01:19:33,953 --> 01:19:36,302
...You know, in our quaint legal system

554
01:19:36,337 --> 01:19:37,670
...When a man sleeps with my wife

555
01:19:37,705 --> 01:19:41,007
...I kill him and her. Get away scot-free

556
01:19:41,645 --> 01:19:43,676
...Crime of passion as it was called

557
01:19:44,102 --> 01:19:47,132
But my passion extends
to all the things I own

558
01:19:48,011 --> 01:19:51,597
They are me, they represent me.

559
01:19:52,592 --> 01:19:59,740
So if a man steals from me, I kill him
... I kill his wife, his children, his mother

560
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:02,216
...I might even throw in the family doctor

561
01:20:02,251 --> 01:20:03,194
for good measure.

562
01:20:03,455 --> 01:20:06,962
For he has taken from me something for
which I have paid the infinite price.

563
01:20:08,621 --> 01:20:09,794
My Soul.

564
01:20:14,492 --> 01:20:17,400
That's something these idiots
will never understand.

565
01:20:37,431 --> 01:20:38,942
He's not coming, is he?

566
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:43,591
He sent you to get the money.

567
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:52,581
So where is it?
Where's my money?

568
01:20:53,699 --> 01:20:57,436
- Where is the safe?
- I don't know.

569
01:20:58,017 --> 01:21:02,239
Where is the safe?

570
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,112
I don't know.

571
01:21:04,147 --> 01:21:05,951
You don't know?

572
01:21:16,892 --> 01:21:19,205
Is it behind this bookcase here?

573
01:21:26,321 --> 01:21:29,005
...Or, perhaps

574
01:21:29,608 --> 01:21:30,733
...This one here

575
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:48,296
- Where is the safe?
- ... I don't know, I haven't seen him si--

576
01:21:49,161 --> 01:21:50,552
Please, you have to do something

577
01:21:50,587 --> 01:21:51,926
Permission to fire?

578
01:21:51,961 --> 01:21:55,349
Hold your fire. I repeat, hold your fire.
Not until Pierce shows himself.

579
01:21:56,818 --> 01:21:58,348
You're very beautiful, Elise.

580
01:21:58,383 --> 01:22:00,779
Try to combine it with a little intelligence.

581
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:04,965
- And tell me where the safe is.
- If I knew it, I would tell you.

582
01:22:09,103 --> 01:22:10,322
In my opinion she knows nothing.

583
01:22:12,733 --> 01:22:15,227
You have to go in.
They're gonna kill her.

584
01:22:15,442 --> 01:22:17,756
- Where's my interpreter?
- They're going to kill her.

585
01:22:18,326 --> 01:22:21,157
- She can handle herself.
- She can handle herself?

586
01:22:22,411 --> 01:22:23,781
She's one of us.

587
01:22:24,743 --> 01:22:26,796
Expert in undercover operations.

588
01:22:27,754 --> 01:22:30,108
When I sent her to Russia to find Pierce

589
01:22:30,143 --> 01:22:32,139
She went dark.

590
01:22:32,401 --> 01:22:34,321
...I think she could never quite decide

591
01:22:34,356 --> 01:22:36,602
If she was with him, or with us.

592
01:22:37,123 --> 01:22:38,579
She's a good agent

593
01:22:38,816 --> 01:22:41,198
...Except that she invariably
falls in love with any man

594
01:22:41,233 --> 01:22:43,435
That she spends longer
than a train ride with.

595
01:22:46,182 --> 01:22:48,105
Commander Acheson, I'm the interpreter.

596
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:49,427
Yes, go!

597
01:22:59,084 --> 01:23:01,125
If you could provide me with some context...

598
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:06,026
...She really doesn't seem

599
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:08,860
...To know where it is

600
01:23:09,306 --> 01:23:10,657
"We should go"

601
01:23:11,078 --> 01:23:12,689
We give it five more minutes

602
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:19,016
If Parce doesn't show -
If Pierce doesn't show, we get rid of the woman and go.

603
01:23:22,661 --> 01:23:24,908
- Permission to engage?
- Negative.

604
01:23:25,317 --> 01:23:27,846
- Please!
- Not one more word from you.

605
01:23:32,028 --> 01:23:33,336
They won't kill her.

606
01:23:34,585 --> 01:23:36,038
Pierce will come.

607
01:23:37,069 --> 01:23:38,644
He has to come.

608
01:23:39,686 --> 01:23:41,363
Well alright, let's do it.

609
01:23:43,554 --> 01:23:44,397
No, knife.

610
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:49,069
"Engaging target"

611
01:23:49,787 --> 01:23:54,253
- Negative, that is an order.
- Order the shot.

612
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:57,119
Now if you don't tell me where the safe is

613
01:23:57,335 --> 01:24:01,043
I might be tempted to rearrange your face somewhat

614
01:24:11,377 --> 01:24:17,780
You'll find life is not quite
so giving to an ugly woman.

615
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:28,162
You really don't know, do you?

616
01:24:39,253 --> 01:24:39,992
There!

617
01:24:44,374 --> 01:24:45,804
Behind the medallion, there!

618
01:25:25,903 --> 01:25:26,721
Open it.

619
01:25:31,748 --> 01:25:33,316
There is movement in the courtyard

620
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:36,798
Pierce, I knew it

621
01:25:42,243 --> 01:25:44,458
You know what,
he does look a little like you

622
01:25:48,498 --> 01:25:49,560
No!

623
01:26:07,964 --> 01:26:08,896
Just try.

624
01:26:22,092 --> 01:26:23,621
Go on, press it.

625
01:26:26,763 --> 01:26:29,032
You may try one more time.

626
01:26:42,341 --> 01:26:43,464
Let her go!

627
01:26:45,813 --> 01:26:47,606
Oh, my God.

628
01:26:47,914 --> 01:26:50,591
- You let her leave and I'll open the safe.
- Stop right there.

629
01:26:53,018 --> 01:26:54,870
...Frank, what in hell?

630
01:26:55,152 --> 01:26:57,475
Please Elise let me handle this

631
01:26:59,105 --> 01:27:03,393
I'll say it again, let her go
I'll open the safe.

632
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:08,154
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Alexander Pierce.

633
01:27:09,075 --> 01:27:10,572
This is the man that was driving the boat

634
01:27:10,607 --> 01:27:13,788
- He is not Alexander Pierce.
- Elise, please.

635
01:27:13,823 --> 01:27:15,322
What the hell are you doing?

636
01:27:15,357 --> 01:27:17,001
What the hell is he doing?

637
01:27:17,036 --> 01:27:18,646
"Permission to engage target?"

638
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:20,449
Shut the hell up.

639
01:27:22,296 --> 01:27:27,455
Alexander, is it you? Truly?

640
01:27:28,071 --> 01:27:29,214
Truly.

641
01:27:32,233 --> 01:27:33,582
Show me your teeth

642
01:27:35,913 --> 01:27:39,741
Alexander had crooked teeth
Stained from excessive smoking

643
01:27:40,278 --> 01:27:42,425
Braces. Electronic cigarettes.

644
01:27:43,113 --> 01:27:44,907
He had a higher forehead

645
01:27:46,341 --> 01:27:48,655
I had a migraine for two
weeks after the remodel

646
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:53,171
- You sound different
- Voice chip implant

647
01:27:53,423 --> 01:27:55,606
No, no, I mean the the way you speak

648
01:27:55,890 --> 01:27:59,190
Yes, that's right, Alexander was English
This man is American

649
01:28:02,081 --> 01:28:04,520
I've actually gotten so used
to the American accent

650
01:28:04,555 --> 01:28:06,590
that I find it a tad difficult to go back

651
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:10,681
That's pathetic,
this man is not Alexander Pierce

652
01:28:11,788 --> 01:28:12,876
He's a tourist!

653
01:28:15,061 --> 01:28:16,111
A tourist?

654
01:28:16,332 --> 01:28:18,826
Someone I happened to
sit next to on the train

655
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:21,729
How would a tourist

656
01:28:22,216 --> 01:28:24,772
know that you killed every man
your wife ever slept with?

657
01:28:24,989 --> 01:28:27,063
I told him that

658
01:28:27,098 --> 01:28:29,137
You told a tourist?

659
01:28:29,595 --> 01:28:32,035
Why would she do that?
It's absurd.

660
01:28:33,819 --> 01:28:37,607
Well, there's a simple way of finding out

661
01:28:41,291 --> 01:28:44,873
- Open the safe
- I've made you a deal

662
01:28:44,908 --> 01:28:44,908
...When she's gone

663
01:28:46,946 --> 01:28:47,409
What are you doing?

664
01:28:47,759 --> 01:28:49,177
...and I know she's safe

665
01:28:49,538 --> 01:28:50,464
...Then

666
01:28:51,472 --> 01:28:53,514
Well... I'll make you an even better deal

667
01:28:54,506 --> 01:28:55,906
Open the safe now...

668
01:28:56,726 --> 01:29:00,390
And I won't make you watch something
that you would never forget.

669
01:29:02,771 --> 01:29:03,661
Open it!

670
01:29:09,514 --> 01:29:10,503
I see

671
01:29:11,937 --> 01:29:13,165
Now you see?

672
01:29:31,096 --> 01:29:33,855
- ...Sir
- I know him, he'll come for her

673
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:36,668
I know him

674
01:29:36,929 --> 01:29:38,266
He won't give her up now

675
01:29:38,524 --> 01:29:39,705
"We must engage."

676
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:42,664
"Permission to engage, sir?"

677
01:29:44,066 --> 01:29:45,301
Sir...

678
01:29:50,973 --> 01:29:53,253
I love you

679
01:30:17,222 --> 01:30:18,311
He'll come for her

680
01:30:19,489 --> 01:30:20,871
He'll come for her,
he doesn't make se-

681
01:30:22,012 --> 01:30:24,537
This is Chief Inspector Jones,
permission granted!

682
01:30:26,263 --> 01:30:27,062
Fire!

683
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:31,420
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

684
01:31:32,431 --> 01:31:34,589
Agent Ward, your suspension's lifted

685
01:31:35,601 --> 01:31:36,643
Thank you, sir

686
01:31:36,678 --> 01:31:40,832
And your employment is terminated,
effective immediately.

687
01:31:41,534 --> 01:31:43,084
Thank you, sir

688
01:31:46,515 --> 01:31:48,615
"We got him, we got Alexander Pearce."

689
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:49,710
Where?

690
01:31:50,051 --> 01:31:53,165
"On the vondameta,
300 meters south of your location."

691
01:32:12,222 --> 01:32:13,723
So, you love me?

692
01:32:23,142 --> 01:32:24,330
I do.

693
01:32:27,054 --> 01:32:29,916
How do you feel about
Alexander Pierce these days?

694
01:32:32,253 --> 01:32:35,327
I love him too, unfortunately

695
01:32:39,565 --> 01:32:41,353
I may have a solution for you

696
01:33:14,836 --> 01:33:16,582
Are you with me this time?

697
01:33:42,864 --> 01:33:43,666
Come on, let him up.

698
01:33:45,864 --> 01:33:46,841
I'm just a tourist.

699
01:33:50,994 --> 01:33:51,991
Just a tourist.

700
01:33:53,649 --> 01:33:55,759
He said I might get arrested at some point

701
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:56,641
What?

702
01:33:57,051 --> 01:34:00,210
But that you'd have to let me go
because you have nothing on me

703
01:34:00,832 --> 01:34:01,363
Who?

704
01:34:02,181 --> 01:34:03,774
The man who's been sending me these texts

705
01:34:04,513 --> 01:34:05,229
Texts?

706
01:34:06,494 --> 01:34:07,750
And the money, of course.

707
01:34:14,041 --> 01:34:17,168
So let me get this straight
because I'm... a little confused

708
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:20,378
You received money from a man
you've never met before?

709
01:34:21,109 --> 01:34:25,752
Who sends you text messages telling you
just to show up somewhere

710
01:34:26,341 --> 01:34:27,235
Well...

711
01:34:31,358 --> 01:34:32,645
Not just anywhere...

712
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:45,679
Clear!

713
01:35:08,227 --> 01:35:10,638
Seven hundred and fourty four million

714
01:35:19,031 --> 01:35:23,314
Inspector Acheson, this operation
has been officially terminated.

715
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,464
I'll expect your report on Monday.

716
01:35:25,756 --> 01:35:27,537
- Sir, listen
- We have our money, Acheson

717
01:35:27,572 --> 01:35:29,569
But we don't have Pierce.

718
01:35:30,438 --> 01:35:33,054
The man is a criminal wanted in 14 countries

719
01:35:34,031 --> 01:35:37,097
But what is it he did? Really?

720
01:35:37,471 --> 01:35:41,364
He stole the money from a gangster.
A dead gangster.

721
01:35:41,705 --> 01:35:43,438
And he has good taste in women.

722
01:35:44,979 --> 01:35:47,327
I can't say I don't wish him well.

723
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:30,437
Twenty million dollars on plastic surgery...

724
01:36:31,187 --> 01:36:33,240
And that's the face you choose?

725
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:37,006
- Do you not like it?
- It'll do.
