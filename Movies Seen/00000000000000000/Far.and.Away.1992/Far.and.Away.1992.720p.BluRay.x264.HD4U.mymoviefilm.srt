1
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,925
Stand aside. Let us pass.

2
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,765
Buntin, you landlord bastard!

3
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,929
<i>Her beautiful eyes
were a terrible curse</i>

4
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,883
<i>Three days in his grave
She ran off with his purse</i>

5
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,119
Lads, that bloody landlord
Buntin's on his way in.

6
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,279
All hell's breaking loose.

7
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,561
Buntin?

8
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,849
I hope they kill him.

9
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,281
Would you look at
that bastard, Joe?

10
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,879
Landlord!
You're a sinner!

11
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,239
Between your lungs, there's
neither heart nor spirit,

12
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,161
but the lump of your own
swollen money bag.

13
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,122
He'll never get over that one, Joe.

14
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,968
You're a blight on this country
that never belonged to you.

15
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,730
Out, you robber!

16
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,803
Joe, come on.
Are you hurt?

17
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,881
Take me home to my sons.

18
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,046
Back!

19
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,042
Stand still, you ugly animal.

20
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,210
Whoa, you ugly...

21
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,159
Damn you.
The hell with you.

22
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,691
Colm!
What?

23
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,448
Will you look at our little brother?
He can't keep hold of his ass.

24
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,759
Sweetheart of a child.

25
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,799
Slaving away.
Is it not enough, Joseph,

26
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,759
you plowed all
that muck down there?

27
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,806
My ambition's a little grander
than yours, a couple of lazy cows.

28
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,399
Ambition, is it? To break your
back on land that isn't your own?

29
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,679
It belongs to the
landlord Christie.

30
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,882
Hold your face up, lad.

31
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,199
Come on.

32
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,607
Give us something we can aim at.

33
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,491
Shag off, the pair of you.

34
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,279
There's a goat over there.
Go improve your love life.

35
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,121
Come on now, Joseph. Just a
nosebleed's all we're asking.

36
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,883
I've no wish to fight you.

37
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Try pummelling me,
you arrogant son of a bitch.

38
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,849
Get him!

39
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,247
Watch him.
He's riled up now.

40
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,486
Hold still now.

41
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,810
Stand up, Joseph.

42
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,246
Lads, your father's been damaged.

43
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,165
You're here, Joe.

44
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,641
Da!

45
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,801
Da!

46
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,959
He took on the enemy
with his own bare hands.

47
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,881
Fifty of them.
Armed and with hideous guns.

48
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,759
Yeah, and your father,
he walloped them all.

49
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,964
One by one, the whole lot of them.

50
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,719
And I killed off a fair share
myself, to tell you the truth.

51
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,843
Quiet, Danty Duff, for once.

52
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,281
Humble as I am, I'll keep that part
of the story for another time.

53
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,799
How are you feeling now, Da?

54
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,082
My soul is departing
from me, Joseph.

55
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,399
Don't you talk that way.

56
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,479
I'll talk any way I please.
I'm dying, I tell you.

57
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,365
You can't die.
We need you here, Da.

58
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,921
Need me? What for?

59
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,481
<i>Her beautiful eyes
were a terrible curse</i>

60
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,206
Da?

61
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,530
God bless your soul.

62
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,124
Poor Joe Donnelly.

63
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,159
We'd be as well to sell off a thing
or two now that the old man's gone.

64
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,364
Is that any way to keen over
the death of our father?

65
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,679
Misery's a personal matter, Joseph.

66
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,799
We don't need any
instruction, thanks.

67
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,924
He's left us with a huge
debt of rent on the land.

68
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,891
We'll begin to settle our debts
when we harvest the land.

69
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,159
Grow the potatoes and pick them
yourself, Joseph, you ambitious boy.

70
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,044
You son of a...
Joseph!

71
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,564
Saints preserve us!

72
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,639
We thought you'd died, Da.

73
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,730
I did, son.
I passed away.

74
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,839
But you're talking to us, Da,
and your eyes are looking about.

75
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,439
I was as dead as a stone,
I tell you.

76
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,120
Now shut your mouth
before I die again.

77
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,401
Come here.

78
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,767
I've come back to
tell you something.

79
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,321
You're an especially odd boy.

80
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,409
You came back from the dead
to tell me that I'm odd?

81
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,927
You have all kinds of oddities
clattering around in your brain.

82
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,447
So had I when I was
as young as you.

83
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,441
But dreams, my boy, in this
poor corner of the world,

84
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,723
end up in a glass of ale.

85
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,524
Not my dreams.
I'll work my own land someday.

86
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,531
Without land a man is nothing.

87
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,328
Land is a man's very own soul.

88
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,401
Yeah.

89
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,923
A miracle, that's
what you're looking for.

90
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,170
And by God, if you manage it,

91
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,601
your old da will be smiling
down on you from heaven above.

92
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,284
<i>Her beautiful eyes</i>

93
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,521
God bless your soul, Joe Donnelly.

94
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,244
For the second time.

95
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,849
God rest your soul, Da.

96
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,568
Say nothing to them, lads.

97
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,811
This country's ours.
They don't exist.

98
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,970
What dead man is this?

99
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,124
What dead man is this?

100
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,167
You needn't answer,
but hear these words.

101
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,282
I represent Mr. Daniel Christie,

102
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,926
who by right of law owns this land
and all improvements upon it.

103
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,159
Rent on this property
has not been paid.

104
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,522
The warning's been given thrice.

105
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,368
Keep walking, lads. Our
father's being buried today.

106
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,488
Bastards are burning our house!

107
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,444
That will do.

108
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,919
Where is this landlord Christie?

109
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,043
I want justice for what he's done.

110
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,799
There's nothing I like better

111
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,924
than the glow of murder
in a young fella's eyes.

112
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,648
It has a terrible go of rust on it.

113
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,362
I've only killed
chickens and pigs till now.

114
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,130
He's a pig and a chicken all in
one, the same Daniel Christie.

115
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,249
Here now, give him
a proper taste of death.

116
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,047
Yeah, landlords!

117
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,250
Captain Moonlight.

118
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,485
Captain Moonlight.

119
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,759
Don't you be
pretending you know what

120
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,799
Captain Moonlight means,
'cause you don't.

121
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,199
It's the code, the rebel code.

122
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,051
Now you've heard it,
keep it to yourself.

123
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,639
Don't breathe it to a living
soul, you understand now?

124
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,649
Yeah. Yeah.

125
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,168
Captain Moonlight, Joseph.

126
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,159
Off to kill your landlord?

127
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,522
Blow the bastard's head off.

128
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,523
Don't be afraid to kill him.

129
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,843
Assassinate the bastard.

130
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,482
Joseph, it was too good
to be kept a secret, son.

131
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,719
Would you know which end of the gun

132
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,199
to point at the gentleman's ear?

133
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,479
He'll shoot himself in
the balls, I'll wager,

134
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,887
and come hobbling home in tears!

135
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,325
Goodbye, Colm.
Goodbye, Paddy.

136
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,571
Goodbye, Joseph.
We'll see you at your wake.

137
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,759
God bless all in this house.

138
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,450
God bless you, son.

139
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,568
Down from the north, are you?

140
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,127
Or perhaps the east?

141
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,284
West of here maybe?

142
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,441
South?

143
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,359
I prefer to keep my business
to myself, if you please.

144
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,722
Very wise, very wise, very wise.

145
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,759
God bless you, every one.

146
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,679
God bless you, sir.

147
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,159
Whiskey for everyone.

148
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,805
Great, great.

149
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,569
How are you, sir, tonight?

150
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,607
Oppressed.
That's the word for me.

151
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,159
I live in a house
that's stuffy and dull.

152
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,682
And worse, I've a wife
who forbids me to drink.

153
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,919
I crave adventure, boys.

154
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,964
If I had wings,
I'd fly to the stars.

155
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,879
Your good health, sir.

156
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,439
To your good health, sir.

157
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,529
To your health, Mr. Christie.

158
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,726
Liven up, lad.

159
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,006
You're too young to be
brooding in your ale.

160
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,605
What places you in this
small chapter of the world?

161
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,285
He's keeping himself
to himself, that one.

162
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,239
Then it's one of two things,
enterprise or love.

163
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,046
It isn't love,
rest assured of that.

164
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,241
Then you're a man of
business, like myself.

165
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,131
But I warn you,

166
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,322
it's brought me nothing but misery.

167
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,719
I'm lost in a fog
of commerce and compromise.

168
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,209
I'd trade it all away
for 15 minutes of freedom.

169
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,371
Freedom is a rare thing
in these parts.

170
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,800
It is.

171
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,319
It is, indeed.
It is.

172
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,851
Indeed, it is.

173
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,202
To a long and happy life,
Mr. Christie.

174
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,844
God bless you, lad.

175
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,291
<i>Why should I expire?</i>

176
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,131
<i>For the fire of any eye</i>

177
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,039
<i>Though foolish men you slay</i>

178
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,004
<i>For thee I shall not die</i>

179
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,683
<i>Your beauty and your name
will never conquer me</i>

180
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,084
<i>What have I done?</i>

181
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,601
Hello,

182
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,443
souls of the departed.

183
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,804
What a disappointment
I must seem to you all.

184
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,725
Here we are.

185
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,044
I recognize these hedges
by their dullness.

186
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,685
<i>Oh, woman high of fame</i>

187
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,363
<i>Though men have died for thee</i>

188
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,642
This is a difficult murder.

189
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,248
Good evening, Mr. Christie.

190
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,165
Take the horse.

191
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,841
Shannon, I saw you
galloping in the fields.

192
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,841
Dignity, Shannon. Dignity.

193
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,239
A lady must always be civilized
even when she rides.

194
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,999
No one saw me riding, Mother.

195
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,199
I saw you.

196
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,526
Yes, Mother.

197
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,685
"A lady must always be civilized."

198
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,999
She never leaves us alone,
does she?

199
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,691
No, she doesn't.

200
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,451
There, go on, good girl.

201
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,245
Somebody there?

202
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,724
Stay right where you are.

203
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,641
Don't flutter an eyelid
or I'll stab you.

204
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,410
I'll stab you through.

205
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,365
Father!

206
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,166
Jesus!

207
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,049
Father! Father!

208
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,050
Father! Father!

209
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,884
Father, help! Help!

210
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,726
I've been all but raped
and slaughtered.

211
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,839
What is it?

212
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,919
In the stables.

213
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,439
What's all the fuss about?

214
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,005
It's the devil himself.

215
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,520
Mr. Daniel Christie.

216
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,839
Look!

217
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,241
Yes?

218
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,684
I'm Joseph Donnelly

219
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,601
of the family Donnelly
that you pushed off our land.

220
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,199
What in the name of God
are you talking about?

221
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,404
Prepare to pay for your crimes.

222
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,401
No!
Father!

223
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,250
Good Lord Jesus!

224
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,086
Captain Moonlight.

225
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,524
Shannon, come back.

226
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,845
Quickly! Find Mr. Chase
and bring him here. Go!

227
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,369
Shannon, come inside.

228
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,284
Shannon, turn around.

229
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,479
Look how black his
fingers are, Mother.

230
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,890
Never mind his fingers.
He's a lowborn blatherskite of filth.

231
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,319
If he's so worthless, then why are
you bothering to dress his wounds?

232
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,919
Our duty is to
restore him to full health

233
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,519
so he can hear his own neck crack

234
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,451
when he dangles from
the hangman's noose.

235
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,967
Turn away, Shannon, and protect
the innocence of your eyes.

236
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,803
Of all the days to intrude
upon our peaceful life.

237
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,810
The ladies are coming by
this afternoon for tea.

238
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,611
I'm feeling very sick
all of a sudden.

239
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,559
Mind yourself, Shannon,

240
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,649
those ladies are models
of manners and behavior.

241
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,399
Nothing happened.

242
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,119
Nothing happened, indeed.

243
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,519
A poor misguided robin
has broken a windowpane.

244
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,039
What a manufactured lie.

245
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,607
I was dusting the liquor cabinet.

246
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,759
As if a bottle in your vicinity

247
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,279
stood long enough to gather dust.

248
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,970
Go upstairs...

249
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,127
<i>Mary, Mary, Mary Nell</i>

250
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,162
<i>Do you hear
your wedding bell?</i>

251
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,281
<i>Will he love you, Mary Nell?</i>

252
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,287
<i>Time and time alone will tell</i>

253
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,003
You're having a dream. This
isn't really happening. No.

254
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,645
I want my land.

255
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,091
Whatever became of
the man I married?

256
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,088
Some other man's replaced him
and goes about with his name.

257
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,799
A murderous insurgent
under your own roof.

258
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,365
How horrible.

259
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,239
He's as ugly as sin and
the most vicious creature

260
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,442
I've ever set eyes upon.

261
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,768
Did you get a look at him, Shannon?

262
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,041
A peek.

263
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,919
Shannon, what is your collar doing?

264
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,559
It's choking me.

265
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,923
Well, do it up. Better to
choke than to be vulgar.

266
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,199
I hear a noise.

267
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,079
Let us hope it is Stephen Chase.

268
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,011
We've come for your
prisoner, Mr. Christie.

269
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,961
Good afternoon, Mrs. Christie.
Good afternoon, ladies.

270
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,519
Speak of the sun
and we see its rays.

271
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,959
Oh, my goodness,
we were so frightened.

272
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,606
Now, now, keep calm.
You're safe and protected.

273
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,607
Go back to your
sinful card playing.

274
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,845
Hello, Shannon.

275
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,685
Hello, Stephen.

276
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,003
My, how handsome he is.

277
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,559
He's a brilliant young man.
He was educated at Trinity.

278
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,799
Of course!

279
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,162
He manages all my husband's
business affairs.

280
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,839
Your daughter's
certainly a very lucky girl.

281
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,610
Yes, indeed.

282
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,443
Shannon, the ladies and I would
like you to play the piano.

283
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,761
No.

284
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,724
I beg your pardon?

285
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,288
Come play something, Shannon.
Something fanciful and nice.

286
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,649
She plays beautifully.

287
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,239
Shannon, good gracious, child.

288
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,159
It's band music, Mother.

289
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,719
Band music?

290
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,519
It's very modern.
It's from America.

291
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,449
Shannon, stay back.

292
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,845
Careful, boy, your life's
worth little as it is.

293
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,966
You're the bastard
that burned my father's house.

294
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,400
I've burned many houses in the line
of duty. Am I meant to remember yours?

295
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,885
Maybe you'll remember this.

296
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,407
Pistols, tomorrow at dawn.

297
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,324
Get him upstairs.

298
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,206
Go on!

299
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,001
Come, ladies. Let us resume our
pleasantries in the parlor.

300
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,007
Come here.
You, too, Shannon.

301
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,567
What's buzzing around inside that
head of yours, my little monkey?

302
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,128
The day's been disrupted, Father.

303
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,090
Heaven forbid.

304
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,010
I'm running away.

305
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,611
Excuse me.

306
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,321
There's something in here I need.

307
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,680
Perhaps you're wondering
why I'm running away.

308
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,330
I'll tell you.

309
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,126
I'm running away
because I'm modern.

310
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,240
I'm modern and I'm
going to a modern place.

311
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,359
You're not the only
one who's trapped.

312
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,122
If I stay here, my mother will turn me
into one of her stuffy old friends.

313
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,201
No, thank you. I'm a little
more interesting than that.

314
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,159
I'm very smart and very modern.

315
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,328
That's all you
need to know about me.

316
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,170
Boy, here.

317
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,409
Have a look at this.

318
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,727
Look!

319
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,364
You can't read, can you?
How pathetic.

320
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,565
"Land," it says.

321
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,366
Land?

322
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,999
"Wanted, strong,
healthy men and women.

323
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,479
"Every resident of
the United States

324
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,001
"is entitled to 160 acres of land."

325
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,044
They've got so much of it,
they give it away for free.

326
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,403
Noland is given away

327
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,048
in any part of the world.

328
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,171
In America it is,
and I'm going there.

329
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,928
I'm going to have
a place of my own.

330
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,479
I'll have horses on it
and I'll raise them,

331
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,331
and I will ride
them any way I please.

332
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,559
What do you need more land for?

333
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,242
You own half of Ireland as it is.
They took it, your people did.

334
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,039
I didn't take it.

335
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,165
You just live here
all fancied up on rent

336
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,131
and broken backs.

337
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,960
Boy, you said you wanted land.

338
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,290
If that's what you want,
then come with me.

339
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,039
Great ships sail out
of Dublin and Liverpool,

340
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,559
but a woman dare
not travel alone. No.

341
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,048
You're brave. You shoot men.
You step on their necks.

342
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,286
When I saw that, I realized you
could be very useful to me.

343
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,399
Useful, could I?

344
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,284
Yes.
You could be my serving boy.

345
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,920
I see.

346
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,447
I see, I could
polish your boots for you.

347
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,559
They will need
a polish now and then.

348
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,886
Aye.

349
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,125
Aye, they would, and I could
make you a cup of tea.

350
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,843
When teatime calls for it.
Yes.

351
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,919
I'll throw the tea in your
face and piss on your boots

352
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,639
before I serve the likes of you.

353
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,879
Get out.
No.

354
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,919
I'll pay you threepence a day.

355
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,121
Get out!

356
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,919
I've an appointment in the morning
and I'm going to honor it.

357
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,999
You'll never win
this duel with Stephen.

358
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,839
We've all seen you handle a gun.

359
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,769
Boy, I am giving you your freedom.

360
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,119
I'm not going to a distant world.

361
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,051
I'm of Ireland and I'll
stay in Ireland till I die.

362
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,368
That's in about five hours.

363
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,404
These weapons belonged
to my father's father.

364
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,281
His father's father was an ass.

365
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,491
I've asked to serve as your
second in this barbarism.

366
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,524
I appreciate that, sir.

367
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,204
Choose one of those things.

368
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,205
You had a good breakfast
this morning, did you?

369
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,879
It was grand, sir.
Thank you.

370
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,999
Good, good.

371
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,124
Count away, 15 paces.

372
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,959
One, two...

373
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,924
This way, son.

374
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,084
Fog! My life is one
long mollifying fog.

375
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,239
The land I hold I inherited.

376
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,649
It manages itself
with a foggy logic of its own.

377
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,327
Son, I was up thinking
about you all night long.

378
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,119
I knew nothing of your family
or their eviction.

379
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,679
I'm sorry for their pain.

380
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,439
I understand why
you came to murder me.

381
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,519
Thirteen...

382
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,839
And I don't blame you
for it at all.

383
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,039
Fourteen...

384
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,401
Fifteen!

385
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,406
Turn, each man, and fire!

386
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,284
I can't see anything!

387
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,771
I can!

388
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,119
Boy, boy, come away from there.

389
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,079
Shannon, get out of the way.

390
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,759
Assess your stupidity, lad.

391
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,610
Get away from me, woman.

392
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,371
As you wish.

393
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,079
Wait!

394
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,044
Shannon!
Wait!

395
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,121
Shannon!

396
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,759
Shannon!
Shannon, don't!

397
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,919
Goodbye, Stephen!

398
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,201
Goodbye?

399
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,886
Don't shoot!

400
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,759
No! No! No!

401
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,199
Shannon!
Shannon!

402
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,804
Shannon! Don't!
No!

403
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,641
I saved your neck.
You remember that.

404
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,079
Thank you, boy.

405
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,691
Don't call me boy.

406
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,326
Sugar.

407
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,841
Two.

408
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,679
You might display some gratitude

409
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,119
considering the price I paid
for your passage.

410
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,687
I paid, let me remind you.

411
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,079
Good afternoon.

412
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,319
Forgive me if I'm intruding.

413
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,759
But I wonder if you'd enjoy a
gentle stroll around the deck.

414
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,839
She's drinking her tea now.

415
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,963
There's no need to
state the obvious, boy.

416
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,039
My name's McGuire
from Boston, Massachusetts.

417
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,999
You're American?

418
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,959
Irish-born, I went back
for personal reasons.

419
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,891
A stroll would be delightful,
Mr. McGuire.

420
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,006
Parasol.

421
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,239
In my imagination, America is
a wonderfully modern place.

422
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,479
Am I right?

423
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,639
Modern as modern can be.

424
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,079
The people, the
culture, the industry.

425
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,359
What about the land?

426
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,721
I beg your pardon?

427
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,879
Land. This girl's
got it in her head

428
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,759
they're giving land away for free.

429
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,442
That's true. Oklahoma territory.
The West's opening up.

430
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,919
I told you, boy.

431
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,360
Can't be good land.

432
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,519
It's the finest in the world.
Seeds flourish in it.

433
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,326
The cattle that grow upon it
are fat as elephants.

434
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,919
How do you get it, Mr. McGuire?

435
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,399
Is it there when
you step off the boat?

436
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,799
No. You have to
travel 1,000 miles or so.

437
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,959
When you get there, you'll have
to run for the land in a race.

438
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,446
A race?

439
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,683
Don't lose time in Boston.

440
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,129
As soon as you can, purchase
horses, a wagon and supplies.

441
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,765
Have I upset you?

442
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,282
I didn't expect it
to be so complicated.

443
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,287
We're very fortunate. Any difficulty
can be overcome with money.

444
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,802
Excuse me, I'd like to speak
to Mr. McGuire alone.

445
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,484
Mr. McGuire, I do have money,
but it's in the form of spoons.

446
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,759
Spoons?

447
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,724
Ancient spoons made of silver.

448
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,759
I'd planned to sell them
when I arrived in Boston.

449
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,362
I can recommend a couple of shops
that'll treat you honestly.

450
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,759
I'm very much obliged to you, sir.

451
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,610
Pleasure's mine.

452
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,291
Thank you.

453
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,484
May I ask what you are doing
sitting at my table?

454
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,649
I'm eating your chocolate cake.

455
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,007
I see. And what have you done
with my father's necktie?

456
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,248
I flung it into the sea.
It was gagging my throat.

457
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,519
You're just upset
because everything

458
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,961
I told you about is
turning out to be true.

459
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,929
"Cows as fat as elephants."
I know what that man's after.

460
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,081
I think you should
cover your ankles.

461
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,362
America.
I'm here, I've made it.

462
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,724
I've arrived, Joseph.

463
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,604
Beg your pardon.

464
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,561
United States of America flag.
You're an American today.

465
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,250
Your great friend,
Mr. McGuire, has vanished.

466
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,359
for one American dollar?

467
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,801
There he is!
Mr. McGuire!

468
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,606
Over here!

469
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,164
Mr. McGuire!
Mr. McGuire!

470
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,291
There you are.

471
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,519
Hey, mister, you Irish?
I can take you to the ward boss.

472
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,799
Need work? Need lodging? There's
people that hate you if you're Irish.

473
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,559
You can't get nothing
without the ward boss.

474
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,239
He's the biggest man in Boston.

475
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,647
Go fleece somebody else, boy.

476
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,079
I know the games of these shysters.
Come on, Miss Christie.

477
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,442
I'll find you a suitable hotel.

478
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,439
Cab!

479
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,085
Thank goodness for Mr. McGuire.

480
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,121
Take Miss Christie
here to a decent hotel.

481
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,446
Well, you've certainly upheld
your end of the bargain.

482
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,090
Good luck, Shannon.

483
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,971
Good luck, Joseph.

484
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,770
Hey, McGuire.

485
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,359
Yes?

486
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,607
Welcome back.

487
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,611
Oh, my God!

488
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,001
Oh, my God! My spoons, my spoons.
They're taking my spoons.

489
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,484
Joseph, Mr. McGuire
stole my spoons.

490
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,929
No, please! Those are mine.
He stole them from me.

491
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,967
Joseph! Please. Joseph, that
dead man, he stole my spoons.

492
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,681
My bag.
They're taking everything.

493
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,839
Now I have nothing.

494
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,439
Come away, Shannon, we have to go.

495
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,399
I have nothing now.
I have no money.

496
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,319
God is punishing me, Joseph.

497
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,559
I stole those spoons from my
mother the morning I ran away.

498
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,279
Hey, you!
You! Stand still!

499
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,999
I didn't do nothing.

500
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,770
Who's this man, the ward boss?

501
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,919
That's him there,
fighting in the fancy clothes.

502
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,009
Mike Kelly, his name is.

503
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,159
Shannon, you should
stand back over there.

504
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,204
Don't shield me, Joseph.
It's only a boxing match.

505
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,761
What?

506
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,519
I'm sorry, Mike.

507
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,882
Mike isn't happy when he loses.

508
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,371
You distracted me.

509
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,168
You weren't concentrating.

510
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,203
A scrappy Connemara man?

511
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,644
Fresh off the boat?

512
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,406
Follow me.

513
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,559
Not you, woman.
You just cost me part of a tooth.

514
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,079
If he gets to go, then I get to go.

515
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,725
I'm Mike Kelly.

516
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,890
Who is this bit of a
snip anyway, your wife?

517
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,719
Certainly not.

518
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,279
Then who are you
coming into my club?

519
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,005
She's...
I'm...

520
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,760
My sister.

521
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,679
Tell me she isn't
a pain in the ass.

522
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,679
Sister? Our blood's not even
the same temperature.

523
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,881
Shannon.

524
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,603
These people, Shannon,
are my kind of people.

525
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,530
And my kind doesn't like your kind.

526
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,645
In fact, they hate
everything about you.

527
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,009
Now, for some reason or other,
I'm willing to lie for you.

528
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,319
Or we could tell them you're a
rich Protestant. Might be sporting.

529
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,010
No, Joseph.

530
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,161
My brother.

531
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,646
Good.

532
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,279
What do you call yourself?

533
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,799
Joseph Donnelly.

534
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,526
Well, Donnelly, let's put you
on the road to citizenship.

535
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,800
We'll get you working and get
you voting when the time comes.

536
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,008
See how the system works here, lad?

537
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,006
Yeah.

538
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,721
Stop it.

539
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,959
Don't.
Leave me alone.

540
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,686
Get away or I'll claw your eyes out.

541
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,648
Don't. No.
I said, leave me alone.

542
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,282
Excuse me, Mr. Kelly.

543
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,759
Leave me alone.
I won't ask you again.

544
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,281
No. Get away!

545
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,200
I'll ask you to
leave this lady alone.

546
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,330
Go ahead and ask.

547
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,884
I've no wish to fight you.

548
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,408
He's no wish to fight me...

549
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,365
All right, hold him.

550
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,360
No, he's mine.
He's mine alone.

551
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,530
Get him, Joseph!

552
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,811
Okay, okay.

553
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,241
Well, now.

554
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,959
You knocked the piss out of the man

555
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,764
who knocked the piss out of me.

556
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,242
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

557
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,919
Dermody.
Yes, sir, Mr. Kelly.

558
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,284
Time to make the rounds. We'll take
this scrapper and the girl here

559
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,763
and lodge them at Molly Kay's.

560
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,009
Grab the luggage.
Yes, sir.

561
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,885
Come on.

562
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,281
Pete, get a match going these
fellas can bet on, will you? I'll be back.

563
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,359
Hey, Mike, what the hell you doing?

564
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,959
All depends.
Good to see you, lads.

565
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,159
This is it, here we are.

566
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,400
Good day to you, Mr. Kelly.
How are you, man?

567
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,599
Molly!

568
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,119
It's just as unpleasant
for me as it is for you.

569
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,039
Got a brother and sister,
Molly, need a room.

570
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,119
You're in luck. We had a
suicide just this morning.

571
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,239
How are you, Bridget?

572
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,521
Hello, Mike.

573
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,839
Any gentlemen up here, girls?

574
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,451
No.

575
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,839
Make an announcement, Dermody.

576
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,119
Ward boss!
Ward boss!

577
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,679
I give you another year.

578
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,159
You're not campaigning, Mike.

579
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,879
Relax, Molly. Politics is more
important to these men than sex.

580
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,359
And I'm the Virgin Mary.

581
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,959
God forgive you, Molly.

582
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,128
Not likely, Mike.
Come on.

583
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,719
Is that Jimmy Dunne, I see? I was
chatting with your wife today, Jimmy.

584
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,843
Don't tell me wife, Mike.

585
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,199
And here is the bath, but
don't linger in it too long.

586
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,528
It's the only one in the house.

587
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,489
This is your room here.

588
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,920
Ours?

589
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,806
You're not suggesting
that we share this room?

590
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,809
I don't care what you do in it
as long as you pay me $1 a week.

591
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,999
There must be some mistake.
We need two rooms.

592
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,519
I've only got the one.

593
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,679
Well, that's not good enough.

594
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,879
Mike, what have you sent me?

595
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,119
You're not listening!

596
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,405
Shannon! Molly, the room is fine.
We'll take it gratefully.

597
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,161
Your sister was spoilt, I'd say.

598
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,001
Shannon?
Shannon, are you awake?

599
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,884
No, sound asleep.

600
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,567
I think I like America.

601
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,408
Do you now?
Aye.

602
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,162
We've only been here a day.
Look at the welcome we've got.

603
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,802
Would you like a room?
Here you go.

604
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,530
Would you like a job?
Why, here you go.

605
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,128
How about some land?
Well, get a horse and help yourself.

606
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,090
So, now you believe me
about the land, do you?

607
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,043
If they're throwing it away,
I wouldn't mind a piece of it.

608
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,404
Maybe this is my destiny.

609
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,599
On his deathbed, my father told me

610
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,768
he'd be watching me from up above.

611
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,247
I wonder now if his spirit might
be near, guiding me along.

612
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,719
If he bumps into
Mr. McGuire up there,

613
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,763
tell him I want my spoons back.

614
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,651
Imagine me,

615
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,404
Joseph Donnelly, standing
on my own plot of land.

616
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,247
What would I plant, I wonder, what?

617
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,723
Oats? Corn?

618
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,603
Potatoes?
God, no, not potatoes.

619
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,851
Maybe wheat.

620
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,086
Wheat.

621
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,566
Shannon, I'm dreaming of it now.

622
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,650
Great fields of wheat
as far as the eye can see.

623
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:04,842
Oklahoma land was my idea,
you blathering fool!

624
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,479
"Maybe this is my destiny."

625
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,889
If it weren't for me, farm boy,
you wouldn't even be here.

626
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,524
If it weren't for me, Miss High and
Mighty, you'd have died in the street!

627
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,604
Give me back my pillow.

628
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,009
Not in 100 years.

629
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,162
This book is irritating me.

630
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,971
Do you actually think
you're fooling me, Daniel?

631
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,721
Would you prefer I proclaim my
independence and drink in the open?

632
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,280
No.

633
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,729
I like the system we've got.

634
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,804
How can she be so cruel?

635
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,202
Not to send us any word.

636
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,651
She's in America, Nora.

637
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,531
She's been writing to me
for some time now.

638
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,648
You hid these from me?

639
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,089
At Shannon's request.

640
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,245
Read them now,

641
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,691
though they may not
bring you comfort.

642
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,161
Nora!

643
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,801
Nora!

644
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,359
Death to the landlord.

645
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,005
Burn the house to the ground.

646
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,839
Burn it down.

647
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,089
Captain Moonlight.

648
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,599
Get out of the house, Nora!

649
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,319
The letters.

650
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,959
Leave the letters alone, Nora.

651
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,161
My baby!

652
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,650
Come with me.

653
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,448
Stephen, we're over here.

654
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,529
Quickly, come this way.

655
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,731
All of your life
collected and destroyed.

656
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,962
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

657
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,279
Does this mean we're finished?

658
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,799
Are we impoverished now?

659
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,999
No, sir.

660
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,646
You still have your land
and your holdings.

661
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,450
This is no longer
the Ireland of my birth.

662
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:58,039
Our daughter's fallen into perilous
ruin, Daniel. We must go to her now.

663
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,446
Shannon?

664
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,965
She's been in Boston
these many months.

665
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,848
Then we shall find her there.

666
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,639
You over there, keep working.

667
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,890
You don't work, you don't get paid.
Get those chickens plucked.

668
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,731
Get to work.

669
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,399
I think the prettiest
girl in this factory

670
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,571
with the prettiest eyes and the
prettiest red hair is Joseph's sister.

671
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,479
If you don't mind
me saying so, Joseph.

672
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,409
Say what you like, lad.

673
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,521
But I warn you, that redhead
has a bite that stings.

674
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,325
Get to work.

675
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,486
Get your filthy hands
off me, you ugly animal.

676
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,763
That'll cost you a day's wage.

677
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,570
Go ahead.
Insult me again.

678
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,679
Pig.

679
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,329
There goes tomorrow.

680
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,086
Done?

681
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:51,127
Take Friday as well, you spineless
little fraction of a man.

682
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,963
Bite, lads. Bite!

683
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,804
What are you looking at?

684
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,408
I'm just trying to figure out
what you're doing there.

685
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,279
It's obvious what I'm doing,
I'm cleaning my clothes.

686
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,527
I see.

687
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,810
Do you ever wonder why it
takes you so long, Shannon?

688
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,839
My clothes, if you notice,
if you look about,

689
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:40,283
are washed and hung.
Done.

690
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,527
Your talent astounds me, Joseph.

691
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,644
Move over.
Move over.

692
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,359
If you want to clean your clothes,

693
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,799
you have to get your hands wet.

694
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,651
First, you place the board like so.

695
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:02,924
You take the soap in your right
hand, the clothes in the left.

696
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,369
You brush the soap across
the clothes twice. Like so.

697
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,691
Then you plunge and scrub.
You plunge and scrub.

698
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,199
Plunge and scrub
and plunge and scrub.

699
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,562
And plunge and scrub and lift.

700
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,801
And if it's still not clean,
then you go again.

701
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,279
You plunge and scrub.
You plunge and scrub.

702
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,759
You keep plunging and scrubbing

703
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:35,170
till all your plunging
and scrubbing is done.

704
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:49,001
Thirty, 40, 45, 50.

705
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,965
You could be a banker, Joseph,
with your ability to count.

706
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,685
A compliment.

707
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,330
Thank you, Shannon.

708
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,759
Don't suppose you've calculated
what the journey will cost.

709
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,442
If I barter, I can get a
buckboard for under $25.

710
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,683
It's the harness that's costly.

711
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,924
Bit, frame...

712
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,841
Frame, collar, reins.

713
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,890
Very impressive.

714
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,522
How much have you saved, Shannon?

715
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,639
Are you still praying you'll make
it to the Oklahoma land race?

716
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,119
I'll get there.

717
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,685
What a corker.

718
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,164
You're a corker, Shannon.

719
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,519
Why don't you go back to Ireland?
Write your parents for money.

720
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,724
They'll forgive you
for your petty foolishness.

721
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,123
America may not be exactly
what I thought it would be.

722
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,851
But if I went back
to Ireland, I wouldn't...

723
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,321
What?

724
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,285
Wouldn't what?

725
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,839
I said I'll get there and
I'll get there. By myself.

726
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,199
You'll need supplies.

727
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,519
Of course.
Food, clothes.

728
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,245
Ammunition, gun.

729
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,003
Whenever I think of guns,
I remember Stephen Chase.

730
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,811
You're lucky to be rid
of that piss-headed snob.

731
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,967
He wasn't so bad, Joseph.
You didn't know him as well as I did.

732
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,684
I knew him well enough.

733
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,444
Me, he adored.

734
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,684
He worshiped me.

735
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,639
There wasn't a puddle of mud

736
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:36,049
he didn't lay his coat upon
for me to walk across.

737
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,330
Are you facing east?

738
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,125
I'm facing east.

739
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,486
All right.

740
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,565
Almost ready.

741
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,804
Thanks be to Jesus.

742
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,246
Light!

743
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,326
I'm in.

744
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,010
Good night, Shannon.

745
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,606
Joseph?

746
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,206
What?

747
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,249
Am I beautiful at all?

748
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:09,450
I've never seen anything like
you in all my living life.

749
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,847
Good.

750
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:38,159
Let's have another boxing
match. We need another challenger.

751
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,759
This man has not
been defeated tonight.

752
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,405
Will anyone box him?

753
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:46,199
Any challengers? You, sir, you can
beat him. You got the face of a winner.

754
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,970
I'll fight him!

755
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,241
Joseph!

756
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:57,679
No! No. Joseph,
there's rules in this club.

757
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,441
Toe the line and all that. You got
to wait till I signal, Joseph.

758
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,159
Toe the line, gentlemen!

759
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,523
No kicking, no biting, no gouging!

760
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,724
You're facing the wrong way!

761
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,919
Fight me here, farmer!

762
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,929
Your foot on the line.

763
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,886
Right.

764
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,323
Toe the line. Toe the line.
Get away.

765
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,688
Come on, you're yella!

766
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,321
Come on!

767
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,450
Come on, scrapper.

768
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,168
Stop it.
You won, Joseph. Stop it.

769
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,129
What a fight.
I knew you had it in you.

770
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,881
Girls, next up, the burleycue.

771
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,879
What do you call yourself again?

772
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,079
Joseph Donnelly.

773
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:10,841
That's right. Joseph Donnelly. You
clobbered that fella's brains out.

774
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,168
I discovered this fella,
fresh off the boat.

775
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:18,244
Gordon, get this scrapper
something to smoke.

776
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,368
Who's your boy there, Kelly?

777
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,369
A new-fangled style
of fighting he's got.

778
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,119
He's slippery, all right.

779
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:33,484
Joseph, shake hands with Mr. D'Arcy
Bourke, member of the City Council.

780
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,559
I'll shake your hand, Mr. Bourke,

781
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,240
but I'm not in a friendly mood.
I came here to fight.

782
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,239
There's fight left in me yet.

783
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,090
He's a lively one, Kelly.

784
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,926
Would you box an Italian
if I scared one up?

785
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,679
I'll box any man
you put in front of me.

786
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:51,439
Mike, Mike, Mike!

787
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,519
Jesus Christ, Dermody, when's
your voice gonna change?

788
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,679
We've got another pug, Mike.
Bring him on.

789
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,319
And I'll put money on you.

790
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,761
Place your bets, gentlemen.

791
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,088
The boy's got an appetite, Kelly.

792
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,999
Toe the line, gentlemen.
Joseph.

793
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:27,446
It's nothing.
I'm feeling grand tonight.

794
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,328
Steady now, you rogue.

795
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,321
Joseph.

796
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,639
Oh, my God, what happened?

797
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,410
Help me get him into bed.

798
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,131
Joseph, you're covered in blood.
What happened to you?

799
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:46,729
He's been prizefighting,
but he'll survive.

800
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:51,042
He had a charge of gunpowder
in him that needed to go off.

801
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,044
And who might you be?

802
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,240
I'm Grace.
I work at the Social Club.

803
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,246
I did well tonight, didn't I?

804
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,562
You beat them all, Joseph.

805
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,370
But don't talk now.

806
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,290
Get some sleep.

807
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,849
I need to talk to you.

808
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,841
You're his sister, right?

809
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:30,080
What sort of man is he? Besides
tough and handsome as a devil.

810
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,250
He's extremely moody.

811
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,970
I believe that. Full of spit, isn't he?
And passion?

812
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,368
No, not really, no.
He's fairly dull.

813
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,884
Dull? I don't know what
sort of men you're used to,

814
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,122
but he's anything but dull.

815
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,839
And the build on him.

816
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,279
Me and the girls got swollen
eyes from gawking at his bum.

817
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,999
Goodbye, Grace.

818
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,319
Would you tell him I...

819
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,599
Nice to meet you.

820
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,799
I just want...

821
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,047
Good night, Grace.

822
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,251
That was Grace.

823
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,799
So she said.

824
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,799
She dances in the burleycue.

825
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,279
Yes, well, never mind her now.

826
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,639
Just lay there.

827
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,649
No, Joseph, lie still.
Lie still.

828
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,122
Look in my boot down there.

829
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:31,399
$4. That's more than plucking
chickens in a month.

830
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,525
I'll have my horse-and-buggy
money before the winter comes,

831
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,759
and it won't be
from plucking chickens.

832
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,759
There are other ways to
get to Oklahoma, Joseph.

833
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,521
You should have heard them,
Shannon, cheering me on.

834
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,250
It was grand.

835
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,239
Toe the line, gentlemen.

836
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,806
Too slow.

837
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,199
You come to the body,
you come to the face.

838
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,439
And you move out of the way.

839
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,919
When he's coming around,
you get out of the way.

840
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,724
They just stand there,
look at them.

841
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,642
Come on! Come on!
Come on now!

842
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,279
Hello there, Joseph.

843
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,559
Hello, Cara.

844
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,842
All done up like a gentleman.

845
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,919
How do you do, ladies?

846
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,848
Shannon.
Joseph.

847
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,119
He's a handsome catch,
that Joseph Donnelly is.

848
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,159
If he can keep his
knuckles up all night,

849
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,119
imagine what his willie can do.

850
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,686
Shoes, secondhand shoes, madam.

851
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,049
Would you look at that!

852
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,999
Look at the sleeves
all billowed out.

853
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,999
From Paris, France, it says.

854
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,089
So beautiful and modern.

855
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,930
Excuse me!

856
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,679
Well, excuse me.

857
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,247
Even her poodle's putting on airs.

858
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,451
Look, Shannon,
there's your famous brother.

859
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,804
Good grief, he's bought
himself another hat.

860
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,239
See you tomorrow.
Bye.

861
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,521
Bye, Olive.

862
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,399
Hello, Shannon.

863
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,647
Hello, Joseph.

864
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,846
What do you think?
Do you like it?

865
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,601
Like my hat?

866
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,368
No. Not at all.

867
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,243
I'll get some other opinions.

868
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,119
Do you like my hat?

869
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,959
It's a fine hat, Mr. Donnelly,

870
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,599
and a fine fight
last night as well.

871
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,404
Glad you enjoyed it, Connor.

872
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,519
So I left her there
pulling up her knickers.

873
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,764
Hold on a second.
Here he comes.

874
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,119
There's my boy,
looking fit and dandy.

875
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,399
How are you, scrapper?

876
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,559
Never better, Mike.

877
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,999
Hello, lads.

878
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,399
Mr. Bourke would
like a word with you.

879
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,444
Joseph Donnelly, still undefeated.

880
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,879
He's a rascal of a holy terror.

881
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,128
That he is.

882
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:56,322
That's a long-legged
piece of strawberry tart.

883
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,890
Mind your mouth, Mr. Bourke.

884
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,124
Now, Donnelly, you don't
talk to Mr. Bourke that way.

885
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,965
Let it go, Kelly.

886
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:12,202
This is business and the
boy's our stock in trade.

887
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,439
Now, listen to me, lad. There's
a man I want you to box.

888
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:20,087
He's a goddamn Italian and I
want you to spill his blood.

889
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,287
I'll box and I'll win.

890
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,527
But your boys don't
own me, Mr. Bourke.

891
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,809
I box for myself, alone.

892
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,642
What do you think you're doing
pissing against the wind?

893
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,999
D'Arcy Bourke is a
powerful man in Boston,

894
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,719
a man whose connections I need.

895
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,799
I'm not gonna kiss
the back of his trousers

896
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,923
just 'cause the rest of you do.

897
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,764
You like your suit?

898
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,051
Well, do you?

899
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,359
You like having
a roof over your head?

900
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,759
I'm your bread and butter, lad.

901
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,399
Cross me and you're nothing,

902
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,682
nothing but an ignorant mick.

903
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,799
You do what you're told or I'll
throw you out in the street,

904
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,641
and every door you knock on
will be slammed in your face.

905
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,765
Do you understand?

906
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,521
Aye.

907
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,041
Good.

908
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,999
It's gonna be a grand
fight, Mr. Bourke.

909
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,521
Good, that's what I like to hear.

910
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,486
Shannon?

911
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,689
I'm drunk, Joseph.

912
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,799
How can you be drunk?
You just left my sight.

913
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,844
She's working her way
through a jigger of rye.

914
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:55,239
When I finish it, I may or
may not have another one.

915
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,279
Well, Shannon, you came
to America to be modern.

916
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,562
I'm glad everything's working out.

917
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,039
You have changed, Mr. Donnelly.

918
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,083
Improved, you mean.

919
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,879
Nope. Changed.

920
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,128
Look at all those silly hats.

921
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,559
You'll never get to Oklahoma.
You've spent all your money.

922
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,679
At the rate I'm going,
they'll bring the land to me.

923
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,928
You have turned into a snob.

924
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,641
Joseph?

925
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:34,725
Joseph!

926
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,647
Excuse me, drunkard.

927
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,359
Hello, Grace.

928
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:50,963
Hello, Joseph, will I be seeing
you in church tomorrow morn?

929
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,766
Sounds divine and holy, Grace.

930
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,799
We can share a pew, me and you.

931
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,206
Toodle-oo.

932
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,006
Same to you.

933
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:05,799
She's got an awfully large
chest to be going to church.

934
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:09,800
Shannon, all chests are equal
in the eyes of the Lord.

935
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,599
She goes into the confession box,

936
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,723
she'll never come out,
the little tramp.

937
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,245
Grace isn't a tramp. She's
a dancer in the burleycue.

938
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,329
That isn't dancing. That's
kicking her knickers up.

939
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:26,968
I suspect if you asked her to,
she'd kick her knickers off.

940
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,284
Maybe she would.

941
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,119
Has she?

942
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,129
Let me see.
Has she?

943
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,005
I'm trying to remember.

944
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:40,001
Think hard. If there's any
brain left in your head.

945
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:43,841
Look at you. They're making a fool of
you, the ward boss and his friends.

946
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:45,959
They respect me.

947
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,288
They do not.
They don't respect you.

948
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,519
Enough.

949
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,959
You're money in their pockets
and nothing more, Joseph.

950
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,479
I said that's enough, Shannon.

951
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,479
You let them pickle you
like a piece of pork.

952
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,279
They're just using you.

953
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,999
I said, that's enough out of you.

954
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,648
No, put me down!

955
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,479
No! No!

956
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,209
Tell me.
Tell me you like my hat.

957
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,119
You're not wearing a hat.

958
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:15,679
Say it. Say you like my hat.

959
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,159
You're not wearing a hat.

960
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,521
Say it.

961
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,039
Why can't you say it, Shannon?

962
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,719
Why can't you say you like my hat?

963
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,490
Why can't you say you like my suit?

964
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,885
I've earned this.

965
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,405
I've done well.

966
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,969
Don't touch me, Joseph.

967
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,039
Why don't you go fondle that
slut with the runaway tits,

968
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,083
if she isn't stuffing
her face with pie.

969
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,879
You're jealous of me. I made more
money than you and you're jealous.

970
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,926
I can make money as fast as you can.
You just watch me, scrapper.

971
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:11,451
Shannon?
Shannon!

972
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,041
Shannon!

973
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,810
Why don't you shag her
and get it over with?

974
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:25,205
She's my sister.

975
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,319
And I'm your mother.

976
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:34,919
Joseph!

977
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,679
Every time your gentleman leaves,

978
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,319
I want you to tidy your room,
do you hear me?

979
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,519
Molly?

980
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,599
I don't want to
have to say that again.

981
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,719
Joseph, Mike Kelly's
looking for you.

982
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:42,919
Molly, where's Shannon?

983
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,719
Tonight's the fight, the big fight.

984
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,039
She didn't come home
from work today.

985
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,399
The club is crawling with eyeties.

986
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,639
Molly, have you seen her?

987
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,919
No, I have not.

988
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,279
She's there.
Shannon is there.

989
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,641
Where?

990
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,046
Joseph,
show them how it's done, lad.

991
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,529
Joseph, for Ireland!

992
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,808
Shannon, stop this.

993
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,799
Where's your dignity, woman?

994
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,604
You mind your business, Joseph.

995
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,279
You get your brains smashed in
every night. What's the difference?

996
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,119
There's a world of difference!

997
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,879
Come on, Donnelly, these eyeties
are tearing the place apart.

998
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:23,959
Forget it!

999
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,639
Get in there and box. I've
got $100 bet on you tonight.

1000
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,039
Kiss it goodbye, Mr. Bourke.

1001
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,519
I'll make it $200, and I'll
split the winnings with you.

1002
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,324
$200,Joseph!

1003
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:32,799
What?

1004
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,319
Did you not hear me? I said I'll
split the winnings with you!

1005
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,851
No.
Joseph.

1006
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,600
Donnelly!

1007
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,639
Take it.

1008
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,759
Take it?

1009
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,479
I thought you
didn't want me to fight.

1010
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,364
But it's so much money.

1011
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:51,371
You boxed for nickels before.
This is a fortune.

1012
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,485
Joseph! Joseph!

1013
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,569
I'll match that offer.

1014
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,679
Don't let your stubborn
pride get in the way.

1015
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,679
You'll have it.
You'll have Oklahoma!

1016
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,319
You'll never have to
fight for them again.

1017
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,439
This'll get us out of here.

1018
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,721
Us?

1019
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,291
Well, you.

1020
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:36,885
I mean you.

1021
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,489
Come on, let's show them.

1022
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,359
Joseph, damage the dago.
You hear me?

1023
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,086
Keep back, will you?
Get back, come on.

1024
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,405
Come on, lad.

1025
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:26,119
This is a fight to the finish,
gentlemen. A fight to the finish.

1026
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:29,085
Side betting's allowed and a
knockdown terminates a round.

1027
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,642
Come to scratch, gentlemen.

1028
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,689
Come on, scrapper!
Keep your left up.

1029
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,249
Yes! Go!

1030
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,641
Joseph!

1031
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,169
Kelly, I smell victory.

1032
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,809
I'd enjoy it even more
with a little strawberry tart.

1033
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,447
Mr. Bourke would like some company.

1034
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,199
I'm not especially
attracted to Mr. Bourke.

1035
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,244
You came to me for help.
Let's show some manners.

1036
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,370
Come to scratch!
Come to scratch!

1037
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,483
What the hell's he doing, Kelly?

1038
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,279
Get your hands off her.

1039
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,679
There's too much
money at stake here.

1040
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:48,959
Filthy pig.

1041
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,479
Joseph! No!

1042
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:53,763
Get back to scratch!
You wanna forfeit?

1043
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,239
Shannon?

1044
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,559
Put him down!

1045
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,279
Shannon!
Joseph!

1046
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:00,879
You're losing me money, you coward!

1047
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,129
Get back in there and fight.
You're gonna forfeit.

1048
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,451
Move over.

1049
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,959
Go on, Joe, get up, Joe.

1050
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,808
Joseph!

1051
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,679
No.

1052
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:04,120
Get up, Joseph.
Get up.

1053
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:08,039
Come on, get up. Get up!

1054
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,925
I bet more money than you've got.
Get up!

1055
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,010
Get up!
He's out.

1056
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,239
Joseph.
My God, I'm sorry.

1057
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:43,364
You, get off. Shut your mouth.

1058
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,207
Get this loser out of my club.

1059
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:55,371
Did you tell them we're in
Jefferson Court? Number 6 Jefferson Court.

1060
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,119
Make sure they hear you.

1061
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:58,279
In the south end.

1062
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:01,563
Her family has come from Ireland.
They're here in Boston.

1063
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,963
They're offering a reward.

1064
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,922
Have you seen a girl like that?

1065
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,599
Find her.
Do your job.

1066
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,599
Must I do everything for you?

1067
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,319
We found her, and here
she is right over here.

1068
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,399
We'll never get anything out of
these people. They're drunks.

1069
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,809
If you see the girl, her
family is in Jefferson Court.

1070
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,322
Number 6 Jefferson Court.

1071
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,761
Joseph, what happened to you?

1072
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:01,526
Shannon?

1073
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,241
Shannon.

1074
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,769
Do come in, scrapper.

1075
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,886
That's our money.
We earned it.

1076
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,170
There isn't a penny here
doesn't originate with me.

1077
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,725
Get him out.

1078
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,245
Don't touch her.

1079
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,359
You're done, scrapper.

1080
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:36,439
You won't work here,
box here, nothing here.

1081
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:39,086
You coppers, beat it.
Get him up.

1082
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:44,243
Too bad, but I saw it coming the first
time you walked in off the boat.

1083
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,489
No. Leave him.

1084
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:51,445
No!

1085
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,731
Leave...

1086
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:58,926
Molly Kay, these two are banished.

1087
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:03,281
You shelter them even a night,
I'll shut this whorehouse down.

1088
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,081
Come on.

1089
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,329
It's too cold, Joseph.

1090
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,719
Hey!
Do you need help, sir?

1091
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,359
Get out of here.

1092
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,679
We haven't eaten for three days.
I'll work for food.

1093
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,247
I don't hire Irish.

1094
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,959
For the love of God, we
haven't eaten for three days.

1095
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:35,164
I said I don't hire Irish.
Now, get out of here.

1096
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:53,887
Joseph, we can't keep
wandering like this.

1097
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,646
I know.

1098
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:01,565
It's been so long, too many days.

1099
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,089
We can't keep doing this.

1100
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,288
I think this house is empty.

1101
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,081
Look.

1102
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:32,201
A tree.

1103
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,161
Food.

1104
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,170
There's food here.

1105
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,849
Joseph, look at us.

1106
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:15,204
I never thought it
would turn out like this.

1107
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,481
Coming all this way for land.

1108
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:29,801
Shannon.

1109
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:33,920
Sit down.

1110
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,362
Sit down at this beautiful table.

1111
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:40,451
No, we can't. We're burglars.

1112
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,245
Please? Please.

1113
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,684
I want you to pretend.

1114
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,723
Sit down.
I'll serve you.

1115
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:53,049
Tonight, I want you to dine.

1116
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,602
No, Joseph, don't serve me.
Just sit down.

1117
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,964
Sit down with me.

1118
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,884
Let's pretend

1119
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,562
that this house is ours.

1120
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:41,250
That you are my husband
and I'm your wife.

1121
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,801
Sit down.

1122
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:03,881
Joseph, did you ever wonder what that
land you dreamed of looked like?

1123
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,441
Aye.

1124
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:14,041
Mine was a green pasture with tall
grass that rolled just a little bit.

1125
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,480
Mine had a stream
running through it.

1126
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,164
Perhaps some trees.

1127
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,528
Rich, dark soil.

1128
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,928
No rocks to pick out of the ground.

1129
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:30,048
A green pasture and a stream.

1130
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:33,127
They will complement
each other, no?

1131
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,160
They would.

1132
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:42,048
The one, in fact,
depends upon the other.

1133
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:45,566
Pretend

1134
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,451
you love me.

1135
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:51,689
I pretend I love you.

1136
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:57,366
I pretend I love you, too.

1137
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,483
What was that?
Who's there?

1138
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:50,048
Get the hell out of my house.

1139
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,601
No!

1140
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,679
Shannon.

1141
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,166
Police. Police!

1142
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,519
Get the police!

1143
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,601
Help!

1144
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:26,124
Help! This girl needs help.
Will you let us in?

1145
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,370
Is this the Christie's?

1146
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,279
Shannon.

1147
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,925
Just let us in.

1148
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,879
Quickly, fetch a doctor.
Yes, sir.

1149
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:00,289
Step aside. You'll infect
her with your filthy hands.

1150
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:04,163
What did you expect? That you
could climb to her station?

1151
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:06,841
A gunshot.

1152
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,205
God, look at her.

1153
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:18,999
Will she be all right?

1154
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,690
She will now.

1155
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:24,245
The wound is in the shoulder.
I have to clean it.

1156
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,680
Shannon, I...

1157
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,565
You're safe now.

1158
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,411
This house.

1159
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,449
You're gonna be fine.

1160
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:27,010
Take care of her.

1161
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,279
Mr. Christie, Mr. Christie,
here's the doctor.

1162
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:52,199
Something terrible has happened.

1163
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:53,359
What is it, Doctor?

1164
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:54,479
Your daughter, Mr. Christie.

1165
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,879
Shannon?
She's here?

1166
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:57,286
What's happened to her?

1167
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:34,999
She's all clear! Let's get
the mud cleaned out here.

1168
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,443
Hey, Mick, after you drop that tie
off, let's get after these rocks!

1169
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:42,289
Come on. Let's get some
goddamn work done here.

1170
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,365
Fill up that wheelbarrow!

1171
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:31,725
<i>Move it.</i>

1172
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,531
Fire in the hole.

1173
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:40,719
Come on, boys, find yourself some cover.
We got fire in the hole.

1174
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:43,526
Hey, you, fire in the hole!

1175
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:05,206
Joseph.

1176
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:11,879
Joseph.

1177
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:27,846
Water!

1178
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,249
Anybody need water?

1179
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:33,446
Water?

1180
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:41,570
Look at that. All them wagons
headed for the Oklahoma territory.

1181
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,959
I'd be going with them
if I was as young as you.

1182
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:46,810
Doesn't interest me.

1183
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,084
I had a woman once.

1184
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:10,639
But she don't want me
'cause I had no money.

1185
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:14,519
That's America. Unless you
are rich, you are nobody.

1186
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:17,326
I should never have
come to this place.

1187
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:22,809
Forget the women, boys. You got
a job of work ahead of you.

1188
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,367
<i>Da, is that you?</i>

1189
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:50,681
<i>Joseph!</i>

1190
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:54,730
<i>You look like you're not
doing too well, my boy.</i>

1191
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:57,045
<i>I missed you, Da.</i>

1192
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:03,171
<i>"A man is nothing
without land, " they say.</i>

1193
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:09,881
Land is a man's own soul.

1194
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:16,002
<i>I'll work my own land someday.</i>

1195
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:20,679
<i>If you manage it, by God,</i>

1196
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:25,568
your old da will be smiling down
on you from heaven above.

1197
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:33,839
Stay where you are, boys.
We're just stopping for water.

1198
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,247
Look, it's the pioneers.

1199
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:43,561
No, they go to Oklahoma,
I think, for the free land.

1200
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:50,326
They just wasting time. There
ain't enough land to go around.

1201
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:55,999
One in 100 will stake a claim.

1202
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,522
The rest of them,
they just dreaming.

1203
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,966
Think they gonna
get some free land.

1204
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,531
Hey, Irish!

1205
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:18,479
Mick, where do you
think you're going?

1206
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,603
I was on the wrong road.

1207
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:37,041
There now!
Coming through!

1208
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:43,719
Farmers, ranchers, homesteaders,

1209
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,759
this well driller is an example of

1210
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,719
modern American industry
at its finest.

1211
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:50,319
Come up and have a look.
It's not gonna bite you,

1212
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:51,519
it's just modern, that's all.

1213
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,119
You may find land tomorrow,

1214
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:56,529
but you won't survive in the
wilderness, not without water.

1215
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:09,049
Folks, each quarter
section is marked.

1216
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:14,203
You run for land, remove the marker
and drive in your own stake.

1217
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:17,566
The race begins tomorrow at noon.

1218
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,124
Again, each quarter
section is marked.

1219
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:25,289
Where can I get a horse?

1220
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:31,047
You're a little late, cowboy.
The pickings are slim.

1221
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:36,081
Now, this here horse is broke.

1222
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:39,770
That horse there, green broke.

1223
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:42,204
Know the difference?

1224
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:44,204
I think I can see it.

1225
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:48,924
A broke horse is
a dependable horse.

1226
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:53,169
A green broke horse, he's faster.

1227
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:57,446
That sounds good.
The faster the better.

1228
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,719
No telling what he'll do, though.

1229
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:01,479
Hell, you could end up in Canada

1230
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:03,364
on that green-broke son of a bitch.

1231
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:05,525
Stand back.

1232
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:14,127
I think I'll take
the dependable horse.

1233
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:16,080
I would.

1234
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,519
You go out there and get you

1235
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,239
a good piece of land
tomorrow, now, Joseph.

1236
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:21,044
Thank you, Ralph.

1237
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:53,651
I'm cursed.

1238
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:56,524
Oh, Lord, I'm cursed.

1239
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:10,119
Mother, the clothes
will never come clean

1240
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:12,243
if you don't get your hands wet.

1241
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:16,599
There's no order in
this godforsaken place.

1242
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:20,850
Here, take the soap
and you plunge and scrub.

1243
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:22,879
Plunge and scrub?

1244
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,206
Like so.

1245
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:29,441
Nora? Nora! Nora!

1246
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,799
I've been shot.

1247
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:33,161
Shot?

1248
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:36,719
Well, shot at anyway.

1249
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,251
By the cavalry.

1250
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:41,763
We crossed the starting line
and we broke the law.

1251
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:45,879
Daniel Christie, I will not
have you riding tomorrow

1252
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:48,287
in that vulgarity of a race!

1253
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,644
The Wild West suits me, Nora.

1254
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:53,726
There's no telling what I might do.

1255
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:59,011
Shannon!

1256
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:03,839
Shannon, I found it.

1257
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:07,279
Twenty miles straight west of here.
It's paradise itself.

1258
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:10,519
You will love it, Shannon. The
earth is dry and dusty here.

1259
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:13,319
But where we'll live,
there's a winding stream,

1260
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:17,491
and the grass on the gentle hills around
it grows high and rich and green.

1261
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:21,767
It's the plot of land
you've dreamed of.

1262
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:26,365
Excuse me, Stephen.

1263
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,969
Are you cross with me, Shannon?

1264
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:34,319
Of course I am. We were doing
this together, I thought.

1265
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:37,126
I couldn't take you with me today.
It was too dangerous.

1266
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:39,159
I don't mind a little
danger now and then.

1267
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:41,089
Shannon, stop this childishness.

1268
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:43,879
Are we not here,
your parents and I,

1269
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:46,399
amongst all these people
because you wanted this?

1270
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:49,809
Tomorrow we'll ride as one,
together, side by side.

1271
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:54,085
We'll claim our land and then we'll
marry and finally settle down.

1272
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:02,531
You do want to settle down,
don't you, Shannon?

1273
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:05,761
Yes.

1274
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:08,882
Yes, I want to settle down.

1275
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:14,130
There now.
That's better.

1276
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,449
I hate to see you angry.

1277
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:23,562
It isn't your nature to be so.

1278
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,690
Hello, Shannon.

1279
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:53,167
I wondered if I'd see you here.

1280
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:55,844
I suspected that I might.

1281
01:51:56,640 --> 01:52:00,447
Not I. I saw you living back
in Boston all this while.

1282
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:09,687
You look well.
You look well.

1283
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,644
I'm here with my family.

1284
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,691
We came by train.

1285
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:18,290
I came by train myself.

1286
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:22,999
You'll be running in the
race tomorrow, I presume.

1287
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,521
I always said I'd get my land.

1288
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:29,171
I even bought a horse,
a fine horse.

1289
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:44,401
Well.

1290
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:50,049
Time takes care of everything,
doesn't it, Joseph?

1291
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:55,647
Everything's worked out
as it should have,

1292
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,686
don't you agree?

1293
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:05,446
Yeah.

1294
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,439
Good luck tomorrow, Joseph.

1295
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:11,721
Aye.

1296
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:15,528
Best of luck to you, Shannon.

1297
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:35,090
Shannon Christie?

1298
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:39,604
You never gave up.

1299
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:44,051
You knew what you
wanted back in Ireland.

1300
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:46,886
And look at you.
Here you are.

1301
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:55,248
You're a corker, Shannon.

1302
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,089
What a corker you are.

1303
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:29,641
Beautiful country, isn't it, boy?

1304
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:33,809
I found the perfect piece
of land for Shannon and me,

1305
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:38,086
almost the picture of what she
described. The land of her dreams.

1306
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:41,365
Congratulations.

1307
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,801
Just what the hell
are you doing here?

1308
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:49,679
You bring her to me bleeding, and
now you think you can talk to her?

1309
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:52,008
Stay away from her, do you hear me?

1310
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:56,799
There'll be a lot of confusion
in the race tomorrow, lad.

1311
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:58,684
Someone could get shot.

1312
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:32,250
<i>Her beautiful eyes</i>

1313
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:36,159
<i>Were a terrible curse</i>

1314
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:39,569
<i>Three days in his grave</i>

1315
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:43,129
<i>She ran off with his purse</i>

1316
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,880
They've got their land
all picked out,

1317
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,679
the pair of them.
The land of her dreams.

1318
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:55,681
All those months I was
trying to forget about her.

1319
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:01,569
I was laying down the very
track that brought her here.

1320
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:11,689
And to hell with everyone.
I'm gonna get my land.

1321
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,247
That's my thought for the night.

1322
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:17,889
Tomorrow I ride for me, me alone.

1323
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:21,771
And my horse.

1324
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,960
Sweet Mary Jesus

1325
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:44,886
and all the saints preserve us.

1326
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:50,647
That there was the oldest
horse lever saw in my life.

1327
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:51,999
It's almost noon. We're
gonna miss the photograph.

1328
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,964
All right.
You ready?

1329
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,168
Stay with him, Joseph!

1330
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:12,289
I sold him that horse.

1331
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:14,801
Don't let him bluff you, cowboy!

1332
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:25,728
We're breaking the law, Nora.

1333
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,679
I don't like you taking charge of
the business side of our life.

1334
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:31,167
You do, too.
Now listen up.

1335
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:34,559
This stake goes into
the ground over there.

1336
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,599
That's your job.
I'll tell you when.

1337
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:39,359
I, meanwhile, will run the
horse around in circles.

1338
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:42,999
He's got to look all sweaty and
tired, even dead would be good.

1339
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,043
Got it?
Yes.

1340
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:48,728
But we don't
really need all of this.

1341
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:52,039
It's scary out here, Daniel.

1342
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:53,685
We'll do fine.

1343
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:57,009
Pretend we're starting out in
life instead of ending up.

1344
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:20,367
You want to buy
a good pair of spurs?

1345
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:24,566
Sorry.

1346
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:30,928
The race is that way, lad.

1347
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:48,639
Forget the horse, lad,
and find yourself a donkey.

1348
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:55,205
Joseph?

1349
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:59,164
Take him by the bit.

1350
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:02,161
Shannon?

1351
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:39,326
Hey, where the hell are you going?

1352
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:41,646
Shoot him!

1353
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,009
Fire!

1354
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:54,405
That way!

1355
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:05,207
I've no wish to fight you.

1356
02:03:57,880 --> 02:03:59,366
Go! Go!

1357
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:41,366
Lord, protect us.
Daniel, here they come.

1358
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:47,639
Stand by, partner, and pretend
you're out of breath.

1359
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:51,208
Pretend? My heart's
up here in my nose!

1360
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:57,199
Oh, my God, Nora!
This is thrilling.

1361
02:04:57,200 --> 02:05:01,007
Nora? Now, Nora! Now!

1362
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:21,371
There it is.

1363
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:25,209
Come on.
Come on.

1364
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,601
Come on, Shannon. Hurry.

1365
02:06:57,160 --> 02:06:59,249
Come on!
Come on!

1366
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:09,807
Stephen! Stephen!

1367
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:14,370
Shannon, getup.
Grab the reins.

1368
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:25,169
Are you all right, Shannon?

1369
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:27,250
Are you all right?

1370
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:33,045
Go, Joseph. Go!

1371
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:38,399
Ride.

1372
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:40,443
Go get your land.

1373
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:11,451
You're not in Ireland anymore,
you arrogant bastard!

1374
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:17,324
Damn it, Shannon. Do you
want your land or don't you?

1375
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:41,850
This land is mine.

1376
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:44,763
Mine by destiny.

1377
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,479
Go ahead, Joseph!
Claim it!

1378
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:17,011
Shannon!

1379
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:18,519
Claim it?

1380
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:19,767
Stephen!

1381
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:22,249
Look out, Joseph!

1382
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:37,289
No! Joseph!

1383
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:39,808
Oh, my God! Joseph!

1384
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,719
Joseph!
Shannon?

1385
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:44,679
Joseph.
Don't touch him.

1386
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:46,519
Get away, Stephen.
Shannon, listen to me.

1387
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,085
Get away, Stephen.
Shannon...

1388
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:50,041
Leave!

1389
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:54,442
Joseph? Joseph.

1390
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:58,882
Joseph, look at me.
Look at me.

1391
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,567
No, don't move.
Stay still.

1392
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,121
Shannon.

1393
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:08,765
Don't do this.

1394
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,519
You've made your choice.

1395
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:17,768
Joseph, look at me.

1396
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:22,481
Look at me.
Look at me.

1397
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:25,039
Joseph, look at me.

1398
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:27,079
I feel myself dying.

1399
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:30,079
No. No, you stay looking at my eyes.
Look at my eyes, Joseph.

1400
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:31,199
Shannon?

1401
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:32,239
No, you're not dying.

1402
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:35,046
Look!
You've got your land.

1403
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:39,121
But all the land in the world
means nothing to me without you.

1404
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:40,961
Joseph...

1405
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:47,687
I tried to prove myself to you,

1406
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:52,926
but I know nothing
of books or alphabets

1407
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:56,729
or sun or moon or...

1408
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:00,091
All I know

1409
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:03,490
is Joseph loves Shannon.

1410
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:13,402
That's all that matters to me.

1411
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:22,799
Hey, Shannon.

1412
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:24,639
Joseph, Joseph, no.

1413
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:26,679
Shannon.

1414
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:28,848
No, no, stay with me.
Stay.

1415
02:11:29,120 --> 02:11:30,765
Joseph, no!

1416
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:34,690
No. Joseph, look at me. Joseph!

1417
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:39,160
Joseph, please.
Please don't leave me.

1418
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:41,728
Please don't leave me alone.

1419
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,646
Joseph, Joseph, no!

1420
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:52,043
Joseph! Joseph, no!

1421
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:54,879
No!

1422
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:56,241
Please.

1423
02:11:58,280 --> 02:12:01,051
No. Please come back, please.

1424
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:03,368
Don't leave me.

1425
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:11,762
This is our dream together.

1426
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:15,041
I don't want this without you.

1427
02:12:23,960 --> 02:12:25,571
I loved you.

1428
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:30,567
I loved you from the
first time I saw you.

1429
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:44,961
I often wondered about that.

1430
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:49,327
How? Joseph.

1431
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:53,559
You died.
You died!

1432
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,201
Aye.

1433
02:12:59,200 --> 02:13:03,086
You can be sure
I won't be dying twice.
