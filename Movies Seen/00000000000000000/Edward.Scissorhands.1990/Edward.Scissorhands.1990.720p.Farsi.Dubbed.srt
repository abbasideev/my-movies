1
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:06,369
Snuggle in, sweetie! It's cold out there.

2
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:14,586
Why is it snowing, Grandma?
Where does it come from?

3
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,589
Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.

4
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:21,759
- I wanna hear.
- Not tonight. Go to sleep.

5
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,763
I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please.

6
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:28,349
Well, all right.

7
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:31,519
Let's see...

8
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:35,857
I guess it would have to start with scissors!

9
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,026
Scissors?

10
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:41,780
Well, there are all kinds of scissors.

11
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:47,660
And once there was even a man
who had scissors for hands.

12
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,704
- A man?
- Yes.

13
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:53,541
- Hands scissors?
- No, scissor hands.

14
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:59,380
You know the mansion
on top of the mountain?

15
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,591
It's haunted.

16
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,760
Well...

17
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:06,471
A long time ago

18
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:10,642
an inventor lived in that mansion.

19
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,938
He made many things, I suppose.

20
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:23,071
<i>He also created a man.</i>

21
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:30,745
<i>He gave him insides,</i>
<i>a heart, a brain, everything.</i>

22
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:33,998
<i>Well, almost everything.</i>

23
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:40,296
<i>You see, the inventor was very old.</i>

24
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,883
<i>He died before he got to finish</i>
<i>the man he invented.</i>

25
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:48,138
<i>So the man was left by himself,</i>

26
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:52,308
<i>incomplete and all alone.</i>

27
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:56,020
<i>He didn't have a name?</i>

28
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,815
<i>Of course he had a name.</i>

29
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:01,693
<i>His name was Edward.</i>

30
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:50,116
Avon calling!

31
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,536
- Weren't you just here?
- No, not since last season!

32
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:59,042
Today I've come to show you our exquisite
new line of softer colours, in shadows,

33
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,877
blushes and lipstick.

34
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,672
Everything you need to accent and highlight
your changing look.

35
00:06:04,756 --> 00:06:08,092
My changing look. That's good!

36
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:11,679
I also have a complete selection
of your old favourites,

37
00:06:11,763 --> 00:06:16,184
those tried and true products we've all
come to depend on year in and year out.

38
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,853
Come on, Peg,
I never buy anything from you.

39
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:21,064
I know. Bye, Helen.

40
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:26,319
You didn't have to call me, ma'am.
You could have taken care of this by yourself.

41
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:28,488
I could? I don't think so.

42
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:31,366
It's easy. Your food trap's clogged, that's all.

43
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,910
See this bolt here? You just unscrew this...

44
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:37,455
And out she pops.

45
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:40,083
On TV they say you repairmen
are a lonely bunch.

46
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:44,921
Housewives get lonely too, though you may
not realise it since they haven't made an ad.

47
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:50,927
And then you just take this and put it back in
here nice and easy. Be careful not to force it.

48
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,263
And then you just screw this back on.

49
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:57,016
Now who could that be?

50
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,185
Will you excuse me for a moment?

51
00:06:59,894 --> 00:07:04,023
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
This is fascinatin'!

52
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:06,526
I wouldn't wanna miss a moment of it!

53
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,409
- Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling!
- Why, Peg...

54
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:17,704
Have you gone blind?
Can't you see that vehicle in my drive?

55
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:24,043
- Yes.
- Don't you realise that means I'm busy?

56
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:28,339
OK, now we should decide on lipsticks.

57
00:07:28,423 --> 00:07:33,094
OK, dear, did you like the Winsome Wahini,
which looked charming on you,

58
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:35,597
or the Bahimini Bliss?

59
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,766
- I like 'em both.
- Well, great!

60
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,020
You don't actually think
I have any money, do you?

61
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:57,702
Ding-dong! The Avon lady!

62
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,624
Just not my day.

63
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:01,576
Oh, my goodness!

64
00:10:20,762 --> 00:10:23,264
Oh, it's so beautiful!

65
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,163
Hello?

66
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:16,067
Hello?

67
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,369
Hello? Avon calling!

68
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:03,698
Oh, my!

69
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:08,328
Hello?

70
00:12:12,874 --> 00:12:18,338
I'm Peg Boggs.
I'm your local Avon representative.

71
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:34,771
I'm sorry to barge in like this,
but you don't have any reason to be afraid.

72
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,982
This is some huge house, isn't it?

73
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:41,820
Thank goodness
for those aerobics classes.

74
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,252
Hello?

75
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:42,630
Why are you hiding back there?

76
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:49,345
You don't have to hide from me.
I'm Peg Boggs.

77
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,848
I'm your local Avon representative,

78
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,018
and I'm as harmless as cherry pie...

79
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,436
Oh, my!

80
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,063
I can see that I've disturbed you.

81
00:13:59,147 --> 00:14:01,357
How stupid of me. I'll just be going now.

82
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,526
Don't go.

83
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:11,910
Oh, my!

84
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:14,913
What happened to you?

85
00:14:14,996 --> 00:14:17,040
I'm not finished.

86
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,751
Put those down.
Don't come any closer. Please...

87
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:29,594
Those are your hands?

88
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,062
What happened to you?

89
00:14:41,523 --> 00:14:43,608
Where are your parents?

90
00:14:44,526 --> 00:14:46,611
Your mother?

91
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,948
Your father?

92
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:52,242
He didn't wake up.

93
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,750
Are you alone?
Do you live up here all by yourself?

94
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:07,006
What happened to your face?

95
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:13,138
I won't hurt you.

96
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,976
At the very least,
let me give you a good astringent.

97
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:20,478
This will help to prevent infection.

98
00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:34,033
What's your name?

99
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,453
Edward.

100
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,544
I think you should just come home with me.

101
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,978
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

102
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,357
You go ahead and look.
You have every reason to be excited.

103
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:13,782
You OK?

104
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,689
Hello?

105
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,399
Hi. It's Marge.

106
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:53,404
I was standing outside talking to Carol, and
Peg drove by. She had somebody with her.

107
00:16:53,488 --> 00:16:56,241
- Did you get a good look at him?
- No, I didn't.

108
00:16:56,324 --> 00:16:58,952
Did she say anything to you
about having a guest?

109
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:02,372
Nothing at all.
She rang my doorbell at the crack of dawn.

110
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:05,416
No... OK, I'll meet you on the corner.

111
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,585
Right. Bye.

112
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:13,383
Damn!

113
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,273
Here we go, dear. This is our house.

114
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:31,985
You can just go right in
and make yourself right at home, OK?

115
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:35,405
We'll have something to eat or drink, or...

116
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:40,368
Here, dear. Here we go. This is the front door.
Right in here.

117
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:44,747
Joyce? I just saw this strange guy
drive in with Peg. I didn't get a good look.

118
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,666
He looked kinda pale.

119
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:49,043
On my way. Don't do anything without me.

120
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:51,212
Yes! Be right there!

121
00:17:57,093 --> 00:17:59,179
Here we are.

122
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:22,368
So... this is the living room
and back here are the bedrooms.

123
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:24,996
You want to see the pictures? All right.

124
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:30,543
This is my husband Bill.
He's a bowling champion.

125
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:32,962
Do you know what bowling is?

126
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,881
Bowling?

127
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:37,884
No. Well... Here they are
down at the lake, fishing.

128
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:43,098
I think Kevin looks a little glum
because they didn't catch anything that day.

129
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:47,644
And here's my daughter Kim.

130
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:50,355
All dressed for the junior prom.

131
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:01,324
She's a senior now, if you can believe it!

132
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,953
She's camping in the mountains
with friends,

133
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:07,956
but she'll be back in a few days.
You can meet then.

134
00:19:17,382 --> 00:19:19,467
Isn't she beautiful?

135
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:29,394
That's my family.

136
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:32,981
Come along.
I'll show you the rest of the house.

137
00:19:33,064 --> 00:19:35,900
Then you can just freshen up
and make yourself at home.

138
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:39,904
That's the kitchen over there.
Help yourself to anything you want.

139
00:19:39,988 --> 00:19:43,491
Those are grapes.
And back here are the bedrooms.

140
00:19:43,575 --> 00:19:47,454
Let me get you some towels
and I'll see what we can find for you to wear.

141
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:52,667
You know what? I think I have some of
Bill's old clothes in here. This is perfect!

142
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:55,670
Here. These should just fit you.

143
00:19:57,046 --> 00:19:59,382
Don't be alarmed. That's just the phone.

144
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:03,928
Now you can go in Kim's room
and put these on, and I'll be right with you.

145
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:52,787
No, no, scissors!

146
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:56,958
That's right. Well, he was
born up there or... something.

147
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:01,045
- <i>Have you seen him before?</i>
- No, I doubt he's ever been off the grounds.

148
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:03,923
<i>Then how did you ever get together with him?</i>

149
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:08,136
Listen, I have to go now.
I'll talk to you later, Marge. Bye-bye.

150
00:22:18,146 --> 00:22:20,231
Sorry, Edward, I didn't...

151
00:22:21,232 --> 00:22:23,151
May I help you with this?

152
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:25,320
Thank you.

153
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:31,576
There you go. Oh dear, you've cut your face.

154
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:33,620
Let me just get this right off.

155
00:22:33,703 --> 00:22:35,705
- Does that hurt?
- No.

156
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:38,208
Good. OK. Now, let's get you dressed.

157
00:22:42,086 --> 00:22:45,215
There we go. Very fine!

158
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:51,846
You look fine!

159
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,771
Helen, come on! She wouldn't wait for you.

160
00:23:00,688 --> 00:23:02,774
I've got rollers in my damn hair!

161
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:26,089
Now, what did I do with my sciss...?

162
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:29,634
Edward, would you?

163
00:23:31,302 --> 00:23:32,929
Thank you.

164
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:37,100
You know, I have a doctor friend
who I think could help you.

165
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,686
- Really?
- Yes.

166
00:23:40,645 --> 00:23:42,730
Now, I can help with the scars...

167
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:50,405
But I just wanna consult the big
Avon handbook before doing anything.

168
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:36,951
Kevin!

169
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:43,374
It's not polite to stare, dear.

170
00:24:46,127 --> 00:24:50,256
Think how it would make you feel
if somebody were staring at you.

171
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:54,511
- I wouldn't care.
- Well, I would, so don't do it!

172
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:58,139
This must be quite a change
for you, right, Ed?

173
00:24:58,223 --> 00:25:01,643
- Edward, dear. I think he prefers Edward.
- Sure.

174
00:25:02,393 --> 00:25:07,065
So what have you been doin' with yourself
up there in that big old place?

175
00:25:07,148 --> 00:25:10,902
- I bet the view must be spectacular, huh, Ed?
- Edward!

176
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:12,612
Yes?

177
00:25:13,988 --> 00:25:16,282
No, I just...

178
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:19,202
See all the way to the ocean, I bet.

179
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:21,121
Sometimes.

180
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:25,750
Bill, could I have the salt and pepper, please?

181
00:25:27,418 --> 00:25:31,714
Bill, dear, could I have
the salt and pepper, please? Thank you.

182
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,402
Man, those things are cool!

183
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:56,448
I bet they're razor-sharp.
One karate chop to a guy's neck...

184
00:25:56,531 --> 00:25:57,991
Kevin...!

185
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:02,954
Edward,

186
00:26:03,455 --> 00:26:06,332
would you like some butter for your bread?

187
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,589
Great!

188
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:15,091
Thank you.

189
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,180
Hey, can I bring him to
show and tell on Monday?

190
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:22,307
Kevin, I've had enough.

191
00:26:27,103 --> 00:26:29,147
Do you think you can sleep?

192
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,650
I know things feel strange,
but soon you'll feel right at home.

193
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:35,612
Good night.

194
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:39,884
The light concealing cream goes on first,

195
00:27:40,385 --> 00:27:42,637
then you blend and blend and blend.

196
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,681
Blending is the secret.

197
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,310
More concealing cream...

198
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:52,021
Your complexion is so fair!

199
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:54,649
Now, this has a touch of lavender in it.

200
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:57,444
Give it a try here.

201
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:59,821
Close enough!

202
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:02,407
OK, this should do the trick here.

203
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,665
I have another idea.

204
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:15,879
We'll cover up the scars
and start with a completely smooth surface.

205
00:28:29,726 --> 00:28:31,811
Darn this stuff!

206
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:45,366
<i>They still have 11 on the scoreboard,</i>
<i>and it's three to one.</i>

207
00:28:47,869 --> 00:28:49,662
<i>It's through the gap to Warren.</i>

208
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:55,710
<i>Now they change it to 12 hits.</i>

209
00:28:55,794 --> 00:28:57,962
Turn it up, Kevin, I can't hear it!

210
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,550
Kevin!

211
00:29:04,636 --> 00:29:07,388
- <i>It's hammered!</i>
- Did you hear that, Mr Boggs?

212
00:29:07,472 --> 00:29:09,849
- No, make it louder!
- <i>It's gone,</i>

213
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:12,018
<i>it's out of here, it's history!</i>

214
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,983
Dad...

215
00:29:19,067 --> 00:29:20,777
Look!

216
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,155
<i>... to make it a five-run inning</i>
<i>and blow this game to pieces!</i>

217
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:26,074
I'll be darned.

218
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:44,050
They filled the whole tape!

219
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:47,220
<i>What's going on over there, Peg? Call me.</i>

220
00:29:47,303 --> 00:29:50,432
<i>Hi, it's Marge. Who is he? Call me.</i>

221
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:54,936
<i>Oh, by the way, I hear it's pouring rain in</i>
<i>the mountains. Do you think the kids are OK?</i>

222
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:59,899
<i>Hey there, darlin'! The gals are all in a tizzy</i>
<i>about your secret visitor.</i>

223
00:29:59,983 --> 00:30:02,527
<i>You can't keep him a secret for ever!</i>

224
00:30:16,624 --> 00:30:21,880
Well, it's just wonderful, Ed. My God,
you have the whole family in there, don't ya?

225
00:30:21,963 --> 00:30:26,050
<i>And he answers the challenge at first</i>
<i>with a strike of his own.</i>

226
00:30:27,469 --> 00:30:29,554
Edward, come here.

227
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:39,731
No, that's a terrible idea, son!

228
00:30:39,814 --> 00:30:43,693
Go to the garage and get the oil can.
We don't want him rusting up on us.

229
00:30:51,242 --> 00:30:53,578
Edward, you did us!

230
00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:56,581
- Oh, Bill, it's us!
- Yes, it is.

231
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:04,631
It's not heaven he's from,
it's straight from the stinking flames of hell.

232
00:31:04,714 --> 00:31:07,258
The power of Satan is in him, I can feel it.

233
00:31:07,342 --> 00:31:10,804
- Can't you? Have you sheep strayed so far?
- We're not sheep.

234
00:31:10,887 --> 00:31:12,972
Don't come near me.

235
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,687
That's right. Go on, get outta here, run!

236
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:22,148
Edward, don't you listen to her!

237
00:31:22,232 --> 00:31:26,611
Don't worry about her, Edward.
She's just a little loony, that's all.

238
00:31:32,408 --> 00:31:33,868
Hi!

239
00:31:33,952 --> 00:31:36,871
You-all are hidin' in there like hermit crabs.

240
00:31:36,955 --> 00:31:38,790
Hi, Joyce.

241
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:41,960
Shame on you,
keepin' your unusual guest to yourself.

242
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:44,337
We think that's mighty selfish of you.

243
00:31:44,421 --> 00:31:46,089
Things have been hectic here.

244
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:49,259
That is so sweet of you
to wanna correct the situation.

245
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:51,219
What time <i>does</i> the barbecue begin?

246
00:31:51,302 --> 00:31:52,762
Barbecue?

247
00:31:52,846 --> 00:31:55,723
You intend to introduce
your guest to your friends,

248
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:57,892
- don't you?
- I'll bring coleslaw.

249
00:31:59,811 --> 00:32:02,272
And I will bring the ambrosia salad!

250
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:06,151
What time was it that you said?

251
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:08,319
- Bill!
- About five?

252
00:32:09,904 --> 00:32:12,240
He has been sent first to tempt you!

253
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:18,329
But it's not too late.
You must push him from you, expel him.

254
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:20,874
Trample down the perversion of nature.

255
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:24,711
Did you hear that?
He's a perversion of nature.

256
00:32:24,794 --> 00:32:26,796
Why, isn't that excitin'?

257
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:32,927
- Bye-bye.
- Thanks so much.

258
00:32:36,514 --> 00:32:38,600
Bill!

259
00:32:41,436 --> 00:32:45,273
You really can't have a picnic or a barbecue
without devilled eggs.

260
00:32:45,356 --> 00:32:48,568
They're just the best. They make a thing.

261
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:53,448
Oh, Edward, that's wonderful!
I didn't know you'd chopped the whole thing.

262
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,869
All right now, it's just a nick.

263
00:32:57,952 --> 00:33:00,663
There's no need to be nervous, dear.

264
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:06,252
Esmeralda won't be here. And the rest of
the neighbours, they're really very nice.

265
00:33:06,336 --> 00:33:09,714
There's no need to be nervous.
They're so eager to meet you!

266
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:11,633
You just have to be yourself.

267
00:33:11,716 --> 00:33:15,345
- Myself?
- That's right. Just your own sweet self.

268
00:35:41,741 --> 00:35:45,328
- Thanks, Edward.
- Hey! Play scissors, paper, stone with us.

269
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:47,622
Play scissors what?

270
00:35:47,705 --> 00:35:50,583
I got a doctor friend
might be able to help you.

271
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:55,547
- He did them just like that!
- That is incredible.

272
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,174
- Hi, Mike, how you doin'?
- Hello, Jack.

273
00:35:58,925 --> 00:36:00,677
Hey, kids!

274
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,973
Hi, George Monroe. That's a heck of
a handshake you got there, Ed.

275
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:08,101
Harry! I saw you
on the golf course last week...

276
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:14,315
Are you OK? Do you want something to eat?
Are you hungry?

277
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:17,402
Do you want a cracker?

278
00:36:17,485 --> 00:36:19,946
- He's different.
- Completely different.

279
00:36:20,029 --> 00:36:21,865
No kidding.

280
00:36:21,948 --> 00:36:24,033
- He's so...
- Mysterious.

281
00:36:25,577 --> 00:36:29,456
D'you imagine those hands are hot or cold?

282
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:32,292
And just think what a single snip could do.

283
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:34,169
Or undo.

284
00:36:36,087 --> 00:36:37,672
Eddie.

285
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:41,176
The guys and I want to invite you
to our card game Friday night.

286
00:36:41,259 --> 00:36:43,052
Would you like that?

287
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,221
Only thing is... you can't cut!

288
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:02,947
I have my own infirmity.
Never did me a bit of harm.

289
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:08,787
Took some shrapnel during the war,
and ever since then I can't feel a damn thing!

290
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:12,248
Don't you ever let anybody tell you
you have a handicap.

291
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:15,543
Who's handicapped? My goodness.

292
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:20,131
Don't be ridiculous!
You're not handicapped, you're...

293
00:37:20,215 --> 00:37:23,134
What do they call the... exceptional?

294
00:37:24,552 --> 00:37:29,724
My name's Joyce, and I noticed that you
have not tasted any of the ambrosia salad

295
00:37:29,808 --> 00:37:32,185
that I made especially for you.

296
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:35,105
Allow me.

297
00:37:43,071 --> 00:37:47,617
- You must try this. It's my mother's recipe.
- Doesn't this look gorgeous?

298
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:52,247
With a green thumb like yours,
I sure could use your help at my place.

299
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:55,333
I want a row of angels!

300
00:37:55,416 --> 00:38:00,964
I am so sorry, ladies, but he's promised to
come to my house first. Haven't you, Eddie?

301
00:38:01,047 --> 00:38:04,467
- I did?
- OK, everybody, grab your plates!

302
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:06,344
Soup's on!

303
00:38:08,471 --> 00:38:10,640
What?

304
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:13,226
It <i>is</i> shish kebab. It was a figure of speech.

305
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:15,770
You shouldn't take things so literally.

306
00:38:19,065 --> 00:38:23,736
<i>"Let us pretend we are in the drawing</i>
<i>room and the hostess is serving tea."</i>

307
00:38:25,572 --> 00:38:28,700
"Many numerous little questions
confront us."

308
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:34,706
"Should the man rise
when he accepts his cup of tea?"

309
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:39,669
"May lump sugar be taken with the fingers?"

310
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:41,004
No.

311
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:43,923
"Is it good form to accept a second cup?"

312
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:48,386
"Should the napkin be entirely unfolded,

313
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:51,723
or should the centre crease
be allowed to remain?"

314
00:38:51,806 --> 00:38:54,684
"It is so easy to commit
embarrassing blunders,

315
00:38:54,768 --> 00:38:58,396
but etiquette tells us
just what is expected of us

316
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,358
and guards us from all
humiliation and discomfort."

317
00:39:09,616 --> 00:39:11,951
Yes. Boring.

318
00:39:12,035 --> 00:39:14,120
Let us switch to...

319
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:17,165
To some poetry, hm?

320
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:24,130
"There was an old man from the Cape,"

321
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:26,758
"Who made himself garments of crepe."

322
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:28,968
"When asked: Will they tear?"

323
00:39:29,052 --> 00:39:31,179
"He replied: Here and there,"

324
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:33,765
"But they keep such a beautiful shape!"

325
00:39:35,975 --> 00:39:37,727
That's right.

326
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:40,188
Go ahead, smile. It's funny.

327
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,630
We're home.

328
00:40:05,713 --> 00:40:07,549
Shit.

329
00:40:07,632 --> 00:40:09,467
Everything's still sopping.

330
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:13,054
- I can hardly wait to take a shower.
- And to sleep in a bed.

331
00:40:13,138 --> 00:40:16,015
If my parents have the alarm set,
I'm screwed.

332
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:19,644
I told you to call them
and tell them we're coming back early.

333
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:22,313
- But did you?
- Nope, he'd rather complain.

334
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:24,566
How else am I supposed to get attention?

335
00:40:24,649 --> 00:40:28,695
- You didn't call your parents.
- They don't run things like a police state.

336
00:40:28,778 --> 00:40:31,406
Bye. Thanks for driving, Denny.

337
00:40:32,073 --> 00:40:33,199
Bye.

338
00:40:33,283 --> 00:40:35,410
- Don't forget your arm!
- Oh, yeah.

339
00:40:35,493 --> 00:40:37,579
Come on, Jim, let's go.

340
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:40,350
There's somebody in my room! Go look!

341
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:43,770
He's a murderer! He's got an axe!
He tried to kill me!

342
00:41:43,853 --> 00:41:46,147
Everything's OK.

343
00:41:46,231 --> 00:41:48,316
Go back to bed, Kevin.

344
00:41:53,196 --> 00:41:55,448
This way.

345
00:41:55,532 --> 00:42:00,120
Edward's come to live with us.
There is nothing to be upset about.

346
00:42:01,955 --> 00:42:04,749
We'll have you set up here in a minute.

347
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:08,169
We got a full queen-size bed here,
believe it or not.

348
00:42:09,754 --> 00:42:12,632
It's all made and everything. Good.

349
00:42:12,715 --> 00:42:14,426
There you go.

350
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:16,553
What's the matter? What's wrong?

351
00:42:16,636 --> 00:42:18,721
She get you nervous?

352
00:42:19,556 --> 00:42:22,725
You've been cloistered away
up in that castle too long.

353
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:27,856
You don't know about the wonderful world
of teenage girls. They're all crazy.

354
00:42:28,773 --> 00:42:32,444
- Here, this'll straighten you right out.
- What is it?

355
00:42:32,527 --> 00:42:34,612
Lemonade.

356
00:42:40,785 --> 00:42:42,579
I don't know what it is.

357
00:42:43,621 --> 00:42:45,707
They reach a certain age...

358
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:50,044
They develop these gland things,
their bodies swell up...

359
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:52,464
They go crazy.

360
00:42:55,592 --> 00:42:56,926
Glands?

361
00:42:58,011 --> 00:43:00,096
Yeah, glands.

362
00:43:00,722 --> 00:43:02,807
I try not to think about it.

363
00:43:20,658 --> 00:43:23,244
Good, isn't it?

364
00:43:23,787 --> 00:43:28,416
Now, you stay in Kevin's room tonight
and tomorrow we'll fix your room right up.

365
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,335
Why did you have to bring him here?

366
00:43:30,418 --> 00:43:33,797
I couldn't have left him all alone.
You'd have done the same.

367
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,757
Why does he have to stay <i>here?</i>

368
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,594
My goodness, Kim, I'm surprised at you.
He can't help the way he is.

369
00:43:39,677 --> 00:43:42,931
- Have a little sympathy.
- I do have sympathy.

370
00:43:43,014 --> 00:43:46,976
Then say a little greeting.
Come downstairs, shake the man's hand...

371
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,813
- Shake his hand?!
- Well, not literally.

372
00:43:49,896 --> 00:43:54,025
- Goodness, you scared him half to death!
- I scared <i>him</i> to death?

373
00:43:59,114 --> 00:44:04,786
Hi, Bill! I just wanted you two
to have a proper introduction.

374
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:07,038
Edward, this is our daughter Kim.

375
00:44:07,163 --> 00:44:10,583
Kim, this is Edward,
who's gonna live with us.

376
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:17,841
Hi.

377
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,773
Eddie!

378
00:44:33,857 --> 00:44:35,650
Thirsty?

379
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:41,156
Kisses! Hush up!

380
00:44:43,074 --> 00:44:45,285
Quiet now!

381
00:44:45,368 --> 00:44:51,040
Darlin', I can hardly hear myself think!
Momma's precious little baby girl...

382
00:44:54,878 --> 00:44:58,381
Wouldn't you like
a nice cool glass of lemonade?

383
00:44:59,048 --> 00:45:00,592
Lemonade?

384
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:13,104
One chop to a guy's neck, and it's all over.

385
00:45:15,064 --> 00:45:18,485
Sharpest things in the world.
They can hack through anything.

386
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,779
And...

387
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,673
They give me the creeps.

388
00:45:40,757 --> 00:45:43,802
You should see the clown
in Miss Peters' yard.

389
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:45,804
Kim!

390
00:45:46,846 --> 00:45:49,057
- Oh, no.
- That's him?

391
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,351
- He's calling you, Kimba.
- Stop it!

392
00:45:51,434 --> 00:45:54,145
Edward, you forgot your cookies.

393
00:45:56,731 --> 00:45:59,234
Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for ya!

394
00:45:59,317 --> 00:46:01,736
- Stop!
- Let's go.

395
00:46:08,243 --> 00:46:10,703
Bill, Edward had lunch at Jackie's today

396
00:46:10,787 --> 00:46:13,832
and she just had her kitchen
completely redone.

397
00:46:13,915 --> 00:46:17,168
- I'll be darned.
- New paint, new cabinets, new floors,

398
00:46:17,252 --> 00:46:21,131
- a new microwave, new silent dishwasher...
- Isn't that wonderful?

399
00:46:21,214 --> 00:46:24,551
Jim, didn't you just tell me
your mom had her kitchen done too?

400
00:46:24,634 --> 00:46:27,220
Yeah, my dad bought himself
a bunch of new toys.

401
00:46:27,303 --> 00:46:30,807
Big-screen TV, CD players,
VCR with four heads...

402
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:35,145
My goodness sake!
I wonder what it's like to be that rich.

403
00:46:35,895 --> 00:46:37,814
They keep things locked up.

404
00:46:37,897 --> 00:46:41,317
My father has his own room for his stuff
to make sure I can't use it.

405
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:43,319
He won't even help me buy an old car.

406
00:46:43,403 --> 00:46:48,575
He probably wants you to pay for it yourself.
It builds character. You'll appreciate it more.

407
00:46:48,658 --> 00:46:50,118
Dad...!

408
00:46:50,201 --> 00:46:55,039
Speaking of money... I understand you're
not charging for your gardening, Edward.

409
00:46:55,123 --> 00:46:58,084
Now, Bill... Marge made him cookies today.

410
00:46:58,168 --> 00:47:00,253
Sweetheart...

411
00:47:01,129 --> 00:47:04,466
You can't buy
the necessities of life with cookies.

412
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:08,303
You can't buy a car with cookies.
Am I right, Jim?

413
00:47:08,386 --> 00:47:10,513
That's true, sir, you can't.

414
00:47:12,015 --> 00:47:14,976
I can't eat that. He used his hands.

415
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:17,479
I don't think it's sanitary.

416
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:24,694
I'm sorry.

417
00:47:27,864 --> 00:47:30,742
Honey, you want me
to help you clean that up?

418
00:47:30,825 --> 00:47:32,744
No, that's OK.

419
00:47:33,453 --> 00:47:35,580
I'll be right back.

420
00:48:22,127 --> 00:48:27,132
Alexis? Oh, this can't possibly be my Alexis!

421
00:48:27,799 --> 00:48:31,970
She looks so beautiful! Look at you! Sweetie!

422
00:48:32,762 --> 00:48:34,848
She's gorgeous. Thank you!

423
00:48:36,724 --> 00:48:39,811
It won't be long.
She just has to decide on the style.

424
00:48:39,894 --> 00:48:41,980
And then it'll be fine.

425
00:48:53,324 --> 00:48:57,537
I was hopin' for somethin' big
and kinda bouffant. Kinda like mine?

426
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:02,542
Now don't you worry, Kisses, you're gonna
be just fine. You're gonna be so pretty.

427
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:04,335
Yes, you are.

428
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:23,938
Oh! Eddie, is there anything you can't do?

429
00:49:24,022 --> 00:49:28,026
You take my very breath away, I swear.
Look at this!

430
00:49:29,611 --> 00:49:31,488
Have you ever cut a woman's hair?

431
00:49:31,571 --> 00:49:33,364
Would you cut mine?

432
00:50:41,224 --> 00:50:45,353
That was the single most thrillin' experience
of my whole life.

433
00:51:50,335 --> 00:51:52,670
They're getting the head of the company!

434
00:51:52,754 --> 00:51:56,007
- I'm home!
- Hi, honey. We're in here.

435
00:51:56,091 --> 00:51:58,009
Hi.

436
00:51:58,093 --> 00:51:59,886
What did you do to your hair?

437
00:51:59,969 --> 00:52:02,055
Edward cut it. Isn't it wild?

438
00:52:03,681 --> 00:52:06,893
Hello? Oh, I can't believe
I'm talking to you in person.

439
00:52:06,976 --> 00:52:09,062
This is such an honour.

440
00:52:10,563 --> 00:52:13,066
Yes. He's right here.

441
00:52:13,149 --> 00:52:15,151
So then you know all about it.

442
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:18,571
Well, that's exactly
what I've been using.

443
00:52:19,864 --> 00:52:25,620
Well, I've had a little trouble getting it
the right consistency... well, just a little.

444
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:28,665
I'll try that.

445
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:33,670
Well, what imaginative suggestions.

446
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:38,633
I sure will. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

447
00:52:39,717 --> 00:52:41,970
No wonder she's the head of the company.

448
00:52:42,053 --> 00:52:45,682
You know, she started out as
a sales representative just like me.

449
00:52:45,765 --> 00:52:49,561
I've always wanted to talk to her,
but until now I never had a reason.

450
00:52:49,644 --> 00:52:51,729
Thanks, Edward.

451
00:52:52,647 --> 00:52:55,066
- She had some ideas?
- You bet she did.

452
00:53:09,497 --> 00:53:11,583
I'll get that.

453
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:55,210
Edward. We're here.

454
00:53:55,293 --> 00:53:57,629
Come on, let's get you sharpened up.

455
00:54:01,007 --> 00:54:03,635
- You got it?
- No. I can't believe this.

456
00:54:03,718 --> 00:54:05,595
This is such a drag.

457
00:54:06,721 --> 00:54:08,181
Hi!

458
00:54:11,643 --> 00:54:13,728
Bye.

459
00:54:15,063 --> 00:54:16,773
Do you have a key?

460
00:54:16,856 --> 00:54:18,066
No.

461
00:54:18,149 --> 00:54:22,362
- I could have sworn they were in my purse.
- Well, we're stranded.

462
00:54:26,658 --> 00:54:28,743
Wow! Thanks!

463
00:54:29,994 --> 00:54:34,332
Ed! What a guy! Good job.
You didn't break it or scratch it or anything.

464
00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:37,210
Be a pal and yell when Peg pulls in.

465
00:54:40,588 --> 00:54:44,175
Quite a story, yes?
Any questions for Edward?

466
00:54:44,259 --> 00:54:46,386
Yeah? Get away over.

467
00:54:46,469 --> 00:54:47,929
Stand right up.

468
00:54:48,012 --> 00:54:51,141
What's been the best part
of your new life here in town?

469
00:54:51,224 --> 00:54:53,476
The friends I've made.

470
00:54:55,395 --> 00:54:57,439
Any other questions?

471
00:54:58,273 --> 00:55:02,235
Have you ever thought of having
corrective surgery or prosthetics?

472
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:05,196
I know a doctor
that might be able to help you.

473
00:55:05,864 --> 00:55:07,490
I'd like to meet him.

474
00:55:07,574 --> 00:55:11,202
We'll get that name after the show.
Thank you. That's very nice.

475
00:55:11,286 --> 00:55:13,538
Anyone else? Yes, stand right up.

476
00:55:13,621 --> 00:55:16,166
But then you'd be like everyone else.

477
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,251
Yes, I know.

478
00:55:18,334 --> 00:55:20,003
I think he'd like that.

479
00:55:20,086 --> 00:55:22,672
But then no one would
think you were special.

480
00:55:22,756 --> 00:55:24,883
You wouldn't be on TV or anything.

481
00:55:24,966 --> 00:55:28,011
No matter what,
Edward will always be special.

482
00:55:33,808 --> 00:55:36,394
More questions? Yes. Stand right up.

483
00:55:36,978 --> 00:55:40,064
Your work is so interesting,
distinctive and unique.

484
00:55:40,148 --> 00:55:43,151
Do you have any plans
to open your own beauty salon?

485
00:55:43,234 --> 00:55:45,320
Oh, there's an idea!

486
00:55:48,323 --> 00:55:51,159
Anyone else? Yeah. Stand right up.

487
00:55:51,242 --> 00:55:54,079
Do you have a girlfriend?

488
00:55:58,249 --> 00:56:00,168
Sure he does. Right, Kim?

489
00:56:00,251 --> 00:56:03,171
- Right, Kim?
- Great! Now you got him started.

490
00:56:03,254 --> 00:56:05,006
Knock it off, bubble-butt.

491
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,716
- You did it.
- So?

492
00:56:07,842 --> 00:56:11,387
<i>How about it, Edward?</i>
<i>Is there some special lady in your life?</i>

493
00:56:41,751 --> 00:56:46,756
Everything's all right. We'll take a break
and we'll be back after these messages.

494
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,716
Why are you laughing? He got hurt!

495
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,345
- It was just a little shock. What do you care?
- A little shock?!

496
00:56:52,887 --> 00:56:57,434
I wish we'd been taping that.
I'd give my left nut to see that again.

497
00:56:58,101 --> 00:57:00,645
Aren't you excited? This is so thrillin'!

498
00:57:00,728 --> 00:57:05,400
Wait till I show it to you. It's just perfect.
It's just what we've been lookin' for.

499
00:57:05,483 --> 00:57:07,986
I wanna call it Shear Heaven!

500
00:57:10,905 --> 00:57:12,824
And here we are.

501
00:57:12,907 --> 00:57:15,994
Now, all along here
I'm gonna put a row of new mirrors.

502
00:57:16,077 --> 00:57:18,455
And back along here, well, I think...

503
00:57:18,538 --> 00:57:20,415
Eddie! Come along, doll.

504
00:57:20,498 --> 00:57:26,004
Back up here a whole row of new cosmetics.
And all along this row here...

505
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:31,009
- Peg could sell cosmetics.
- Yeah... Sure.

506
00:57:31,092 --> 00:57:33,845
And this of course
is where we wash the hair.

507
00:57:33,928 --> 00:57:37,766
And here is where I stand...
when I greet the customers.

508
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:40,977
But back in here
is what I really wanna show you.

509
00:57:44,898 --> 00:57:49,068
Eddie... This is what
I really want to show you.

510
00:57:49,152 --> 00:57:52,405
Now, this is the storeroom
where we keep everything,

511
00:57:52,489 --> 00:57:56,659
and what I need from you today
is a decision I need you to help me make.

512
00:57:56,743 --> 00:57:59,788
Honey, no! No, don't. That's dangerous.

513
00:57:59,871 --> 00:58:02,373
Now, you just sit right down there...

514
00:58:04,584 --> 00:58:09,089
I have some smocks.
Would you like me to model them for you?

515
00:58:09,506 --> 00:58:10,882
Yes.

516
00:58:10,965 --> 00:58:13,051
OK.

517
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,205
Now, this is my favourite.

518
00:58:43,248 --> 00:58:45,333
Because it's yellow...

519
00:58:46,876 --> 00:58:48,837
And what it's for...

520
00:58:50,463 --> 00:58:54,592
is to catch those itchy little
trimmings that fall down your neck.

521
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:03,101
And then there's this old purple one
that you kinda drape around you like this.

522
00:59:05,645 --> 00:59:07,730
I like that one.

523
00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:12,777
Why, Eddie, you're tremblin'.

524
00:59:15,655 --> 00:59:17,407
So am I!

525
00:59:19,909 --> 00:59:22,412
I've been waitin' for this moment for so long.

526
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,579
Edward!

527
01:00:04,662 --> 01:00:07,624
Edward, you come back here!
You can't do that!

528
01:00:19,552 --> 01:00:21,596
Velcro, sweetheart.

529
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:24,599
- It hangs on the dashboard.
- I've never seen that.

530
01:00:24,682 --> 01:00:26,684
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi, Edward.

531
01:00:26,768 --> 01:00:29,896
Sorry, dear, we had to go ahead without you.
There you go.

532
01:00:29,979 --> 01:00:32,690
So, Edward, did you have a productive day?

533
01:00:32,774 --> 01:00:35,276
Mrs Monroe showed me
where the salon will be.

534
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,947
- You could have a cosmetics counter.
- Wouldn't that be great?

535
01:00:39,781 --> 01:00:41,032
Great.

536
01:00:41,116 --> 01:00:44,494
Then she showed me the back room
where she took all her clothes off.

537
01:00:45,412 --> 01:00:49,290
Edward, I can't tell you how thrilled I am.
I'm as pleased as punch.

538
01:00:49,374 --> 01:00:51,876
This venture's gonna teach you volumes.

539
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,921
There's nothin' like
running your own business.

540
01:00:55,004 --> 01:00:56,840
I've never done it myself,

541
01:00:56,923 --> 01:01:01,052
but I gather it's the greatest satisfaction
a working man can have.

542
01:01:01,803 --> 01:01:04,848
So I guess the bank's
gonna be your next step, huh?

543
01:01:04,931 --> 01:01:06,558
The bank?

544
01:01:06,641 --> 01:01:10,103
Yeah. Take out a loan, get yourself started.

545
01:01:10,937 --> 01:01:16,025
Nothin' to worry about. With your talent
and reputation, it's gonna be a snap.

546
01:01:20,238 --> 01:01:22,031
No credit,

547
01:01:22,115 --> 01:01:24,534
no record ofjobs you've held,

548
01:01:24,617 --> 01:01:26,453
no savings,

549
01:01:26,536 --> 01:01:28,621
no personal investments...

550
01:01:29,372 --> 01:01:32,792
No social security number -
you may as well not even exist...

551
01:01:32,876 --> 01:01:37,046
- There is no collateral.
- No, we already have a second on the house.

552
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,382
But don't the testimonials count?

553
01:01:39,466 --> 01:01:43,344
Did you see here the mayor's wife
can't wait to become a client?

554
01:01:43,428 --> 01:01:45,388
We simply can't do it.

555
01:01:45,472 --> 01:01:50,643
Now, get yourself a social security card,
establish credit and buy yourself a car.

556
01:01:50,727 --> 01:01:54,689
You have a decided advantage.
You can get a handicapped placard

557
01:01:54,773 --> 01:01:56,608
and park anywhere you like.

558
01:01:59,652 --> 01:02:02,572
I can't believe it. It's just an outrage.

559
01:02:02,655 --> 01:02:07,494
But don't you worry. This isn't the end of it.
We'll get your money somehow.

560
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:14,125
- But that's breaking and entering.
- My parents have insurance up the rear.

561
01:02:14,209 --> 01:02:17,754
What'll it cost them?
A little hassle, that's about it.

562
01:02:17,837 --> 01:02:21,007
- We can't.
- This guy'll give us cash for the stuff.

563
01:02:21,091 --> 01:02:22,675
I don't want to.

564
01:02:22,759 --> 01:02:27,263
You don't want us to have our own van where
we can be alone? And a mattress in the back?

565
01:02:27,347 --> 01:02:28,890
Why can't <i>you</i> do it?

566
01:02:28,973 --> 01:02:32,102
Because the room's locked
and we need Edward to get us in.

567
01:02:32,185 --> 01:02:34,479
Can't you take the key when he's sleeping?

568
01:02:34,562 --> 01:02:37,690
The only thing he hangs on to tighter
is his dick.

569
01:02:37,816 --> 01:02:41,194
- Razor Blades'll do anything for you.
- That's not true.

570
01:02:41,277 --> 01:02:43,988
- Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?
- That's not fair.

571
01:02:44,072 --> 01:02:47,659
- So what? There isn't any other way.
- There's gotta be.

572
01:02:48,868 --> 01:02:50,829
Look, I've racked my brain.

573
01:02:50,912 --> 01:02:53,123
Don't you want us to have our own van?

574
01:02:53,206 --> 01:02:55,417
Yeah.

575
01:02:58,044 --> 01:02:59,838
Jim, the lights are on!

576
01:02:59,921 --> 01:03:03,758
Those go on automatically.
They're gone for the weekend, I told you.

577
01:03:03,842 --> 01:03:05,593
In case of burglars.

578
01:03:05,677 --> 01:03:08,096
- You turned off the alarm?
- Yes. Let's go.

579
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:10,056
I hate this.

580
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:13,560
Are you sure he doesn't know
this is Jim's house?

581
01:03:14,269 --> 01:03:16,771
- This person stole from you?
- Keep it down!

582
01:03:16,855 --> 01:03:18,898
I told you he stole it, OK? Let's go!

583
01:03:18,982 --> 01:03:21,818
Tell his parents
and they'll make him give it back.

584
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:26,406
Listen, I already tried that.
Now, you told Kim you'd do this. Let's go.

585
01:03:26,489 --> 01:03:28,283
Come on!

586
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:35,165
OK, come on.

587
01:04:04,569 --> 01:04:07,155
The bastard had it wired separately.
Come on!

588
01:04:07,238 --> 01:04:09,491
No, Jim, we can't just leave him here!

589
01:04:17,582 --> 01:04:19,375
- Come on.
- I'm not gonna do this!

590
01:04:19,459 --> 01:04:21,544
- Just come on, Kim.
- Stop!

591
01:04:22,128 --> 01:04:24,214
Put me down!

592
01:04:52,242 --> 01:04:54,285
<i>We know you're in there!</i>

593
01:04:54,786 --> 01:04:59,457
<i>We're in the process of deactivating</i>
<i>the system so that you can come out!</i>

594
01:05:11,511 --> 01:05:13,304
- Denny, turn around!
- No way.

595
01:05:13,388 --> 01:05:16,516
Jim, they can't arrest you
for setting off your own alarm.

596
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:18,435
We'll tell 'em we freaked and ran.

597
01:05:18,518 --> 01:05:20,812
- I'm not going back there, OK?
- We have to!

598
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,730
No. My father would prosecute.

599
01:05:22,814 --> 01:05:24,983
- His own son?
- Especially his own son.

600
01:05:25,066 --> 01:05:27,235
And if Edward tells I'll kill him!

601
01:05:27,902 --> 01:05:29,988
- Denny, turn around!
- No!

602
01:05:30,071 --> 01:05:31,573
You have to!

603
01:05:31,656 --> 01:05:35,452
<i>We want your hands high in the air</i>
<i>where we can see them!</i>

604
01:05:40,707 --> 01:05:42,792
<i>Put your hands up!</i>

605
01:05:47,922 --> 01:05:50,508
He's holding something. Looks like knives.

606
01:05:50,592 --> 01:05:52,385
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

607
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,306
<i>I repeat- drop your weapons!</i>

608
01:05:56,389 --> 01:06:01,186
<i>I'm gonna ask you one more time.</i>
<i>This is your last warning. Drop your weapons.</i>

609
01:06:05,523 --> 01:06:10,487
<i>If you fail to do so we'll have to open fire.</i>
<i>Don't make us do that, buddy.</i>

610
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:13,656
<i>Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!</i>

611
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,033
<i>Now!</i>

612
01:06:15,116 --> 01:06:17,035
Looks like we got a psycho.

613
01:06:17,118 --> 01:06:19,162
- Prepare to fire!
- No!

614
01:06:19,245 --> 01:06:23,374
- Stand back, ladies!
- Those aren't weapons, those are his hands!

615
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,543
Please. We know him.

616
01:06:27,212 --> 01:06:28,838
All right. Cuff him.

617
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:39,599
- But we can see him now?
- We're going to have to hold him overnight.

618
01:06:39,682 --> 01:06:44,312
- He has to stay in prison all night?
- You can pick him up in the morning.

619
01:06:44,395 --> 01:06:46,481
Oh, Edward!

620
01:06:46,606 --> 01:06:48,817
Hello, Edward.

621
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,444
Oh, Edward, dear. I blame myself.

622
01:06:51,528 --> 01:06:54,864
What in God's name
was going through your mind, son?

623
01:06:54,948 --> 01:06:59,577
Why didn't I set a better example?
You saw how I envied Jim's parents.

624
01:06:59,661 --> 01:07:01,871
What were you gonna do with that stuff?

625
01:07:01,955 --> 01:07:05,333
I blithely say "We'll get money
for the salon somehow",

626
01:07:05,417 --> 01:07:07,335
but I never meant stealing.

627
01:07:07,419 --> 01:07:11,798
Dear, stealing's not the way to get it.
Stealing's not the way to get anything.

628
01:07:11,881 --> 01:07:15,635
Except trouble.
And you're in a serious heap of that.

629
01:07:15,718 --> 01:07:18,346
Oh, Edward. Why ever did you do this?

630
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:22,016
- Damn those TV programmes!
- Damn them all to hell!

631
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,269
Or did somebody put you up to this?

632
01:07:37,407 --> 01:07:39,784
Will he be OK, doc?

633
01:07:39,868 --> 01:07:44,914
The years spent in isolation have not given
him the tools to judge right from wrong.

634
01:07:44,998 --> 01:07:48,334
He's had no context.
He's been completely without guidance.

635
01:07:48,418 --> 01:07:52,380
Furthermore his work, the garden sculptures,
hairstyles and so forth,

636
01:07:52,464 --> 01:07:55,300
indicate that he's a highly imaginative...

637
01:07:55,383 --> 01:07:56,760
character.

638
01:07:56,843 --> 01:08:01,014
His awareness of what we call reality
is radically underdeveloped.

639
01:08:01,097 --> 01:08:04,058
But will he be all right out there?

640
01:08:04,476 --> 01:08:06,561
Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.

641
01:08:12,692 --> 01:08:18,239
Listen, it could keep me up all night worrying
about ya. You watch yourself, you hear?

642
01:08:23,453 --> 01:08:26,206
I happened to be up,
so I heard all this noise...

643
01:08:26,289 --> 01:08:30,168
All along I felt in my gut
there was somethin' wrong with him.

644
01:08:31,586 --> 01:08:35,090
- It could have been my house.
- Or any of our houses, but...

645
01:08:35,173 --> 01:08:39,344
I warned you, didn't I?
I saw the sign of Satan on him.

646
01:08:39,427 --> 01:08:44,265
You didn't heed my warning, but now
you will. Because now you can see it too.

647
01:09:00,073 --> 01:09:01,866
Edward, you stay here.

648
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:05,120
- What do you say in your defence?
- Nothing.

649
01:09:05,203 --> 01:09:08,540
- He doesn't want to talk.
- You have to say something.

650
01:09:08,623 --> 01:09:12,127
- He can't talk right now.
- No comments? No remarks?

651
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:15,547
So, were you set up?
What was going through your mind?

652
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:18,383
What do you have to say for yourself?

653
01:09:18,466 --> 01:09:21,803
- One comment.
- Later.

654
01:09:22,595 --> 01:09:26,057
Goodness, Lois, it looks like
I'll see you at our Christmas party

655
01:09:26,141 --> 01:09:28,435
before I get you over for your haircut!

656
01:09:28,518 --> 01:09:33,982
Well, of course we're gonna have it this year.
We have it every year. Why wouldn't we?

657
01:09:36,234 --> 01:09:37,652
Well!

658
01:09:37,735 --> 01:09:40,530
You may think that, but you're wrong.

659
01:09:45,201 --> 01:09:47,287
You're here.

660
01:09:49,122 --> 01:09:51,207
They didn't hurt you, did they?

661
01:09:53,877 --> 01:09:55,628
Were you scared?

662
01:09:59,174 --> 01:10:03,845
I tried to make Jim go back,
but you can't make Jim do anything.

663
01:10:10,351 --> 01:10:12,771
Thank you for not telling them that we...

664
01:10:13,354 --> 01:10:15,148
You're welcome.

665
01:10:18,276 --> 01:10:21,905
It must have been awful
when they told you whose house it was.

666
01:10:23,782 --> 01:10:25,867
I knew it was Jim's house.

667
01:10:26,534 --> 01:10:28,620
You did?

668
01:10:29,412 --> 01:10:31,081
Yes.

669
01:10:32,999 --> 01:10:35,085
Well, then why'd you do it?

670
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:39,214
Because you asked me to.

671
01:10:42,425 --> 01:10:44,010
Kimba!

672
01:10:44,094 --> 01:10:46,513
Kimmy!

673
01:10:54,729 --> 01:10:57,148
- Don't!
- What's the matter with you?

674
01:10:57,232 --> 01:10:59,484
When are you gonna stop? I did what I could.

675
01:10:59,567 --> 01:11:02,987
My old man thinks he's retarded, so he's free.
What more do you want?

676
01:11:03,071 --> 01:11:06,366
- You could tell the truth.
- So could you. You were there too!

677
01:11:06,449 --> 01:11:10,286
- You know I didn't wanna do it.
- But you did do it.

678
01:11:10,995 --> 01:11:13,706
I don't get why you give such a shit anyway.

679
01:11:44,446 --> 01:11:48,575
Maybe there's a way you can
replace the drapes and the towels,

680
01:11:48,658 --> 01:11:52,245
but our confidence in you
is not gonna be so easy to replace.

681
01:11:52,328 --> 01:11:53,913
Dad...

682
01:11:55,039 --> 01:12:00,670
OK. A little ethics. You're walkin' down
the street. You find a suitcase full of money.

683
01:12:00,754 --> 01:12:05,175
There's nobody around. No human person
is in evidence. What do you do?

684
01:12:05,258 --> 01:12:07,677
A: You keep the money.

685
01:12:07,761 --> 01:12:12,223
B: You use it to buy gifts
for your friends and your loved ones.

686
01:12:12,307 --> 01:12:15,268
C: You give it to the poor.

687
01:12:16,019 --> 01:12:19,189
D: You turn it in to the police.

688
01:12:19,272 --> 01:12:21,691
- Dad, this is really stupid.
- Kim...!

689
01:12:21,775 --> 01:12:23,735
- I'd keep the money.
- Simmer down.

690
01:12:23,818 --> 01:12:25,069
Edward?

691
01:12:26,404 --> 01:12:30,492
Hey, how about after dinner we go down
to the bowling alley? That'd be fun.

692
01:12:30,575 --> 01:12:32,535
You're not seeing Jim tonight?

693
01:12:32,619 --> 01:12:34,120
No.

694
01:12:34,913 --> 01:12:36,998
We had the coolest show and tell today.

695
01:12:37,082 --> 01:12:41,961
This kid brought in a box of baby possums.
Ten, maybe twelve. Totally naked.

696
01:12:42,045 --> 01:12:46,216
- No hair at all.
- Honey, your father isn't finished yet.

697
01:12:46,674 --> 01:12:49,427
Thank you, dear. Edward, we're waiting.

698
01:12:52,514 --> 01:12:54,599
Give it to my loved ones?

699
01:12:57,811 --> 01:13:02,232
Oh, Edward, it does seem that
that's what you should do, but it's not.

700
01:13:05,193 --> 01:13:09,572
You dope, everybody knows
you're supposed to give it to the police.

701
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,992
Good thinking, Kevin.

702
01:13:13,076 --> 01:13:15,662
Well, think about it, you guys.

703
01:13:15,745 --> 01:13:19,207
I mean, that's the nicer thing to do.
That's what <i>I</i> would do.

704
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:25,213
We're not trying to confuse him, we're trying
to make things easier, so cut the comedy.

705
01:13:25,296 --> 01:13:28,425
I am being serious, Dad.
It's a much nicer thing to do.

706
01:13:28,508 --> 01:13:31,094
Forget nice. We're talking right and wrong.

707
01:13:31,511 --> 01:13:32,554
Shut up!

708
01:13:32,637 --> 01:13:38,768
Oh, goodness! No wonder poor Edward can't
learn right from wrong, living in this family!

709
01:13:38,852 --> 01:13:41,855
Well, did you hear
what he did to Peg's curtains?

710
01:13:41,938 --> 01:13:45,859
It's unbelievable they're having
their party anyway. Are you going?

711
01:13:45,942 --> 01:13:47,652
I don't think so.

712
01:13:47,735 --> 01:13:51,072
He practically raped Joyce,
threatening her with those knives.

713
01:13:51,156 --> 01:13:52,949
It's a miracle she escaped.

714
01:13:53,032 --> 01:13:55,243
I have nothing against Bill and Peg, but...

715
01:13:55,326 --> 01:13:58,621
I know. They've got that
teenage daughter in the house.

716
01:13:58,705 --> 01:14:01,624
Those poor things!
After what happened to me...

717
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:03,460
Can you imagine?

718
01:14:03,543 --> 01:14:05,920
What did you say about the Christmas party?

719
01:14:06,004 --> 01:14:08,047
I said I hoped we could make it.

720
01:14:08,131 --> 01:14:10,049
I lied too.

721
01:14:30,028 --> 01:14:32,947
Edward? Do you want to
give me that new haircut?

722
01:14:33,531 --> 01:14:35,825
- Again?
- Yeah, sure!

723
01:14:35,909 --> 01:14:40,288
It makes me proud to have you
as my own personal hairdresser.

724
01:14:42,874 --> 01:14:44,709
Hi, honey.

725
01:14:44,793 --> 01:14:47,837
- Kevin, want to play scissors, paper, stone?
- No.

726
01:14:47,921 --> 01:14:51,174
- Why?
- It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.

727
01:14:51,257 --> 01:14:54,427
- People's feelings, please. A few manners!
- I'll be outside.

728
01:14:54,511 --> 01:14:58,848
Never you mind, dear. Just... cut away.

729
01:15:09,067 --> 01:15:11,736
# I saw three ships come sailing by

730
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:14,697
# On Christmas day in the morning

731
01:15:21,746 --> 01:15:25,417
It needs something... else.
What do you think, honey?

732
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,420
- More bells?
- OK.

733
01:15:28,503 --> 01:15:31,548
Mom, do you really think
we should be having this party?

734
01:15:31,631 --> 01:15:34,426
Of course I think
we should be having this party.

735
01:15:34,509 --> 01:15:41,182
It's just what we need to calm things down...
and everything'll go back to normal.

736
01:15:43,017 --> 01:15:45,186
Do you have any more bells, honey?

737
01:17:37,173 --> 01:17:39,384
Now you've done it.

738
01:17:39,467 --> 01:17:41,970
It's just a scratch, Jim, really. It's OK.

739
01:17:42,053 --> 01:17:45,098
- Touch her again and I'll kill ya.
- It's no big deal.

740
01:17:45,181 --> 01:17:47,851
- Call a doctor. He skewered Kim.
- No!

741
01:17:47,934 --> 01:17:49,769
Stay away from her. I mean it!

742
01:17:49,853 --> 01:17:54,149
You can't touch anything without ruining it.
Why do you hang around here anyway?

743
01:17:54,232 --> 01:17:58,737
I want you to sit right down
and wait for me to bring you some ice.

744
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:01,364
Stay right there. I'll be right back.

745
01:18:07,412 --> 01:18:09,831
Get the hell outta here!

746
01:18:10,373 --> 01:18:12,917
Get the hell out! Go! Freak!

747
01:18:13,668 --> 01:18:15,837
Hey, Edward, where are you goin'?

748
01:18:23,678 --> 01:18:25,346
Where is he?

749
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:28,141
- He tried to hurt you.
- He did not, and you know it.

750
01:18:28,224 --> 01:18:30,685
Are you nuts? I just saw him!

751
01:18:30,769 --> 01:18:35,648
Jim, I don't love you any more.
I just want you to go, OK? Just go!

752
01:18:36,441 --> 01:18:38,151
Are you serious?

753
01:18:38,234 --> 01:18:40,820
And lose you to that? He isn't even human.

754
01:18:40,904 --> 01:18:43,615
Just get out of here, OK? Just go!

755
01:18:51,623 --> 01:18:53,666
Dad, did you see where Edward went?

756
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:56,294
I don't know. He just waltzed down the street.

757
01:18:56,377 --> 01:18:59,339
- We have to find him, Mom.
- Your father will find him.

758
01:18:59,422 --> 01:19:01,633
Go on in the house. I'll take care of it.

759
01:19:01,716 --> 01:19:03,802
I'll go find him.

760
01:19:21,111 --> 01:19:22,404
Edward!

761
01:19:22,487 --> 01:19:24,572
I'm calling the police!

762
01:20:12,454 --> 01:20:15,749
See all that blood, sweetie?
And it's just a little cut.

763
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:28,553
Hello. I'm here to see the man with the hands.

764
01:20:32,682 --> 01:20:34,851
He's not here. Thank you.

765
01:20:35,852 --> 01:20:38,062
Oh, dear.

766
01:20:39,814 --> 01:20:42,150
Helen, did you actually see him?

767
01:20:42,233 --> 01:20:43,818
Yes! Look!

768
01:20:49,532 --> 01:20:51,659
I'm looking for the man with the scissors.

769
01:20:51,743 --> 01:20:55,163
- Thank God you're here.
- He went right down that way, sir.

770
01:20:55,246 --> 01:20:58,833
All right, calm down.
Go on home. We'll handle it.

771
01:20:58,917 --> 01:21:00,752
Just go home.

772
01:21:00,835 --> 01:21:04,756
- A demon. A demon.
- You gotta do somethin'!

773
01:21:12,388 --> 01:21:14,891
I'm sure your father'll find him soon.

774
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,685
What time is it?

775
01:21:18,228 --> 01:21:22,190
It's almost 8.30. Great party, huh?

776
01:21:22,273 --> 01:21:24,359
Mom, where are they?

777
01:21:25,902 --> 01:21:28,905
- God, I hope he's OK.
- So do I, honey.

778
01:21:34,369 --> 01:21:38,164
You know, when I brought Edward
down here to live with us,

779
01:21:39,582 --> 01:21:42,210
I really didn't think things through.

780
01:21:43,253 --> 01:21:46,423
And I didn't think about
what could happen to him.

781
01:21:47,757 --> 01:21:51,261
Or to us. Or to the neighbourhood.

782
01:21:53,638 --> 01:21:55,723
And now I think that maybe...

783
01:21:57,475 --> 01:21:59,561
it might be best if he goes...

784
01:22:01,062 --> 01:22:03,148
back up there.

785
01:22:03,898 --> 01:22:06,067
Because at least there he's safe.

786
01:22:08,445 --> 01:22:11,114
And we'd just go back to normal.

787
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:17,203
I got halfway to the Whitmans'.
I didn't see him anywhere.

788
01:22:17,287 --> 01:22:19,539
Let's get in the car and go look for him.

789
01:22:19,622 --> 01:22:21,624
- Where's Kevin now?
- At Max's.

790
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:23,543
Oh, for God's sakes!

791
01:22:23,626 --> 01:22:26,296
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- With you guys.

792
01:22:26,379 --> 01:22:30,800
- You stay here in case somebody shows up.
- We'll be right back, dear.

793
01:23:09,672 --> 01:23:11,758
Police!

794
01:23:48,545 --> 01:23:50,630
Edward?

795
01:23:53,466 --> 01:23:55,135
Are you OK?

796
01:23:56,511 --> 01:23:58,304
Yes. Are you OK?

797
01:24:02,517 --> 01:24:04,310
Where is everybody?

798
01:24:05,019 --> 01:24:07,105
Out looking for you.

799
01:24:13,153 --> 01:24:15,071
Hold me.

800
01:24:28,877 --> 01:24:30,295
I can't.

801
01:24:59,032 --> 01:25:03,453
I know it's a little early
for Christmas, Edward, but...

802
01:25:06,831 --> 01:25:08,917
I have a present for you.

803
01:27:07,327 --> 01:27:09,162
Forget holding her hand.

804
01:27:09,245 --> 01:27:11,831
Picture the damage he could do other places.

805
01:27:11,915 --> 01:27:14,000
Yeah. That's sick.

806
01:27:19,714 --> 01:27:22,592
I feel like I'm gonna pass out
or puke or something.

807
01:27:22,675 --> 01:27:25,178
Later. First, take me to her house.

808
01:27:25,261 --> 01:27:27,138
Come on. Don't make me drive.

809
01:27:27,222 --> 01:27:28,765
Just do it!

810
01:27:29,307 --> 01:27:31,309
Jesus. Maybe she <i>was</i> right about you.

811
01:27:31,392 --> 01:27:33,478
- Just drive!
- Relax!

812
01:27:37,816 --> 01:27:40,777
- See you tomorrow. Call me.
- All right.

813
01:27:59,003 --> 01:28:01,297
Have they caught him yet?

814
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:05,301
- Who?
- Him! That cripple.

815
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,890
Let me know when they do.

816
01:28:12,976 --> 01:28:15,061
Let us all know, OK?

817
01:28:16,104 --> 01:28:18,189
Like a good boy.

818
01:28:38,752 --> 01:28:40,211
Kevin.

819
01:28:45,216 --> 01:28:46,885
Are you OK?

820
01:28:46,968 --> 01:28:48,470
It's OK.

821
01:28:52,307 --> 01:28:54,476
- Edward, stop!
- I'm your friend.

822
01:28:59,064 --> 01:29:00,565
Help us!

823
01:29:03,109 --> 01:29:05,987
What are you doing? Get away from him!

824
01:29:14,579 --> 01:29:16,456
- Let go of me!
- What?

825
01:29:16,539 --> 01:29:18,333
Kevin!

826
01:29:25,048 --> 01:29:28,134
- Get away!
- Edward, come home!

827
01:29:59,874 --> 01:30:00,917
Run.

828
01:30:28,486 --> 01:30:32,073
Kevin's all right!
It was just the tiniest scratch!

829
01:30:32,157 --> 01:30:36,453
He's gone. Let's not bother him, all right?
Let's just leave him alone.

830
01:30:44,961 --> 01:30:47,046
Go on, run.

831
01:30:51,593 --> 01:30:54,345
- What happened? Is he dead?
- Did you get him?

832
01:30:55,013 --> 01:30:58,141
It's all over. Go on home.
There's nothing more to see.

833
01:30:58,224 --> 01:31:02,854
What happened out there?
I want to know! I want some answers!

834
01:31:02,937 --> 01:31:05,482
It is all over.

835
01:31:05,565 --> 01:31:07,650
Where is he?

836
01:31:09,444 --> 01:31:12,614
Get back here!
I wanna ask you something!

837
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:21,122
Look at that! I don't believe this.

838
01:31:22,415 --> 01:31:24,417
They don't have him. I'm goin'.

839
01:31:24,501 --> 01:31:26,586
No! That's not a good idea.

840
01:32:32,026 --> 01:32:34,112
They're coming?

841
01:32:36,656 --> 01:32:38,658
Did I hurt Kevin?

842
01:32:38,742 --> 01:32:42,287
No, he's OK. Mostly he was just scared.

843
01:32:44,289 --> 01:32:46,958
Edward, I was so afraid.

844
01:32:47,584 --> 01:32:49,836
I thought you were dead.

845
01:32:57,552 --> 01:32:59,095
I didn't.

846
01:33:07,896 --> 01:33:09,397
No!

847
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:20,658
No!

848
01:33:20,742 --> 01:33:22,744
Jim, stop!

849
01:33:39,677 --> 01:33:40,720
No!

850
01:33:44,307 --> 01:33:47,185
Stop it. Or I'll kill you myself.

851
01:33:59,155 --> 01:34:01,074
I said stay away from her!

852
01:35:01,217 --> 01:35:03,052
Goodbye.

853
01:35:14,355 --> 01:35:16,191
I love you.

854
01:36:04,406 --> 01:36:06,282
Is he in there?

855
01:36:08,451 --> 01:36:10,203
He's dead.

856
01:36:13,998 --> 01:36:16,167
The roof caved in on him.

857
01:36:17,252 --> 01:36:19,295
They killed each other.

858
01:36:22,132 --> 01:36:24,843
You can see for yourselves.

859
01:36:26,803 --> 01:36:28,513
See?

860
01:36:37,647 --> 01:36:39,733
I'm goin' home.

861
01:36:48,575 --> 01:36:50,660
Joyce...

862
01:37:07,844 --> 01:37:09,929
She never saw him again.

863
01:37:11,723 --> 01:37:13,850
Not after that night.

864
01:37:14,684 --> 01:37:16,770
How do you know?

865
01:37:23,526 --> 01:37:25,612
Because I was there.

866
01:37:26,279 --> 01:37:30,033
You could have gone up there.
You still could go.

867
01:37:31,367 --> 01:37:33,745
No, sweetheart.

868
01:37:33,828 --> 01:37:35,914
I'm an old woman now.

869
01:37:36,873 --> 01:37:39,667
I would rather him remember me
the way I was.

870
01:38:14,619 --> 01:38:16,704
How do you know he's still alive?

871
01:38:18,957 --> 01:38:21,126
I don't know.

872
01:38:21,209 --> 01:38:23,628
Not for sure, but...

873
01:38:24,212 --> 01:38:26,506
I believe he is.

874
01:38:35,849 --> 01:38:42,689
<i>You see, before he came down here</i>
<i>it never snowed.</i>

875
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:50,947
And afterwards it did.

876
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:58,121
If he weren't up there now,
I don't think it would be snowing.

877
01:39:00,707 --> 01:39:04,169
Sometimes you can still catch me
dancing in it.
