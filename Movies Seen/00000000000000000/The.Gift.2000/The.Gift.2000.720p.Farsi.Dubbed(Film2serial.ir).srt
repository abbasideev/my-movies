where the victim's body was.

664
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:40,086
And how you found out,
well,

665
00:56:40,157 --> 00:56:43,351
that might open up
a real can of worms for us.

666
00:56:43,423 --> 00:56:47,947
Psychic phenomena,
E.S.P., dreams, visions.

667
00:56:48,024 --> 00:56:50,286
The defense
could go to town on you.

668
00:56:50,358 --> 00:56:53,585
And if that's not bad enough,
I understand there was bad blood...

669
00:56:53,658 --> 00:56:56,556
between you
and Donnie Barksdale.

670
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,852
Yeah.
He threatened my kids.

671
00:56:58,924 --> 00:57:02,880
That's what I heard. I also heard
that you threatened him right back.

672
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:05,082
Told his wife
to leave him.

673
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:09,956
Donnie's quite
a ladies' man.

674
00:57:10,024 --> 00:57:12,252
Were you involved
with him ?

675
00:57:14,324 --> 00:57:16,586
- What ?
- I can deal with any revelation...

676
00:57:16,658 --> 00:57:18,589
right now.

677
00:57:18,657 --> 00:57:21,590
But at the trial
there can't be any surprises.

678
00:57:23,258 --> 00:57:25,917
So, is there anything I need
to know about you or Donnie...

679
00:57:25,991 --> 00:57:29,219
or Donnie's wife
or the victim ?

680
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:31,757
No.

681
00:57:31,825 --> 00:57:34,120
Will that be all ?

682
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:37,223
Yes, ma'am.

683
00:57:40,025 --> 00:57:43,457
You know, Mr. Duncan,

684
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:46,979
the victim had a name.

685
00:57:47,057 --> 00:57:49,751
It was Jessica King.

686
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:55,157
Mr. Hawkins, how long have you
worked out at AyJay's ?

687
00:57:55,157 --> 00:57:57,315
Mr. Hawkins, how long have you
worked out at AyJay's ?

688
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,323
About ten years.

689
00:57:59,391 --> 00:58:02,948
Now, were you working at AyJay's
on Saturday night, April 8 ?

690
00:58:03,024 --> 00:58:05,581
- Yes, sir.
- And did you see the defendant,

691
00:58:05,657 --> 00:58:09,420
-Donnie Barksdale, there that night?
-Yes, sir.

692
00:58:09,491 --> 00:58:12,218
Could you describe the circumstances
when you saw him ?

693
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:17,053
The circumstances were I come
outside to throw out some trash.

694
00:58:17,124 --> 00:58:19,056
And do you recall
what time it was ?

695
00:58:19,124 --> 00:58:21,419
About midnight,
I reckon.

696
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:25,048
Anyhow, I seen Donnie Barksdale
out there by his truck...

697
00:58:25,124 --> 00:58:29,022
havin' an argument
with this white lady.

698
00:58:29,091 --> 00:58:33,853
She scratched his arm
and he slapped the tar out of her.

699
00:58:33,924 --> 00:58:36,754
About that time,
I go back inside.

700
00:58:36,824 --> 00:58:39,154
Is this the woman
you saw with Donnie Barksdale ?

701
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:42,451
- Yes, sir.
- Your Honor, let the record show...

702
00:58:42,524 --> 00:58:46,548
that I've just shown Mr. Hawkins
a photograph of Jessica King.

703
00:58:49,024 --> 00:58:54,184
You just said that your attention
was drawn to the defendant's pond.

704
00:58:55,525 --> 00:58:58,547
Drawn in--
Well, drawn in what way ?

705
00:58:59,924 --> 00:59:02,720
Me, Wayne Collins
and Kenneth King...

706
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,722
went to see a woman,
name of Annie Wilson.

707
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:07,222
What made you think this woman
would be able to help you ?

708
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:13,053
Well, word around town
was that she was a,

709
00:59:13,124 --> 00:59:15,834
uh--

710
00:59:15,968 --> 00:59:20,025
- Well, I don't know the right word.
- Isn't it fortune-teller ?

711
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:24,063
-I guess so.
-What did this fortune-teller see...

712
00:59:24,135 --> 00:59:27,100
when she looked into
her little crystal ball ?

713
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:31,998
Well, she didn't have no ball.
She had these, uh, special cards.

714
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:35,329
What did she see when she looked
into her little special cards ?

715
00:59:35,401 --> 00:59:37,663
Uh, she didn't actually
see nothing then.

716
00:59:37,734 --> 00:59:41,258
But next day,
she come to see me and...

717
00:59:41,335 --> 00:59:43,198
told me
she had this dream.

718
00:59:43,267 --> 00:59:46,290
- She had a dream ?
- Yes, sir.

719
00:59:46,367 --> 00:59:50,561
She'd seen this pond and it looked
a lot like Donnie Barksdale's and...

720
00:59:52,135 --> 00:59:54,726
then she woke up
from her dream...

721
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:57,858
and she went outside
and looked up in this tree.

722
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:02,924
I'm all ears.

723
01:00:06,901 --> 01:00:09,992
She seen Jessica King...

724
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:12,693
floatin' in the tree,

725
01:00:12,768 --> 01:00:15,564
half-naked, with a chain
wrapped around her.

726
01:00:15,634 --> 01:00:18,032
Floatin' around a tree ?

727
01:00:19,501 --> 01:00:21,433
Yes, sir.

728
01:00:22,933 --> 01:00:24,900
Floatin' in a tree,

729
01:00:24,968 --> 01:00:27,059
half-naked,

730
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:31,262
with a chain
wrapped around her.

731
01:00:31,334 --> 01:00:33,664
Thank you, Sheriff.

732
01:00:35,168 --> 01:00:37,656
That little squirrel,
Weems, is just mean and skinny.

733
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:40,256
Never have known
a Weems worth a damn.

734
01:00:40,334 --> 01:00:42,198
Well, he was
just doing his job.

735
01:00:42,268 --> 01:00:46,098
Uh, Mrs. Wilson ?
Can I talk to you for a minute ?

736
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:49,497
- Um--
- Uh, just call me later on, okay ?

737
01:00:49,567 --> 01:00:51,500
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, bye.

738
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:56,192
Buddy, I got a lot on my mind.
It's not a good time, okay ?

739
01:00:58,534 --> 01:01:00,467
Um, Mrs. Wilson ?

740
01:01:00,534 --> 01:01:04,557
You did tell me to do some thinkin'
and talkin'. And I've been thinkin'.

741
01:01:04,634 --> 01:01:06,429
What ? What ?

742
01:01:06,501 --> 01:01:10,366
Can you tell me why
I do things to myself...

743
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:12,366
when I think
about my daddy ?

744
01:01:12,434 --> 01:01:14,525
All right, well--

745
01:01:14,601 --> 01:01:18,829
Bud, you call me later, hon,
and we'll talk, all right ?

746
01:01:18,901 --> 01:01:21,696
- I need to talk to you.
- Buddy.

747
01:01:21,768 --> 01:01:24,700
I've been thinking about my daddy
and I've been touching myself.

748
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:27,700
- Touching yourself? How ?
- Why do I do that ?

749
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:29,324
It's not a good time.

750
01:01:29,401 --> 01:01:32,663
- Something's bad wrong with me.
- Look, Buddy--

751
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:35,699
And I-- I keep thinking
about that blue diamond.

752
01:01:35,767 --> 01:01:39,564
You look into the blue diamond,
you won't think a negative thought.

753
01:01:39,634 --> 01:01:43,430
I promise. Now, hon, I'm going
through a hard time myself. I'm--

754
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:46,763
I just-- I can't talk
to you now, okay ?

755
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,725
[Man] You're gonna burn
in hell, Annie Wilson !

756
01:02:03,401 --> 01:02:06,561
Now, Mike, I know you skipped
school and went to that trial.

757
01:02:06,634 --> 01:02:09,758
- How'd you know ?
- A little bird told me.

758
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:13,027
It's time you started making things
easier on me instead of harder.

759
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,033
- [Phone Ringing]
- I'm very disappointed in you.

760
01:02:15,101 --> 01:02:18,589
- The phone's ringing, Mama.
- Second of all,

761
01:02:18,667 --> 01:02:21,428
I'm gonna have to testify
at that trial tomorrow.

762
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,331
- The phone's ringing, Mama.
- I'm not deaf, Miller.

763
01:02:24,401 --> 01:02:26,560
Let the machine get it.

764
01:02:26,634 --> 01:02:30,588
Donnie Barksdale's side, they're
gonna try and give me a hard time.

765
01:02:30,666 --> 01:02:33,224
They're gonna call me names
and I--

766
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,232
I just want y'all
to be prepared...

767
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,561
if you hear any bad stuff
about me, all right ?

768
01:02:38,633 --> 01:02:42,122
Now, we're all gonna have to
be sticking together on this one.

769
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,927
[Woman]
Annie Wilson, it's Buddy's mother.

770
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,591
Buddy's done gone crazy.
He's threatening to kill his daddy!

771
01:02:47,666 --> 01:02:51,497
He's got Odell tied up
in the backyard,

772
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,590
accusing him
of horrible things.

773
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:57,099
- Have you called the police ?
- He said if I did he'd kill Odell.

774
01:02:57,167 --> 01:02:59,429
He wants you.

775
01:02:59,501 --> 01:03:01,433
[ Buddy Sobbing ]

776
01:03:01,501 --> 01:03:04,194
Hey, Buddy.

777
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:10,889
Buddy, put that strap down and
tell me what he's done to you.

778
01:03:10,967 --> 01:03:14,195
I'm here, Buddy. Like you said,
you can talk to me, honey.

779
01:03:14,267 --> 01:03:19,598
It's too late for that !
It's too goddamn late !

780
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:23,429
This here is a criminal.

781
01:03:25,533 --> 01:03:28,022
And he's gonna be punished.

782
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,566
Bud-Buddy.
Buddy, it's Annie.

783
01:03:30,634 --> 01:03:33,724
- You shut up ! You shut up !
- It's all right.

784
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,857
- Get away ! Where were you ?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

785
01:03:37,933 --> 01:03:42,365
You knew everything
and you did nothing.

786
01:03:42,433 --> 01:03:45,195
You ruined me.
You ruined me !

787
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,929
I was just a little boy, Daddy.

788
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,488
It got so I was embarrassed
to go to school, Daddy.

789
01:03:52,566 --> 01:03:55,328
How could you do that
to your little boy ?

790
01:04:07,733 --> 01:04:10,358
No, Buddy. You put that down.
No, Buddy.

791
01:04:10,433 --> 01:04:13,400
You put that down, Buddy.
You put that down. You listen to me.

792
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:16,694
You get away !
You get away ! Get away !

793
01:04:16,767 --> 01:04:21,166
All right, Buddy. All right.
It's all right. Come on.

794
01:04:22,634 --> 01:04:24,929
Why-- Why didn't
you help me, Annie ?

795
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,761
What ?

796
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:29,560
Why didn't you
help me ?

797
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:33,191
- I had you for a friend and then--
- I am your friend, Buddy.

798
01:04:33,267 --> 01:04:35,926
Now I have nobody.

799
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,932
I have nobody !

800
01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:51,433
But I'm gonna--
I'm gonna kill this thing.

801
01:04:52,767 --> 01:04:54,892
- No !
- No, Buddy !

802
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,398
No !

803
01:05:02,767 --> 01:05:04,255
Help me !

804
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,494
- Help me!
- Look at that goddamn thing.

805
01:05:07,567 --> 01:05:09,759
And you tell me what kind
of thoughts you have ?

806
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:12,856
You look!

807
01:05:12,933 --> 01:05:14,865
You look
into that thing !

808
01:05:14,933 --> 01:05:16,865
[Sirens Walling]

809
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:39,465
[Duncan]
Mrs. Wilson ? Mrs. Wilson.

810
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:43,993
Mrs. Wilson, your husband,
Ben Wilson Senior,

811
01:05:44,067 --> 01:05:46,532
was one of the men killed last year
in the explosion...

812
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,532
out at the Reinhold
Cable Plant.

813
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,691
Yes, that's right.

814
01:05:50,767 --> 01:05:54,200
And you were left with three small
children to raise on your own.

815
01:05:54,267 --> 01:05:56,755
Yes, sir.

816
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:59,230
How do you provide
for you and your sons ?

817
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,564
I get a little bit
of money from Social Security...

818
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:08,584
as a result
of my husband's death.

819
01:06:11,185 --> 01:06:13,707
And, uh,

820
01:06:13,784 --> 01:06:16,012
I also give readings.

821
01:06:16,084 --> 01:06:18,107
- Psychic readings.
- Yes, sir.

822
01:06:18,184 --> 01:06:21,174
What does being psychic
enable you to do ?

823
01:06:23,152 --> 01:06:25,344
I see things...

824
01:06:25,417 --> 01:06:28,850
and I, you know--
I sense... things...

825
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,009
that-- well, they
hadn't happened yet...

826
01:06:31,085 --> 01:06:34,278
or they were happening
someplace else.

827
01:06:34,351 --> 01:06:39,511
My granny told me that I--
I had a gift that runs in my family.

828
01:06:39,584 --> 01:06:41,880
And she told me that
I shouldn't be afraid of it.

829
01:06:41,951 --> 01:06:47,043
I should just always use my instinct
and I'd-- I'd be all right.

830
01:06:47,118 --> 01:06:49,107
So, you're swearing
before this court...

831
01:06:49,185 --> 01:06:51,343
that you didn't get your information
about this tragedy...

832
01:06:51,417 --> 01:06:54,281
from any other means
than your special ability ?

833
01:06:54,351 --> 01:06:57,341
- Your gift.
- Yes, sir.

834
01:06:57,418 --> 01:07:00,144
I'm swearing that. Yes.

835
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:03,206
- Thank you, Mrs. Wilson.
- Yes, sir.

836
01:07:03,284 --> 01:07:05,978
- I have no further questions.
- [Judge] Mr. Weems.

837
01:07:10,885 --> 01:07:12,373
[Weems]
Mrs. Wilson.

838
01:07:16,285 --> 01:07:18,807
How many fingers am I holding up
behind my back ?

839
01:07:18,885 --> 01:07:20,850
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Your Honor,

840
01:07:20,917 --> 01:07:23,645
my client is sitting in this
courtroom on trial for his life...

841
01:07:23,718 --> 01:07:27,206
partly because of powers
that this woman claims to have.

842
01:07:27,284 --> 01:07:30,216
Now, in all fairness, I believe
I should be given the opportunity...

843
01:07:30,284 --> 01:07:32,216
to test
the alleged powers...

844
01:07:32,284 --> 01:07:34,807
instead of having to stand here
and take her word for it.

845
01:07:34,885 --> 01:07:38,339
You have a good point.
Objection overruled.

846
01:07:38,417 --> 01:07:43,782
Can everyone in the jury box
see how many fingers I'm showing ?

847
01:07:48,217 --> 01:07:50,445
How many fingers,
Mrs. Wilson ?

848
01:07:56,117 --> 01:07:58,049
I don't know.

849
01:07:58,117 --> 01:08:00,311
You don't know ?

850
01:08:02,885 --> 01:08:06,339
Seven.
Seven fingers.

851
01:08:06,417 --> 01:08:09,042
That-- That doesn't
prove anything.

852
01:08:09,117 --> 01:08:12,242
Your Honor, I can't do this,
you know, at the drop of a hat.

853
01:08:12,317 --> 01:08:16,681
Well, then, ma'am, how about doing
it at the drop of a dollar bill ?

854
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:19,013
What are you trying to say ?

855
01:08:19,085 --> 01:08:21,482
I'm trying to say maybe this special
gift of yours doesn't work...

856
01:08:21,551 --> 01:08:24,278
unless you're
being paid for it.

857
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:26,782
Like they say in the army,
''No money, no honey.''

858
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:28,817
No, that's not true.

859
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:30,817
Are you aware that in Hatcher County
it's against the law...

860
01:08:30,885 --> 01:08:33,043
for a psychic to set up shop
and charge people money ?

861
01:08:33,117 --> 01:08:35,106
Well, I don't charge money.

862
01:08:35,184 --> 01:08:37,151
You just testified
that you do charge money.

863
01:08:37,218 --> 01:08:40,615
No. I accept donations.
People give me gifts.

864
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:45,342
Oh. A distinction
worthy of a lawyer.

865
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:47,906
Mrs. Wilson,
you a rich woman ?

866
01:08:47,985 --> 01:08:50,007
- No.
- Why not ?

867
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:54,983
If I had psychic powers and could
read the future, I'd be filthy rich.

868
01:08:55,051 --> 01:08:56,983
I'd be playing
the Stock Market.

869
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:00,016
I'd be over in Mobile
betting on the dogs.

870
01:09:00,084 --> 01:09:02,346
I'd certainly warn my husband
not to go to work...

871
01:09:02,416 --> 01:09:04,849
on the day I know the Reinhold
Plant's gonna blow up...

872
01:09:04,918 --> 01:09:09,145
leaving three little ol' children
to be raised in a carnival sideshow.

873
01:09:09,217 --> 01:09:12,512
Well, it doesn't work
that way, sir.

874
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:14,550
I can't use my gift
for personal gain.

875
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:19,845
Except for those, uh,
what you call 'em, donations ?

876
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:28,107
You've had some personal trouble
with Donnie Barksdale, haven't you ?

877
01:09:33,351 --> 01:09:35,283
Yes, I have.

878
01:09:35,351 --> 01:09:38,181
Just a few weeks ago, you told him--
I believe the exact words was...

879
01:09:38,251 --> 01:09:40,513
you was gonna have
his ass thrown in jail.

880
01:09:40,584 --> 01:09:43,345
- But he was threatening my kids.
- Ain't it also true...

881
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:46,349
that a few weeks ago in one of
those famous readings of yours,

882
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:48,348
when you were doing
your so-called E.S.P.,

883
01:09:48,416 --> 01:09:50,713
you told Valerie Barksdale,
Donnie's wife,

884
01:09:50,784 --> 01:09:53,147
that Donnie was just
an insecure redneck...

885
01:09:53,217 --> 01:09:56,149
and that he wasn't really
crazy enough to kill anybody ?

886
01:10:02,917 --> 01:10:04,849
Yes, I did say that.

887
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:07,144
Then why today are you
saying he did kill somebody ?

888
01:10:07,216 --> 01:10:09,149
Wait a second.
I've never said that.

889
01:10:09,217 --> 01:10:11,739
You might as well have, ma'am.
You wanted his ass in jail.

890
01:10:11,817 --> 01:10:15,181
-He's on trial for his life.
-I just told the sheriff what I saw.

891
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:18,809
And how could any of us
ever forget that ?

892
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:22,682
Jessica King just
floatin' up in that tree,

893
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:25,272
naked,

894
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,839
with a chain...

895
01:10:27,917 --> 01:10:29,849
wrapped around her.

896
01:10:31,617 --> 01:10:35,277
It must be
so much fun for you.

897
01:10:35,351 --> 01:10:37,510
You must be having
the time of your life...

898
01:10:37,584 --> 01:10:40,674
entertaining yourself
with your dreams and your visions.

899
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:44,307
You think it's fun seeing decomposed
bodies in my tree, do you, sir ?

900
01:10:44,384 --> 01:10:46,316
You think that's fun ?

901
01:10:46,384 --> 01:10:49,781
Do you think it's fun I have people
trying to strangle me in my sleep ?

902
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:52,009
Now I'm sitting here
and I'm blaming myself...

903
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:54,516
'cause some poor crazy man tried
to burn his daddy half to death.

904
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:56,516
And you think I'm sitting here
having fun ?

905
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:59,378
I'm sorry, sir.
You're crazy if you think that.

906
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:02,211
No more questions,
Your Honor.

907
01:11:03,751 --> 01:11:05,682
[Judge]
You're dismissed.

908
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,308
Like they say in Hollywood,
let's just cut to the chase.

909
01:11:21,384 --> 01:11:24,611
Did you or did you not
kill Jessica King ?

910
01:11:24,683 --> 01:11:26,615
I did not.

911
01:11:26,683 --> 01:11:30,309
Did you or did you not see Jessica
King on the night she was killed ?

912
01:11:30,384 --> 01:11:33,645
Yeah, I seen her.

913
01:11:33,717 --> 01:11:36,182
Would you describe
the circumstances, please ?

914
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,045
Well, I'd been seeing her
for quite a while.

915
01:11:39,116 --> 01:11:42,514
Would you clarify what
you mean by "seeing" ?

916
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:46,037
I mean, her and me
had been having sex.

917
01:11:46,116 --> 01:11:49,776
Okay, go ahead.

918
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:52,112
Well, she called me
about 1 1.:00.

919
01:11:52,184 --> 01:11:56,047
So I told her
I'd meet her out at Ay Jay's.

920
01:11:56,116 --> 01:11:58,674
And I told my wife
I was going out for a beer.

921
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:02,114
- What happened after that ?
- Well, we got in an argument.

922
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:04,115
She told me she didn't
want to see me no more.

923
01:12:04,183 --> 01:12:06,877
-Did she tell you why ?
-She said she was getting married...

924
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:09,541
in a couple of months and she
wanted to stop playing around.

925
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:12,777
At least
till after the wedding.

926
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:14,782
And during the course
of this argument with Miss King,

927
01:12:14,849 --> 01:12:16,873
did you at any moment
strike her ?

928
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:21,981
Yes, sir.

929
01:12:25,917 --> 01:12:28,213
What happened
after you struck her ?

930
01:12:28,283 --> 01:12:30,943
Well, she banged her head
pretty hard when she went down,

931
01:12:31,016 --> 01:12:34,245
so I-- I decided
to take her to the hospital.

932
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:37,373
- Did you reach the hospital ?
- No, sir.

933
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:39,382
Are you feeling okay ?

934
01:12:41,316 --> 01:12:43,249
I'm fine.

935
01:12:44,683 --> 01:12:46,672
I wanna go back.

936
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:49,272
I don't wanna go
to the hospital. Someone--

937
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:51,282
Someone might see me.

938
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:55,442
She said she was feeling better,
so I took her back to Ay Jay's.

939
01:12:55,517 --> 01:12:59,846
I dropped her off,
then I went on back home.

940
01:12:59,916 --> 01:13:04,372
And that was the very last time
that you saw Jessica King alive ?

941
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:07,439
- Yes, sir. The very last.
- Donnie,

942
01:13:07,517 --> 01:13:10,813
are you guilty
of the charge against you ?

943
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:14,761
I'm guilty
of cheating on my wife,

944
01:13:14,895 --> 01:13:17,326
of being a bad husband,

945
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:19,917
a bad Christian.

946
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:22,426
But I ain't guilty
of killing Jesse.

947
01:13:22,494 --> 01:13:24,959
I swear to God.

948
01:13:25,027 --> 01:13:28,323
No more questions,
Your Honor.

949
01:13:28,394 --> 01:13:29,758
Mr. Duncan.

950
01:13:29,828 --> 01:13:34,351
Mr. Barksdale,
you're a wife-beater, aren't you ?

951
01:13:38,162 --> 01:13:41,093
I've swore to tell
the truth here today.

952
01:13:41,161 --> 01:13:45,457
Yeah, I've hit
Valerie before.

953
01:13:45,528 --> 01:13:47,926
I guess
it ain't no secret.

954
01:13:47,995 --> 01:13:51,154
So, you admit to having a history
of violence against women ?

955
01:13:51,227 --> 01:13:53,090
You also admit to having
beaten up the victim...

956
01:13:53,161 --> 01:13:54,751
on the night
that she was murdered.

957
01:13:54,827 --> 01:13:56,760
I wouldn't exactly say
that I beat her up.

958
01:13:56,828 --> 01:13:59,191
You're the expert. You tell me.
Just how badly do you...

959
01:13:59,261 --> 01:14:03,523
have to beat a woman before it fits
your definition of ''beating up'' ?

960
01:14:03,593 --> 01:14:07,321
Now, your story is that you've
been having an affair...

961
01:14:07,394 --> 01:14:10,258
with the victim.

962
01:14:10,328 --> 01:14:13,691
But tell us why a beautiful
young woman like Jessica King...

963
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,693
from one of the finest
families in Brixton,

964
01:14:15,761 --> 01:14:18,885
just about to be married to a good,
decent professional man...

965
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,687
and with a bright,
shining future in front of her--

966
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,955
Why would a woman like that get
involved with something like you ?

967
01:14:25,028 --> 01:14:29,255
I asked her that
myself one time.

968
01:14:29,328 --> 01:14:32,521
She said I was the only man
in town who knew how to fuck.

969
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:34,822
[Murmuring]

970
01:14:34,895 --> 01:14:37,588
You're really disgusting.
You know that ?

971
01:14:37,661 --> 01:14:40,922
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Objection sustained.

972
01:14:40,994 --> 01:14:44,085
Mr. Duncan, you will refrain from
making those personal comments.

973
01:14:44,161 --> 01:14:47,093
I apologize, Your Honor.
It won't happen again.

974
01:14:48,927 --> 01:14:52,451
So, let's get this straight.
Let's clarify this.

975
01:14:52,528 --> 01:14:54,959
You're saying it was
just a coincidence...

976
01:14:55,027 --> 01:14:58,618
that on the very same night that you
physically assaulted Jessica King,

977
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:00,820
someone else put
her body in your pond ?

978
01:15:00,895 --> 01:15:03,190
I'm not saying
it was a coincidence.

979
01:15:03,261 --> 01:15:05,852
- What are you saying ?
- I'm saying I got framed !

980
01:15:05,927 --> 01:15:08,120
Oh, well, what an original defense.

981
01:15:08,194 --> 01:15:10,592
Did you think of Jessica King
as a stray cat ?

982
01:15:10,661 --> 01:15:12,183
No.

983
01:15:12,261 --> 01:15:14,523
Did you tell Sheriff Johnson that
a stray cat had clawed your arm ?

984
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,525
- Yeah.
- Didn't you just tell the court...

985
01:15:16,593 --> 01:15:18,526
-Jessica had scratched your arm ?
- Yeah, but--

986
01:15:18,594 --> 01:15:21,583
Didn't you tell Sheriff Johnson you
got scratched by the stray cat...

987
01:15:21,661 --> 01:15:23,592
because she didn't like it
when you killed her ?

988
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:26,024
Yeah, but I was lying.
My wife was standing right there !

989
01:15:26,094 --> 01:15:28,959
-How do I know you're not lying now?
-Because I'm not, goddamn it !

990
01:15:29,027 --> 01:15:31,493
- It's her, goddamn it !
- Be seated, Mr. Barksdale !

991
01:15:31,561 --> 01:15:33,685
She's the reason I'm up here !
She's a goddamn witch !

992

I'm glad that girl is dead.
Jessica.

1159
01:36:25,058 --> 01:36:28,253
She was messin' around with my
husband and deserved what she got.

1160
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:35,715
I couldn't sleep.
Met the girls for a drink.

1161
01:36:37,126 --> 01:36:39,217
Take off your clothes.

1162
01:36:45,459 --> 01:36:48,448
[Jessica's Voice]
Aren't you taking yours off too ?

1163
01:36:48,525 --> 01:36:52,252
[Duncan's Voice] There's a saying
about letting sleeping dogs lie.

1164
01:36:53,425 --> 01:36:57,551
You just fucked him,
didn't you ? Hmm ?

1165
01:36:59,859 --> 01:37:02,790
Donnie Barksdale ?

1166
01:37:03,959 --> 01:37:05,891
So ?

1167
01:37:05,959 --> 01:37:09,618
Why would you do this to me ?
Hmm ? I love you.

1168
01:37:09,692 --> 01:37:11,850
Maybe I wanted to be
with a man for a change.

1169
01:37:11,925 --> 01:37:14,357
- Watch your mouth.
- You watch your mouth. Fuck you !

1170
01:37:14,425 --> 01:37:17,220
- I'm sorry.
- We're through.

1171
01:37:17,292 --> 01:37:20,019
I don't like being spied on.

1172
01:37:20,092 --> 01:37:23,354
The only reason I'm with you
is 'cause my daddy likes you.

1173
01:37:25,926 --> 01:37:27,857
You horrible little bitch !

1174
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:30,686
I'll show you a bitch if you
don't let go of me. Let go !

1175
01:37:52,759 --> 01:37:55,122
- I think we better go back.
- Nothing's coming to you ?

1176
01:37:57,092 --> 01:37:59,059
No.

1177
01:37:59,126 --> 01:38:01,353
Nothing.

1178
01:38:10,258 --> 01:38:12,190
You know.

1179
01:38:15,058 --> 01:38:18,855
I knew if I got you close enough
to it that you'd see it.

1180
01:38:18,926 --> 01:38:22,289
- Wayne, I told you--
- No, no. It's okay.

1181
01:38:22,359 --> 01:38:24,551
I swear to God, Annie,
it's okay. It's okay.

1182
01:38:24,624 --> 01:38:26,614
I wanted you to.
I swear to God.

1183
01:38:26,692 --> 01:38:30,647
I wanted you to see it so bad.
I mean, that's why we're here.

1184
01:38:30,726 --> 01:38:33,283
I'm not some killer, Annie.
I'm not.

1185
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:36,621
You don't-- I mean, do you know
what it was like with her ?

1186
01:38:36,692 --> 01:38:40,351
She was so fucking hurtful
and spiteful and all of it--

1187
01:38:40,425 --> 01:38:42,015
Wayne, I'm not gonna--

1188
01:38:42,092 --> 01:38:44,786
But all of it just happened
in this flash of a moment.

1189
01:38:44,859 --> 01:38:48,313
- Wayne, I--
- Listen to me. I'm a good man.

1190
01:38:48,392 --> 01:38:51,653
If it had been you instead of her,
none of this would have happened.

1191
01:38:51,725 --> 01:38:53,885
Wayne.

1192
01:38:56,792 --> 01:38:58,723
It's all right, you know ?

1193
01:38:58,791 --> 01:39:02,019
I won't-- I won't tell.

1194
01:39:05,125 --> 01:39:08,250
I-I-I won't--
I won't tell anybody.

1195
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:11,982
No, Annie--

1196
01:40:25,559 --> 01:40:27,888
You all right, Mrs. Wilson ?

1197
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:20,618
I thought you were supposed to
be in the hospital.

1198
01:41:20,686 --> 01:41:24,448
I escaped, Mrs. Wilson.

1199
01:41:24,519 --> 01:41:26,917
I'm free.

1200
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:31,252
Buddy, I'm so sorry
I wasn't there for you.

1201
01:41:32,953 --> 01:41:35,975
- I should've--
- Now, don't you say another word.

1202
01:41:39,186 --> 01:41:42,913
You was the only one
that was a friend to me.

1203
01:41:44,419 --> 01:41:46,351
And I love you.

1204
01:41:49,853 --> 01:41:53,478
You're the soul
of this town, Mrs. Wilson.

1205
01:41:53,552 --> 01:41:57,712
And you just need to keep doing
what you're doing.

1206
01:42:13,018 --> 01:42:14,951
I washed it.

1207
01:42:30,185 --> 01:42:32,583
Will you come back
into town with me ?

1208
01:42:32,652 --> 01:42:34,584
Yeah.

1209
01:42:50,419 --> 01:42:53,749
You know you're
gonna have to go back.

1210
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:58,143
Yes, ma'am, I know.

1211
01:43:31,085 --> 01:43:33,017
Can I have your keys,
ma'am ?

1212
01:43:55,652 --> 01:43:56,743
Well,

1213
01:43:56,953 --> 01:44:00,180
I just talked to Wayne.

1214
01:44:00,252 --> 01:44:03,241
He pretty much admitted
to everything.

1215
01:44:03,319 --> 01:44:07,684
I've known that boy
half my life.

1216
01:44:11,352 --> 01:44:14,284
It just goes to show,
you can know somebody and...

1217
01:44:18,018 --> 01:44:19,950
not know 'em.

1218
01:44:22,586 --> 01:44:25,983
How's his, um--
How's his head ?

1219
01:44:26,052 --> 01:44:28,177
Well, you put
a pretty good dent in it.

1220
01:44:28,252 --> 01:44:31,151
Oh, no, Sheriff,
I told, uh--

1221
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:33,412
I told the deputy
it wasn't me who did that.

1222
01:44:33,486 --> 01:44:36,543
It was, um--
It was Buddy Cole. He saved me.

1223
01:44:36,619 --> 01:44:39,641
- No, ma'am. It weren't Buddy.
- Well, yes, it was.

1224
01:44:39,718 --> 01:44:43,242
- Why don't you just ask Wayne ?
- I did.

1225
01:44:43,319 --> 01:44:45,648
He don't remember
what happened.

1226
01:44:45,718 --> 01:44:47,980
Head injuries is funny.

1227
01:44:48,052 --> 01:44:53,178
-I'm telling you, it was Buddy Cole.
-What I'm tryin' to say is,

1228
01:44:53,252 --> 01:44:55,581
it couldn't have been Buddy.

1229
01:44:55,651 --> 01:44:58,117
I-- I just called up
at the State Hospital.

1230
01:44:58,185 --> 01:45:01,481
- He told me he escaped.
- Ma 'am.

1231
01:45:03,452 --> 01:45:05,576
Buddy Cole is dead.

1232
01:45:08,019 --> 01:45:10,541
He hanged himself
in the shower room...

1233
01:45:12,152 --> 01:45:14,084
6:00 this evening.

1234
