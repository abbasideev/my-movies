1
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:20,390
- Lights up!
- Beginners, please!

2
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:22,631
- Your five-minute call, sir.
- Places.

3
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:25,099
Places. Everyone to their places.

4
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:26,668
Sh. Quiet, everyone.

5
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:29,160
Opening nights?
I love opening nights.

6
00:00:30,673 --> 00:00:33,198
- How are you? Good to see you.
- Good evening, Charles.

7
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,768
- Sir Herbert, how are you?
- This is my wife.

8
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:36,941
- Oh, Lady Herbert.
- How do you do?

9
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:37,737
May I give you a peck?

10
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:39,681
One of Mr Barrie's finest?

11
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:41,513
Oh, that genius Scotsman
has done it again.

12
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:43,914
It's the best thing I've produced
in 25 years.

13
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:46,712
I already have investors interested
back home in New York.

14
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,352
See you on Broadway!

15
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:06,971
First positions, people.

16
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:10,907
Standing by, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

17
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:13,462
If you could take
your opening positions, please.

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,572
Beginners, please take
your opening positions.

19
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:24,992
Audience are coming in. Standing by.

20
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:29,860
- Good audience.
- Sorry?

21
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:31,600
Good audience tonight.

22
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:33,933
OK. That's great, thank you.
How much longer?

23
00:01:34,103 --> 00:01:36,298
Um, ten minutes, sir.

24
00:01:38,107 --> 00:01:40,940
I love opening nights.

25
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,510
I want to dance with your wife
at the after-party.

26
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:45,471
- Oh, my goodness.
- Good evening, Mr Frohman.

27
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:47,032
- How are you, John?
- Very well.

28
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:49,831
It's the best thing
that I've produced in 25 years.

29
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:52,087
- Hello, George. How are you?
- Healthy and wealthy, I see.

30
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:54,112
You've rearranged a holiday
for me and I won't forget it.

31
00:01:54,123 --> 00:01:55,590
- For you, Charles, anything.
- You won't regret it.

32
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,614
I'm sure.

33
00:01:56,842 --> 00:01:59,709
- Have you got the tickets?
- They're in my pocket.

34
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:03,626
- There's Mrs Barrie.
- Oh, Mr and Mrs Snow.

35
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:08,233
We were so hoping to speak
with your husband before the show.

36
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:11,895
- Have you seen him?
- I'm not sure where he is, actually.

37
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:34,329
We do miss seeing you on stage.
You were so wonderful.

38
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,461
Yes, well, it's been some time now.
Are you right to find your seat?

39
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:41,836
Oh, yes, yes.

40
00:02:41,837 --> 00:02:44,931
See you at the party, then.

41
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:46,490
Excuse me. Could you find Mr Barrie

42
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:49,736
and remind him that they're doing his play
this evening.

43
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:52,512
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

44
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:14,496
Let's close the doors.

45
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:58,323
Really, I mustn't
inconvenience you in this way.

46
00:03:58,664 --> 00:04:00,598
I can wait quite well in the shop.

47
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:05,194
'Tis no inconvenience.
The shop is chilly. And there is a fire here.

48
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:06,570
Really, you are uncommonly good.

49
00:04:06,672 --> 00:04:09,163
Sorry, sir.

50
00:04:09,175 --> 00:04:12,338
Mrs Barrie wanted me to remind you
that the play's begun.

51
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:15,761
- Though I imagine you know that.
- They hate it.

52
00:04:15,762 --> 00:04:18,844
- Sir?
- It's like a dentist's office out there. Why?

53
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:25,055
- I wouldn't say they hate it, sir.
- What do you think? Do you like it?

54
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:28,626
- I've just been hired here, sir.
- Yes or no? I'm not bothered.

55
00:04:28,627 --> 00:04:32,062
- I'm not really qualified to...
- Do you like it? Is it crap?

56
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:34,496
- Crap, sir?
- Go on, say it. Just say it.

57
00:04:34,497 --> 00:04:36,168
It's shite, isn't it? Go on. Say it.

58
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:39,171
- Don't know if I'm...
- "It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie." Go on, say it.

59
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:40,729
- It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie.
- I knew it.

60
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:44,973
- No, I haven't even seen it.
- I knew it. Thank you.

61
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:47,201
Thank you very much.

62
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:53,173
Might I knock a tune, milord,
for a moment?

63
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:58,520
I'm an old man...

64
00:04:59,058 --> 00:05:00,787
..and I've seen few of the sights.

65
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:20,618
Absolute rubbish from start to finish.

66
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:22,497
Yes, I found it fearfully dull.

67
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:24,432
Say goodbye to your investment, old boy.

68
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,934
Good to see you. My apologies.

69
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:28,503
We'll get them with the next one,
Charles, I promise.

70
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:31,940
- Of course we will, James.
- I know you put a lot into this one.

71
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:35,966
A fortune, James, but I am fortunate
because I can afford to lose a fortune.

72
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:38,639
- Can you?
- No, I can't. How are you?

73
00:05:39,315 --> 00:05:41,249
- Arthur.
- James.

74
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:43,114
You were sorely missed
at the last club meeting.

75
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,308
Was I?

76
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,404
We were beginning to wonder
which is your hobby, writing or cricket.

77
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:50,174
You wanted to speak with Mr Barrie,
didn't you?

78
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:53,302
Oh yes, but we shouldn't interrupt them,
should we?

79
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:55,338
I don't see why not.

80
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:58,879
If you ask me, the problem
lies in our batting order.

81
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,635
- James.
- Hello, darling.

82
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,432
You remember Mr and Mrs Snow,
don't you?

83
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:04,434
- Mrs Snow.
- Mr Barrie.

84
00:06:04,435 --> 00:06:05,655
Mr Snow.

85
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:08,616
The Snows have been waiting
to meet with you all evening.

86
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:10,941
- Oh, yes.
- Is that right?

87
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:16,796
Your play this evening,
it was remarkable, wasn't it?

88
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:19,495
Was it?

89
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:25,343
Well, thank you. That's very kind of you.
I'm glad you liked it.

90
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:29,390
How did you feel it went?

91
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:32,325
- I think I can do better.
- Really?

92
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:51,836
- Mary? Hello?
- Yes, James?

93
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:56,740
I'm headed off for the park if you'd
like to join me. It's a beautiful morning.

94
00:06:56,842 --> 00:06:59,276
You'll be working, won't you?

95
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:02,644
Perhaps, yes.

96
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:05,646
I'll let you to your work then.

97
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:16,491
- Morning, Mr Barrie.
- Morning, Emma.

98
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:21,222
- Have a good day, sir.
- And you.

99
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:26,163
That's it. Go on, boy. Go get it, boy.

100
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,066
That's right. Good boy. Grab it. Good.

101
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:04,065
Who do you belong to?
Come on, boy. Come on.

102
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:11,789
Excuse me, sir,
you're standing on my sleeve.

103
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,526
Am I? So sorry.

104
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:17,866
I might point out
you're lying under my bench.

105
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:20,174
I have to, I'm afraid.

106
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:24,669
I've been put in a dungeon
by the evil Prince George.

107
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,981
I'm sorry if it bothers you.

108
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:31,179
Well, if you're trapped in the dungeon,
there isn't much to be done now, is there?

109
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,068
Perhaps I could slide a key to you
through the bars.

110
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:39,056
I wouldn't risk it, sir. The evil
Prince George has tortured many men.

111
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:40,945
I'm sorry. Is he bothering you, sir?

112
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:45,349
My brother can be
an extremely irritating sort of person.

113
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,327
Aha, Prince George, I gather.

114
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:52,018
I understand you are the horrible tyrant
who imprisoned this unfortunate wretch.

115
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,935
I'm not horrible really, but
a firm ruler, yes. Kind and tolerant.

116
00:08:56,345 --> 00:08:59,508
And what precisely is...
What did you say your name was?

117
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:02,449
- Michael.
- What precisely is Michael's crime?

118
00:09:02,468 --> 00:09:05,403
- He's my younger brother.
- Ah.

119
00:09:05,604 --> 00:09:10,769
- Fair enough. Sorry, lad. Cannot free you.
- That's all right.

120
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,808
- Do you mind us playing with your dog?
- No. Go on.

121
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:17,055
This is Jack, second in line to the throne
and that one's Michael. He's only five.

122
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:20,451
And I'm in prison for it.

123
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:24,889
- I'm so sorry. Are my boys bothering you?
- We're not bothering him, Mum.

124
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,855
Michael, darling,
come out from under there.

125
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:28,786
I can't. I'm in prison.

126
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:31,353
Oh, I see.

127
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:33,548
JM Barrie. Pleased to meet you.

128
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:37,178
JM Barrie, the author? A pleasure.
Sylvia Llewelyn Davies.

129
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:39,013
- Are you a writer?
- I am.

130
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:42,368
He's a playwright, Jack.
Quite a famous one, at that.

131
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:44,688
- I apologize. I imagine you're writing.
- No. Not at all.

132
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,196
- Where's Peter?
- What have you written, Mr Barrie?

133
00:09:48,263 --> 00:09:54,964
Well, currently, I make my living
entertaining princes and their courts

134
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:57,481
with my trained bear, Porthos.

135
00:09:57,823 --> 00:09:59,323
If you command your brother,
Peter, to join us,

136
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:02,725
I am willing, Prince George,
to give you just such a performance

137
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:06,043
in exchange for the freedom
of this prisoner, of course.

138
00:10:06,044 --> 00:10:07,716
- Very well.
- Very well.

139
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,168
Now...

140
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:14,538
I want you to pay particular attention
to the teeth.

141
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:22,177
Some unscrupulous trainers will show you
a bear whose teeth have all been pulled,

142
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:26,818
while other cowards
will force the brute into a muzzle.

143
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:33,087
Only the true master would attempt these
tricks without either measure of safety.

144
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:38,560
- What did you bring me over here for?
- Peter.

145
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:41,499
This is absurd. It's just a dog.

146
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:45,996
Come on, darling.

147
00:10:46,288 --> 00:10:50,208
"Just a dog"? "Just"?

148
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:52,370
Porthos, don't listen to him.

149
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:54,341
Porthos dreams of being a bear

150
00:10:54,413 --> 00:10:59,146
and you want to dash those dreams
by saying he's "just a dog"?

151
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:01,325
What a horrible, candle-snuffing word.

152
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:05,602
That's like saying, "He can't climb
that mountain, he's just a man."

153
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:10,301
Or, "That's not a diamond, it's just a rock."

154
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,739
"Just."

155
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:20,883
Fine then. Turn him into a bear. If you can.

156
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,690
Peter, where are your manners?

157
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:27,628
With those eyes, my bonny lad,
I'm afraid you'd never see it.

158
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:33,416
However, with just a wee bit of imagination,

159
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:37,582
I can turn around right now and see...

160
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,651
the great bear, Porthos.

161
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:43,239
Dance with me.

162
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:48,809
Thank you. I don't think I've ever seen
a performance quite like it.

163
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:52,938
We're here every day, and the bear
is always more than happy to perform.

164
00:12:53,031 --> 00:12:55,158
Well, perhaps we'll see you here
tomorrow then.

165
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,431
Perhaps.

166
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:00,502
- Peter, jump up please, darling. Quick.
- Bye.

167
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:02,837
Bye.

168
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:06,361
- Peter, didn't you enjoy that?
- I've seen better.

169
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:09,443
Well, Michael wanted the bear
kept prisoner with him,

170
00:13:09,444 --> 00:13:12,509
and Peter insisted
that Michael was hardly a prisoner

171
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:15,535
and Porthos simply wasn't a bear at all.

172
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:19,767
I do very much hope to see them tomorrow.

173
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:23,385
- What's her name?
- Sylvia. Um...

174
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:27,264
Mrs... something Davies.

175
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,597
Llewelyn Davies?

176
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:34,999
- You know her?
- I know who she is, of course.

177
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:37,658
Why, she's a du Maurier,
for heaven's sake.

178
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:43,996
Her father was the artist.
Her brother's the actor.

179
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:49,069
And there was something... tragic
that happened with her husband.

180
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:52,155
Oh, yes. He died.

181
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:55,742
Cancer of the jaw, I believe.

182
00:13:55,743 --> 00:13:57,403
That's horrible.

183
00:13:57,846 --> 00:14:03,876
Yes. Apparently, he left her with four boys
and no income to speak of.

184
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:08,152
If it wasn't for her mother's help...

185
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,658
James.

186
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:20,096
- We should have them to dinner.
- Should we?

187
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:24,703
Absolutely. I've always wanted
to meet Madam du Maurier.

188
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:29,037
Why, she knows practically
everyone there is worth knowing.

189
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,020
- What are you writing about?
- Oh.

190
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:48,659
Nothing of any great consequence.

191
00:14:49,865 --> 00:14:52,459
I can't write.

192
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:55,496
Have you ever kept a journal?

193
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:59,431
Ever tried your hand at writing a play?

194
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,536
Well, then how do you know?

195
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:06,814
I know. That's all.

196
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:11,319
I see. Where's your mother today
and the rest of the boys?

197
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:15,322
Home. Mother's got a bit of a chest cold.

198
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:21,923
I'm sure everyone would be happy
to see you though. One afternoon.

199
00:15:24,483 --> 00:15:26,747
I should leave you to your writing.

200
00:15:30,822 --> 00:15:33,324
Peter.

201
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,623
I'll see you later then.

202
00:15:45,203 --> 00:15:48,743
Why didn't you tell me, Charles?
You knew it wasn't any good.

203
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:52,283
Why didn't you tell me. James?
You knew it wasn't any good. Hm?

204
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:56,958
I took an extended lease on the theater,
keeping the actors on.

205
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:01,201
- I don't have another play.
- I'm sure you will.

206
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:05,932
- Won't you?
- We'll see.

207
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:08,970
I need you to sign for the storage,
Mr Frohman.

208
00:16:09,811 --> 00:16:13,872
- Lower.
- Easy does it. Take your time.

209
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:23,052
It was never meant to be taken seriously.

210
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:26,920
You know what happened, James?
They changed it.

211
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:31,822
- They changed what?
- The critics.

212
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:35,962
They made it important.

213
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:42,275
Hm?

214
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:44,437
What's it called?

215
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:49,567
What's it called?

216
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:52,286
- "Play."
- "Play."

217
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,396
Bang, bang, bang!

218
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:08,514
Bang!

219
00:17:10,422 --> 00:17:12,756
Return the boy to us, you nasty lnjun.

220
00:17:12,757 --> 00:17:16,124
Our people teach boy lndian ways,
make him great warrior.

221
00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:20,311
Our chief, Running Nose, never let him go.

222
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:22,558
Bang, bang, bang!

223
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:28,436
Me wounded, Peter. Time's short.

224
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:32,948
You go. Spread wings
and soar like eagle above enemy.

225
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:37,290
Fly back to our chief.
Tell her of my brave defeat.

226
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:40,000
That's crazy. Indians can't fly.

227
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:42,036
Of course they can. Go on, go on, go on.

228
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:44,699
Listen to us, boy.
This lnjun kidnapped you.

229
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:49,210
Not true. We kidnap no one. You lost boy.

230
00:17:49,211 --> 00:17:54,012
I teach you ways of the brave.
I take you as my own son.

231
00:17:54,332 --> 00:17:56,800
You are not my father.

232
00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:00,764
Bang, bang, bang, bang!

233
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:02,568
- I've got him!
- Let me go!

234
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:05,041
- Stop it, you two.
- Ooh, we are awful, aren't we?

235
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,224
- I'm warning you.
- Oh, I'm scared.

236
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:09,090
Of course, you had a bit of fun
for a change.

237
00:18:09,347 --> 00:18:11,941
- Stop it, you two. Get off!
- Don't.

238
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:13,963
- Jack!
- Stop it!

239
00:18:13,985 --> 00:18:17,079
- Get off, George!
- Peter.

240
00:18:19,658 --> 00:18:23,492
- I'm terribly sorry.
- No, it wasn't your fault.

241
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:25,375
I'm afraid it might have been.

242
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,482
To be honest, I'm just happy you got him
to join in the game.

243
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:32,075
Oh, yes, I was a tremendous success.

244
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:35,887
Mr Barrie, it's more
than I've been able to achieve.

245
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:39,891
Peter's a different boy
since his father died.

246
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:43,894
You know, I don't think
he's even had a good cry about it.

247
00:18:43,895 --> 00:18:47,694
Well, grief affects us all
in different ways, doesn't it?

248
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:49,229
Yes, it does.

249
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:55,804
Oh, by the way, my wife would like
to invite you and the boys over to dinner.

250
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,988
Your mother as well.

251
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:00,914
Oh.

252
00:19:00,982 --> 00:19:04,782
How kind. That would be lovely.

253
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:08,565
Well...

254
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,792
Don't you all look
lovely in your little suits?

255
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:17,629
And, Mrs du Maurier, what a shame it is
that we've not met until this evening.

256
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,633
How kind of you to say so.

257
00:19:19,634 --> 00:19:24,162
Not at all. I can't tell you how many times
I've been to a charity or a social event

258
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,973
and seen your name listed
among the organizers.

259
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:35,048
It's the very thing I would love to do myself

260
00:19:35,317 --> 00:19:38,402
if I could just find the time.

261
00:19:38,403 --> 00:19:42,305
My problem is in finding the time
to do everything else.

262
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:45,409
At the moment I am running
two households.

263
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,742
Sylvia believes she can get by
without a housekeeper.

264
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:48,939
Mother.

265
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,911
My house is quite large enough for us all,

266
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:55,147
- but the idea of living with me seems...
- Not now, please, mother.

267
00:19:55,587 --> 00:19:58,522
- We help her keep the house in order.
- Don't interrupt, George.

268
00:19:58,523 --> 00:20:02,126
- Where did you get your manners?
- Sorry, Grandmother.

269
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:07,588
Mr Barrie, I understand you've become
playmates of my grandchildren.

270
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:12,669
- Oh, they indulge me, really.
- On the contrary.

271
00:20:12,771 --> 00:20:17,834
The other day we took to an exploration
of darkest Africa in our garden.

272
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:23,513
But Mr Barrie was taken ill
by the bite of a... What was it?

273
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,981
Tsetse fly. Quite horrible.

274
00:20:26,151 --> 00:20:28,676
Yes, and he swelled to the size
of a hippopotamus.

275
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,086
Fingers like sausages.

276
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:33,613
And we had to float in him down the river
like he was a great bloated raft.

277
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,492
But the fishing was good, wasn't it?

278
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,100
James.

279
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:47,919
Please.

280
00:20:47,922 --> 00:20:50,641
- Bye.
- Thank you so much.

281
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:52,371
- Lovely evening.
- Thank you. Bye.

282
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:56,205
- Good night.
- Good night.

283
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:03,143
Well, that was a disaster.

284
00:21:03,655 --> 00:21:08,592
Painful.
Utterly painful to see.

285
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,492
I don't know what you mean.
I had a lovely time.

286
00:21:11,613 --> 00:21:13,697
Oh, James, please.

287
00:21:13,698 --> 00:21:18,032
"My problem is in finding
the time to do everything else."

288
00:21:18,203 --> 00:21:22,765
- I never felt so judged in my life.
- Judged? How do you mean?

289
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:25,073
A grown man, for heaven's sake,

290
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,008
playing all day long with children?

291
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,789
In any case, I hardly think they'll be
the social contact we'd hoped for.

292
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,199
I hadn't really thought of them that way.
I just enjoy their company.

293
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:40,703
He's been a good friend to us, Mother.

294
00:21:40,704 --> 00:21:44,468
Yes. But what does that mean? Hm?

295
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:45,446
Surely you don't intend...

296
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,940
..to keep spending your afternoons
with those children, do you?

297
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:56,616
And so today, ladies and gentlemen,

298
00:21:58,209 --> 00:22:00,643
using only the wind
and his own physical strength,

299
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:04,253
George Llewelyn Davies shall test
the very limits of the atmosphere

300
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:06,667
using his tethered craft. Go on, boy.

301
00:22:06,668 --> 00:22:09,330
- Go on, George.
- You're going to break it, George.

302
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:11,647
- George, stop!
- I just need a bit more speed.

303
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:13,504
I want to do it.

304
00:22:13,808 --> 00:22:16,436
Hold off a bit, George.
I think it's in need of a tail.

305
00:22:16,437 --> 00:22:18,422
Oh, wait.

306
00:22:20,014 --> 00:22:22,078
- Here. James, this will do.
- That's a good idea.

307
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,143
- No, it's not heavy enough.
- I want to do it.

308
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:28,152
- You coming, Peter?
- Porthos!

309
00:22:28,323 --> 00:22:30,382
It'll work this time.

310
00:22:30,408 --> 00:22:33,343
Porthos, give us your bell. That's good.

311
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:34,528
- Michael?
- Yeah?

312
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:38,021
- Now, would you like to give it a go?
- Yes, please.

313
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:41,468
- Oh, he can't run fast enough.
- Of course he can.

314
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:44,361
- Let him try, Jack.
- Now, George, you hold the kite.

315
00:22:44,422 --> 00:22:45,422
George.

316
00:22:45,423 --> 00:22:49,325
Come on, boys, let's go back up to the top.
Come on, Peter.

317
00:22:49,677 --> 00:22:54,705
Right, George, hold it up. Darling,
you've got to run now. Ready? Ready?

318
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:57,701
- Run! Run, Michael!
- Run!

319
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:02,365
- Oh, I told you this wasn't going to work.
- I don't think he's fast enough.

320
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,340
It's not going to work
if no one believes in him.

321
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:06,842
- Now, give him a chance.
- Michael, go back to your starting position.

322
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,302
- Come on, darling, try again.
- George, you take the kite.

323
00:23:09,397 --> 00:23:15,461
Now this time, I don't want a flea's breath
of doubt. We must get that kite in the air.

324
00:23:15,904 --> 00:23:18,737
Right. Look, I think I feel a bit
more breeze. Are you ready, Michael?

325
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,782
- You can do it, Michael.
- You've got to run. Run, Michael, run.

326
00:23:21,783 --> 00:23:23,704
- Run!
- That's it!

327
00:23:24,212 --> 00:23:27,714
Yes! He did it!

328
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:30,946
Keep running! Keep running!

329
00:24:00,582 --> 00:24:02,982
What are you writing about now?

330
00:24:03,084 --> 00:24:05,245
Oh, just making notes.

331
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:09,739
I'm never really certain what they're about
until I've read them over later.

332
00:24:10,425 --> 00:24:12,620
Something about the kite?

333
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:17,739
Now, why do you ask that?

334
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:21,402
I don't know.

335
00:24:21,436 --> 00:24:26,373
If I were a writer I think I could tell
a whole story about flying the kite today.

336
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:31,235
Perhaps you should then. That's
a fantastic idea. Why not give it a try?

337
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:35,946
I hope you haven't been talking about
anything too serious with this one.

338
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:40,276
No. Talking a bit of silliness really.

339
00:24:48,997 --> 00:24:50,965
Can we have him for supper?

340
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:53,331
Have him to stay for supper, Michael.
We're not cannibals.

341
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:54,900
You are welcome, you know.

342
00:24:57,505 --> 00:25:00,019
Sylvia. Mr Barrie.

343
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,533
Where have you been?

344
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,523
Flying a kite, Mother,
and having a wonderful time.

345
00:25:04,762 --> 00:25:06,559
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were coming this evening.

346
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:09,816
No? Well, apparently you forgot then.

347
00:25:09,817 --> 00:25:12,911
- I brought some supper along for us all.
- You didn't need to do that.

348
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:15,455
Well, there's no food in the house, is there?

349
00:25:15,523 --> 00:25:17,650
Really. You don't need to wait
till the cupboard is bare.

350
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:19,610
Please, Mother. Come on, darlings.

351
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:22,774
Wipe feet. There's been
enough tracking round here.

352
00:25:23,114 --> 00:25:26,311
George, I thought you said you were going
to help your mother take care of the house.

353
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:28,483
Coat, Michael, please. Yes.

354
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,605
- And... coat hanger. Good.
- Will we see you tomorrow?

355
00:25:32,606 --> 00:25:36,291
No. You're going to be helping
round the house tomorrow.

356
00:25:36,461 --> 00:25:39,123
Mother, there is absolutely no need for this.

357
00:25:39,347 --> 00:25:41,747
You can't do everything yourself.

358
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:47,200
Look at you. You're horribly flush.
You're wearing yourself out.

359
00:25:47,201 --> 00:25:50,533
Thank you for a lovely day, James.
Excuse me, Mother.

360
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:56,714
So from tomorrow, we're going to have
some discipline around here.

361
00:25:56,715 --> 00:26:01,316
And not one of you will escape.

362
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,105
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.
- Good evening, Sarah.

363
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:12,290
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.
- Good evening, Emma.

364
00:26:20,338 --> 00:26:22,397
You missed supper.

365
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:27,175
Perhaps I'll have something later.
I have a bit of writing I wanted to do.

366
00:26:27,176 --> 00:26:31,312
Are you sure? It was a lovely meal. Duck.

367
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:35,332
Sarah let Emma cook this evening.

368
00:26:35,436 --> 00:26:39,805
Is that right? Listen, what would you think
of loaning Emma out to the Davies

369
00:26:39,941 --> 00:26:41,441
for the occasional evening?

370
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:43,842
They don't actually have a cook.

371
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:48,180
I take it Mrs Davies enjoyed the meal
that she had here?

372
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:54,764
I imagine she could use an extra hand
now and again. That's all.

373
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:57,505
That's very charitable of you.

374
00:26:58,593 --> 00:27:01,687
Perhaps we can send over
some of the silver as well.

375
00:27:02,096 --> 00:27:04,097
And what about linen?

376
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:07,033
I wouldn't be surprised if some of hers
was looking a bit shabby.

377
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:09,402
Please, Mary, stop.

378
00:27:10,438 --> 00:27:14,602
Maybe she can send over
some of the things we've run short on.

379
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:17,275
My husband, for example.

380
00:27:18,196 --> 00:27:21,427
We rarely see him in this house.

381
00:27:21,699 --> 00:27:24,429
That hasn't seemed to bother you
for some time now.

382
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:15,348
Lords and ladies, His Royal Highness,
King Michael the Benevolent,

383
00:28:15,349 --> 00:28:17,838
protector of the realm.

384
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,740
That scepter's made of wood.

385
00:28:20,842 --> 00:28:23,902
Yes, well, we dream on a budget here,
don't we?

386
00:28:24,345 --> 00:28:29,510
No, I mean, everyone thinks it's made
of gold, but it's just an old hunk of wood.

387
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:31,818
The means to an end, Peter.

388
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,762
What we've done is taken
an old hunk of wood

389
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:40,039
and transformed it for all the world to see
into the most magnificent gold.

390
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:44,790
- There you go.
- What's this?

391
00:28:44,816 --> 00:28:50,413
All great writers begin with a good
leather binding and a respectable title.

392
00:28:50,905 --> 00:28:53,169
Open it.

393
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,201
"The Boy Castaways."

394
00:28:58,212 --> 00:29:02,740
"Being a record of the terrible adventures
of the brothers Davies,

395
00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:07,721
faithfully set forth by...
Peter Llewelyn Davies."

396
00:29:07,722 --> 00:29:10,714
Kipling would swallow his own ear
for a title like that.

397
00:29:10,808 --> 00:29:13,777
Stab him, George. You can do it.

398
00:29:14,262 --> 00:29:16,856
I still have no idea what to write.

399
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:19,708
Write about anything.
Write about your family.

400
00:29:19,851 --> 00:29:22,649
- Write about the talking whale.
- What whale?

401
00:29:22,737 --> 00:29:28,801
The one that's trapped in your imagination
and desperate to get out. Come sit down.

402
00:29:31,996 --> 00:29:35,955
I have actually begun writing about the
adventures of the Davies brothers myself.

403
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,265
- A play?
- A play indeed, yes.

404
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:41,994
And I would be extremely honored

405
00:29:42,006 --> 00:29:46,443
if you would allow me the use of your name
for one of the characters.

406
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,274
I don't know what to say.

407
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:51,106
Say yes.

408
00:29:53,017 --> 00:29:54,017
Good man.

409
00:29:54,018 --> 00:29:56,111
Porthos! That's mine. Let go.

410
00:29:56,354 --> 00:29:59,222
I won't go to bed. I won't, I won't.

411
00:29:59,223 --> 00:30:04,126
You should have been in bed
half an hour ago, young man.

412
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:07,373
I'm afraid I've grown hopelessly lax
in my discipline.

413
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:10,717
Nonsense. Young boys
should never be sent to bed.

414
00:30:10,785 --> 00:30:13,845
They always wake up a day older.

415
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:18,080
And then, before you know it,
they're grown.

416
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,126
Their father would have been horrified.

417
00:30:20,127 --> 00:30:22,322
Of course, he never would have allowed
a dog in the house either.

418
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,877
He'd have tied him up in the yard.

419
00:30:25,878 --> 00:30:29,125
Right! Last one in bed's a hairy toad.

420
00:31:19,053 --> 00:31:22,181
You mean a lot to my boys, you know.

421
00:31:23,641 --> 00:31:26,474
Especially Peter.

422
00:31:27,228 --> 00:31:31,255
It seems to me
that Peter's trying to grow up too fast.

423
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,832
I imagine he thinks that grown-ups don't
hurt as deeply as children do when they...

424
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:41,300
when they lose someone.

425
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:49,121
I lost my elder brother, David,
when I was just Peter's age.

426
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:52,158
And it nearly destroyed my mother.

427
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,662
James, I'm so sorry.

428
00:31:56,674 --> 00:32:00,576
Your poor mother.
I can't imagine losing a child.

429
00:32:00,678 --> 00:32:02,703
Aye.

430
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:06,047
She didn't get out of bed for months.

431
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,784
She wouldn't eat.

432
00:32:08,936 --> 00:32:12,167
I tried everything to make her happy, but...

433
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:15,841
she only wanted David.

434
00:32:15,943 --> 00:32:17,570
So...

435
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:19,788
one day...

436
00:32:20,781 --> 00:32:23,875
I dressed myself in David's clothing

437
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:28,671
and I went to her.

438
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:31,869
You must have frightened her to death.

439
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:37,861
I think it was the first time
she ever actually... looked at me.

440
00:32:42,436 --> 00:32:45,530
And that was the end of the boy James.

441
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:50,926
I used to say to myself
he'd gone to Neverland.

442
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,946
Where?

443
00:32:52,947 --> 00:32:56,542
Neverland. It's a wonderful place.

444
00:33:06,494 --> 00:33:09,861
I've not spoken about this before
to anyone.

445
00:33:10,498 --> 00:33:12,398
Ever.

446
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:26,268
What's it like... Neverland?

447
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:31,868
One day I'll take you there.

448
00:33:33,404 --> 00:33:35,099
Wait a minute, James.
He's a fairy?

449
00:33:35,406 --> 00:33:39,103
Er, no. He's the irrepressible
spirit of youth. Tinker Bell is the fairy.

450
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:42,208
- Tinker Bell is a woman?
- She's not a woman. She's a fairy.

451
00:33:42,413 --> 00:33:45,405
He is a boy who stays young forever.

452
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:47,748
James, how does anyone
stay young forever? It doesn't work.

453
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:50,614
He just believes, Charles.
He imagines life the way he wants it to be,

454
00:33:50,921 --> 00:33:56,052
and he believes in it long enough and hard
enough that it all appears before him, see?

455
00:33:56,053 --> 00:33:58,622
James, I'm your friend.
You're coming off a flop.

456
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:03,229
- You have a man who is a fairy.
- No, a boy who has a fairy.

457
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,881
And this girl calls herself Tinker.

458
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:09,079
And you have a pirate ship on stage
surrounded by tons and tons of water.

459
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,057
- That's a lot of water.
- It's a lot of water.

460
00:34:11,058 --> 00:34:14,858
- Yes, and that's a lot of money.
- It is, but we can fake the water.

461
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:17,860
Oh, well, if we can fake the water
then I'm sure your play will be a hit.

462
00:34:18,065 --> 00:34:21,432
You know what I think I'll do? I think
I'll imagine life the way I want it to be...

463
00:34:21,569 --> 00:34:22,433
Long enough and hard enough?

464
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:26,973
Yes, and then the money for the play
will appear magically before me.

465
00:34:27,074 --> 00:34:28,837
- That's right. That's it.
- Yes.

466
00:34:29,076 --> 00:34:31,977
How does the clock wind up
inside the crocodile?

467
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,240
- He swallows it.
- Ah, of course he does.

468
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:37,891
Out!

469
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:41,638
How was he?

470
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,630
- Well done.
- Good show!

471
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:47,921
I finally get the courage
to invite the boys to a game

472
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:50,891
and we have to suffer
this grave humiliation.

473
00:34:51,098 --> 00:34:52,815
It's perfect actually.

474
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:55,046
Spend a good deal of time with them,
don't you?

475
00:34:55,319 --> 00:34:57,617
Every moment I can spare, in fact.

476
00:34:57,821 --> 00:34:59,948
I'm glad for you.

477
00:35:00,324 --> 00:35:03,851
And Mrs Davies seems to be
having a good time of it as well.

478
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:08,473
You should be aware though, James,
what some people have been saying.

479
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:12,632
Mind you, I wouldn't bring it up
if I thought the rumors would pass.

480
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:15,703
I'm not surprised. What are they saying?

481
00:35:17,424 --> 00:35:18,925
Very well.

482
00:35:18,926 --> 00:35:22,384
That you spend much more time with Mrs
Davies than you do with your own wife.

483
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:25,125
She's a widow. And...

484
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:28,731
And a friend. That's it. Nothing more.

485
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,753
There have also been questions about
how you spend your time with those boys.

486
00:35:34,942 --> 00:35:37,035
And why.

487
00:35:37,895 --> 00:35:42,195
That's outrageous. How could anyone
think something so evil?

488
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:46,893
They're children.
They're innocent children.

489
00:35:48,072 --> 00:35:50,348
You find a glimmer of happiness
in this world,

490
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:52,625
there's always someone
who wants to destroy it.

491
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:59,031
No. Thank you, Arthur, but I don't think
many will give credence to such nonsense.

492
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:01,691
Then why is no one sitting with them?

493
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,666
Once you get a bit of notoriety, James,

494
00:36:06,056 --> 00:36:12,017
people watch you and they will
look for ways to drag you down.

495
00:36:15,566 --> 00:36:18,364
Are you sure your wife doesn't
object to us taking over your cottage

496
00:36:18,365 --> 00:36:19,517
for the summer, James?

497
00:36:19,653 --> 00:36:21,951
- She doesn't go there anymore.
- Really?

498
00:36:22,072 --> 00:36:24,836
It's such a relief to get away.
You'll come and visit, I hope?

499
00:36:25,075 --> 00:36:27,839
- Of course. Are we in?
- Everyone in?

500
00:36:28,078 --> 00:36:30,945
- Can I drive, Uncle Jim?
- Er, no.

501
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,205
Out of the way
or I'll make haggis out of you.

502
00:36:48,682 --> 00:36:50,741
Get the sheep out the way.

503
00:37:08,068 --> 00:37:11,799
- Are we there yet?
- Almost. Almost there.

504
00:37:12,072 --> 00:37:15,098
I can see the cottage!

505
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:35,885
- Shall we explore, Michael?
- Don't tear your clothes, please.

506
00:37:35,896 --> 00:37:38,922
- Come on. Follow me.
- Be careful of stinging nettles.

507
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,923
Hurry up, everyone.

508
00:37:45,906 --> 00:37:49,535
- Would you like to see the rest of it?
- Mm. Yes.

509
00:38:11,465 --> 00:38:12,965
'Ello!

510
00:38:12,966 --> 00:38:16,532
Thought you could escape
from Captain Swarthy, eh?

511
00:38:16,533 --> 00:38:20,099
Off to the ship with you, then.
Off to the ship, son!

512
00:38:22,476 --> 00:38:26,708
So now you can either choose
to become a pirate with the rest of us,

513
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,676
or we'll toss you to the sharks.

514
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:35,053
- How marvelous.
- Well, maybe the crocodiles, eh?

515
00:38:35,155 --> 00:38:38,613
- No one's escaped, Captain.
- Excellent work, matey.

516
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:39,591
Now then.

517
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,061
Now is your only chance to speak.

518
00:38:43,163 --> 00:38:46,599
Who amongst you is ready
to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea?

519
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:48,999
- I am!
- Not finished yet.

520
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:52,369
To enter upon
the most dangerous chapter

521
00:38:52,506 --> 00:38:55,839
in your young
and soon-to-be-wasted lives?

522
00:38:57,144 --> 00:38:59,145
What did you say? What are doing, son?

523
00:38:59,146 --> 00:39:02,411
Are you giggling? On my ship?
Giggling? What did you say?

524
00:39:02,649 --> 00:39:04,879
- I said I'm ready, Captain.
- What's your name, boy?

525
00:39:05,152 --> 00:39:08,121
I'm Curly, the oldest and wisest of the crew.

526
00:39:08,155 --> 00:39:10,487
Cut him loose, matey.

527
00:39:10,657 --> 00:39:14,855
Welcome aboard, Curly.
Your job will be to mop the deck.

528
00:39:15,662 --> 00:39:17,960
And who be you, young squire?

529
00:39:18,165 --> 00:39:23,535
My name be Nibs the Cut-throat. Feared
by men and greatly desired by the ladies.

530
00:39:23,537 --> 00:39:24,526
Jack!

531
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:28,849
Welcome aboard, Nibs.
You shall polish all wood surfaces.

532
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:31,158
Grab a hold of that rigging.

533
00:39:31,462 --> 00:39:34,659
- And you, lad?
- I'm Peter.

534
00:39:35,048 --> 00:39:39,485
That's not a pirate name.
What about Dastardly Jim, eh?

535
00:39:39,553 --> 00:39:42,004
No. Just Peter.

536
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,456
I like my name.

537
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:47,891
Very well.

538
00:39:48,061 --> 00:39:53,795
In punishment for lack of an interesting
pirate name, Peter shall walk the plank.

539
00:39:53,796 --> 00:39:56,001
Cut him loose.

540
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:20,992
- What are you playing again?
- The boy.

541
00:40:21,094 --> 00:40:22,493
What have you got...? Excuse me.

542
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:25,997
Mr Barrie, sir?

543
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:29,262
There's been a mistake here, sir.
It says here I'm to play the nanny.

544
00:40:29,603 --> 00:40:34,802
- I don't imagine I quite fit that part, eh?
- You're not actually the nanny.

545
00:40:34,803 --> 00:40:36,701
You're a dog.

546
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,111
- What?
- A Newfound land.

547
00:40:39,112 --> 00:40:41,512
We'll put you in a great big fluffy dog suit.

548
00:40:41,615 --> 00:40:44,049
Rrr.

549
00:40:45,118 --> 00:40:47,313
Oh, right.

550
00:40:49,122 --> 00:40:52,683
Actually, we don't have a Tinker Bell cast,
do we? He could play Tinker Bell.

551
00:40:53,176 --> 00:40:57,078
Heavens, no. Tinker Bell's a light.
It moves around the stage.

552
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,649
Just a wee light
that moves around the stage.

553
00:41:02,553 --> 00:41:04,680
Bit worried about this.

554
00:41:05,055 --> 00:41:08,718
Let's see.
We've got John Darling, Michael Darling,

555
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,652
Tiger Lily, Smee, Skylights.

556
00:41:12,062 --> 00:41:16,226
It's a play for puppets.
Tootles, Nibs, Curly.

557
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:19,161
All these names are absurd
when you see them all together.

558
00:41:19,162 --> 00:41:21,264
Captain Hook, S...

559
00:41:22,072 --> 00:41:25,200
Oh, hello, James.

560
00:41:26,577 --> 00:41:28,101
You're out of your mind.

561
00:41:40,591 --> 00:41:42,923
How were rehearsals?

562
00:41:43,093 --> 00:41:48,554
Fine. Great. They're going... quite well.

563
00:41:48,598 --> 00:41:51,965
- Good.
- Yes. Thank you.

564
00:42:30,107 --> 00:42:33,508
- Hello.
- Hello.

565
00:42:34,061 --> 00:42:38,430
- How was your journey?
- It was quite long. I'm exhausted.

566
00:42:38,649 --> 00:42:42,585
- Let's get you some tea.
- That'd be nice. Thanks.

567
00:42:43,654 --> 00:42:48,619
- Can you come to the playhouse?
- In a moment, Michael. He's just arrived.

568
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:53,585
But I said I'd get him. They always
send Peter to do things. I said I'll do it.

569
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,917
- It will spoil the surprise.
- What surprise, darling?

570
00:42:57,918 --> 00:43:02,617
It's a great surprise. We've taken
most of the day preparing for it.

571
00:43:02,973 --> 00:43:07,235
- Everybody's waiting for you.
- Then we mustn't keep them waiting.

572
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:11,497
Please don't tell them that I told you
the surprise. I said I wouldn't.

573
00:43:11,598 --> 00:43:13,463
Oh, well, you didn't really tell us
anything about it, did you?

574
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:17,393
- Yes I did. It's a play.
- It's a play?

575
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:32,317
"The Lamentable Tale of Lady Ursula."

576
00:43:32,335 --> 00:43:35,600
"A play in one act
by Peter Llewelyn Davies."

577
00:43:38,258 --> 00:43:42,456
- This is just a bit of silliness, really.
- I should hope so. Go on.

578
00:43:42,629 --> 00:43:45,063
I just wanted to take a stab at writing,
you know.

579
00:43:45,265 --> 00:43:47,825
Well, the others do
a good job with it anyway.

580
00:43:47,851 --> 00:43:50,012
Well, let's see it then.

581
00:43:52,222 --> 00:43:55,817
"The Lamentable Tale of Lady Ursula."

582
00:43:56,226 --> 00:43:58,227
"One morning, just after sunrise,

583
00:43:58,228 --> 00:44:01,755
Lady Ursula, the most beautiful daughter
of Lord and Lady Dubon,

584
00:44:01,982 --> 00:44:07,249
made her way up the steps of the great
cathedral to pray to her blessed saint."

585
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:10,337
"Suddenly, as she reached
the cathedral doors,

586
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:13,103
the gargoyle that guarded
the sacred structure

587
00:44:13,376 --> 00:44:16,004
came to life and swooped down upon her."

588
00:44:18,331 --> 00:44:20,561
"The people of the village all ran to safety,

589
00:44:20,584 --> 00:44:23,385
but Lady Ursula slipped
on the cathedral steps

590
00:44:23,386 --> 00:44:27,550
and the gargoyle descended upon her,
wrapping her in its huge wings

591
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:32,191
and taking her high up into the spires
of the cathedral."

592
00:44:32,429 --> 00:44:35,762
- Go on, Peter.
- "Not long after this sorrowful event,

593
00:44:35,932 --> 00:44:40,596
a young knight named JM Barnaby
came into the city."

594
00:44:41,271 --> 00:44:43,535
Sylvia.

595
00:44:43,907 --> 00:44:46,273
- Do you want some water?
- Mother?

596
00:44:46,409 --> 00:44:49,867
- No, James.
- Let's get her back to the house. Go on.

597
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,596
She won't discuss it with me at all.
She claims it was nothing.

598
00:44:57,597 --> 00:45:00,506
I tell you, Doctor, she couldn't breathe.

599
00:45:00,507 --> 00:45:04,034
You can't very well treat a patient
who won't admit there's anything wrong.

600
00:45:04,511 --> 00:45:07,969
Well, you'll have to make her understand
that something is.

601
00:45:08,014 --> 00:45:11,780
- I'll try and do my best.
- Great. Just there.

602
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:44,847
Get your hand flat like that.

603
00:45:46,002 --> 00:45:47,936
Ow.

604
00:45:49,005 --> 00:45:51,235
Then... Like that.

605
00:46:17,784 --> 00:46:19,877
Come in.

606
00:46:28,795 --> 00:46:32,526
The good doctor didn't feel
up to the challenge on this one.

607
00:46:32,799 --> 00:46:36,326
He thinks you need to go to hospital
for further tests.

608
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:39,795
Nonsense.
When would I have time for that?

609
00:46:39,806 --> 00:46:44,038
Besides, this family's
had enough of hospitals.

610
00:46:45,312 --> 00:46:48,873
- Perhaps they can help you.
- I know what they can do for me.

611
00:46:49,316 --> 00:46:52,318
I saw what they did for my husband.

612
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,618
No, James. I've no interest in hospitals.

613
00:46:56,823 --> 00:46:59,417
I'm keenly interested
in having some supper.

614
00:47:29,189 --> 00:47:33,649
What did you and Mother decide
to tell us this time? "It's only a chest cold"?

615
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,578
- We hadn't decided anything.
- Stop lying to me!

616
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:39,727
I'm sick of grown-ups lying to me.

617
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,868
I'm not lying to you.
I don't know what's wrong.

618
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:47,363
"Father might take us fishing,"
that's what she said. "In just a few weeks."

619
00:47:47,707 --> 00:47:50,162
And he died the next morning.

620
00:47:50,163 --> 00:47:52,618
That wasn't a lie, Peter.

621
00:47:52,879 --> 00:47:53,879
That was your mother's hope.

622
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,283
He barely moved for a week,
but I started planning our fishing trip.

623
00:47:58,435 --> 00:48:02,496
I will never lie to you. I promise you that.

624
00:48:02,605 --> 00:48:06,166
No, all you'll do is teach me
to make up stupid stories

625
00:48:06,443 --> 00:48:10,971
and pretend that things
aren't happening until...

626
00:48:14,451 --> 00:48:16,851
I won't! I'm not blind.

627
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,595
I won't be made a fool.

628
00:48:20,407 --> 00:48:23,433
What's this? Peter.

629
00:48:23,793 --> 00:48:25,886
The play.

630
00:48:26,379 --> 00:48:29,678
Darling, I wanted to see the rest of it.

631
00:48:31,384 --> 00:48:34,842
Magic's gone out of it a bit now,
hasn't it?

632
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:38,102
All because of a silly chest cold.

633
00:49:22,385 --> 00:49:24,285
James.

634
00:49:26,389 --> 00:49:28,755
Well, you remember Gilbert Cannan,
don't you?

635
00:49:28,892 --> 00:49:29,892
Good evening.

636
00:49:29,893 --> 00:49:36,093
Mr Cannan has been working on the
committee to fight government censorship.

637
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:38,890
I know how involved you've been as well.

638
00:49:38,902 --> 00:49:44,169
He wanted to speak to you.
I did think you'd be home so much sooner.

639
00:49:44,407 --> 00:49:47,001
It's been a long evening, Mary.

640
00:49:47,911 --> 00:49:49,845
Yes.

641
00:49:49,913 --> 00:49:52,414
Well, if I'd realized how late it was,
of course.

642
00:49:52,415 --> 00:49:55,646
I should perhaps talk to you
at another time? Not so late?

643
00:49:55,919 --> 00:49:57,978
That will be fine.

644
00:50:00,423 --> 00:50:02,424
We'll talk then.

645
00:50:02,425 --> 00:50:05,292
Thank you for your patience, Mrs Barrie.

646
00:50:05,428 --> 00:50:07,157
Mr Barrie.

647
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,557
- Good night.
- Night.

648
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:29,614
Well, aren't you going to speak?

649
00:50:29,615 --> 00:50:32,646
What would you like me to say?

650
00:50:33,456 --> 00:50:36,857
"Curious how late Mr Cannan stayed,"
I suppose.

651
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,452
And then, let's see. What comes next?

652
00:50:42,465 --> 00:50:45,434
"No later than you were out, James."

653
00:50:45,468 --> 00:50:48,266
"And how is Mrs Davies this evening?"

654
00:50:49,222 --> 00:50:51,588
Oh, yes, I would have a great answer
for that one, wouldn't I?

655
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:53,317
How dare you.

656
00:50:55,812 --> 00:50:58,178
This isn't one of your plays.

657
00:50:58,314 --> 00:51:02,080
I know that, Mary. It's quite serious.

658
00:51:04,537 --> 00:51:07,734
But I'm not ready for this conversation,
wherever it may lead.

659
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:13,001
Perhaps we can talk in the morning, yes?
Good night then.

660
00:52:35,995 --> 00:52:40,414
Mr Barrie. Don't you agree
this is a little bit tight?

661
00:52:40,415 --> 00:52:44,834
- No. No, in fact I think it's quite... baggy.
- Baggy?

662
00:52:45,004 --> 00:52:47,700
Quite frumpy. I'd bring it
right in just there.

663
00:52:47,807 --> 00:52:49,399
That's very tight.

664
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:52,243
And put maybe a plank of wood there
to straighten him up.

665
00:52:52,312 --> 00:52:54,280
- Oh, aye. Yes, Mr Barrie.
- Plank of wood?

666
00:52:54,314 --> 00:52:56,714
Some wood there on the shoulders as well.

667
00:52:56,816 --> 00:53:00,684
- Otherwise, it's marvelous.
- Right, sir.

668
00:53:12,949 --> 00:53:15,850
- You'll be sick tomorrow.
- I'll be sick tonight.

669
00:53:19,922 --> 00:53:22,322
James.

670
00:53:22,425 --> 00:53:26,225
We're just having some tea.
You remember my mother, of course.

671
00:53:26,429 --> 00:53:29,592
Yes. Of course. How do you do?

672
00:53:31,884 --> 00:53:35,820
- May I take your hat?
- That's enough, boys.

673
00:53:39,192 --> 00:53:41,660
Boys, please don't run in the house.
You'll break something.

674
00:53:41,978 --> 00:53:44,003
Come away from that door.
Come on, come on.

675
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:47,328
- I'd like a word with you,
Mr Barrie, before you go.

676
00:53:47,329 --> 00:53:49,330
We'll only be a few minutes.

677
00:53:49,786 --> 00:53:52,050
Boys, why don't you go
and play in the garden? Go on.

678
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:53,634
- Is he in trouble?
- Sh.

679
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,976
Because I've been alone with Grandmother
and I know what it's like.

680
00:53:58,044 --> 00:54:02,140
- Should we retire into the study?
- Why don't you join them, dear?

681
00:54:02,141 --> 00:54:03,890
Very well.

682
00:54:06,085 --> 00:54:09,521
- I do apologize for interrupting.
- Would you close the door, please?

683
00:54:09,672 --> 00:54:11,173
Certainly.

684
00:54:11,174 --> 00:54:16,237
Sylvia has told me you have offered her
the services of your household staff.

685
00:54:16,238 --> 00:54:20,445
- Well, not exactly.
- That won't be necessary.

686
00:54:20,817 --> 00:54:23,012
I'll leave that to Sylvia, of course.

687
00:54:23,686 --> 00:54:25,771
You'll leave that to me, Mr Barrie.

688
00:54:25,772 --> 00:54:28,824
You see, I'm moving in here from now on.

689
00:54:28,825 --> 00:54:33,455
- You're moving in?
- I'm going where I'm most needed.

690
00:54:33,696 --> 00:54:36,358
And I can certainly see to it
that this house is managed

691
00:54:36,582 --> 00:54:38,914
without resorting to your charity.

692
00:54:38,951 --> 00:54:43,580
It isn't charity, Mrs du Maurier.
I was only trying to help, as a friend.

693
00:54:43,581 --> 00:54:48,209
Have you no idea how much your
friendship has already cost my daughter?

694
00:54:48,344 --> 00:54:51,108
Or are you really that selfish?

695
00:54:51,297 --> 00:54:53,925
I beg your pardon?

696
00:54:54,183 --> 00:54:58,279
Don't you see what a visit
to the summer cottage of a married man

697
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,418
does for a widow's future prospects?

698
00:55:02,975 --> 00:55:07,002
Sylvia needs to find someone.
The boys need a father.

699
00:55:09,899 --> 00:55:14,336
And you are destroying any hope this
family has of pulling itself together again.

700
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:18,204
I have only wanted good things
for this family, Mrs du Maurier.

701
00:55:18,205 --> 00:55:20,702
I'll look after them.

702
00:55:22,044 --> 00:55:24,911
You have your own family
to concern yourself with.

703
00:55:24,914 --> 00:55:26,711
What are you suggesting?

704
00:55:26,716 --> 00:55:30,709
I'm suggesting that you protect
what you have, Mr Barrie.

705
00:55:31,003 --> 00:55:34,769
That is precisely what I am doing.

706
00:55:56,913 --> 00:56:00,610
I was so certain what I would find in this.

707
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,733
Some little confession
would leak out onto the page.

708
00:56:05,955 --> 00:56:08,389
I don't write love notes in my journal.

709
00:56:08,424 --> 00:56:10,858
No.

710
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:14,468
Still, you knew who I meant, didn't you?

711
00:56:14,514 --> 00:56:17,244
That's some comfort, actually.

712
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,830
It means I know you just a little after all.

713
00:56:20,853 --> 00:56:24,550
You needn't steal my journal
to get to know me, Mary.

714
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:29,168
No. I suppose I could just go see the plays.

715
00:56:31,614 --> 00:56:36,415
I was hopelessly naive when I married you.

716
00:56:37,453 --> 00:56:42,948
I imagined that brilliant people
disappeared to some secret place

717
00:56:42,949 --> 00:56:46,990
where good ideas floated around
like leaves in autumn.

718
00:56:47,547 --> 00:56:52,280
And I hoped, at least once...

719
00:56:53,636 --> 00:56:56,571
you would take me there with you.

720
00:56:56,639 --> 00:56:59,631
There is no such place.

721
00:57:01,093 --> 00:57:03,220
Yes, there is.

722
00:57:04,764 --> 00:57:06,857
Neverland.

723
00:57:09,235 --> 00:57:11,903
It's the best you've written, James.

724
00:57:11,904 --> 00:57:15,931
And I'm sure the Davies will adore
the world you've created for them.

725
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:19,453
I only wish I were part of it.

726
00:57:20,363 --> 00:57:23,992
I've wanted you to be. I've tried.

727
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,120
Mary.

728
00:57:29,121 --> 00:57:34,024
I always imagined us going off on
great adventures once we were together.

729
00:57:34,126 --> 00:57:37,653
But we moved into this house
and you started, I don't know,

730
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:41,998
- you started rearranging the furniture.
- What was I supposed to do, James?

731
00:57:42,134 --> 00:57:43,431
You were always gone.

732
00:57:43,432 --> 00:57:44,728
I was right here.

733
00:57:45,137 --> 00:57:52,134
Sitting in your parlor, staring off
into other worlds as though I didn't exist.

734
00:57:53,062 --> 00:57:55,724
Look. Just give me bit more time
to finish up the play.

735
00:57:55,815 --> 00:57:57,749
To spend with your muse?

736
00:57:57,817 --> 00:58:03,380
No, I'm tired of waiting, James.
I'm tired of looking like a fool.

737
00:58:04,657 --> 00:58:08,024
Well, I can't very well give up the play.

738
00:58:09,128 --> 00:58:11,756
Of course not.

739
00:58:12,081 --> 00:58:17,542
Just come home to me at the end of
the day. Rehearse and be home for dinner.

740
00:58:17,753 --> 00:58:22,713
No more trips to the country,
no more long afternoons in the park.

741
00:58:22,714 --> 00:58:26,885
If you can't give us that much of a chance,

742
00:58:27,313 --> 00:58:30,282
then we must end this.

743
00:58:31,067 --> 00:58:33,934
And I will.

744
00:58:38,991 --> 00:58:41,516
Pitiful display.

745
00:58:46,999 --> 00:58:49,160
Nanny. Nanny.

746
00:58:49,161 --> 00:58:51,595
What?

747
00:58:54,006 --> 00:58:57,373
First you get the pajamas,
then you make the bed.

748
00:58:57,374 --> 00:58:59,420
With my paws?

749
00:58:59,762 --> 00:59:03,823
You make the bed with your paws.
The pajamas you get with your teeth.

750
00:59:03,824 --> 00:59:07,884
Because in fact, being a dog,
you haven't any proper digits, have you?

751
00:59:08,854 --> 00:59:11,385
Well, I don't have any teeth, either.

752
00:59:11,386 --> 00:59:13,917
I mean, I can't see. I can't breathe.

753
00:59:14,226 --> 00:59:17,354
All I've got is this rubbery snout.

754
00:59:20,232 --> 00:59:24,328
- Can we get him some teeth?
- He can have mine.

755
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:26,466
We'll get you teeth.

756
00:59:26,739 --> 00:59:30,197
- Let's have a wee break, shall we?
- Right.

757
00:59:33,045 --> 00:59:34,512
- I thought you were wonderful.
- You were marvelous.

758
00:59:34,964 --> 00:59:36,989
I think you're better on four legs
than you are on two.

759
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,491
- Oh, give it a rest.
- I do.

760
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:44,303
- Just say it, Charles, go on.
- Well, you picture it, James.

761
00:59:44,304 --> 00:59:47,636
Opening night, doctors, lawyers,
businessmen and their wives,

762
00:59:47,977 --> 00:59:49,444
all dressed to the nines.

763
00:59:49,478 --> 00:59:54,130
They've paid good money, they're
expecting theater, what we call theater.

764
00:59:54,131 --> 00:59:58,783
The curtain opens and it's crocodiles
and fairies and pirates and lndians.

765
00:59:58,988 --> 01:00:02,389
I don't even know what it is.

766
01:00:02,491 --> 01:00:06,825
But you did know, Charles. You're
an absolute genius, Charles. That's it.

767
01:00:06,946 --> 01:00:08,846
Oh, don't patronize me, James.

768
01:00:08,948 --> 01:00:12,008
You know how much money I put into
this show that I haven't even found yet?

769
01:00:12,284 --> 01:00:15,447
Listen, listen. Opening night,
I want 25 seats set aside.

770
01:00:15,448 --> 01:00:17,288
- Set aside? 25?
- 25 seats.

771
01:00:17,289 --> 01:00:19,985
Scattered throughout the theater.
Two here, two there, three up there.

772
01:00:20,292 --> 01:00:22,260
- Are they paying for it?
- They're filled.

773
01:00:22,261 --> 01:00:24,695
- No, no, no. I'm asking...
- The seats are filled.

774
01:00:24,764 --> 01:00:27,358
- Uncle Jim?
- Hello, boys.

775
01:00:27,767 --> 01:00:29,064
Could I speak to you for a moment,
please?

776
01:00:29,065 --> 01:00:30,497
Certainly.

777
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:33,796
25 seats, Charles. It'll be great.
It'll be fantastic.

778
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,365
25 scattered seats?
Who's paying for them?

779
01:00:35,366 --> 01:00:36,298
Throughout the theater.

780
01:00:36,776 --> 01:00:40,268
- Who's paying for these 25 seats?
- They're filled-up seats, Charles.

781
01:00:40,279 --> 01:00:42,280
Whoa. Look.

782
01:00:42,281 --> 01:00:45,045
This is great. I'm flying.

783
01:00:45,151 --> 01:00:49,485
We don't need to use much pull at all, see?
As long as we've got the balance down.

784
01:00:49,789 --> 01:00:52,257
Mother asked me to take the boys out
for the afternoon.

785
01:00:52,374 --> 01:00:54,876
She said she only wanted a bit of quiet,

786
01:00:54,877 --> 01:00:59,246
but she was trembling so badly
she couldn't even finish her tea.

787
01:00:59,298 --> 01:01:02,461
I'm not a fool, Uncle James.
I deserve to know the truth.

788
01:01:02,668 --> 01:01:06,035
I don't know the truth.
She won't talk about it.

789
01:01:06,036 --> 01:01:08,448
But you think it's serious?

790
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,426
It could be. The doctor felt
she should go and have some tests.

791
01:01:13,562 --> 01:01:15,393
Then you'll have to convince her
to go then.

792
01:01:15,564 --> 01:01:17,964
I've tried. She won't listen to me.

793
01:01:19,151 --> 01:01:20,151
And lately, to be quite honest,

794
01:01:20,152 --> 01:01:24,885
it seems that all my best intentions for
your family have come to nothing but harm.

795
01:01:25,157 --> 01:01:27,421
Apparently I've made
quite a mess of things.

796
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:30,857
It's Grandmother, isn't it?
She's run you off, hasn't she?

797
01:01:30,863 --> 01:01:36,062
Oh, she's absolutely tried with great
effort. And perhaps with good reason.

798
01:01:36,063 --> 01:01:39,454
It isn't you, Uncle Jim. She just...

799
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:43,824
She just doesn't want
to see Mother hurt anymore.

800
01:01:47,346 --> 01:01:50,281
Look at that.

801
01:01:50,349 --> 01:01:53,011
How magnificent.

802
01:01:54,053 --> 01:01:56,146
The boy's gone.

803
01:01:58,557 --> 01:02:03,075
Somewhere during the last 30 seconds,
you've become a grown-up.

804
01:02:03,076 --> 01:02:07,593
Right then. I think you should be the one
to talk to her, George.

805
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:13,702
- But I wouldn't know what to say.
- You'll do fine. You'll do just fine.

806
01:02:13,706 --> 01:02:16,708
Mr Barrie, sir. Sorry to interrupt.

807
01:02:16,709 --> 01:02:20,873
- It's Nana, he's expired backstage.
- What's happened?

808
01:02:21,213 --> 01:02:23,943
I think his costume is too tight.

809
01:02:24,216 --> 01:02:29,620
It's not possible, too tight.
George, give me a minute, I'll be back.

810
01:02:33,008 --> 01:02:37,707
Pull that one tight.
Here, last one.

811
01:02:39,431 --> 01:02:41,581
OK. Flap those wings.

812
01:02:41,582 --> 01:02:43,731
- There you go.
- Whoa!

813
01:02:44,603 --> 01:02:47,071
- Can I have a go?
- Yeah, you can have a little go if you want.

814
01:02:47,106 --> 01:02:48,573
Give that a tug. Go on.

815
01:02:48,607 --> 01:02:50,973
- Just give it a little pull.
- Can I have a go?

816
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:52,509
- In a minute. In a minute.
- Can I have a go?

817
01:02:52,611 --> 01:02:54,602
- Jack. Pull me higher.
- I have to concentrate.

818
01:02:54,613 --> 01:02:56,240
- Stop it now, boys.
- No, Michael.

819
01:02:56,448 --> 01:02:57,949
Stop mucking about, boys. Come on now.

820
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:59,918
- I want to do it now.
- No, don't go down there.

821
01:03:00,336 --> 01:03:01,530
What are you...?

822
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:05,882
Ow!

823
01:03:10,129 --> 01:03:12,819
Oh, no. Oh, no, I'm sorry.

824
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,509
- I'm so sorry.
- George?

825
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,039
Mr Barrie?

826
01:03:23,142 --> 01:03:26,771
Mrs Davies would like a word with you.

827
01:03:27,062 --> 01:03:29,394
No, just Mr Barrie.

828
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:50,933
- Did you encourage this?
- Encourage what?

829
01:03:51,003 --> 01:03:55,167
Oh, James, please.
You know perfectly well what.

830
01:03:56,008 --> 01:04:02,277
George won't allow them to set his arm
unless I submit to an examination.

831
01:04:03,766 --> 01:04:06,929
I see. Well, I suppose you'll have to then,

832
01:04:07,269 --> 01:04:12,366
because he's quite a stubborn young man
when he sets his mind to it.

833
01:04:12,524 --> 01:04:17,325
This is absurd.
They won't tell me anything different.

834
01:04:17,326 --> 01:04:19,497
Different?

835
01:04:19,531 --> 01:04:22,125
So you've already spoken to a doctor then?

836
01:04:22,534 --> 01:04:25,298
That is not your concern.

837
01:04:30,926 --> 01:04:35,192
My understanding is that my condition
may be quite serious.

838
01:04:35,431 --> 01:04:40,232
However... my wish is that
life should go on as normal.

839
01:04:41,186 --> 01:04:42,676
So,

840
01:04:43,188 --> 01:04:45,690
I'll have the examination,

841
01:04:45,691 --> 01:04:48,819
and I'll take whatever medications
they advise.

842
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:51,527
But I don't want to know what they're for.

843
01:04:51,697 --> 01:04:55,793
And I don't want you inquiring into it
any further.

844
01:04:56,702 --> 01:04:59,068
Wouldn't dream of it.

845
01:05:17,806 --> 01:05:19,899
Mary?

846
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:24,074
Mary?

847
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:48,068
Peter, could you help George
to fold a pocket handkerchief, please?

848
01:05:48,253 --> 01:05:51,552
- They're in the linen cupboard. Darling?
- Yes, Mother.

849
01:05:51,553 --> 01:05:55,352
Jack, how do you manage
to always come untucked?

850
01:05:55,594 --> 01:05:57,789
Would you check your shirt-tails
in the intermission, please?

851
01:05:58,097 --> 01:05:59,325
Yes, Mother.

852
01:05:59,598 --> 01:06:02,032
You're not planning on attending
any after-theater events, are you?

853
01:06:02,101 --> 01:06:05,798
Only for a short time if we do. The tickets!

854
01:06:05,804 --> 01:06:07,805
- With the children?
- George!

855
01:06:07,806 --> 01:06:11,036
Um, possibly. Would you see
if George has the tickets, please?

856
01:06:11,037 --> 01:06:14,267
- I'll just check the dressing table.
- Sylvia, there's a...

857
01:06:14,813 --> 01:06:19,375
Mother, please see if George has
the tickets. Michael, where are your socks?

858
01:06:19,376 --> 01:06:21,650
Wait here, don't move.

859
01:06:56,271 --> 01:06:59,172
Take her feet, George.

860
01:07:01,326 --> 01:07:03,692
We'll need some more blankets.

861
01:07:04,913 --> 01:07:07,882
Oh, take Michael with you, would you?

862
01:07:10,419 --> 01:07:14,651
She looks much worse
than when we were at the cottage.

863
01:07:14,923 --> 01:07:17,925
Sh, Michael.

864
01:07:17,926 --> 01:07:20,918
- Those 25 seats, has anyone shown up?
- No, sir. Not yet.

865
01:07:20,929 --> 01:07:23,397
Precisely. Have there been
many people asking for seats?

866
01:07:23,932 --> 01:07:24,921
- Yes, sir.
- Charles.

867
01:07:24,933 --> 01:07:26,992
I suggest you start selling them.
Yes, James?

868
01:07:27,102 --> 01:07:28,899
Have you seen any of the Davies family
yet this evening?

869
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:29,901
The 25 seats, are they filled?

870
01:07:30,105 --> 01:07:31,800
- It's taken care of.
- Yes. Yes.

871
01:07:32,107 --> 01:07:35,167
Who did you invite? Because obviously
whoever you invited decided not to come.

872
01:07:35,194 --> 01:07:37,754
- The seats will be filled, I promise.
- Yes. You've been promising me all...

873
01:07:37,755 --> 01:07:39,323
- Charles?
- Hello, Mr Stanley.

874
01:07:39,698 --> 01:07:41,427
Have you seen the Davies family
this evening?

875
01:07:41,428 --> 01:07:42,189
No, sir.

876
01:07:43,035 --> 01:07:46,266
- Jack has gone to get Dr Brighton.
- Oh, no, Mother. I don't need a doctor.

877
01:07:46,267 --> 01:07:48,131
Yes, you do, dear.

878
01:07:50,042 --> 01:07:53,102
I think I'll get some camomile
to help you relax.

879
01:07:53,103 --> 01:07:57,038
Peter will be here if you need anything.

880
01:08:03,055 --> 01:08:04,716
Peter.

881
01:08:05,057 --> 01:08:07,116
Peter.

882
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,432
Can I do anything, Mother?

883
01:08:17,603 --> 01:08:19,696
No, darling.

884
01:08:21,106 --> 01:08:23,438
You must go to the play.

885
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:28,706
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

886
01:08:28,707 --> 01:08:31,139
I need you to.

887
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:36,319
I need you to come back tonight
and tell me every bit of it.

888
01:08:36,455 --> 01:08:37,955
Please.

889
01:08:37,956 --> 01:08:41,016
It's only a play, Mother.

890
01:08:41,017 --> 01:08:43,860
It doesn't matter.

891
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:50,614
What do you want?

892
01:08:50,852 --> 01:08:53,650
Take it out.

893
01:08:55,857 --> 01:08:58,621
Open it.

894
01:09:07,703 --> 01:09:11,036
I've never been so proud of you.

895
01:09:24,386 --> 01:09:27,287
Last call, please, ladies and gentlemen.
Last call.

896
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:30,165
Yes, yes, yes. It's all right. They know.

897
01:09:30,425 --> 01:09:34,156
We had time to sell those 25 seats.
The play's starting.

898
01:09:46,441 --> 01:09:47,441
- Charles.
- What?

899
01:09:47,442 --> 01:09:51,401
- They're here.
- Who's here?

900
01:09:54,449 --> 01:09:58,044
Do forgive them being a bit late -
short legs, long walk from the orphanage.

901
01:09:58,045 --> 01:10:00,183
I'm not clear what they're doing here.

902
01:10:00,455 --> 01:10:02,047
- They've come to see the play.
- Mm-hm.

903
01:10:02,048 --> 01:10:03,857
- That's the 25 seats.
- Mm.

904
01:10:03,959 --> 01:10:08,123
25 seats given to orphans. Right.
Now my nightmare is complete.

905
01:10:08,463 --> 01:10:10,522
You can start your play now.

906
01:10:10,523 --> 01:10:12,524
Your play.

907
01:10:17,522 --> 01:10:20,491
Get them in the scattered seats.

908
01:10:35,624 --> 01:10:38,752
Just there, boys.

909
01:11:10,192 --> 01:11:13,286
Excuse me, sir. This way.

910
01:11:13,287 --> 01:11:15,254
Thank you.

911
01:11:15,697 --> 01:11:18,791
Looks like we got
one of the better-dressed ones.

912
01:11:19,201 --> 01:11:23,661
I just want you to know,
I think you're a wonderful dog.

913
01:11:23,705 --> 01:11:25,935
Thanks.

914
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,536
I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.

915
01:12:29,537 --> 01:12:31,018
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.

916
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:33,574
Two minutes more.

917
01:12:33,575 --> 01:12:36,009
Please. One minute more.

918
01:12:36,361 --> 01:12:41,162
Nana, I will not be bathed.
I tell you, I will not be bathed.

919
01:12:46,171 --> 01:12:48,765
Who are you?

920
01:12:55,347 --> 01:13:00,046
No one there. Yet I feel sure I saw a face.

921
01:13:00,852 --> 01:13:03,286
My children.

922
01:13:04,606 --> 01:13:07,905
- How is she?
- She's resting.

923
01:13:08,109 --> 01:13:09,977
- May I see her?
- No, Mr Barrie.

924
01:13:09,978 --> 01:13:12,970
I don't think we need to include you in
everything that goes on in this household.

925
01:13:13,231 --> 01:13:15,426
- But she'd want to see him.
- Be quiet, George.

926
01:13:15,427 --> 01:13:16,534
And since, as I've discovered,

927
01:13:16,535 --> 01:13:20,528
you've seen fit to conceal certain facts
about my daughter's condition from me,

928
01:13:20,872 --> 01:13:23,864
I feel no remorse at excluding you
from my home.

929
01:13:23,865 --> 01:13:24,784
But you can't...

930
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,687
- Go upstairs, George, now.
- Stop ordering me about.

931
01:13:28,688 --> 01:13:30,858
This isn't your home. It's our home.

932
01:13:31,166 --> 01:13:33,134
Just cos Mother's
needed your help recently

933
01:13:33,168 --> 01:13:35,432
doesn't give you the right
to rule over her existence.

934
01:13:35,433 --> 01:13:37,832
She's not a child anymore,
and neither am I.

935
01:13:38,139 --> 01:13:40,539
If she wants to see Uncle Jim,
she can see Uncle Jim.

936
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:43,603
There's nothing you can do about it.

937
01:13:47,432 --> 01:13:50,526
- Mother?
- Yes, darling?

938
01:13:52,938 --> 01:13:55,439
James.

939
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,204
No. Your play.

940
01:14:00,946 --> 01:14:03,948
Look at all this.

941
01:14:03,949 --> 01:14:06,247
I'd have come tonight, it's just...

942
01:14:06,451 --> 01:14:09,579
- Mother, you need to rest.
- I still have things to do here.

943
01:14:10,505 --> 01:14:13,507
See? This needs mending.

944
01:14:13,508 --> 01:14:17,035
Four boys, no end of patches.

945
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:19,845
Can't seem to keep up.

946
01:14:20,966 --> 01:14:23,799
I haven't the time for all this.

947
01:14:24,603 --> 01:14:30,473
Don't look at me like that, James.
You make me feel so utterly exposed.

948
01:14:32,277 --> 01:14:37,772
Boys, would you give me a moment
with your mother, please? Thank you.

949
01:14:57,552 --> 01:15:00,282
They can see it, you know.

950
01:15:01,556 --> 01:15:03,956
You can't go on just pretending.

951
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:07,995
"Just pretending"?

952
01:15:10,065 --> 01:15:14,001
You brought pretending
into this family, James.

953
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:18,630
You showed us we can change things
by simply believing them to be different.

954
01:15:18,631 --> 01:15:21,064
A lot of things, Sylvia, not everything.

955
01:15:21,076 --> 01:15:24,307
But the things that matter.

956
01:15:25,363 --> 01:15:31,927
We've pretended for some time now
that you're a part of this family, haven't we?

957
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:44,008
You've come to mean so much to us all
that now it doesn't matter if it's true.

958
01:15:47,385 --> 01:15:49,751
And even if it isn't true,

959
01:15:50,605 --> 01:15:53,574
even if that can never be...

960
01:15:56,111 --> 01:15:59,046
I need to go on pretending.

961
01:16:01,116 --> 01:16:03,243
Until the end.

962
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:07,713
With you.

963
01:16:08,623 --> 01:16:12,957
- Oh, I am sweet.
- How do you do it?

964
01:16:13,294 --> 01:16:17,856
You just think lovely, wonderful thoughts
and they lift you up in the air.

965
01:16:20,752 --> 01:16:26,281
You are so nippy at it.
Couldn't you do it very slowly once?

966
01:16:30,178 --> 01:16:34,114
Yes, I've got it now, Wendy.

967
01:16:34,182 --> 01:16:37,481
I must blow fairy dust on you first.

968
01:16:47,162 --> 01:16:49,687
Now try. Try it from the beds.

969
01:16:50,248 --> 01:16:54,184
Just wriggle your shoulders like this
and then let go.

970
01:16:55,837 --> 01:16:59,000
- I flew!
- How ripping!

971
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:01,566
Now join hands.

972
01:17:05,597 --> 01:17:08,464
- Look at me!
- I do like it!

973
01:17:10,552 --> 01:17:13,851
- Bravo!
- Let's go out.

974
01:17:14,189 --> 01:17:18,125
Second on the right
and straight on till morning.

975
01:17:18,193 --> 01:17:20,491
Genius.

976
01:17:24,315 --> 01:17:29,184
- Sylvia, don't move.
- I feel a little better.

977
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:32,949
It's been a bad day, that's all.

978
01:17:34,325 --> 01:17:37,294
Now I want you to go back to the theater.

979
01:17:37,328 --> 01:17:39,830
Find Peter.

980
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:43,892
- Of course.
- Thank you.

981
01:17:47,338 --> 01:17:51,468
Are you sure there's nothing else
I can do for you?

982
01:17:52,343 --> 01:17:54,436
No.

983
01:17:56,347 --> 01:17:57,848
Well,

984
01:17:57,849 --> 01:18:01,080
I have always wanted to go to Neverland.

985
01:18:01,519 --> 01:18:04,579
You did promise to tell me about it,
you know.

986
01:18:05,106 --> 01:18:08,098
Aye. That I did.

987
01:18:09,244 --> 01:18:12,680
It's a bit late for it
tonight though, I'm afraid.

988
01:18:14,282 --> 01:18:17,740
Perhaps some time soon though?

989
01:18:24,676 --> 01:18:27,177
Most definitely.

990
01:18:27,178 --> 01:18:32,411
- D'you mean we shall both be drowned?
- Look how the water is rising.

991
01:18:35,687 --> 01:18:39,189
It must be the tail of the kite
we made for Michael.

992
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:44,526
You remember. It tore itself
out of his hands and floated away.

993
01:18:45,697 --> 01:18:50,259
- The kite. Why shouldn't it carry you?
- Both of us.

994
01:18:51,202 --> 01:18:54,535
It can't lift two. Michael and Curly tried.

995
01:18:54,536 --> 01:18:57,299
I won't go without you, Peter.

996
01:18:57,709 --> 01:19:00,269
Let us draw lots which is to stay behind.

997
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:03,203
And you a lady? Never.

998
01:19:06,217 --> 01:19:07,775
Ready, Wendy?

999
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:09,687
Peter!

1000
01:19:09,721 --> 01:19:12,189
Don't let go, Wendy.

1001
01:19:12,223 --> 01:19:14,691
Peter, I'm frightened.

1002
01:19:14,726 --> 01:19:17,593
Hang on, Wendy!

1003
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:20,731
Peter!

1004
01:19:20,732 --> 01:19:24,566
To die will be an awfully big adventure.

1005
01:19:41,002 --> 01:19:43,562
- I'm glad you came.
- Well...

1006
01:19:45,006 --> 01:19:48,635
I've never missed an opening.

1007
01:19:48,636 --> 01:19:50,602
So I...

1008
01:19:51,512 --> 01:19:54,538
assume you heard about Gilbert and I.

1009
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:56,415
Yes.

1010
01:19:57,518 --> 01:19:59,850
Quite the scandal, so I'm told.

1011
01:20:07,528 --> 01:20:10,258
How are you?

1012
01:20:14,535 --> 01:20:17,402
I'm all right.

1013
01:20:17,538 --> 01:20:20,029
How are you?

1014
01:20:21,042 --> 01:20:23,772
I'm sorry.

1015
01:20:26,547 --> 01:20:29,243
Don't be.

1016
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:34,715
Without that family, you could
never have written anything like this.

1017
01:20:34,716 --> 01:20:37,149
You need them.

1018
01:20:44,065 --> 01:20:46,898
Goodbye.

1019
01:20:58,196 --> 01:21:00,528
- Mr Barrie.
- Mrs Snow.

1020
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:05,067
Thank you. That was quite the nicest
evening I've ever spent in the theater.

1021
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:08,297
Very kind of you to say. Thank you.
Where's Mr Snow this evening?

1022
01:21:08,706 --> 01:21:09,706
Oh.

1023
01:21:09,707 --> 01:21:12,574
I'm afraid he's left us.

1024
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:15,702
And he would so have loved this evening.

1025
01:21:15,713 --> 01:21:18,204
The pirates and the lndians.

1026
01:21:18,716 --> 01:21:22,584
He was really just a boy himself, you know.

1027
01:21:22,585 --> 01:21:24,950
To the very end.

1028
01:21:25,223 --> 01:21:28,488
I'm terribly sorry. How are you doing?

1029
01:21:28,726 --> 01:21:32,612
I'm doing well enough now, thank you.

1030
01:21:32,613 --> 01:21:37,880
I suppose it's all the work
of the ticking crocodile, isn't it?

1031
01:21:38,403 --> 01:21:43,136
Time is chasing after all of us.
Isn't that right?

1032
01:21:44,158 --> 01:21:47,150
- That's right, Mrs Snow.
- Aunt Rose, your drink.

1033
01:21:47,161 --> 01:21:50,619
Thank you. I mustn't keep you.
You've a lot of friends here.

1034
01:21:50,665 --> 01:21:54,192
Well, it's lovely to see you.
I'm terribly sorry, once again.

1035
01:21:55,670 --> 01:21:59,504
- Was that Mr Barrie?
- That was Mr Barrie.

1036
01:21:59,674 --> 01:22:02,438
Well done, Mr Barrie.

1037
01:22:02,677 --> 01:22:05,510
- Good show.
- Well done.

1038
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:11,683
Psst.

1039
01:22:11,903 --> 01:22:13,996
What did you think?

1040
01:22:14,489 --> 01:22:17,458
- It's about our summer together, isn't it?
- It is.

1041
01:22:17,492 --> 01:22:19,687
- About all of us.
- That's right.

1042
01:22:21,496 --> 01:22:24,192
Did you like it?

1043
01:22:24,499 --> 01:22:27,195
It's magical. Thank you.

1044
01:22:27,502 --> 01:22:29,902
Oh, thank you.

1045
01:22:30,004 --> 01:22:31,801
Thank you, Peter.

1046
01:22:32,006 --> 01:22:36,102
- This is Peter Pan! How wonderful.
- Really?

1047
01:22:36,511 --> 01:22:39,969
You're Peter Pan? Why, you must be
quite the little adventurer.

1048
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:43,161
Look, it's true.
He has no shadow.

1049
01:22:44,469 --> 01:22:46,960
But I'm not Peter Pan.

1050
01:22:47,138 --> 01:22:49,572
He is.

1051
01:22:59,984 --> 01:23:04,648
And there's been no improvement
since my last visit?

1052
01:23:04,649 --> 01:23:06,548
No.

1053
01:23:11,913 --> 01:23:15,371
Has James been by at all today, Mother?

1054
01:23:17,835 --> 01:23:20,099
Dr Brighton. May I have a word?

1055
01:23:21,756 --> 01:23:24,452
Excuse me a moment.

1056
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:32,354
You haven't been keeping him from me,
have you?

1057
01:23:32,433 --> 01:23:34,663
As a matter of fact,
I actually hoped he might come.

1058
01:23:34,664 --> 01:23:37,488
Would have proved me wrong about him.

1059
01:23:37,522 --> 01:23:39,387
Of course, with the success of his play,

1060
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:43,801
the whole of London
must be knocking at his door.

1061
01:23:47,448 --> 01:23:49,609
I'm sorry, dear.

1062
01:23:53,454 --> 01:23:56,456
- What is it?
- It's a secret.

1063
01:23:56,457 --> 01:23:59,517
- Quiet, Michael.
- I didn't say anything.

1064
01:23:59,594 --> 01:24:02,188
Mother, could you come downstairs
for a moment?

1065
01:24:02,713 --> 01:24:05,443
Oh, she can't come downstairs.
What are you thinking of, George?

1066
01:24:05,516 --> 01:24:10,044
Actually, I think a trip downstairs
might do her good, ma'am.

1067
01:24:18,896 --> 01:24:22,764
- What have you been up to?
- Just wait and see.

1068
01:24:31,292 --> 01:24:33,210
It's a play.

1069
01:24:33,211 --> 01:24:37,079
It's not just a play, Michael.
It's the play.

1070
01:24:38,249 --> 01:24:41,616
Of course, we'll have to make do
with a few compromises.

1071
01:24:42,253 --> 01:24:44,254
Much of it will have to be imagined.

1072
01:24:44,255 --> 01:24:47,622
- As it should be.
- As it should be, that's right.

1073
01:24:55,566 --> 01:24:59,024
Michael, come and sit here,
next to Mum.

1074
01:25:02,907 --> 01:25:05,341
When you're ready.

1075
01:25:31,385 --> 01:25:33,979
I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.

1076
01:25:34,272 --> 01:25:39,539
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.
Two minutes more. Please.

1077
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:43,273
- You know fairies, Peter?
- Yes.

1078
01:25:44,031 --> 01:25:46,522
But they're nearly all dead now.

1079
01:25:46,534 --> 01:25:51,233
You see, Wendy, when the first baby
laughed for the first time,

1080
01:25:51,539 --> 01:25:55,669
the laugh broke into a thousand pieces
and they all went skipping about

1081
01:25:55,826 --> 01:25:57,827
and that was the beginning of fairies.

1082
01:25:57,828 --> 01:26:03,266
And now when every new baby is born,
its first laugh becomes a fairy.

1083
01:26:03,334 --> 01:26:06,633
So there ought to be one fairy
for every boy and girl.

1084
01:26:06,837 --> 01:26:09,931
- Ought to be? Isn't there?
- Oh, no.

1085
01:26:10,007 --> 01:26:14,569
Children know such a lot now.
Soon, they don't believe in fairies.

1086
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:18,175
And every time a child says,
"I don't believe in fairies,"

1087
01:26:18,432 --> 01:26:21,663
there's a fairy somewhere
that falls down dead.

1088
01:26:25,323 --> 01:26:28,417
Who is that?

1089
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:32,488
The redskins were defeated?

1090
01:26:32,947 --> 01:26:37,008
Wendy and the boys
captured by the pirates?

1091
01:26:37,084 --> 01:26:39,985
I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her!

1092
01:26:42,123 --> 01:26:44,853
Oh, that's just my medicine.

1093
01:26:45,292 --> 01:26:49,319
Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?

1094
01:26:51,382 --> 01:26:55,079
Why, Tink. You've drunk my medicine.

1095
01:26:57,188 --> 01:27:00,157
It was poisoned.

1096
01:27:01,192 --> 01:27:04,525
And you drank it to save my life?

1097
01:27:06,397 --> 01:27:08,558
Tink.

1098
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,733
Are you dying?

1099
01:27:16,741 --> 01:27:19,175
Her light is growing faint.

1100
01:27:20,745 --> 01:27:24,738
If it goes out, that means she's dead.

1101
01:27:26,967 --> 01:27:30,664
Her voice is so low I can scarcely hear
what she's saying.

1102
01:27:30,665 --> 01:27:34,430
She says she thinks
she could get well again

1103
01:27:34,431 --> 01:27:37,208
if children believed in fairies.

1104
01:27:43,851 --> 01:27:46,820
Do you believe in fairies?

1105
01:27:48,322 --> 01:27:51,587
Say quick that you believe.

1106
01:27:54,278 --> 01:27:57,338
If you believe, clap your hands.

1107
01:27:58,999 --> 01:28:02,162
Clap louder.

1108
01:28:07,174 --> 01:28:10,268
Thank you. Thank you.

1109
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:56,166
That is Neverland.

1110
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:22,438
So many perfect days.

1111
01:30:23,644 --> 01:30:28,308
I really began to believe
we'd go on like that forever.

1112
01:30:28,649 --> 01:30:30,900
Oh, stop it.

1113
01:30:30,901 --> 01:30:34,064
She wasn't going to stay with you forever.

1114
01:30:34,905 --> 01:30:38,274
She had a husband. My father.

1115
01:30:38,275 --> 01:30:41,836
She never cared for you
the way she did for him.

1116
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:46,124
I'm not trying to replace your father, Peter.

1117
01:30:46,533 --> 01:30:49,468
I could never do that.

1118
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,819
You'd best let him go.

1119
01:31:01,432 --> 01:31:06,631
George, would you take the boys back
to the house? I'll be with you in a moment.

1120
01:31:07,021 --> 01:31:09,080
Go on, dear.

1121
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:18,657
I'm terribly sorry.

1122
01:31:19,533 --> 01:31:22,969
I've ruined everything I've touched
in this family.

1123
01:31:23,070 --> 01:31:25,572
Stop giving yourself so much credit.

1124
01:31:25,573 --> 01:31:29,873
Peter's grieving.
It has nothing to do with you.

1125
01:31:31,078 --> 01:31:33,478
Perhaps if I just had
a bit more time with him.

1126
01:31:33,581 --> 01:31:36,744
No, Mr Barrie. That won't be good enough.

1127
01:31:37,084 --> 01:31:43,353
If "a bit more time" is all you can provide,
you'd better leave him alone.

1128
01:31:44,842 --> 01:31:48,710
I know you don't much care for me,
Mrs du Maurier, and I respect that,

1129
01:31:48,846 --> 01:31:52,509
but I loved your daughter very much.

1130
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:55,216
And I love those boys.

1131
01:31:55,352 --> 01:31:57,411
And I think they need me right now.

1132
01:31:57,412 --> 01:31:59,355
Is that so?

1133
01:31:59,356 --> 01:32:01,586
And for how long after?

1134
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:04,827
Meaning what?

1135
01:32:04,828 --> 01:32:10,164
Sylvia has requested a co-guardianship
for the boys in her will.

1136
01:32:10,367 --> 01:32:14,895
You, Mr Barrie, and myself.

1137
01:32:17,374 --> 01:32:22,744
- And what do you have to say about that?
- I shall respect my daughter's wishes.

1138
01:32:22,745 --> 01:32:27,447
Something I should have done more of
while she was alive.

1139
01:32:29,186 --> 01:32:31,154
But if you feel you're not ready
for such a commitment,

1140
01:32:31,188 --> 01:32:36,592
I assure you I can certainly
look after the boys by myself.

1141
01:32:36,694 --> 01:32:39,822
Do you think I could abandon those boys?

1142
01:32:49,206 --> 01:32:51,401
Sit down, Peter.

1143
01:33:11,729 --> 01:33:15,187
Mother pasted it back together

1144
01:33:15,188 --> 01:33:17,314
after I ruined it.

1145
01:33:18,485 --> 01:33:20,486
And then I saw the play.

1146
01:33:20,487 --> 01:33:25,356
I just started writing
and I haven't been able to stop.

1147
01:33:26,994 --> 01:33:30,259
She would be very pleased to know that.

1148
01:33:34,001 --> 01:33:38,233
Listen. I've just spoken
with your grandmother

1149
01:33:39,506 --> 01:33:41,701
and I'm staying.

1150
01:33:41,702 --> 01:33:44,443
For good.

1151
01:33:47,014 --> 01:33:49,608
I'm sorry I was so horrible.

1152
01:33:50,768 --> 01:33:52,827
Don't worry.

1153
01:33:56,273 --> 01:33:59,275
It's just...

1154
01:33:59,276 --> 01:34:02,575
I thought she'd always be here.

1155
01:34:04,448 --> 01:34:06,507
So did I.

1156
01:34:08,452 --> 01:34:10,647
But, in fact...

1157
01:34:13,323 --> 01:34:15,708
she is.

1158
01:34:15,709 --> 01:34:20,874
Because she's on every page
of your imagination.

1159
01:34:22,249 --> 01:34:25,446
You'll always have her there. Always.

1160
01:34:31,225 --> 01:34:34,854
But why did she have to die?

1161
01:34:41,985 --> 01:34:44,249
I don't know, boy.

1162
01:34:48,742 --> 01:34:51,302
When I think of your mother...

1163
01:34:52,246 --> 01:34:55,272
I will always remember
how happy she looked

1164
01:34:55,273 --> 01:34:57,479
sitting there in the parlor,

1165
01:34:57,618 --> 01:35:00,485
watching a play about her family.

1166
01:35:00,504 --> 01:35:04,440
About her boys that never grew up.

1167
01:35:07,711 --> 01:35:10,179
She went to Neverland.

1168
01:35:12,716 --> 01:35:17,619
And you can visit her any time you like

1169
01:35:17,721 --> 01:35:20,588
if you just go there yourself.

1170
01:35:22,726 --> 01:35:25,728
How?

1171
01:35:25,729 --> 01:35:28,892
By believing, Peter.

1172
01:35:28,893 --> 01:35:31,223
Just believe.

1173
01:35:44,548 --> 01:35:46,982
I can see her.
