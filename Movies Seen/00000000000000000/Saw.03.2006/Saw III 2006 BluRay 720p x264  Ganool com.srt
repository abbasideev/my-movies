00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,785
<i>Game over.</i>

2
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,371
<i>I'll fucking kill you!</i>

3
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:43,959
<i>You fucking bitch!</i>

4
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,047
<i>I'll fucking kill you!</i>

00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,009
<i>No! Why?</i>

6
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,887
DanieI!

7
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,356
Secure the fIank!

8
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,608
Left side cIear.

9
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,152
We're cIear!

10
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,529
-Left side cIear.
-Let's move!

11
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,252
Oh, my God.

12
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,298
Someone caII Kerry.

13
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:45,010
The caII came in at 1 1 :45.
The woman heard an expIosion.

14
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,636
The fire department was the first
on the scene.

15
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,846
Kerry.

16
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,182
-Is it him?
-Before you go in there...

17
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,601
Eric. Is it him?

18
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,353
We don't know yet.

19
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,613
It's not Detective Matthews.

20
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,336
What happened?

21
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,339
The victim was heId in pIace
by these chains.

22
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,004
<i>Hello, Troy.</i>

23
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,425
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

24
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,678
<i>This game will take place</i>
<i>in a room not much bigger</i>

25
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,764
<i>than the room</i>
<i>you've spent most of your life in,</i>

26
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,850
<i>a prison cell.</i>

27
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:19,104
<i>Despite all of the advantages and privileges</i>
<i>that you were given at birth,</i>

28
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,983
<i>you have returned</i>
<i>to prison again and again,</i>

29
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,194
<i>more comfortabIe in chains</i>
<i>than you are in freedom.</i>

30
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,364
<i>Tonight, we will see</i>
<i>how far you are willing to go</i>

31
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,951
<i>to break those chains once and for aII.</i>

32
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,621
<i>Live or die, Troy. Make your choice.</i>

33
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,809
This was the bomb.

34
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,980
AII he had to do was reIease himseIf
from each of the chains,

35
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,902
waIk out the door before it went off.

36
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,281
AII he had to do?

37
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,702
Oh, God!

38
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,198
Fuck! Fuck!

39
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,677
I reaIIy had this feeIing
it was going to be him.

40
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,932
Kerry, Eric is a missing-person case,
not a homicide case.

41
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:07,063
I've been having nightmares
where I see him.

42
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,863
I'm never going to be abIe
to forgive myseIf for what happened.

43
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,324
Listen, it's not your fauIt.

44
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,160
-It's aIways somebody's fauIt.
-Yeah, but that somebody isn't you.

45
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,537
That someone is stiII out there,

46
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:28,126
so put aII your anger into finding them
and putting them away, aII right?

47
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:33,506
What I don't understand is,
how the heII couId Jigsaw do aII of this?

48
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,718
He was damn near on his deathbed
the Iast time we saw him.

49
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,555
I'm not so sure he did.

50
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,932
So far,
this doesn't foIIow any of his patterns.

51
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:47,520
-Meaning?
-WeII, how did you get in here?

52
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,356
-We cut the door down.
-Why?

53
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,442
Because somebody heard an expIosion
and caIIed us.

54
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,362
I mean,
why did you have to cut the door down?

55
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,406
It was weIded shut.
BIoody truck couIdn't get in here.

56
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,076
-ExactIy.
-I don't foIIow.

57
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,912
If the aim of Jigsaw's game
was to get out before the bomb went off,

58
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,164
then why was the door weIded shut?

59
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,083
The guy couIdn't get out if he wanted to.

60
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,419
You won't beIieve this.
We got the tape out cIean.

61
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,473
<i>Hello, Troy.</i>

62
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,142
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

63
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,897
<i>Live or die, Troy. Make your choice.</i>

64
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,518
<i>Hello, Kerry.</i>

65
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,855
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

66
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,233
<i>Up until now,</i>
<i>you have spent your life among the dead,</i>

67
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,443
<i>piecing together their final moments.</i>

68
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:27,240
<i>You are good at this</i>
<i>because you, like them, are also dead,</i>

69
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,285
<i>dead on the inside.</i>

70
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:36,291
<i>You identify more with a cold corpse</i>
<i>than you do with a living human.</i>

71
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,377
<i>I believe you want to join your true family,</i>

72
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,589
<i>indeed your only family, in death.</i>

73
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:48,011
<i>The device you are wearing</i>
<i>is hooked into your ribcage,</i>

74
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:53,975
<i>and by the time this tape is finished,</i>
<i>you will have one minute to find a way out.</i>

75
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,643
<i>At the end of that minute,</i>

76
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:59,981
<i>you should know better than anyone</i>
<i>what happens then.</i>

77
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,651
<i>There is a simple key</i>
<i>that will unlock the harness, Kerry.</i>

78
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,320
<i>It is right in front of you.</i>

79
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:09,073
<i>All you have to do is reach in and take it,</i>

80
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,076
<i>but do it quickly.</i>

81
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:16,247
<i>The acid will dissolve the key</i>
<i>in a matter of seconds.</i>

82
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,334
<i>Make your choice.</i>

83
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,290
No!

84
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,429
You.

85
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,554
I've got to be at the hospitaI by 9:00.

86
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,476
It's Tuesday. I thought you started at 1 1 :00.

87
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,146
Yeah, weII,
they change things on me Iast minute.

88
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,565
WeII, you better head off, then.

89
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,282
You're not gonna take a shower?

90
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,284
No.

91
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,455
I'm just going to take a shower
at the hospitaI.

92
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:06,125
Can we just taIk for five minutes?

93
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,546
Okay, how about we just make eye contact
for five seconds?

94
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,381
What's wrong?

95
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:16,511
Nothing. Just everything.

96
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,389
Lynn.

97
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,184
What is it you want from me, Chris?

98
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,104
A divorce.

99
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,489
MVA.

100
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,660
-Car skidded into oncoming traffic.
-BP is 80...

101
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,702
-Pressure?
-80 over...

102
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,704
-PaIp.
-PuIse is thready.

103
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,748
Ready? One, two, three.

104
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,667
-Where's Lynn?
-Page Dr. DenIon.

105
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,876
Set up an art Iine.

106
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:54,674
<i>Dr. Lynn Denlon,</i>
<i>please report to Trauma immediately.</i>

107
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,802
Lynn!

108
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,847
Pressure's dropping rapidIy.

109
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,766
Pressure down to 70.
He's going into shock.

110
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,227
Get an OR ready. We gotta crack his chest.

111
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,563
-Do we get a boIus, 500 wide open?
-No.

112
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,858
What?

113
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,238
-No air entry on the right side.
-And?

114
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,782
Some bIood Ioss. There's tension pneumo.
Let's get a chest tube in him.

115
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,951
We gotta get him to an OR now.

116
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,079
His stats are dropping. He's going to code.

117
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,624
I'm doing it.

118
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,344
I'm getting a rush of air.

119
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,973
Stats are improving. Pressure back to 80.

120
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,683
Pressure normaI.

121
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,619
Look, if you've got something
on your mind, go upstairs to Psych.

122
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:08,080
Just don't bring it in here.
We don't have any seconds to spare, Lynn.

123
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,333
The woman standing in front of me
had to be dragged

124
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,461
from the Iocker room
to put a chest tube in a trauma patient?

125
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:16,297
Lynn DenIon shouId have been
the first one there.

126
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,384
Lynn.

127
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,261
<i>Lynn!</i>

128
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,506
What the heII?

129
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,882
I'm Iocked in!

130
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,342
Is anybody there?

131
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,177
HeIIo?

132
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,853
Anybody here?

133
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,479
Somebody heIp me!

134
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:39,315
HeIp! HeIp me!

135
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,611
HeIp!

136
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,244
Who are you? Who are you?

137
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,788
What is this?

138
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,000
What are you doing?

139
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,384
Are you gonna behave?

140
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,309
Let's go.

141
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,855
What is this pIace? What is this pIace?

142
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,990
What is this pIace?

143
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,502
Who are you? Who are you?

144
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,342
HeIIo, Dr. DenIon.

145
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:52,471
You may not remember me,
but I most certainIy remember you.

146
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:58,310
I was a guest at your hospitaI once.

147
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,274
Where am I?

148
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,028
Do you remember me?

149
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,373
I've seen you on teIevision.

150
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,586
Lawrence Gordon was your doctor.

151
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,297
I was his patient, and he was mine.

152
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,594
As you can see from that report,
my prognosis isn't good.

153
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,473
WouId you agree?

154
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,441
There's no preventative treatment
for what you have.

155
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,860
I remember you saying that
to me once before

156
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,738
in aImost the exact same tone.

157
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:54,158
Leave it to a doctor
to find such a coId, cIinicaI way

158
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,660
of saying I'm a dead man waIking.

159
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,706
Looking at me,
how Iong wouId you say I have Ieft?

160
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,750
I'd have to examine you.

161
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,587
Even then,
a frontaI-Iobe tumor is unpredictabIe.

162
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,757
The growth depends on the rate
of mitosis versus apoptosis...

163
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:14,470
I'm sorry, but is
aII this crude medicaI equipment around me

164
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:18,390
causing you to beIieve
that you're stiII inside a hospitaI?

165
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,767
No.

166
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:24,188
Then why are you speaking to me
in that graduate-schooI medicaI jargon?

167
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,192
Look at me!

168
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,404
Now, you Iook at me.

169
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,782
I asked you a simpIe question.

170
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:40,287
Based on your experience,
how Iong do you think I have Ieft?

171
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,581
It's not a simpIe answer.

172
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:47,002
Based on your fiIe, I'd say not Iong.

173
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,347
Death is a surprise party

174
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:03,102
unIess, of course,
you're aIready dead on the inside,

175
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,108
unIess you're the type of person

176
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,195
who swaIIows antidepressants
to hide the pain, huh?

177
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,658
Turns their back on their husband,
negIects their chiId,

178
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:22,746
who has every possibIe advantage in Iife
but chooses not to advance.

179
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,832
What do you want from me?

180
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,751
What do I want?

181
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,463
I want to pIay a game.

182
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,136
The ruIes of the game are simpIe.

183
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,265
The consequences
for breaking them are great.

184
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,392
Death.

185
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,439
You're being tested.
Your wiII is being tested,

186
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:53,277
your wiII to keep someone aIive.
Can you do that? Can you foIIow the ruIes

187
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:57,364
-and grant someone the gift of Iife?
-What is this? What is this? No, get it...

188
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,494
No! No! What is this?
What are you doing to me?

189
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:13,255
The device that you're wearing
is Iinked to my heart-rate monitor.

190
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:18,052
The second that heart-rate monitor
fIat-Iines or you move out of range,

191
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,055
an expIosion wiII go off in that coIIar.

192
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:25,559
Your Iife and my Iife
wiII end simuItaneousIy.

193
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,063
PIease, pIease don't do this to me.

194
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,690
I have a famiIy. I have a famiIy.

195
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,276
Let me give you the simpIe version.

196
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,947
You wiII keep him aIive, whatever it takes.

197
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:44,119
No excuses, no equivocations,

198
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,080


no crying.

199
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,666
What do you mean, keep him aIive?

200
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:55,964
Out there, on those screens,
we have another test subject.

201
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,258
A man.

202
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,972
He wiII face a series of tests.

203
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:09,937
You have to keep John aIive
untiI he makes it through.

204
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:14,775
If he compIetes aII of his tests,
and John is stiII breathing,

205
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,945
then I wiII remove your coIIar,

206
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,407
and you're free to go.

207
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:25,411
You're a vitaI piece of my puzzIe,
Dr. DenIon,

208
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:29,039
a criticaI part
of what couId be my finaI test.

209
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:34,211
Amanda, it's time to start our game.

210
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:06,869
HeIp!

211
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,251
HeIIo!

212
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,089
Is there anybody out there?

213
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,768
<i>Hello, Jeff.</i>

214
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,352
<i>Over the past few years,</i>

215
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:36,148
<i>you have become a shell</i>
<i>of your former self,</i>

216
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,359
<i>consumed with hatred and vengeance,</i>

217
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:43,113
<i>vengeance against the drunk driver</i>
<i>who killed your only son,</i>

218
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:47,993
<i>vengeance against the killer</i>
<i>who, to your surprise and dismay,</i>

219
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,663
<i>was set free after a hasty trial.</i>

220
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:57,377
<i>Today, however,</i>
<i>it is you who will be put on trial.</i>

221
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:01,924
<i>To escape from where you are,</i>
<i>you will have to face a series of tests.</i>

222
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:06,220
<i>You wiII have to suffer</i>
<i>to move forward through each of them,</i>

223
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:10,224
<i>but with each one,</i>
<i>you will also have a chance,</i>

224
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,893
<i>a chance to forgive.</i>

225
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,395
<i>When you complete the tests,</i>

226
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,774
<i>I promise you,</i>
<i>you will finally come face to face</i>

227
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,944
<i>with the man responsible</i>
<i>for the loss of your child.</i>

228
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:25,113
<i>That will be your ultimate test.</i>

229
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,658
<i>Can you forgive him?</i>

230
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,869
<i>You better hurry, though.</i>

231
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,914
<i>ln two hours, the doors will lock,</i>

232
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,125
<i>and this place will become your tomb.</i>

233
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,128
<i>This is what you've been waiting for, Jeff.</i>

234
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,172
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

235
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,383
HeIp!

236
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,704
You fucking kiIIed my son.

237
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,665
Don't you fucking beg.

238
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,960
Do you know who I am?

239
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:25,841
I'm your fucking teacher, you motherfucker.

240
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,644
This is what you fucking deserve.

241
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,958
Where is it?

242
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,168
What?

243
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,671
Where is it?

244
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,180
How many times?

245
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:18,727
How many times do I have to teII you
before you get it in your head?

246
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,479
I just wanted to sIeep with something.

247
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,023
No. No, you just nothing.

248
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:27,277
You don't touch things in DyIan's room,

249
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:32,991
okay?

250
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,252
I'm sorry, Daddy.

251
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,054
You know I Iove you, don't you?

252
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:43,353
What do you think Mommy wouId say
if she saw us Iike this?

253
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,275
I'm gonna go get ready for schooI.

254
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,341
<i>Daddy!</i>

255
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:40,410
HeIIo?

256
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,220
Hey!

257
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,507
AII right, John.
I need you to Iook at my nose.

258
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,925
Right here.

259
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,304
Look at my nose, pIease.

260
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,181
FoIIow my fIashIight.

261
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,399
TeII me if you feeI any pain, aII right?

262
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,484
That hurt?

263
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,658
It's begun.

264
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,287
He's out of the box.

265
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,252
So?

266
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,797
My 20-second anaIysis
without any medicaI equipment

267
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,883
is that his brain's herniating.

268
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,096
He needs to go to the hospitaI
and have an operation

269
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,140
to decompress his brain.

270
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,559
Come here.

271
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,311
-No, reaIIy. Come here.
-What?

272
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,479
-Come here.
-No.

273
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,106
-Let me ask you something.
-Oh, God!

274
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,984
Did I bring John to you,

275
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:21,488
or did I bring your seIf-centered ass
to him?

276
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,784
Now, you better start
fucking paying attention.

277
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,161
No one's going to any hospitaI.

278
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:35,085
I can't perform miracIes.
You're... You're giving him painkiIIers.

279
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,504
For a tumor Iike this,
he needs steroids, Prednisone.

280
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,672
Oh, good, yeah.

281
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,590
Maybe we couId try
some corticoid steroids,

282
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,300
you know, Iike Dexamethasone.

283
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:46,429
Why don't you fucking teII me something
that I don't know, you stupid cunt?

284
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:52,227
The onIy pIace that he can get those drugs
is in a hospitaI,

285
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,231
or eIse he's gonna die.

286
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,860
You are not a good Iistener.

287
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:05,073
I think you missed the part that if he dies,

288
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,034
you die.

289
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,204
You're asking me to do the impossibIe.

290
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,624
I'm not asking you. He is.

291
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,377
He chose you.

292
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,048
-Not me.
-Amanda!

293
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,761
Our doctor can't do
what's being asked of her

294
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,888
if you're threatening her.

295
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,851
The ruIes of our game
have been made very cIear.

296
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,854
You need to abide by those ruIes.

297
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,105
Sorry.

298
00:38:56,584 --> 00:39:00,128
Amanda! Amanda, I need your heIp.

299
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,505
Amanda, he needs oxygen.

300
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,591
Oxygen, Amanda!

301
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,676
Put the mask on his face.

302
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,807
I need you to hoId him down.

303
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,852
Tip his head to the side. You got it?

304
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,162
What are you doing?

305
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:37,040
Ativan? Do you have Ativan?

306
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,375
No!

307
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,921
Back off! Back off! Back off! Back off!

308
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,008
Stay with me, John.

309
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,803
You're aImost through this.
Stay with me, John.

310
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,184
Stay with me. We're aImost done with this.

311
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,794
Was that enough for you?

312
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,630
Are you ready to go to the hospitaI now?

313
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,716
He needs to have an operation.

314
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,680
-Okay.
-Okay.

315
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,307
But we do it here.

316
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,143
-We do it here.
-What?

317
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,936
What do you need?

318
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,355
I need anesthetic for a procedure Iike this.

319
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,690
Anesthetic, what eIse?

320
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,316
Even with an anesthetic...

321
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,277
Anesthetic, what eIse?

322
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,865
A power driII.

323
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,183
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

324
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:47,564
PIease, pIease, Iease, Iet me go.

325
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:53,319
PIease, why...
Why are you doing this to me?

326
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,698
Don't... Don't kiII me, okay? PIease!

327
00:42:56,782 --> 00:43:01,202
Wait. Key, key, key. Okay, come on.

328
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,412
Fuck!

329
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,040
-God!
-Fuck!

330
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,208
Okay.

331
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:12,005
PIease, pIease, I'm so coId.
I can't feeI my arms. PIease.

332
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,306
<i>Welcome to your first test, Jeff.</i>

333
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:24,392
<i>For the past three years,</i>
<i>you've cursed the name</i>

334
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:29,355
<i>of all those you thought were responsible</i>
<i>for the death of your son.</i>

335
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:32,692
<i>You fantasize those accountable will pay.</i>

336
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:37,447
<i>Well, you will find a woman</i>
<i>in front of you chained in place.</i>

337
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,074
<i>This will prevent her from running,</i>

338
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,202
<i>much Iike she did</i>
<i>on the day your son was hit.</i>

339
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,125
<i>Her name is Denica Scott.</i>

340
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:53,671
<i>She was the onIy witness present</i>
<i>at the scene of your son's untimely demise.</i>

341
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:04,098
<i>If not for her own self-absorption</i>
<i>and cowardice,</i>

342
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:08,728
<i>she could have brought</i>
<i>your son's killer to justice.</i>

343
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:13,191
<i>Now it is you</i>
<i>who has a chance to bring her to justice.</i>

344
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:19,614
<i>You alone can grant her the gift of life</i>
<i>before she freezes to death.</i>

345
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,949
<i>Behind the pipes on the back wall,</i>

346
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,744
<i>you will find the key</i>
<i>that will free her and bring you</i>

347
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:28,998
<i>one step closer to the man</i>
<i>responsible for the loss of your child.</i>

348
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:33,419
<i>Will you claim the key</i>
<i>to save only yourself?</i>

349
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,962
You have to heIp me!

350
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,091
<i>Or can you find it within you</i>
<i>to save another?</i>

351
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,010
<i>Make your choice.</i>

352
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,237
No!

353
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,125
I didn't do anything.

354
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,087
I didn't do anything to you!

355
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,006
That's exactIy it. You didn't do anything.

356
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,970
I'm fucking dying. PIease...

357
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,555
He died

358
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,558


in my arms.

359
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:33,604
My eight-year-oId son died in my arms.

360
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:04,343
I made a mistake.

361
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,221
I'm so sorry.

362
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,015
I'm human.

363
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:12,602
I'm human, just Iike your son was, okay?

364
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,273
Look at me.

365
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,902
I said, Iook at me. Look...

366
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:27,074
Oh, my God.

367
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,368
It's so coId.

368
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,281
Oh, God!

369
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:53,239
Amanda, if you reaIIy care about John,

370
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,074
you won't Iet me do this to him.

371
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,618
You're a smart woman,
and you know what's right for him.

372
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,869
I'm sorry.

373
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,413
I know it's hard to concentrate

374
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:03,582
when you're surrounded by so many things
you couId kiII me with,

375
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,085
Iike this ax I saw you Iooking at.

376
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,171
Take it.

377
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,007
PIease, it's yours.

378
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,384
Come on.

379
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,972
I'd go for the neck,
but I'm not the brain surgeon.

380
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:20,641
Just do it quietIy
so John doesn't hear me die.

381
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:25,396
Otherwise, he's IikeIy to get upset,
rip off his heart-rate monitor. Boom.

382
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,691
Then you just have to find the sensor
and disarm it

383
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,027
so you can waIk more
than 30 feet out that door

384
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,862
without the coIIar detonating,

385
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:36,532
or you couId try and take
the coIIar off yourseIf,

386
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,284
but that couId be tricky.

387
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,370
The sIightest knock
in the wrong pIace couId trigger it.

388
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,955
I shouId know.

389
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,334
I buiIt it.

390
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:55,092
So do you have everything you need?

391
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:59,388
I have the instruments
to cut someone open.

392
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,141
I don't have the tooIs to save a Iife.

393
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,644
You'd be surprised
what tooIs can save a Iife.

394
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,443
<i>Hello, Amanda.</i>

395
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:58,489
<i>You don't know me, but I know you.</i>

396
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,076
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

397
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,039
<i>There's only one key to open the device.</i>

398
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,879
<i>It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.</i>

399
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,261
<i>Look around, Amanda.</i>

400
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,139
<i>Know that I'm not playing.</i>

401
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,640
<i>Live or die.</i>

402
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,226
<i>Make your choice.</i>

403
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,944
<i>CongratuIations. You are stiII aIive.</i>

404
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:42,449
<i>Most people are so ungrateful to be alive,</i>

405
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:45,077
<i>but not you, not anymore.</i>

406
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:50,416
Amanda, do not be afraid.

407
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,043
<i>Your life has just begun.</i>

408
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,272
He made it through the freezer room.

409
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,319
He tried to save her.

410
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:32,750
There are some things

411
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,296
I need you to do for me.

412
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:42,051
In my desk, in the center drawer,

413
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,636
an enveIope

414
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,639
with your name on it.

415
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,436
She's gonna do a procedure on you.

416
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:56,815
-Yeah?
-To reIieve the pressure on your brain...

417
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,152
-Yeah?
-...and heIp with the headaches.

418
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,079
I can't do this.

419
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,665
Amanda, you can.

420
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,583
You can.

421
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,460
You're stronger now,

422
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,589
and I beIieve in you.

423
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,847
You chose her 'cause she's the best, right?

424
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,893
That's one reason I chose her.

425
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:24,254
Damn it!

426
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,632
HeIIo?

427
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,967
HeIp me, pIease!

428
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,099
PIease, heIp me!

429
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,561
I'm in here!

430
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,025
PIease get me out of here!

431
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,319
HeIp me! I...

432
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,200
HeIIo?

433
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,994
I know you're there.

434
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,122
PIease! PIease heIp me!

435
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:05,504
I can hear you. PIease, answer me!

436
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,506
HeIp me!

437
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,802
PIease!

438
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,679
HeIp me!

439
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:20,018
Get me out of here, pIease! PIease heIp me!

440
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:21,562
Get me out of here!

441
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,855
PIease!

442
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,400
Don't just stand there! HeIp me!

443
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,491
<i>Jeff, when the judge</i>
<i>presiding over your case</i>

444
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:39,413
<i>sentenced your boy's murderer so lightly,</i>
<i>your soul never recovered.</i>

445
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:44,293
<i>Now you have the power to sentence</i>
<i>his soul straight to hell,</i>

446
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:46,420
<i>or you can forgive.</i>

447
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:50,424
<i>The key that will free him</i>
<i>is hidden inside your son's possessions,</i>

448
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:55,179
<i>possessions you have clung to</i>
<i>for far too long.</i>

449
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:59,683
<i>Now, if you flip the switch</i>
<i>on the incinerator underneath you,</i>

450
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:04,021
<i>a fire will cleanse you of this obsession</i>
<i>and destroy them all,</i>

451
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:06,398
<i>leaving only the key remaining.</i>

452
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,901
<i>It is also the key that will bring you closer</i>

453
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:12,529
<i>to the man accountabIe</i>
<i>for taking your child.</i>

454
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,616
<i>He doesn't have much time, Jeff.</i>
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

455
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,243
PIease get me out of here. PIease!

456
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,916
What is that?

457
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,131
What's that sound?

458
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,382
I'm a criminaI court judge, for Christ's sake!

459
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,133
You can't do this to me!

460
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,637
You don't remember me?

461
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,811
WeII, maybe you remember
Timothy Young?

462
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,904
He was the driver who kiIIed my son.

463
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,990
You gave him six months!

464
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:42,327
Okay, aII right, we can taIk about your case.

465
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,162
ObviousIy you want answers.

466
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,665
I can't give them to you Iike this.

467
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,667
Does this hurt?

468
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,087
You give more for fucking parking tickets!

469
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,589
Listen to me.

470
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,550
I can see that you're in a great deaI of pain,

471
00:59:56,634 --> 01:00:00,345
but there are ways
that we can have his sentence extended.

472
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:01,847
I can heIp you!

473
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:03,682
It's too Iate!

474
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,934
They Iet him go!

475
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,020
Don't become what he is!

476
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,273
Don't become a kiIIer!

477
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:14,526
PIease, I have a son, too.

478
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,203
Where are you going?

479
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,665
You gotta heIp me!

480
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,380
I'm so sorry!

481
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,637
Oh, God.

482
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,931
You're kiIIing me!

483
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:49,603
Don't do this to me! I'm gonna die!

484
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:57,903
Fuck you!

485
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,822
Fuck you, you...

486
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,574
You gotta heIp me!

487
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,242
Shut the fuck up.

488
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,659
HeIp!

489
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:45,969
Come on!

490
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,899
He made it through the second test.

491
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,693
The judge is aIive.

492
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,571
Faster than I expected.

493
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:50,617
AII right, John, I need you
to keep your head to the side

494
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:52,160
and keep stiII.

495
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:56,414
What's going on here is that your brain
is pushing against your skuII.

496
01:03:56,457 --> 01:04:00,710
I'm gonna try to reIieve the pressure
by cutting away a IittIe bit of your skuII.

497
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:05,298
It shouId heIp you with your headaches
and drasticaIIy improve your motor skiIIs.

498
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,551
Do you understand?

499
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:09,594
AII too weII.

500
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:21,690
AII right, you're gonna feeI
some sIight discomfort.

501
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,110
Are you gonna give him
a generaI anesthetic?

502
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:28,655
For a procedure Iike this,
the patient needs to be fuIIy aIert.

503
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,497
Okay.

504
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:19,789
Amanda, I need you here.

505
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:22,918
Amanda.

506
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:28,465
AII right, John,
you're gonna feeI some pressure.

507
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:42,103
Let's cIip this, stop the bIeeding.

508
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,870
FiII that syringe
with aIcohoI from that bowI.

509
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,042
Hurry.

510
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:15,762
AII right, John,
I need you to keep your mouth cIosed.

511
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:18,264
You're gonna hear a Iot of noise.

512
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:19,951
-John, how you doing?
-Never better.

513
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,621
AII right.

514
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:36,634
AII right, you're gonna hear a Iot of ringing.

515
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:38,970
I need you to stay very stiII.

516
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,598
Here I go.

517
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:28,103
AII right, John, I'm gonna remove the skuII.

518
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:55,630
He's stabiIized.

519
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:01,219
John, I need you to raise your hand
and fIex your fingers.

520
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,935
John?

521
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,771
John, raise your hand.

522
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,733
John, can you hear me?

523
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,654
What's happening?

524
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,407
John.

525
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,326
What's happening to him?

526
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,078
What's happening?

527
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:30,290
What's wrong?

528
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:38,631
<i>What's wrong?</i>

529
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,093
Why isn't he moving?

530
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,929
Do something!

531
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:46,931
PIease.

532
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,187
Stay with me, John.

533
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:55,773
Good.

534
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,110
-I Iove you.
-I Iove you.

535
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:03,281
Breathe! Breathe, damn it! Breathe, John.

536
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,658
I Iove...

537
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:07,619
Breathe.

538
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:13,208
I...

539
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,002
I Iove you.

540
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:52,330
You wiII give everything to me.

541
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,251
Every ceII in your body.

542
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,921
Is that understood?

543
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:02,131
Yes.

544
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:09,264
The marks on your arms,
they're from another Iife.

545
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,184
We'II Ieave that Iife behind.

546
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:18,022
When you go down that corridor,

547
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:26,447
there is no turning back.
Do you understand that?

548
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,201
Yes.

549
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:32,745
Then start with this.

550
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,591
Go.

551
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:10,825
<i>Who is that?</i>

552
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,453
<i>Who's in there?</i>

553
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:20,251
<i>I'll kill you, you motherfucker!</i>

554
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:35,118
Put his Ieft Ieg in the shackIe.

555
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:02,788
It's time to start our game.

556
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:32,777
What's that?

557
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:37,740
SIow my heart rate, reIax my muscIes.

558
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,579
It's time.

559
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:49,919
CIose the door behind you.

560
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,229
He can't hear you.

561
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:34,732
He doesn't even know you're there.

562
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,159
Amanda.

563
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:48,079
Put it away.

564
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:49,914
Trust me.

565
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:52,541
Put it away.

566
01:17:57,297 --> 01:17:58,881
Leave us aIone.

567
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:01,092
Now.

568
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:03,844
You fucking freak.

569
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:08,224
I apoIogize for her behavior.

570
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,477
She swims in my sea.

571
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:17,650
In the end, she wiII be the cIosest
I've ever come to a connection,

572
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:19,735
to being understood,

573
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:26,909
but her emotion is aIso her weakness.

574
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:19,003
Adam.

575
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:30,639
Come here. I'm gonna heIp you.

576
01:19:31,975 --> 01:19:33,726
I'm gonna heIp you.

577
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:39,774
I'm gonna free you.

578
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:08,779
I'm so sorry about your son, Jeff,

579
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:14,952
but Iet me teII you something that I...
That I know for sure.

580
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:18,664
No sentence I gave him, not 500 years,

581
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:22,334
not even death, nothing,
wiII take your pain away,

582
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:26,797
and vengeance doesn't soIve anything.

583
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,717
It onIy makes the pain greater, Jeff.

584
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:54,325
What the... What the fuck?

585
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,328
Somebody heIp me!

586
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,456
What the fuck?

587
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:04,585
HeIp.

588
01:22:10,508 --> 01:22:13,260
What the... What the fuck are you doing?

589
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:17,264
PIease heIp me.

590
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:20,392
<i>Hello, Jeff.</i>

591
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:22,144
<i>If you are listening to this,</i>

592
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:26,857
<i>that means that the confrontation</i>
<i>you so long dreamed of</i>

593
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,734
<i>is finally unfolding.</i>

594
01:22:28,818 --> 01:22:30,527
Do something!

595
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:35,616
<i>In your head, he is a cipher,</i>
<i>a symbol of your life changing,</i>

596
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:36,951
<i>a symbol of death.</i>

597
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:41,205
<i>I present him to you now</i>
<i>as a simple human being.</i>

598
01:22:42,582 --> 01:22:44,083
<i>His name is Timothy Young.</i>

599
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:45,793
<i>He's 27 years old,</i>

600
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:48,462
<i>a medicaI student</i>
<i>with a mother and a father</i>

601
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:50,214
<i>just like you,</i>

602
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:54,301
<i>a man whose life also changed</i>
<i>the day your son died.</i>

603
01:22:58,556 --> 01:23:01,141
<i>That day, he made a terrible mistake.</i>

604
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:12,236
<i>You believe he didn't pay for that mistake,</i>
<i>and now is your chance to make him pay.</i>

605
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:16,991
<i>The device Timothy is strapped to</i>
<i>is my personal favorite.</i>

606
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:18,534
<i>I caII it the rack.</i>

607
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:27,418
<i>The human body is a miraculous creation.</i>

608
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:31,338
<i>Ever wonder how far the arm can twist?</i>

609
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:34,341
<i>This device is going to start twisting.</i>

610
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:37,136
<i>There is a chance he might live,</i>
<i>though, with your help.</i>

611
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:38,262
PIease.

612
01:23:38,304 --> 01:23:40,681
<i>To your right is a box.</i>

613
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:43,100
<i>At the back of the box is a key.</i>

614
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:45,978
<i>It's tied to the trigger of a shotgun.</i>

615
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:48,772
<i>The question you have to ask yourself</i>
<i>is this.</i>

616
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:53,277
<i>-Are you willing...</i>
-Have mercy!

617
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:56,447
<i>...to take a buIIet for the man</i>
<i>who killed your son?</i>

618
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:59,742
<i>Does "Do unto others</i>
<i>as you would have them do unto you"</i>

619
01:23:59,784 --> 01:24:01,618
<i>apply here, Jeff?</i>

620
01:24:01,661 --> 01:24:03,203
<i>Make your choice.</i>

621
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,004
My God.

622
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,516
You've got to heIp him, Jeff!

623
01:25:12,732 --> 01:25:13,816
Fuck!

624
01:25:13,858 --> 01:25:17,528
PIease stop! Stop! Stop! PIease stop!

625
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:40,134
Jeff!

626
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:43,220
Just standing there,
you're an accompIice to murder.

627
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:46,306
Are you a murderer?

628
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,267
I've wanted to kiII him every day.

629
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:52,187
-Oh, my God!
-For three years, I wanted to kiII you.

630
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:54,898
Yeah, maybe I am.

631
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,526
-You'II Iose your famiIy.
-Oh, my God!

632
01:25:57,569 --> 01:26:00,696
-Your wife, your daughter.
-Oh, God!

633
01:26:03,074 --> 01:26:04,199
Fuck!

634
01:26:14,919 --> 01:26:16,170
Oh, God.

635
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,257
Okay.

636
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:24,928
HoId on, son.

637
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:50,120
HoId on. Don't give up.

638
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:51,663
Come on, son.

639
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:54,625
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

640
01:26:56,127 --> 01:26:57,211
Son.

641
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,307
Got the key.

642
01:27:25,448 --> 01:27:29,076
HeIp me!

643
01:27:37,543 --> 01:27:39,253
-HeIp me!
-Stop!

644
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:42,172
I forgive him!

645
01:27:45,009 --> 01:27:47,719
I forgive him! No!

646
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:49,513
No!

647
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,224
God!

648
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:56,144
God damn you!

649
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:31,888
Don't you think it wouId be wise

650
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:35,058
to engage me in conversation
for your own sake?

651
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:38,603
I asked you to teII me about your husband.

652
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:46,403
-It's Iike we're strangers now.
-And?

653
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:52,034
The Iast time I saw him,
we were so disconnected,

654
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:53,410
but now

655
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:59,916
I'd give anything in the worId

656
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:05,255
to see my husband.

657
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,633
Matrimony's aIways fascinated me.

658
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:11,261
Husbands bareIy abIe to Iook at their wives,

659
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:15,599
wives on their backs
in moteI rooms with perfect strangers,

660
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:18,935
peopIe who bear chiIdren
onIy to negIect them.

661
01:29:18,978 --> 01:29:21,313
"TiII death do us part," indeed.

662
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:24,775
I don't know what you think you know,

663
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:27,486
but my marriage
has survived more suffering

664
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:30,238
than someone Iike you couId ever grasp.

665
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:31,656
Suffering?

666
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:34,993
You haven't seen anything yet.

667
01:29:37,246 --> 01:29:39,539
Someone Iike me? Who am I?

668
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:40,957
A monster.

669
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:43,043
A murderer.

670
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:44,669
I don't condone murder,

671
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:48,382
and I despise murderers.

672
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:49,633
PIease.

673
01:29:56,307 --> 01:29:58,850
PIease, Iet me go.

674
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,568
We're fine, Amanda. We don't need you.

675
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:14,741
I said, we're fine.

676
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:29,005
If you make it through this, Lynn,

677
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,883
you're going to thank me one day
just as Amanda did.

678
01:30:39,475 --> 01:30:42,477
PIease, Iet me go.

679
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:45,772
I saved your Iife.

680
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:49,317
Maybe my Iife isn't the one
you were saving after aII.

681
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:57,826
TeII me about your daughter.
I understand she's quite a IittIe athIete.

682
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:08,211
-Or we couId taIk about your son.
-What did you say?

683
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:16,052
Why are you Iiving with the dead
when you have such a beautifuI famiIy?

684
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:19,222
A husband who's indeed aIone,

685
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:23,643
a daughter who needs her mother,

686
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:27,272
patients who need a competent physician
who Iooks them in the eye

687
01:31:27,356 --> 01:31:30,192
and treats them Iike human beings?

688
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:32,527
He's compIeted the third test.

689
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:36,531
CongratuIations, Lynn. You're free to go.

690
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:40,744
Yeah, but he's not aII the way out yet.

691
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:45,415
Undo her coIIar, Amanda, and Iet her go.

692
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:49,419
No, he's not finished. He's not aII the way.

693
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:53,423
Amanda, Lynn is more important
than you know.

694
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:56,635
UnIock her coIIar, and Iet her go.

695
01:31:58,054 --> 01:31:59,429
I said no.

696
01:32:03,809 --> 01:32:06,686
-Amanda, there are ruIes.
-I said no!

697
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:10,941
She doesn't deserve to go free.

698
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:13,568
-You promised.
-I didn't promise you shit.

699
01:32:13,611 --> 01:32:15,946
Amanda, even with that gun,

700
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:21,076
it is Lynn who hoIds your Iife in her hands.

701
01:32:21,118 --> 01:32:25,705
Fuck you. You give her controI over me?
Fuck you!

702
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:28,250
I won't teII anyone. I promise I won't.

703
01:32:28,292 --> 01:32:29,459
PIease, I have a famiIy.

704
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:32,295
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!

705
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,756
And stop fucking moving around!

706
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:38,134
And what about the other test subjects
that we Ieft aIive?

707
01:32:38,177 --> 01:32:40,720
-Game over.
-I'II fucking kiII you!

708
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:44,724
-What about them?
-Is that how you feIt about them?

709
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:49,980
Is that how you feIt about Eric Matthews?

710
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:52,649
-Eric Matthews.
-Oh, my God! Let me go.

711
01:32:53,192 --> 01:32:56,236
I'II teII you how I feIt about Eric Matthews.

712
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:27,267
DanieI!

713
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:34,190
-Fuck!
-DanieI!

714
01:33:46,245 --> 01:33:47,454
DanieI?

715
01:34:17,943 --> 01:34:19,069
Fuck!

716
01:35:26,762 --> 01:35:28,304
Where's my son?

717
01:35:30,599 --> 01:35:33,643
-Where is he, you junkie bitch?
-Fuck you.

718
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,440
Where is he?

719
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:54,247
TeII me where he is.

720
01:35:54,331 --> 01:35:57,250
-TeII me where he is.
-Right fucking here.

721
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:17,937
You bitch!

722
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,778
You're nothing, bitch!

723
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:28,406
You're nothing!

724
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:35,705
You're not Jigsaw.

725
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:42,670
You're not Jigsaw, bitch!

726
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:53,556
You hear me?

727
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:56,392
You're nothing!

728
01:36:59,396 --> 01:37:01,439
You're not Jigsaw, bitch.

729
01:37:04,902 --> 01:37:06,486
You're nothing!

730
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:12,742
I'II fucking kiII you!

731
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:14,118
No!

732
01:37:14,203 --> 01:37:17,038
That's right. I'm a murderer.

733
01:37:18,165 --> 01:37:22,877
He took my Iife from me,
so I just returned the fucking favor.

734
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:26,130
No, Amanda, that's what you thought,

735
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:28,550
but I know different.

736
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:32,762
-You Ieft him for dead, didn't you?
-Just stop fucking with me.

737
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:38,017
But I cIeaned up your mistakes,
and I forgave you for them.

738
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,688
Let me go! PIease!

739
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:45,441
What you do is no different than murder.

740
01:37:45,484 --> 01:37:48,444
You torture peopIe. You watch them die.

741
01:37:48,487 --> 01:37:51,197
But now you're begging me
not to kiII this worthIess bitch

742
01:37:51,282 --> 01:37:52,991
on the grounds of some game?

743
01:37:53,075 --> 01:37:56,244
You're waIking us
toward a precipice, Amanda.

744
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:58,663
-Step back.
-It's buIIshit.

745
01:37:58,747 --> 01:38:02,166
Nobody changes. It's aII a Iie.

746
01:38:02,251 --> 01:38:04,419
If you faiI in this, we aII faiI.

747
01:38:04,461 --> 01:38:06,546
Succeed, and we aII succeed.

748
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:08,006
It's a Iie!

749
01:38:13,762 --> 01:38:16,639
I'II teII you, she hasn't changed

750
01:38:16,682 --> 01:38:18,975
because nobody fucking changes.

751
01:38:20,644 --> 01:38:23,771
Nobody is reborn. It's aII buIIshit!

752
01:38:23,814 --> 01:38:25,648
It's aII a fucking Iie,

753
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:28,526
and I'm just a pawn in your stupid games.

754
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:43,833
I don't mean anything to you.

755
01:38:43,876 --> 01:38:46,544
No, you mean everything to me.

756
01:38:46,629 --> 01:38:48,046
Fuck you!

757
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:49,923
Our fates are Iinked.

758
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:54,302
I've tried to heIp you, Amanda.

759
01:38:54,345 --> 01:38:57,347
So heIp me! Fix me!

760
01:38:58,682 --> 01:39:00,516
Fix me, motherfucker!

761
01:39:01,852 --> 01:39:03,853
I'm standing right here.

762
01:39:08,692 --> 01:39:11,027
Why is she so important to you?

763
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:14,530
She's not important to me.

764
01:39:15,824 --> 01:39:19,452
-She's important to you.
-She's not important to me.

765
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:23,706
I beg you to reconsider that.

766
01:39:29,713 --> 01:39:31,381
This is your Iast chance, Amanda.

767
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:32,966
She's nothing.

768
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,901
Your time's running out.

769
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:57,073
Now, you think about what you're doing.

770
01:40:00,536 --> 01:40:03,287
Think about everything that you've done.

771
01:40:10,504 --> 01:40:13,131
You think about what you promised me.

772
01:40:13,215 --> 01:40:15,133
Think about our dreams.

773
01:40:16,301 --> 01:40:18,136
You think about tomorrow.

774
01:40:20,764 --> 01:40:21,889
Lynn?

775
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:23,766
Jeff! Jeff!

776
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:29,897
Lynn.

777
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:31,899
-Lynn.
-Jeff.

778
01:40:32,735 --> 01:40:34,986
You just destroyed four Iives.

779
01:40:35,612 --> 01:40:37,697
You just murdered Jeff's wife.

780
01:40:57,801 --> 01:40:58,885
Baby.

781
01:40:59,553 --> 01:41:00,762
Amanda.

782
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:04,766
It's okay.

783
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:12,315
This was your test,

784
01:41:14,109 --> 01:41:15,610
your game.

785
01:41:17,154 --> 01:41:18,571
What do I want?

786
01:41:18,655 --> 01:41:20,031
I want to pIay a game.

787
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:25,161
You're being tested.
Your wiII is being tested,

788
01:41:25,245 --> 01:41:29,916
your wiII to keep someone aIive.
Can you do that? Can you foIIow the ruIes

789
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,335
and grant someone the gift of Iife?

790
01:41:34,546 --> 01:41:37,548
I was testing you. I took you in.

791
01:41:38,342 --> 01:41:39,842
You wiII give everything to me.

792
01:41:39,885 --> 01:41:41,177
Yes.

793
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,553
Every ceII in your body.

794
01:41:42,638 --> 01:41:47,683
<i>I selected you for the honor</i>
<i>of carrying on my life's work,</i>

795
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:49,727
<i>but you didn't.</i>

796
01:41:49,812 --> 01:41:51,062
That's right.

797
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:53,481
I'm a murderer.

798
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:55,316
I despise murderers.

799
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:57,276
You didn't test anyone's wiII to Iive.

800
01:41:57,361 --> 01:41:58,694
Game over.

801
01:41:59,947 --> 01:42:02,615
<i>Instead you took away their only chance.</i>

802
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:04,826
<i>Your games were unwinnable,</i>

803
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:07,495
<i>your subjects, merely victims.</i>

804
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:08,913
You.

805
01:42:09,873 --> 01:42:13,042
There is no turning back.
Do you understand that?

806
01:42:13,085 --> 01:42:18,631
<i>In my desperation,</i>
<i>I decided to give you one last chance,</i>

807
01:42:18,715 --> 01:42:21,551
<i>so I put everything in place.</i>

808
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:24,679
You chose her 'cause she's the best, right?

809
01:42:24,721 --> 01:42:26,097
That's one reason I chose her.

810
01:42:26,181 --> 01:42:30,560
<i>You didn't know that Lynn and Jeff</i>
<i>were husband and wife.</i>

811
01:42:31,353 --> 01:42:35,731
I had to keep that from you
for the purposes of my game.

812
01:42:35,774 --> 01:42:38,234
<i>I had to leave out the ruined marriage,</i>

813
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:40,486
<i>the cheating wife,</i>

814
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:45,825
<i>the vengeful husband,</i>
<i>the neglected daughter,</i>

815
01:42:46,451 --> 01:42:49,996
<i>and I let you make your own choices.</i>

816
01:42:51,915 --> 01:42:54,167
I wanted you to succeed.

817
01:42:55,085 --> 01:42:56,127
Amanda.

818
01:42:56,211 --> 01:42:57,920
Put it away.

819
01:42:58,005 --> 01:42:59,046
Trust me.

820
01:42:59,089 --> 01:43:00,256
Even with that gun,

821
01:43:00,299 --> 01:43:03,759
it is Lynn who hoIds your Iife in her hands.

822
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:05,595
She's not important to me.

823
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:08,306
I beg you to reconsider that.

824
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:10,433
UnIock her coIIar, and Iet her go.

825
01:43:10,517 --> 01:43:11,684
I said no.

826
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:15,104
The ruIes of our game
have been made very cIear.

827
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:17,607
You need to abide by those ruIes.

828
01:43:19,568 --> 01:43:21,027
You couIdn't.

829
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:28,159
God.

830
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:45,843
Game over.

831
01:43:57,856 --> 01:44:00,233
You haven't Iearned anything tonight,
have you?

832
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:04,153
Your rage and your vengeance
wiII onIy hurt the ones you Iove.

833
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:07,657
KiIIing me wiII onIy add to your misery.

834
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:10,785
It wiII not bring back your son.

835
01:44:10,827 --> 01:44:12,828
Think of your daughter, Jeff.

836
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:15,331
She needs you now more than ever.

837
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:18,960
You can't kiII me, Jeff.

838
01:44:28,845 --> 01:44:30,846
Your wife's dying, Jeff.

839
01:44:32,015 --> 01:44:33,975
Her time's running out.

840
01:44:42,025 --> 01:44:45,736
Jeff, do not miscaIcuIate.

841
01:44:45,821 --> 01:44:47,697
Your fate is in my hands.

842
01:44:47,739 --> 01:44:50,700
Your wife's fate is in my hands.

843
01:44:50,784 --> 01:44:54,704
I Iove you.

844
01:44:58,542 --> 01:45:00,584
I'm taking you home, okay?

845
01:45:01,336 --> 01:45:04,422
Though you may not see any threat,

846
01:45:04,506 --> 01:45:07,258
there are threats aII around you.

847
01:45:07,342 --> 01:45:10,011
Jeff, if you try to move your wife,
she wiII die.

848
01:45:10,053 --> 01:45:13,180
I can have an ambuIance here
in four minutes.

849
01:45:13,223 --> 01:45:15,766
WouId you Iike to take your wife
out of here tonight?

850
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:17,601
WouId you Iike to take her to safety?

851
01:45:17,686 --> 01:45:19,729
-Stay.
-Stand and face me, Jeff.

852
01:45:19,813 --> 01:45:22,231
-Stay with me, pIease.
-Right now.

853
01:45:23,775 --> 01:45:28,070
WouId you Iike to get your Iife back?
WouId you, Jeff?

854
01:45:28,113 --> 01:45:30,072
We can make that happen.

855
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:33,909
Which is it, Jeff?

856
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:36,620
Come on, yes or no?

857
01:45:36,705 --> 01:45:37,747
Yes.

858
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:43,753
-What do you want?
-One finaI test.

859
01:45:43,795 --> 01:45:45,254
The ruIes are simpIe.

860
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:49,675
Over on that tabIe,
there's a host of vicious impIements,

861
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:54,847
which you can use
to exact your pound of fIesh,

862
01:45:54,931 --> 01:45:56,515
to take your vengeance,

863
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,435
to induIge your obsession,

864
01:46:00,187 --> 01:46:05,107
or you can choose
to put your vengeance aside,

865
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:06,942
and you can forgive.

866
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:14,700
You can forgive me for the pain
that I've caused you and your wife tonight.

867
01:46:15,952 --> 01:46:19,622
-Jeff.
-Which is it gonna be, Jeff?

868
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:25,878
Honey, don't do it.

869
01:46:25,962 --> 01:46:27,129
Jeff...

870
01:46:29,758 --> 01:46:31,384
It's up to you.

871
01:46:31,468 --> 01:46:33,928
-I need you.
-Live or die, Jeff?

872
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,306
Make our choice.

873
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:56,617
I forgive you.

874
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:04,708
Jeff...

875
01:47:05,627 --> 01:47:07,711
Jeff. Jeff!

876
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:18,681
Jeff, no.

877
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:34,613
I forgive you.

878
01:47:47,043 --> 01:47:48,544
<i>Hello, Jeff.</i>

879
01:47:48,628 --> 01:47:53,549
<i>I made this tape as an insurance policy,</i>
<i>if you will.</i>

880
01:47:53,633 --> 01:47:54,717
Jeff!

881
01:47:56,219 --> 01:48:00,181
<i>And if you're listening to it,</i>
<i>then it's time to coIIect.</i>

882
01:48:02,601 --> 01:48:05,895
<i>I was your final test of forgiveness,</i>

883
01:48:05,937 --> 01:48:09,148
<i>and if you are listening to this,</i>
<i>then you failed.</i>

884
01:48:11,067 --> 01:48:14,069
<i>Now you must pay the price,</i>

885
01:48:14,112 --> 01:48:17,072
<i>the price for living for nothing</i>
<i>but vengeance.</i>

886
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:20,743
<i>Now I will give you something to live for.</i>

887
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:24,079
<i>I told you that you couldn't kill me, Jeff,</i>

888
01:48:24,164 --> 01:48:26,290
<i>but I didn't tell you why,</i>

889
01:48:26,374 --> 01:48:28,000
<i>and the answer is simple.</i>

890
01:48:28,084 --> 01:48:31,962
<i>I am the person responsible</i>
<i>for the loss of your child.</i>

891
01:48:32,839 --> 01:48:38,093
<i>I am the only person</i>
<i>who knows where your daughter is.</i>

892
01:48:38,803 --> 01:48:41,889
<i>She onIy has a Iimited suppIy of air, Jeff,</i>

893
01:48:41,932 --> 01:48:43,724
<i>and if you want to get her back,</i>

894
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:45,893
<i>you'll have to play a game.</i>

895
01:48:51,733 --> 01:48:53,067
Jeff!
