1
00:00:38,178 --> 00:00:40,169
<i>...and I'll tell you what,
the storm system's still moving west.</i>
 
2
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,272
What are you looking at, Caroline?

2
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:45,875
The wind, Mom.

3
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:51,388
They say the hurricane is coming.

4
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:56,222
I'm on a boat.

5
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,593
I'm drifting.

6
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:03,232
Can I do anything for you, Mom?

7
00:01:04,604 --> 00:01:06,469
Make anything easier?

8
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,839
Oh, sugar...

9
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,639
There's nothing left to do.

10
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:13,737
Is what it is.

11
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:18,217
Finding it harder to keep my eyes open.

12
00:01:20,186 --> 00:01:23,314
My mouth's full of cotton.

13
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:25,983
There, there, Miss Daisy.

14
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:28,822
You gonna scratch yourself to ribbons.

15
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:36,531
Do you want any more
medication, Mother?

16
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:40,634
Doctor said you could have
as much as you want.

17
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,004
No need for anybody to suffer.

18
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:00,892
A friend told me
that she never had the chance

19
00:02:00,994 --> 00:02:03,292
to say goodbye to her mother.

20
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:08,764
- I wanted to...
- It's okay.

21
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:12,395
I wanted to tell you
how much I'm gonna miss you so...

22
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:13,964
Mom.

23
00:02:15,975 --> 00:02:17,738
Oh, Caroline.

24
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:25,039
Are you afraid?

25
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:26,846
I'm curious.

26
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:30,248
What comes next?

27
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:40,562
They built the train station in 1918.

28
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:44,331
My father was there the day it opened.

29
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,701
He said they had

30
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:51,940
a tuba band playing.

31
00:02:56,716 --> 00:03:00,777
They had the finest clockmaker
in all of the South

32
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:04,185
to build that glorious clock.

33
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:07,617
<i>His name was...</i>

34
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:11,326
Mr. Gateau.

35
00:03:15,702 --> 00:03:16,862
Mr. Cake.

36
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,603
<i>He was married to a Creole
of Evangeline Parish</i>

37
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,940
<i>and they had a son.</i>

38
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,977
<i>Mr. Gateau was, from birth,
absolutely blind.</i>

39
00:03:35,254 --> 00:03:39,486
<i>When their son was old enough,
he joined the army.</i>

40
00:03:40,426 --> 00:03:44,795
<i>And they prayed God would
keep him out of harm's way.</i>

41
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:52,467
<i>For months,
he did nothing but work on that clock.</i>

42
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:57,975
<i>One day,</i>

43
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:01,245
<i>a letter came.</i>

44
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:10,217
<i>And Mr. Gateau, done for the night,</i>

45
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:13,414
<i>went up, alone, to bed.</i>

46
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:18,893
<i>And their son came home.</i>

47
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,868
<i>They buried him in the family plot,</i>

48
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:30,875
<i>where he would be with them
when their time came.</i>

49
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,973
<i>Mr. Cake worked on his clock,</i>

50
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:42,446
<i>laboring to finish.</i>

51
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:47,690
<i>It was a morning to remember.</i>

52
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:52,123
<i>Papa said
there were people everywhere.</i>

53
00:04:53,566 --> 00:04:56,126
<i>Even Teddy Roosevelt came.</i>

54
00:05:13,886 --> 00:05:15,751
It's running backwards!

55
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,119
I made it that way

56
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:22,591
so that perhaps the boys
that we lost in the war

57
00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:24,060
might stand and come home again.

58
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,401
<i>Home to farm,</i>

59
00:05:31,504 --> 00:05:32,698
<i>work,</i>

60
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:35,968
<i>have children.</i>

61
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:41,746
<i>To live long, full lives.</i>

62
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:47,613
Perhaps my own son
might come home again.

63
00:05:56,295 --> 00:05:58,820
I'm sorry if I've offended anybody.

64
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,663
I hope you enjoy my clock.

65
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:07,437
<i>Mr. Cake was never seen again.</i>

66
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:16,214
<i>Some say he died of a broken heart.</i>

67
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:20,248
<i>Some say he went to sea.</i>

68
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:26,551
Excuse me.

69
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:29,219
Do you mind if I make a call?
Somebody's watching my little boy.

70
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:30,556
Sure.

71
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:43,036
I hope I haven't disappointed you.

72
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:46,236
You couldn't disappoint me.

73
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:52,582
Well, I know I don't have much
to show for myself.

74
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:57,588
Find my dark suitcase.

75
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:04,862
There's a diary.

76
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,091
This?

77
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:13,737
Could you read it to me?

78
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,538
Is this what you want to do?

79
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:20,544
I tried to read it
a hundred different times.

80
00:07:21,514 --> 00:07:23,505
Mom, it's not exactly...

81
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:27,017
It's just the sound of your voice, darling.

82
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:28,847
Okay.

83
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:34,960
It's dated April 4th, 1985.

84
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:38,427
And it says New Orleans.

85
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:41,261
"This is my last will and testament.

86
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:45,565
"I don't have much to leave,
few possessions, no money, really.

87
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:51,205
"I will go out of this world the same way
I came in, alone and with nothing.

88
00:07:51,877 --> 00:07:53,713
"All I have is my story,

89
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:57,247
"and I'm writing it now
while I still remember it.

90
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,213
"My name is Benjamin.
Benjamin Button. "

91
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:04,681
<i>And I was born under
unusual circumstances.</i>

92
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:07,888
<i>The First World War had ended,</i>

93
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:12,462
<i>and I've been told it was
an especially good night to be born.</i>

94
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,261
Thank God it's over!

95
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:18,166
We won the war!

96
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:34,882
The Great War is over!

97
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,190
What are you doing here?

98
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,597
Thomas,

99
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:52,269
I'm afraid she's going to die.

100
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:53,531
What?

101
00:08:54,707 --> 00:08:58,336
That's enough.
All of you, get away from her.

102
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:04,641
I came as quickly as I could.
The streets are filled with people.

103
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,012
Thomas.

104
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,113
Promise me he has a place.

105
00:09:11,524 --> 00:09:12,650
Yeah.

106
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:16,017
<i>She gave her life for me.</i>

107
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:20,032
<i>And for that, I am forever grateful.</i>

108
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:31,041
Mr. Button.

109
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:47,586
Thomas!

110
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:48,921
Thomas.

111
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,091
Thomas? Where are you going?

112
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:24,059
Hey! What are you doing there?

113
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:27,322
What do you have there?

114
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,322
- Come on, Queenie.
- Now, Mr. Weathers!

115
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:30,793
Come on, now, you know I ain't got
nothing but work to do around here.

116
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:33,160
- Come on. Just take some time.
- Stop all this foolishness.

117
00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:38,131
The air is sweet.

118
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:45,635
You look very handsome tonight,
Miss Queenie.

119
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:49,106
Handsome as I've ever seen.

120
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:52,779
The brown matches your eyes.

121
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:54,216
Oh, hush!

122
00:11:55,688 --> 00:11:59,818
Let's see here.
You ain't no slouch yourself.

123
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,197
Hambert's back in town.

124
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:14,068
He came home legless, but he's home.

125
00:12:15,074 --> 00:12:17,702
I know you were sweet on him one time.

126
00:12:18,244 --> 00:12:20,109
Sweeter than I should've been.

127
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:22,112
Miss Simone messed herself.

128
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:23,442
Oh, sweet Jesus.

129
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:26,074
She got to stop doing that
or it's diapers for her.

130
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:28,210
- I'll be right there, Miss Jameson!
- Now, Queenie, now come on.

131
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,880
Okay, Queenie'll be right there.

132
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,252
It's awful nice out here.

133
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:35,555
Come on out back for a moment.
Take your mind off things.

134
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:36,685
You're so bad.

135
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:39,263
- What in God's name?
- What's this?

136
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:51,872
Oh, the Lord done something here.

137
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:55,469
Hope I didn't hurt it none
stepping on it like that.

138
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:57,105
We best leave that for the police.

139
00:12:57,216 --> 00:12:58,706
Poor baby.

140
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:00,882
I'll go.

141
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:05,216
It's for sure nobody wanted to keep it.
Come on, baby.

142
00:13:07,893 --> 00:13:10,327
Queenie? Where are you, Queenie?

143
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:12,363
Hold your water! You go deal with it.

144
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:14,557
Okay. No, go, I'll be back.

145
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:18,699
Queenie, Apple, she went and messed
herself all over again!

146
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:20,669
Jane Childress, start her a bath!

147
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:22,832
And mind your own business,
Mrs. Duprey.

148
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:24,739
You'll be messing yourself
soon enough.

149
00:13:24,843 --> 00:13:26,401
Somebody stole my necklace.

150
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:29,447
Okay. All right, Mrs. Hollister,
I'll be right with you, okay?

151
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:31,743
Go on back upstairs, hear?

152
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:40,582
You are as ugly as an old pot

153
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:42,354
but you're still a child of God.

154
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:44,827
Queenie, Apple,
she won't take a bath without you!

155
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,397
Mercy.

156
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:48,466
I'll be right there!

157
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:54,438
Okay. You just wait right here
for me now, okay?

158
00:13:57,776 --> 00:14:02,406
My sister gave me those pearls.
I can't find them anywhere.

159
00:14:02,514 --> 00:14:06,348
- Somebody's been stealing my jewelry.
- They're right here, Mrs. Hollister. See?

160
00:14:06,452 --> 00:14:09,751
Right around your pretty white neck.
Now, come on. Hush all that noise.

161
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:12,449
- Is Dr. Rose still here?
- I don't know.

162
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,557
Your heart is strong.

163
00:14:16,662 --> 00:14:19,631
You just want to avoid
any undue stimulation.

164
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:23,326
I trust you ladies
will help me out with that?

165
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:26,563
I have something.
Could you come downstairs?

166
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:33,972
Never seen anything like it.
Nearly blind from cataracts.

167
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,140
I'm not sure if he can hear.
His bones indicate severe arthritis.

168
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:43,353
His skin has lost all elasticity,
and his hands and feet are ossified.

169
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:48,051
He shows all the deterioration,
the infirmities, not of a newborn,

170
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,788
but of a man well in his 80s
on his way to the grave.

171
00:14:50,896 --> 00:14:51,885
He's dying?

172
00:14:51,997 --> 00:14:55,228
His body is failing him
before his life's begun.

173
00:14:57,603 --> 00:14:59,036
Where'd he come from?

174
00:14:59,138 --> 00:15:03,507
My sister's child. From Lafayette.
She had an unfortunate adventure.

175
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:07,511
The poor child, he got the worst of it.
Come out white.

176
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:15,145
There are places for unwanted babies
like these, Queenie.

177
00:15:15,788 --> 00:15:18,450
No room for another mouth to feed here.

178
00:15:18,557 --> 00:15:21,082
The Nolan Foundation,
despite their good intentions,

179
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:23,957
thinks this place is
a large nuisance as it is.

180
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:25,077
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

181
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:26,222
- A baby...
- You said he don't have long.

182
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:30,893
Queenie, some creatures
aren't meant to survive.

183
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:38,037
No, this baby, he is a miracle.
That's for certain.

184
00:15:38,143 --> 00:15:41,135
Just not the kind of miracle
one hopes to see.

185
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:46,674
Y'all listen. Y'all listen up here.

186
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:48,477
We're gonna have us a visitor

187
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:51,681
that's gonna be staying with us
for a little while.

188
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:55,487
My sister had a child
and she couldn't see right by it, so...

189
00:15:57,763 --> 00:15:59,492
He's known as...

190
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:04,065
Benjamin.

191
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:06,033
Benjamin.

192
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:09,874
He's not a well child, so we're gonna
have to take good care of him.

193
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:11,033
I had 10 children.

194
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:14,476
There's not a baby I can't care for.
Let me see him.

195
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:20,311
God in Heaven.
He looks just like my ex-husband.

196
00:16:21,153 --> 00:16:23,781
Look, he's prematurely old.

197
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:27,816
Dr. Rose said he ain't got much more
time on this earth.

198
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,286
Join the club.

199
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,866
He's smiling!

200
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:45,303
Hambert sends his
remembrances to you.

201
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,452
Are you right out of your mind?

202
00:16:58,757 --> 00:17:02,124
I know you ain't got all the parts
it takes to make one of your own,

203
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:03,455
but this ain't yours to keep.

204
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:05,826
It may not even be humankind.

205
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,373
Mr. Weathers, come back here.

206
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:20,939
Please.

207
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:39,856
You never know what's coming for you.

208
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,241
<i>It seemed I had found a home.</i>

209
00:17:55,414 --> 00:17:56,472
Is any of this true?

210
00:17:56,582 --> 00:17:59,949
You have such a lovely voice.

211
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:05,183
Mom, it's an ancient streetcar token.

212
00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:10,020
That clock just kept going,

213
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:15,227
year after year after year.

214
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:21,438
<i>But I didn't know I was a child.</i>

215
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,008
Same old crap every day.

216
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,674
<i>I thought I was like everyone else there.</i>

217
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,841
<i>An old man in the twilight of his life.</i>

218
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:33,281
Could you make him stop that?

219
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:37,346
Stop banging that fork.
It's used for eating, not for playing with.

220
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:40,289
And use your napkin, please,
Mr. Benjamin.

221
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:43,923
Queenie!

222
00:18:56,008 --> 00:18:57,305
Hey, boy.

223
00:19:04,683 --> 00:19:06,981
<i>Always had a healthy curiosity.</i>

224
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:11,611
<i>What was up the street?
Or around the next corner?</i>

225
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:14,789
Go get him!

226
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:18,590
Benjamin! That is dangerous.
Come back over here.

227
00:19:19,331 --> 00:19:21,060
Stay put, child.

228
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:25,369
<i>I loved her very much.</i>

229
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:27,798
<i>She was my mother.</i>

230
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:29,066
Mama.

231
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:30,901
Mama.

232
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,476
Some days I feel different
than the day before.

233
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:40,942
Everybody feels different about
themselves, one way or another.

234
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,218
But we're all going the same way.

235
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,253
Just taking different roads to get there,
that's all.

236
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:51,829
You're on your own road, Benjamin.

237
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:57,261
Mama? How much longer I got?

238
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:01,068
Just be thankful
for what you're given, hear?

239
00:20:01,173 --> 00:20:04,233
You're already here longer
than you're supposed to.

240
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:10,046
<i>Some nights, I'd have to sleep alone.</i>

241
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:20,418
<i>I didn't mind.</i>

242
00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:24,056
<i>I would listen to the house breathing.</i>

243
00:20:25,263 --> 00:20:27,322
<i>All those people sleeping.</i>

244
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,995
<i>I felt safe.</i>

245
00:20:51,857 --> 00:20:54,451
<i>It was a place of great routine.</i>

246
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,460
<i>Every morning at 5:30,
no matter the weather,</i>

247
00:20:57,562 --> 00:21:01,623
<i>General Winslow, U.S. Army, Retired,
would raise the flag.</i>

248
00:21:04,503 --> 00:21:08,462
<i>Mrs. Sybil Wagner,
once an opera singer of some note,</i>

249
00:21:08,573 --> 00:21:11,201
<i>well, she sang Wagner.</i>

250
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:24,454
All right, baby, come on.

251
00:21:24,556 --> 00:21:28,390
We got to put some life
into these old sticks for you.

252
00:21:28,493 --> 00:21:32,793
Get you walking so you can help me out
around here. Come on now, hear?

253
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:37,733
<i>No matter the season,
supper was served promptly at 5:30.</i>

254
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:39,997
Molasses.

255
00:21:40,105 --> 00:21:41,333
Molasses.

256
00:21:42,574 --> 00:21:44,132
Molasses.

257
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,635
I learned to read when I was five.

258
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:52,148
My grandfather was a dresser
for a famous actor.

259
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,946
He brung home every play
for me to read.

260
00:21:57,189 --> 00:22:00,920
"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,

261
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,455
"Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.

262
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:08,961
"Even like a man
new haled from the rack,

263
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:11,763
"So fare my limbs
with long imprisonment.

264
00:22:12,504 --> 00:22:16,133
"And these gray locks,
the pursuivants of death,

265
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:19,744
"Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer. "

266
00:22:23,648 --> 00:22:25,114
You thought I was plain ignorant,
didn't you?

267
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:26,710
You thought I was plain ignorant,
didn't you?

268
00:22:26,818 --> 00:22:30,447
The actor my grandfather worked for
was John Wilkes Booth.

269
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:34,782
He killed Abraham Lincoln.

270
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:39,189
You never know what's coming for you.

271
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:43,493
<i>On Saturday nights,
Mama would make me go to church.</i>

272
00:22:47,305 --> 00:22:48,670
Benjamin!

273
00:22:59,017 --> 00:23:00,575
- Amen! Amen!
- Amen! Amen!

274
00:23:03,188 --> 00:23:05,520
What can I do for you, sister?

275
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:20,828
Her parts are all twisted up inside
and she can't have little children.

276
00:23:24,643 --> 00:23:28,670
Lord, if you could see clear
to forgive this woman her sins

277
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,873
so she can bear the fruit of the womb.

278
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:33,382
Out, damnable affliction!

279
00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:35,646
- Praise God!
- Praise God!

280
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:36,914
Hallelujah!

281
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:38,489
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

282
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,289
And what's this old man's irrediction?

283
00:23:44,996 --> 00:23:46,429
He's got the Devil on his back,

284
00:23:46,531 --> 00:23:49,796
trying to ride him into the grave
before his time.

285
00:23:53,104 --> 00:23:54,537
- Out, Zebuchar!
- Yes!

286
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:56,470
- Out, Beelzebub!
- Yes!

287
00:23:58,376 --> 00:24:00,105
How old are you?

288
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:02,702
Seven. But I look a lot older.

289
00:24:03,782 --> 00:24:05,272
God bless you.

290
00:24:05,884 --> 00:24:07,351
He's seven.

291
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:14,091
Now, this is a man
with optimism in his heart.

292
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:15,887
- All right.
- Belief in his soul!

293
00:24:15,994 --> 00:24:16,983
- Yes!
- Yes!

294
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:18,892
We are all children in the eyes of God!

295
00:24:18,997 --> 00:24:20,294
- Yes!
- Hallelujah!

296
00:24:20,398 --> 00:24:23,265
We are gonna get you out of that chair.

297
00:24:23,368 --> 00:24:25,393
- And we're gonna have you walk.
- Amen.

298
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:27,829
It's all right.

299
00:24:28,773 --> 00:24:30,968
In the name of God's glory...

300
00:24:31,843 --> 00:24:33,276
Rise up!

301
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:36,144
Come on.

302
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:39,746
Come on. Walk.

303
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:41,284
Come on, son. Come on.

304
00:24:41,386 --> 00:24:44,116
- Come on with it, son. Come on.
- Come on.

305
00:24:44,222 --> 00:24:47,589
Now God is gonna see you
the rest of the way.

306
00:24:47,692 --> 00:24:52,493
He's gonna see this little old man walk
without the use of a crutch or a cane.

307
00:24:52,597 --> 00:24:54,394
He's gonna see that you walk
from faith...

308
00:24:54,499 --> 00:24:57,468
- Hallelujah!
- ... and divine inspiration alone!

309
00:24:57,569 --> 00:24:58,729
- Yes.
- Hey, Ben!

310
00:24:58,837 --> 00:25:00,134
- Go, son!
- Now walk.

311
00:25:00,238 --> 00:25:01,466
- Yes.
- Come on.

312
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:05,235
Don't touch him.

313
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:09,341
Rise up, old man.

314
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:12,975
Rise up like Lazarus.

315
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:15,211
I said, rise up!

316
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:17,252
Hallelujah!

317
00:25:19,424 --> 00:25:20,618
Yes.

318
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:22,286
Come on.

319
00:25:22,394 --> 00:25:23,383
Say hallelujah.

320
00:25:23,495 --> 00:25:24,860
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

321
00:25:26,598 --> 00:25:27,792
Walk.

322
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,659
Walk on. Yes.

323
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:35,563
That's right, Benjamin.

324
00:25:35,674 --> 00:25:38,905
<i>Now when I look back on it,
it was miraculous.</i>

325
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:43,037
<i>But you know the saying, the Lord
giveth and the Lord taketh away.</i>

326
00:25:43,314 --> 00:25:45,179
Glory in the highest!

327
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:50,447
Sweet Jesus!

328
00:25:50,588 --> 00:25:51,680
- No!
- No!

329
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,490
<i>There were so many birthdays.</i>

330
00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:59,120
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow...</i>

331
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,824
<i>So we wouldn't run out,
we would spare the candles.</i>

332
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:05,960
Queenie, you know I don't like birthdays
and I don't like cake.

333
00:26:06,671 --> 00:26:10,607
<i>And death was a common visitor.
People came and went.</i>

334
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:14,844
<i>You always knew
when someone left us.</i>

335
00:26:14,946 --> 00:26:17,437
<i>There was a silence in the house.</i>

336
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:33,793
<i>It was a wonderful place to grow up.</i>

337
00:26:33,898 --> 00:26:38,358
<i>I was with people who had shed
all the inconsequences of earlier life.</i>

338
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:43,166
<i>Left wondering about the weather,
the temperature of a bath,</i>

339
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:46,604
<i>the light at the end of a day.</i>

340
00:26:51,015 --> 00:26:54,974
<i>For everyone that died, someone would
come to take their place.</i>

341
00:26:56,054 --> 00:26:58,318
I've been married five times.

342
00:26:58,857 --> 00:27:02,554
My fifth wife and I are captured
by a neighbor tribe of cannibals.

343
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,718
Oh, goodness gracious.

344
00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:05,295
We escaped across the river.

345
00:27:05,396 --> 00:27:08,763
My wife, she can't swim,
so, sadly, she eaten.

346
00:27:08,867 --> 00:27:10,061
Oh, my God.

347
00:27:10,168 --> 00:27:13,001
My second wife steps on cobra
and dies.

348
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:16,335
It was very bad luck
to be married to me.

349
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:19,467
That's Mr. Oti. He's an acquaintance
of an acquaintance of mine.

350
00:27:19,577 --> 00:27:21,670
- The next summer I'm captured...
- He's a Pygmy.

351
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,645
...with three others
by the Baschiele tribe.

352
00:27:23,748 --> 00:27:28,617
They trade us for pigs, shoes, and beer
to a very strange American man.

353
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:50,230
I hear you're not so old
as you're looking.

354
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:52,571
You just fooling everybody.

355
00:27:53,144 --> 00:27:56,170
<i>What's the matter?
Did you get Madjembe?</i>

356
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:57,646
<i>What's Madjembe?</i>

357
00:27:57,749 --> 00:27:59,046
Worms.

358
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,714
I don't think I have worms.

359
00:28:02,387 --> 00:28:03,911
This is just how I am.

360
00:28:04,022 --> 00:28:06,889
- Did you take your pills today?
- No, ma'am.

361
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:09,323
Come. Let's get a cold root beer.

362
00:28:09,427 --> 00:28:11,554
I found the medication
under your pillow.

363
00:28:11,663 --> 00:28:14,826
I'm not supposed to. It's dangerous.

364
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:17,663
Who said that? Come on, little man.

365
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,631
Hello, children.

366
00:28:31,883 --> 00:28:33,373
Hold, please.

367
00:28:36,054 --> 00:28:40,354
Then I'm in the monkey house
at Philadelphia Zoological Park.

368
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:44,751
Three thousand people
show up my first day.

369
00:28:46,097 --> 00:28:47,086
Look.

370
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,800
What's it like living in a cage?

371
00:28:50,902 --> 00:28:52,369
It stinks.

372
00:28:53,004 --> 00:28:55,268
But the monkeys.

373
00:28:56,074 --> 00:28:58,099
They do some tricks there.

374
00:28:58,343 --> 00:29:01,039
I throw a spear, wrestle with Kowali.

375
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,609
She is orangutan.

376
00:29:04,048 --> 00:29:07,575
When I'm not playing with the monkeys,
they want me to run to the bars

377
00:29:07,685 --> 00:29:09,778
in my cage, with my teeth.

378
00:29:19,731 --> 00:29:21,790
So then what'd you do?

379
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:27,736
Then I leave zoo, go here, go there.
Wandered most of the time.

380
00:29:28,206 --> 00:29:29,230
You were all alone?

381
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,638
Plenty of time you'll be alone.

382
00:29:31,743 --> 00:29:35,179
When you're different like us,
it's gonna be that way.

383
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:40,047
But I'll tell you a little secret.

384
00:29:40,151 --> 00:29:43,450
Fat people, skinny people, tall people,

385
00:29:43,554 --> 00:29:46,546
white people,
they're just as alone as we are.

386
00:29:47,091 --> 00:29:49,286
But they're scared shitless.

387
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,128
I think about the river I grew up on.

388
00:29:58,603 --> 00:30:01,504
It would be nice to sit by my river again.

389
00:30:03,775 --> 00:30:06,141
Come, I have an appointment.

390
00:30:08,546 --> 00:30:11,106
There's my little man.
You ready, sugar?

391
00:30:11,215 --> 00:30:13,547
Always ready. Always ready.

392
00:30:15,353 --> 00:30:17,446
Filamena, Mr. Benjamin.

393
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:21,549
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- My pleasure, ma'am.

394
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:23,627
You can find your own way home,
can't you?

395
00:30:23,728 --> 00:30:26,458
Take the St. Charles line to Napoleon.

396
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,062
Hey! Hey!

397
00:30:54,392 --> 00:30:57,884
Where in God's name have you been?
Get in here.

398
00:30:59,397 --> 00:31:02,662
I mean, you take my breath away,
you know that?

399
00:31:03,067 --> 00:31:05,661
Oh, Lord, I was so worried about you.

400
00:31:09,374 --> 00:31:11,934
<i>It had been the best day of my life.</i>

401
00:31:12,877 --> 00:31:15,573
- How's her breathing?
- It's shallow.

402
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,204
They say it'll reach us in a few hours,

403
00:31:17,315 --> 00:31:20,216
so I gotta get my baby
and take him to my sister's.

404
00:31:20,318 --> 00:31:22,786
They say there's nothing to worry about
here in the hospital.

405
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:25,378
Nurses'll be right here if you need them.
Are you okay?

406
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:29,221
- Yeah, I'm okay reading.
- I shouldn't be more than an hour.

407
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:33,256
Was there just company?

408
00:31:33,831 --> 00:31:36,231
It was just Dorothy leaving.

409
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:39,836
Go on, Caroline.

410
00:31:39,937 --> 00:31:43,031
"On Sundays, the families would come
and visit. "

411
00:31:43,441 --> 00:31:46,376
<i>It was Thanksgiving, 1930.</i>

412
00:31:46,477 --> 00:31:49,446
<i>I met the person
who changed my life forever.</i>

413
00:32:01,526 --> 00:32:03,585
Well, Benjamin.

414
00:32:04,028 --> 00:32:07,327
Might I say you are looking
strikingly youthful.

415
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,357
Good day, Mrs. Fuller.

416
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:12,732
A single cane,
back straight as an arrow.

417
00:32:12,837 --> 00:32:15,203
What elixir have you been drinking?

418
00:32:15,306 --> 00:32:18,673
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Grandma! Look at me!

419
00:32:21,112 --> 00:32:23,444
That was really something.

420
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:25,413
Come on over here, you.

421
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,348
Now, this is my granddaughter, Daisy.

422
00:32:29,287 --> 00:32:31,118
This is Mr...

423
00:32:31,255 --> 00:32:34,918
I'm afraid, Benjamin,
I don't rightly know your last name.

424
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:36,653
Benjamin's fine.

425
00:32:37,295 --> 00:32:39,627
<i>I never forgot her blue eyes.</i>

426
00:32:40,064 --> 00:32:42,726
Good people, supper is served.

427
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:48,932
Health and food, for love and friends.
For everything thy goodness sends.

428
00:32:49,373 --> 00:32:50,533
Amen.

429
00:32:50,641 --> 00:32:51,869
- Amen!
- Amen!

430
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,140
Did you know turkeys aren't really birds?

431
00:32:58,249 --> 00:32:59,273
Why do you say that?

432
00:32:59,383 --> 00:33:02,511
They're in the pheasant family,
can't hardly fly.

433
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,145
It's sad, don't you think?
Birds that can't fly?

434
00:33:05,256 --> 00:33:07,417
I love birds that can't fly.

435
00:33:07,525 --> 00:33:09,516
They are so delicious.

436
00:33:10,695 --> 00:33:13,163
- That's terrible.
- I have something to tell y'all

437
00:33:13,264 --> 00:33:16,427
while we're giving thanks
for God's blessings.

438
00:33:16,534 --> 00:33:18,468
I had a miracle happen.

439
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,598
The Lord saw fit to answer my prayers.

440
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:27,607
What does she mean,
answered her prayers?

441
00:33:27,712 --> 00:33:29,236
Thanks. Thank you.

442
00:33:29,347 --> 00:33:31,713
She's gonna have a baby, silly.

443
00:33:32,683 --> 00:33:35,675
That's what my mama said
when I was gonna have a baby brother,

444
00:33:35,786 --> 00:33:38,050
but he didn't live long,

445
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,622
'cause he didn't breathe right.

446
00:33:44,495 --> 00:33:48,488
"In the afternoon, when he had got
his beautiful hind legs

447
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:52,194
"just as Big God Nqong had promised.

448
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,265
"You can see that it is 5:00,

449
00:33:55,373 --> 00:33:59,332
"because Big God Nqong's
clock says so. "

450
00:33:59,443 --> 00:34:01,274
Isn't that something?

451
00:34:01,846 --> 00:34:03,211
Again, read it again.

452
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:05,612
Oh, read it again, please.

453
00:34:05,716 --> 00:34:09,015
All right.
But afterwards, you must go to bed.

454
00:34:09,387 --> 00:34:10,786
I promise.

455
00:34:12,757 --> 00:34:14,588
"Old Man Kangaroo. "

456
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:20,557
Are you sleeping?

457
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:23,589
Who's that?

458
00:34:23,701 --> 00:34:25,259
It's me, Daisy.

459
00:34:26,304 --> 00:34:27,771
Oh, hi!

460
00:34:28,372 --> 00:34:29,862
'Kay, come on.

461
00:34:41,018 --> 00:34:42,747
Where are we going?

462
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:46,719
Come on. Under here.

463
00:34:56,267 --> 00:34:57,700
Here, you light it.

464
00:34:57,802 --> 00:34:59,895
I'm not supposed to play with matches.

465
00:35:00,004 --> 00:35:02,268
Don't be a chicken. Light it.

466
00:35:13,384 --> 00:35:16,319
I'll tell you a secret if you'll tell me one.

467
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,853
Okay.

468
00:35:17,955 --> 00:35:21,288
I saw my mama kissing another man.

469
00:35:21,692 --> 00:35:23,751
Her face was red from it.

470
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,520
Your turn.

471
00:35:30,835 --> 00:35:33,133
I'm not as old as I look.

472
00:35:33,237 --> 00:35:34,795
I thought so.

473
00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:39,208
You don't seem like an old person.

474
00:35:39,877 --> 00:35:42,038
- Like my grandma.
- I'm not.

475
00:35:43,814 --> 00:35:45,406
Are you sick?

476
00:35:45,983 --> 00:35:49,146
Well, I heard Mama
and Tizzy whispering.

477
00:35:49,253 --> 00:35:53,417
They said I was gonna die soon,
but maybe not.

478
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,184
You're odd.

479
00:35:57,962 --> 00:36:00,829
You're different
than anybody I've ever met.

480
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:06,162
- May I?
- Okay.

481
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:15,845
What are you doing under there?

482
00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:19,382
You come right out here
and get back up to bed!

483
00:36:19,483 --> 00:36:21,246
It's after midnight!

484
00:36:21,352 --> 00:36:23,445
You are not to be playing together.

485
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:25,078
Yes, ma'am.

486
00:36:25,189 --> 00:36:27,350
Now you get back to bed, little lady.

487
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:31,417
You're too young to be wandering
around in the night on your own.

488
00:36:34,098 --> 00:36:37,932
And you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

489
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:55,276
You are a different child.

490
00:36:56,053 --> 00:36:57,145
A man-child.

491
00:36:57,254 --> 00:37:01,714
And, baby, people aren't gonna
understand just how different you are.

492
00:37:08,032 --> 00:37:10,193
What's wrong with me, Mama?

493
00:37:11,135 --> 00:37:12,898
Come here.

494
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:17,302
God hasn't said yet, baby.

495
00:37:21,746 --> 00:37:25,238
Now go on to bed, hear?
And behave yourself.

496
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:29,144
Go on. Say your prayers, hear?

497
00:37:40,965 --> 00:37:45,026
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

498
00:37:47,371 --> 00:37:50,272
Once when I was repairing
a leak on the roof.

499
00:37:54,378 --> 00:37:57,609
Once I was just crossing
the road to get the mail.

500
00:38:13,664 --> 00:38:14,961
<i>I never forgot her...</i>

501
00:38:15,065 --> 00:38:16,555
"... blue eyes. "

502
00:38:18,035 --> 00:38:19,593
Mom?

503
00:38:19,703 --> 00:38:24,470
Did you get that this Benjamin loved you
from the first time that he saw you?

504
00:38:25,743 --> 00:38:28,177
Not many people experience that.

505
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,443
Want me to go on?

506
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:35,442
He crosses something out.

507
00:38:35,553 --> 00:38:38,852
<i>When that baby came,
things were different.</i>

508
00:38:38,956 --> 00:38:42,289
<i>Your mama gone away
And your daddy gonna stay</i>

509
00:38:42,393 --> 00:38:46,193
<i>Didn't leave nobody but the baby</i>

510
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:50,259
<i>Babies were born, people died.</i>

511
00:38:51,168 --> 00:38:54,001
<i>A lot of folks been through
that old house.</i>

512
00:38:55,973 --> 00:38:59,204
I've come to say goodbye.
I'm going away.

513
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,572
Going?

514
00:39:01,078 --> 00:39:02,602
Where?

515
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:04,271
I haven't figured that out yet,

516
00:39:04,381 --> 00:39:06,849
but I'll send you a postcard
when I get there.

517
00:39:06,951 --> 00:39:09,715
What about your friend, the tall lady?

518
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,219
We are not friends anymore.

519
00:39:11,322 --> 00:39:14,587
That's what happens
with tall people sometimes.

520
00:39:14,692 --> 00:39:17,456
Well, goodbye.

521
00:39:36,747 --> 00:39:39,511
<i>Spent a lot of time by myself that year.</i>

522
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:42,113
Hello?

523
00:39:43,888 --> 00:39:45,651
- Hi.
- I'm moving in today.

524
00:39:45,756 --> 00:39:48,589
Welcome. We've been expecting you.

525
00:39:48,692 --> 00:39:51,718
Can you please show her up
to Mrs. Rousseau's old room?

526
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:55,162
I'm sorry, but we usually
don't allow dogs in the house.

527
00:39:55,266 --> 00:39:58,258
Well, she's old as the hills.
She's almost blind.

528
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:01,304
She won't be a bother much longer.

529
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:05,102
Well, all right,
long as she stays from up underfoot.

530
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:06,403
Right this way, ma'am.

531
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,638
<i>As hard as I try,
I can't remember her name.</i>

532
00:40:09,747 --> 00:40:12,875
<i>Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford.</i>

533
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:15,681
<i>Maybe it was Maple.</i>

534
00:40:15,786 --> 00:40:18,118
<i>It's funny how sometimes
the people we remember the least</i>

535
00:40:18,222 --> 00:40:20,747
<i>make the greatest impression on us.</i>

536
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:23,690
<i>I do remember she wore diamonds.</i>

537
00:40:23,794 --> 00:40:27,594
<i>And she always dressed in fine
clothing, as if she was going out.</i>

538
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:31,259
<i>Although she never did
and nobody ever came to visit her.</i>

539
00:40:33,003 --> 00:40:35,335
<i>She taught me to play the piano.</i>

540
00:40:40,711 --> 00:40:43,339
It's not about how well you play.

541
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:46,914
It's how you feel
about what you're playing.

542
00:40:47,017 --> 00:40:48,348
Try this.

543
00:41:04,702 --> 00:41:07,933
You can't help putting yourself
in the music.

544
00:41:16,013 --> 00:41:18,004
<i>There were many changes.</i>

545
00:41:18,115 --> 00:41:21,175
<i>Some you could see,
some you couldn't.</i>

546
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,152
<i>Hair had started growing
in all sorts of places,</i>

547
00:41:25,689 --> 00:41:27,657
<i>along with other things.</i>

548
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:31,689
<i>I felt pretty good, considering.</i>

549
00:41:32,763 --> 00:41:35,425
Darling, the pain.

550
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:38,057
All right, Mom, I'll get the nurse.

551
00:41:40,604 --> 00:41:43,266
<i>Look at this eye.
This is a major hurricane,</i>

552
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:46,366
<i>a slow hurricane,
with maximum sustained winds of...</i>

553
00:41:46,477 --> 00:41:48,308
Not doing too good?

554
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:52,444
Nobody seems to know
whether to stay or leave.

555
00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:54,847
I'm gonna ride it out.

556
00:41:54,952 --> 00:41:57,819
There.
That should make things much easier.

557
00:42:01,258 --> 00:42:04,455
Have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes?

558
00:42:04,561 --> 00:42:08,053
My father waited four hours for
my brother to get here from Boger City.

559
00:42:08,165 --> 00:42:10,133
Couldn't go without him.

560
00:42:10,668 --> 00:42:13,330
- She seems like a sweet woman.
- Yeah.

561
00:42:14,004 --> 00:42:15,699
I haven't had as much time with her
as I would've...

562
00:42:15,806 --> 00:42:17,706
- You busy? I could use your help.
- Excuse me.

563
00:42:17,808 --> 00:42:19,036
Sure.

564
00:42:37,227 --> 00:42:39,252
"Queenie would let me go
with Mr. Daws... "

565
00:42:39,363 --> 00:42:43,163
<i>...to Poverty Point to watch the boats
go up and down the river.</i>

566
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:45,201
<i>These were hard times.</i>

567
00:42:48,238 --> 00:42:51,935
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

568
00:42:52,876 --> 00:42:56,277
Once when I was in the field,
just tending to my cows.

569
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,084
My fourth hand didn't show up.

570
00:43:07,324 --> 00:43:10,782
Anybody want to make $2
for a day's work 'round here?

571
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,425
What's the matter?

572
00:43:14,531 --> 00:43:17,261
Nobody wants to do an honest
day's work for an honest day's pay?

573
00:43:17,401 --> 00:43:18,925
He never pays.

574
00:43:20,404 --> 00:43:22,702
- Nobody wants a job?
- I do.

575
00:43:24,341 --> 00:43:27,174
You got your sea legs about you,
old man?

576
00:43:28,278 --> 00:43:29,643
I think.

577
00:43:33,617 --> 00:43:36,051
Well, that's good enough for me.

578
00:43:36,153 --> 00:43:39,611
Get your ass on board.
We'll sure as hell find out.

579
00:43:45,129 --> 00:43:46,756
<i>I was as happy as I could be.</i>

580
00:43:46,864 --> 00:43:48,126
I need a volunteer!

581
00:43:48,232 --> 00:43:49,563
<i>I would do anything.</i>

582
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:51,099
Yes, Captain!

583
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:53,499
Scrape off all this bird shit!

584
00:43:54,238 --> 00:43:55,933
Right away, sir.

585
00:43:56,774 --> 00:44:01,234
<i>And I was actually gonna be paid
for something I would've done for free.</i>

586
00:44:02,913 --> 00:44:05,245
<i>His name was Captain Mike Clark.</i>

587
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,151
<i>He'd been on a tugboat
since he was seven.</i>

588
00:44:10,187 --> 00:44:11,916
Get moving, then.

589
00:44:12,856 --> 00:44:14,346
Come here.

590
00:44:16,426 --> 00:44:19,520
Can you still get it up?

591
00:44:20,898 --> 00:44:22,889
I do every morning.

592
00:44:23,567 --> 00:44:26,968
The old pole, huh? The high, hard one?

593
00:44:27,604 --> 00:44:28,901
I guess.

594
00:44:31,508 --> 00:44:34,136
When was the last time
you had a woman?

595
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,580
- Never.
- Never?

596
00:44:39,082 --> 00:44:41,141
Not that I know of, sir.

597
00:44:41,652 --> 00:44:43,415
Wait a minute, now.

598
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:48,351
You mean to say you've been
on this earth however many years

599
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:51,723
and you've never had a woman?

600
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,460
Damn, that's the saddest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

601
00:45:00,938 --> 00:45:02,166
Never?

602
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,032
No.

603
00:45:06,677 --> 00:45:10,773
Well, then, by Jesus,
you are coming with me.

604
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:23,384
What did your father do?

605
00:45:23,493 --> 00:45:25,518
I never met my father.

606
00:45:25,629 --> 00:45:27,563
You lucky bastard.

607
00:45:28,465 --> 00:45:31,093
All fathers want to do is hold you down.

608
00:45:33,737 --> 00:45:37,138
Out on my father's boat,
workin' the two-a-day,

609
00:45:37,474 --> 00:45:39,908
this little, fat bastard.

610
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,705
"Tug Irish," they called him.

611
00:45:41,812 --> 00:45:45,179
Anyway, I finally work up the nerve
and tell him,

612
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:49,780
"I don't want to spend the rest of my life
on a goddamn tugboat. "

613
00:45:49,887 --> 00:45:51,855
You know what I'm saying?

614
00:45:52,256 --> 00:45:54,918
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life on a tugboat.

615
00:45:55,025 --> 00:45:57,323
Absolutely! Damn right!

616
00:46:00,097 --> 00:46:02,691
So you know
what my father says to me?

617
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:07,970
He says,
"Who the hell do you think you are?

618
00:46:08,071 --> 00:46:10,801
"What the hell do you think you can do?"

619
00:46:11,108 --> 00:46:12,769
So I tell him.

620
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:16,607
"Well, if you're asking,

621
00:46:18,882 --> 00:46:20,907
"I want to be an artist. "

622
00:46:21,485 --> 00:46:23,385
He laughs.

623
00:46:23,887 --> 00:46:28,881
"An artist? God meant for you
to work a tugboat, just like me.

624
00:46:28,992 --> 00:46:31,620
"And that's exactly
what you're gonna do. "

625
00:46:31,728 --> 00:46:34,959
Well, I turned myself into an artist.

626
00:46:37,434 --> 00:46:39,163
A tattoo artist!

627
00:46:41,605 --> 00:46:44,403
I put on every one of these myself.

628
00:46:46,944 --> 00:46:50,744
You have to skin me alive
to take my art away from me now.

629
00:46:51,548 --> 00:46:55,040
When I'm dead,
I'm gonna send him my arm.

630
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,719
That one.

631
00:47:00,057 --> 00:47:02,685
Don't let anyone tell you different.

632
00:47:02,793 --> 00:47:05,387
You gotta do what you're meant to do.

633
00:47:05,495 --> 00:47:08,589
And I happen to be a goddamned artist.

634
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:11,497
But you're a tugboat captain.

635
00:47:12,102 --> 00:47:13,831
Captain Mike?

636
00:47:13,937 --> 00:47:16,667
We're ready for you and your friend.

637
00:47:18,408 --> 00:47:21,434
Let's go, old timer, eh?
Break your cherry.

638
00:47:22,646 --> 00:47:25,342
- Hello, my lovelies!
- Hey, Captain.

639
00:47:25,482 --> 00:47:26,449
- Hi, Captain.
- Hi.

640
00:47:28,618 --> 00:47:29,710
- Hi.
- Hi.

641
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:32,846
He gives me the willies.
That is not for me.

642
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:37,055
How are you tonight, grandpa?

643
00:47:37,728 --> 00:47:39,855
<i>It was a night to remember.</i>

644
00:47:45,602 --> 00:47:49,265
What are you, Dick Tracy or something?
I've got to rest.

645
00:47:50,407 --> 00:47:51,635
Again.

646
00:47:52,943 --> 00:47:55,275
- Thank you.
- No, thank you. You have a nice night.

647
00:47:55,379 --> 00:47:57,506
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- Every night but Sunday.

648
00:47:57,614 --> 00:48:01,311
<i>It sure made me understand
the value of earning a living.</i>

649
00:48:01,952 --> 00:48:03,783
Good night, sweetie. Come back now.

650
00:48:03,887 --> 00:48:06,082
<i>Things money can buy you.</i>

651
00:48:23,774 --> 00:48:25,435
It's nasty out.

652
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:28,810
Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

653
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,844
Well, that's awfully kind of you, sir.

654
00:48:42,192 --> 00:48:44,660
My name is Thomas, Thomas Button.

655
00:48:45,328 --> 00:48:47,421
- I'm Benjamin.
- Benjamin.

656
00:48:48,698 --> 00:48:50,825
It's a pleasure to know you.

657
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:55,600
Would you like to stop somewhere
and have a drink?

658
00:48:55,705 --> 00:48:57,070
All right.

659
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:00,639
Evening, Mr. Button.

660
00:49:05,215 --> 00:49:07,149
What'll it be, sir?

661
00:49:07,884 --> 00:49:10,910
- I'll have whatever he's having.
- Sazerac for the both of us.

662
00:49:11,021 --> 00:49:13,387
With whiskey, not brandy.

663
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,980
You don't drink, do you?

664
00:49:15,092 --> 00:49:17,686
- It's a night for firsts.
- How's that?

665
00:49:17,794 --> 00:49:19,853
I've never been to a brothel, either.

666
00:49:19,963 --> 00:49:22,727
Well, it's an experience.

667
00:49:22,866 --> 00:49:25,960
It certainly is.
There's a time for everything.

668
00:49:26,069 --> 00:49:28,469
- True enough.
- Your drinks.

669
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:35,339
I don't mean to be rude, but your hands.
Is that painful?

670
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:38,307
Well, I was born
with some form of disease.

671
00:49:38,415 --> 00:49:39,973
What kind of disease?

672
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:41,812
I was born old.

673
00:49:43,353 --> 00:49:45,048
- I'm sorry.
- No need to be.

674
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:47,680
There's nothing wrong with old age.

675
00:49:56,566 --> 00:49:59,592
My wife passed away many years ago.

676
00:50:01,004 --> 00:50:02,835
I'm so, so sorry.

677
00:50:04,307 --> 00:50:06,172
She died in childbirth.

678
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:12,204
- To children.
- To mothers.

679
00:50:17,053 --> 00:50:19,317
What line of work you in, Mr. Button?

680
00:50:19,422 --> 00:50:23,552
Buttons. Button's Buttons.
There isn't a button that we don't make.

681
00:50:25,762 --> 00:50:28,128
Our biggest competition
is B.F. Goodrich

682
00:50:28,231 --> 00:50:29,960
and his infernal zippers.

683
00:50:30,066 --> 00:50:32,864
Would you gentlemen like
anything else?

684
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:34,994
One for the road, Benjamin?

685
00:50:35,105 --> 00:50:37,938
Only if you let me pay for it, Mr. Button.

686
00:50:39,209 --> 00:50:41,677
So, what line of work do you do?

687
00:50:43,113 --> 00:50:45,547
I'm a tugboat man.

688
00:50:51,755 --> 00:50:53,780
I enjoyed talking to you.

689
00:50:54,257 --> 00:50:56,384
I enjoyed drinking with you.

690
00:50:59,996 --> 00:51:01,395
Benjamin?

691
00:51:01,498 --> 00:51:04,934
Would you mind if, time to time,
I stopped by and said hello?

692
00:51:05,035 --> 00:51:08,436
Anytime. Good night, Mr. Button.

693
00:51:08,972 --> 00:51:10,735
Good night, Benjamin.

694
00:51:11,474 --> 00:51:12,839
Drive on.

695
00:51:18,515 --> 00:51:19,846
Where have you been?

696
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:24,944
Nothing. I met some people
and listened to some music.

697
00:51:27,724 --> 00:51:29,919
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!

698
00:51:30,927 --> 00:51:34,021
<i>Growing up's a funny thing.
Sneaks up on you.</i>

699
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:39,299
<i>One person is there, then suddenly
somebody else has taken her place.</i>

700
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,564
<i>She wasn't all elbows
and knees anymore.</i>

701
00:51:41,671 --> 00:51:43,366
Benjamin! Come on!

702
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,105
Okay.

703
00:51:46,376 --> 00:51:47,934
<i>I loved those weekends
when she'd come</i>

704
00:51:48,044 --> 00:51:50,842
<i>and spend the night
with her grandmother.</i>

705
00:51:58,922 --> 00:52:01,390
Daisy. Daisy.

706
00:52:02,592 --> 00:52:04,719
You want to see something?

707
00:52:05,895 --> 00:52:10,662
You gotta keep it a secret,
so get dressed. I'll meet you out back.

708
00:52:16,206 --> 00:52:17,571
Come on.

709
00:52:19,376 --> 00:52:22,504
- Can you swim?
- I can do anything you can do.

710
00:52:22,612 --> 00:52:25,206
Here, put this on. We gotta hurry.

711
00:52:38,161 --> 00:52:39,685
Is he okay?

712
00:52:39,796 --> 00:52:41,229
Captain?

713
00:52:42,866 --> 00:52:44,356
Captain Mike?

714
00:52:48,104 --> 00:52:50,800
Morning, Captain. Can you take us out?

715
00:52:51,975 --> 00:52:54,273
Do you know what day it is?

716
00:52:54,377 --> 00:52:55,639
Sunday?

717
00:52:55,745 --> 00:52:57,872
Do you know what that means?

718
00:52:59,215 --> 00:53:01,615
Means I was very drunk last night.

719
00:53:02,218 --> 00:53:04,482
Well, you're drunk every night.

720
00:53:06,956 --> 00:53:09,220
- Is that a girl?
- Close friend.

721
00:53:09,959 --> 00:53:11,051
I want to show her the river.

722
00:53:11,161 --> 00:53:14,460
You're not supposed to go joyriding
with civilians.

723
00:53:15,632 --> 00:53:17,759
I could lose my license.

724
00:53:27,577 --> 00:53:29,044
What are you waiting for?

725
00:53:59,242 --> 00:54:02,336
Pulled in for repair a wounded duck.

726
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,907
She's flying now, huh?

727
00:54:06,449 --> 00:54:08,076
Ahoy, sailor!

728
00:54:12,655 --> 00:54:14,987
I wish we could go with them.

729
00:54:20,997 --> 00:54:23,261
Did you say something, Mom?

730
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,008
It's getting really bad.

731
00:54:35,044 --> 00:54:36,807
Can you hear me, Mom?

732
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:42,111
Time just seeped out of me.

733
00:54:48,892 --> 00:54:50,689
"Things were changing quickly. "

734
00:54:50,794 --> 00:54:54,890
I don't know how it's possible,
but you seem to have more hair.

735
00:54:56,433 --> 00:54:59,402
What if I told you
that I wasn't getting older,

736
00:54:59,502 --> 00:55:02,801
but I was getting younger
than everybody else?

737
00:55:02,906 --> 00:55:06,808
Well, I'd feel sorry for you,

738
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:09,743
to have to see everybody you love
die before you do.

739
00:55:09,846 --> 00:55:11,746
It's an awful responsibility.

740
00:55:11,848 --> 00:55:15,409
<i>I'd never thought about life or death
that way before.</i>

741
00:55:17,053 --> 00:55:21,114
Benjamin, we're meant
to lose the people we love.

742
00:55:21,591 --> 00:55:24,958
How else would we know
how important they are to us?

743
00:55:28,064 --> 00:55:32,524
<i>And one fall day, a familiar visitor
came knocking on our door.</i>

744
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:37,068
You want to go with me
to the drugstore?

745
00:55:47,217 --> 00:55:49,583
<i>She taught me how to play the piano.</i>

746
00:55:49,686 --> 00:55:50,948
- Amen.
- Amen.

747
00:55:51,054 --> 00:55:54,217
<i>And she taught me
what it meant to miss somebody.</i>

748
00:55:58,795 --> 00:56:00,228
Let's go.

749
00:56:01,264 --> 00:56:03,198
<i>I had gone to a brothel.</i>

750
00:56:03,299 --> 00:56:05,597
<i>I'd had my first drink.</i>

751
00:56:05,702 --> 00:56:09,160
<i>Said goodbye to one friend
and buried another.</i>

752
00:56:09,706 --> 00:56:14,575
<i>In 1936, when I was coming to the end
of the 17th year of my life,</i>

753
00:56:14,677 --> 00:56:17,510
<i>I packed my bag, said goodbye.</i>

754
00:56:17,614 --> 00:56:19,946
- Bye, Benjamin.
- Goodbye.

755
00:56:20,049 --> 00:56:24,509
<i>I knew, life being what it was,
I'd probably never see them again.</i>

756
00:56:26,723 --> 00:56:28,350
Bye, Mr. Benjamin.

757
00:56:28,458 --> 00:56:30,926
- Good luck to you, son.
- Thank you.

758
00:56:35,465 --> 00:56:38,366
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, too, baby.

759
00:56:39,569 --> 00:56:42,800
I want you to say your prayers
every night, hear?

760
00:56:47,677 --> 00:56:49,702
Be safe, hear?

761
00:57:01,124 --> 00:57:02,489
Benjamin!

762
00:57:05,595 --> 00:57:08,223
- Where you going?
- To sea.

763
00:57:09,632 --> 00:57:11,691
I'll send you a postcard.

764
00:57:13,536 --> 00:57:15,470
From everywhere.

765
00:57:15,572 --> 00:57:18,166
Write me a postcard from everywhere.

766
00:57:32,689 --> 00:57:34,554
Can you imagine?

767
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:43,058
He sent me a postcard
from everywhere he went.

768
00:57:44,634 --> 00:57:46,602
Every place he worked.

769
00:57:47,937 --> 00:57:50,997
Newfoundland. Baffin Bay.

770
00:57:51,608 --> 00:57:54,668
Glasgow. Liverpool. Narvik.

771
00:57:55,478 --> 00:58:00,211
He had gone with that Captain Mike.

772
00:58:02,251 --> 00:58:04,481
<i>Captain Mike had contracted
for three years</i>

773
00:58:04,587 --> 00:58:06,885
<i>with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage.</i>

774
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:10,858
<i>The old ship had been refitted with
a diesel engine and a new sea winch.</i>

775
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,861
<i>We went around Florida
and up the Atlantic seaboard.</i>

776
00:58:13,963 --> 00:58:17,364
<i>We were a crew of seven now.
Captain Mike and me.</i>

777
00:58:17,467 --> 00:58:20,800
<i>Cookie, Prentiss Mayes
from Wilmington, Delaware.</i>

778
00:58:20,903 --> 00:58:23,303
<i>The Brody twins, Rick and Vic,</i>

779
00:58:23,406 --> 00:58:25,636
<i>who got along fine at sea
but, for some reason,</i>

780
00:58:25,742 --> 00:58:28,802
<i>once they were on dry land
couldn't stand the sight of each other.</i>

781
00:58:28,911 --> 00:58:32,472
You know, one in every
eight boats never returns.

782
00:58:32,582 --> 00:58:34,709
<i>There was John Grimm,
who sure fit his name.</i>

783
00:58:34,817 --> 00:58:36,648
All hands lost at sea.

784
00:58:36,753 --> 00:58:38,983
<i>From Belvedere, South Dakota.</i>

785
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:43,223
<i>And Pleasant Curtis
from Asheville, Notch.</i>

786
00:58:43,326 --> 00:58:46,489
<i>Never said a word to anyone,
except himself.</i>

787
00:58:48,598 --> 00:58:49,980
I wrote him constantly.

788
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,492
I wrote him constantly.

789
00:58:53,136 --> 00:58:58,130
<i>I told him I had been invited to
audition in New York City</i>

790
00:58:58,708 --> 00:59:01,370
<i>for the School of American Ballet.</i>

791
00:59:01,477 --> 00:59:02,876
Please stay.

792
00:59:02,979 --> 00:59:05,106
Thank you. Thank you.

793
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:08,345
You can stay.

794
00:59:10,853 --> 00:59:13,913
<i>But I was relegated to the corps.</i>

795
00:59:14,257 --> 00:59:16,623
<i>Another dancing gypsy.</i>

796
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,454
Benjamin!

797
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:25,567
How is it when you showed up

798
00:59:25,668 --> 00:59:29,536
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave,

799
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:33,837
but now, either I drink a hell
of a lot more than I think I do,

800
00:59:35,111 --> 00:59:36,738
or you sprouted?

801
00:59:37,647 --> 00:59:39,410
What's your secret?

802
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:42,408
Well, Captain,

803
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,017
you do drink a lot.

804
00:59:50,827 --> 00:59:55,093
<i>We stayed in a small hotel
with a grand name, The Winter Palace.</i>

805
00:59:55,198 --> 00:59:57,962
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

806
00:59:58,067 --> 01:00:01,525
The hummingbird
is not just another bird.

807
01:00:02,271 --> 01:00:05,968
Its heart rate's 1,200 beats per minute.

808
01:00:07,744 --> 01:00:10,440
Its wings beat 80 times a second.

809
01:00:12,381 --> 01:00:15,373
If you was to stop their wings
from beating,

810
01:00:16,018 --> 01:00:18,851
it would be dead
in less than 10 seconds.

811
01:00:19,856 --> 01:00:22,518
This is no ordinary bird.

812
01:00:23,192 --> 01:00:25,285
This is a frickin' miracle.

813
01:00:28,464 --> 01:00:32,366
They slowed down their wings
with moving pictures,

814
01:00:33,035 --> 01:00:35,230
and you know what they saw?

815
01:00:35,738 --> 01:00:38,536
Their wingtips are doing that.

816
01:00:42,578 --> 01:00:46,412
You know what the figure eight
is the mathematical symbol for?

817
01:00:49,418 --> 01:00:50,942
Infinity.

818
01:00:51,053 --> 01:00:52,384
Infinity!

819
01:00:55,892 --> 01:00:58,793
<i>Everybody, no matter
what differences they had,</i>

820
01:00:58,895 --> 01:01:02,922
<i>the languages, the color of their skin,
had one thing in common.</i>

821
01:01:03,866 --> 01:01:06,232
<i>They were drunk every single night.</i>

822
01:01:06,335 --> 01:01:07,859
Three, please.

823
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:09,562
Could you hold, dear, for us, please?

824
01:01:09,672 --> 01:01:11,936
Thank you very much. Good evening.

825
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:14,737
<i>Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.</i>

826
01:01:14,844 --> 01:01:18,143
<i>She was not beautiful.
She was plain as paper.</i>

827
01:01:18,247 --> 01:01:21,045
<i>But she was pretty as any picture to me.</i>

828
01:01:22,351 --> 01:01:24,376
What are you looking at?

829
01:01:26,622 --> 01:01:29,147
If you must know,
we have a longstanding agreement

830
01:01:29,258 --> 01:01:30,623
never to go to bed sober.

831
01:01:30,726 --> 01:01:33,126
- Isn't that right, darling?
- Whatever you say, darling.

832
01:01:33,229 --> 01:01:35,288
<i>Her husband was Walter Abbott.</i>

833
01:01:35,398 --> 01:01:39,300
<i>He was Chief Minister of
the British Trade Mission in Murmansk,</i>

834
01:01:39,402 --> 01:01:41,029
<i>and he was a spy.</i>

835
01:01:41,137 --> 01:01:44,004
- Darling.
- Oh, thank you, my darling.

836
01:01:44,106 --> 01:01:46,131
- Key, darling.
- Oh, yes.

837
01:01:50,646 --> 01:01:53,672
I broke my heel off one of my shoes.

838
01:01:53,783 --> 01:01:57,378
I'm not in the habit of walking about
in my stocking feet.

839
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:03,952
<i>They were long days there.</i>

840
01:02:11,467 --> 01:02:13,435
<i>And even longer nights.</i>

841
01:02:15,638 --> 01:02:19,199
<i>One particular night,
I was having trouble sleeping.</i>

842
01:02:20,643 --> 01:02:22,167
I'm sorry.

843
01:02:24,046 --> 01:02:25,775
I couldn't sleep.

844
01:02:38,694 --> 01:02:42,152
I was gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

845
01:02:43,065 --> 01:02:44,896
Oh, no. Thank you.

846
01:03:22,738 --> 01:03:24,296
Milk? Honey?

847
01:03:24,941 --> 01:03:26,875
A bit of honey, please.

848
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:29,173
I hope you like flies in your honey.

849
01:03:29,278 --> 01:03:30,939
Oh, perhaps not.

850
01:03:45,795 --> 01:03:50,027
Oh, maybe better to let it steep a little.

851
01:03:51,033 --> 01:03:52,227
Steep?

852
01:03:52,601 --> 01:03:53,659
Soak.

853
01:03:53,936 --> 01:03:57,599
I don't know, I mean,
there's a proper way of making tea.

854
01:03:57,707 --> 01:04:00,938
Well, where I'm from,
people just want it to be hot.

855
01:04:01,043 --> 01:04:03,136
Well, quite right.

856
01:04:12,054 --> 01:04:14,454
- Now, you're a seaman.
- A sailor.

857
01:04:14,557 --> 01:04:17,287
I hope you won't think me impolite,
but I have to ask,

858
01:04:17,393 --> 01:04:19,520
aren't you a little old
to be working on a boat?

859
01:04:19,628 --> 01:04:23,029
There's no age limit,
as long as you can do the work.

860
01:04:33,843 --> 01:04:36,141
And you have trouble sleeping?
Thank you.

861
01:04:36,245 --> 01:04:39,442
I didn't think I did.
I usually sleep like a baby.

862
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:42,850
Something's been keeping me up.

863
01:04:44,086 --> 01:04:45,280
My father, in his 80s,

864
01:04:45,388 --> 01:04:48,653
he was so convinced
he was gonna die in his sleep,

865
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:52,419
he limited himself
to having afternoon naps.

866
01:04:53,195 --> 01:04:55,959
He was so determined
he was gonna cheat death.

867
01:04:57,133 --> 01:04:58,998
- Did he?
- Did he what?

868
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,762
Die in his sleep?

869
01:05:02,471 --> 01:05:05,065
He died sitting in his favorite chair

870
01:05:05,174 --> 01:05:07,802
listening to his favorite program
on the wireless.

871
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:10,378
He must have known something.

872
01:05:16,118 --> 01:05:21,181
My husband's the British Trade Minister,
and we've been here for 14 months.

873
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:24,623
- Good God.
- We were supposed to go to Peking

874
01:05:24,727 --> 01:05:28,185
but it never seemed to work out.

875
01:05:29,665 --> 01:05:31,360
Have you been in the Far East?

876
01:05:31,467 --> 01:05:33,662
No. I've never been anywhere, really.

877
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:36,203
I mean, outside of harbors.

878
01:05:36,305 --> 01:05:37,966
And where is it that you're from?

879
01:05:38,074 --> 01:05:40,565
New Orleans. Louisiana.

880
01:05:42,078 --> 01:05:44,376
I didn't know there was another.

881
01:05:46,682 --> 01:05:51,710
<i>And she told me about all the places
she had been, and what she had seen.</i>

882
01:05:53,322 --> 01:05:56,223
<i>And we talked till just before the dawn.</i>

883
01:05:57,259 --> 01:05:58,726
I'm just a lush, myself.

884
01:05:58,828 --> 01:06:03,765
<i>And we went back to our rooms,
to our separate lives.</i>

885
01:06:09,205 --> 01:06:12,504
<i>But every night,
we'd meet again in that lobby.</i>

886
01:06:17,847 --> 01:06:21,749
<i>A hotel in the middle of the night
can be a magical place.</i>

887
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:27,521
<i>A mouse running, and stopping.</i>

888
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:31,051
<i>A radiator hissing.</i>

889
01:06:32,061 --> 01:06:33,926
<i>A curtain blowing.</i>

890
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:41,067
<i>There's something peaceful,
even comforting</i>

891
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:44,401
<i>knowing that the people you love
are asleep in their beds</i>

892
01:06:44,507 --> 01:06:46,737
<i>where nothing can harm them.</i>

893
01:06:49,845 --> 01:06:52,780
<i>Elizabeth and I would lose track
of the night</i>

894
01:06:53,315 --> 01:06:55,476
<i>until just before daybreak.</i>

895
01:06:58,087 --> 01:07:00,885
I think I may have given you
the wrong impression.

896
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:02,514
Beg pardon?

897
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:06,425
Well, married women don't customarily
sit around

898
01:07:06,529 --> 01:07:08,554
in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels.

899
01:07:08,664 --> 01:07:12,191
I wouldn't know what a married woman
does or doesn't do.

900
01:07:17,973 --> 01:07:19,406
Good night.

901
01:07:21,744 --> 01:07:23,041
Murmansk.

902
01:07:25,681 --> 01:07:28,741
"I've met somebody,
and I've fallen in love. "

903
01:07:28,851 --> 01:07:30,045
Mom?

904
01:07:33,889 --> 01:07:36,414
That was over 60 years ago.

905
01:07:37,726 --> 01:07:38,750
Did you love him, Mother?

906
01:07:38,861 --> 01:07:41,625
What does a girl know about love?

907
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,425
Well...

908
01:08:18,934 --> 01:08:22,700
- I'm not dressed.
- Oh, you look splendid, just as you are.

909
01:08:24,974 --> 01:08:28,034
Don't waste any time bothering about
the wine or the cheese in Murmansk,

910
01:08:28,143 --> 01:08:31,169
'cause they're really
completely ordinary,

911
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:36,240
but the caviar and the vodka

912
01:08:36,819 --> 01:08:40,915
are sublime and plentiful.

913
01:08:44,727 --> 01:08:45,989
So.

914
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:52,597
Savor it.

915
01:08:54,737 --> 01:08:56,705
And don't eat it all at once,

916
01:08:56,805 --> 01:08:59,899
because that way,
there's nothing left to enjoy.

917
01:09:01,577 --> 01:09:05,911
And now, take a little swallow of vodka
while it's still in your mouth.

918
01:09:20,796 --> 01:09:23,629
You haven't been with many women,
have you?

919
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:26,460
Not on Sundays.

920
01:09:28,671 --> 01:09:30,400
And you've never had caviar before,
have you?

921
01:09:30,506 --> 01:09:32,133
No, ma'am.

922
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:39,641
When I was 19,

923
01:09:40,649 --> 01:09:46,918
I attempted to become the first woman
ever to swim the English Channel.

924
01:09:47,923 --> 01:09:49,322
Really?

925
01:09:49,958 --> 01:09:52,984
But the current that day
was so strong that,

926
01:09:53,095 --> 01:09:56,189
for every stroke I took,
I was pushed back two.

927
01:09:56,799 --> 01:09:59,393
<i>I was in the water for 32 hours.</i>

928
01:10:00,369 --> 01:10:04,203
And when I was two miles from Calais,

929
01:10:05,341 --> 01:10:07,070
<i>it started to rain.</i>

930
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:09,710
That's it! Steady on!

931
01:10:10,245 --> 01:10:12,873
<i>When I couldn't go any further,</i>

932
01:10:14,483 --> 01:10:15,916
I stopped.

933
01:10:17,319 --> 01:10:18,911
<i>I just stopped.</i>

934
01:10:19,521 --> 01:10:24,390
And everybody asked me,
would I try again?

935
01:10:25,127 --> 01:10:26,992
<i>For why wouldn't I?</i>

936
01:10:29,898 --> 01:10:31,593
But I never did.

937
01:10:33,035 --> 01:10:37,267
As a matter of fact, I've never done
anything with my life after that.

938
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:43,435
Your hands are so coarse.

939
01:10:53,789 --> 01:10:56,349
I can feel the wind in your cheek.

940
01:11:03,132 --> 01:11:05,623
I'm afraid it's the witching hour.

941
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:14,771
<i>It was the first time
a woman had ever kissed me.</i>

942
01:11:15,344 --> 01:11:17,744
<i>It's something you never forget.</i>

943
01:11:28,257 --> 01:11:30,282
I think you make me feel younger.

944
01:11:30,392 --> 01:11:32,917
You make me feel years younger, too.

945
01:11:33,028 --> 01:11:34,620
I wish I was.

946
01:11:35,631 --> 01:11:37,758
So many things I'd change.

947
01:11:38,467 --> 01:11:40,799
I'd undo all my mistakes.

948
01:11:40,903 --> 01:11:42,598
What mistakes?

949
01:11:45,941 --> 01:11:48,102
I kept waiting, you know?

950
01:11:48,744 --> 01:11:53,238
Thinking that I'd do something
to change my circumstances.

951
01:11:54,516 --> 01:11:56,245
Do something.

952
01:11:57,820 --> 01:12:01,051
Such an awful waste.
You never get it back.

953
01:12:01,523 --> 01:12:02,990
Wasted time.

954
01:12:09,298 --> 01:12:11,698
If we're going to have an affair,

955
01:12:12,434 --> 01:12:15,267
you're never to look at me
during the day.

956
01:12:15,904 --> 01:12:18,839
And we're always to part before sunrise.

957
01:12:19,508 --> 01:12:22,136
And we will never say "I love you. "

958
01:12:23,779 --> 01:12:25,576
Those are the rules.

959
01:12:28,183 --> 01:12:30,344
- Are you cold?
- I'm freezing.

960
01:12:30,452 --> 01:12:32,386
Oh, you! You're frozen.

961
01:12:32,488 --> 01:12:35,685
What an idiot, I'm standing here
in this fur. How thoughtless of me.

962
01:13:09,358 --> 01:13:12,156
<i>She was the first woman
that ever loved me.</i>

963
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:16,358
You want me to skip some?

964
01:13:16,465 --> 01:13:22,233
No, I'm glad he had somebody
to keep him warm.

965
01:13:25,908 --> 01:13:28,376
"I couldn't wait to see her again. "

966
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:43,588
<i>We saw each other every night.</i>

967
01:13:44,192 --> 01:13:46,490
<i>We always used the same room.</i>

968
01:13:48,463 --> 01:13:51,796
<i>But each time seemed new
and different.</i>

969
01:13:53,201 --> 01:13:54,634
Come here.

970
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:03,509
Elizabeth.

971
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,279
Good night.

972
01:14:08,984 --> 01:14:10,611
<i>Until one night.</i>

973
01:14:47,889 --> 01:14:53,486
<i>Yesterday, December 7th, 1941,</i>

974
01:14:53,595 --> 01:14:56,689
<i>a date which will live in infamy...</i>

975
01:14:56,798 --> 01:15:00,928
It's a meeting, a policy meeting
regarding your future,

976
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:03,428
possibly beyond.

977
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,400
There's been a change of plan, lads.

978
01:15:07,609 --> 01:15:10,203
As you may or may not know,

979
01:15:10,312 --> 01:15:12,906
the Japs bombed
Pearl Harbor yesterday.

980
01:15:13,348 --> 01:15:16,806
Frank D. Roosevelt's asked
each of us to do our part.

981
01:15:17,319 --> 01:15:21,415
<i>The Chelsea's been commissioned
to serve in the United States Navy.</i>

982
01:15:21,857 --> 01:15:25,122
To repair, to salvage, and to rescue.

983
01:15:26,662 --> 01:15:30,996
Anybody doesn't want to go to war,
now is the time to say so.

984
01:15:31,099 --> 01:15:35,297
Once you set foot on that boat,
you're in the Navy, friend.

985
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:41,566
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk with you, Mike.

986
01:15:41,677 --> 01:15:43,668
My wife's doing poorly.

987
01:15:43,779 --> 01:15:46,509
I'd like to maybe see her one more time.

988
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:52,050
You're free to make your way home
any way you can, Mr. Mayes.

989
01:15:57,693 --> 01:15:59,456
Well, if he's leaving, who's gonna cook?

990
01:15:59,561 --> 01:16:03,622
Food poisoning's one of the leading
causes of death at sea.

991
01:16:03,732 --> 01:16:06,098
Right after
inadequate safety equipment.

992
01:16:06,201 --> 01:16:08,829
I can cook, Captain.
Been doing it all my life.

993
01:16:08,937 --> 01:16:13,340
I don't know.
You're a little moody for war, Benjamin.

994
01:16:13,442 --> 01:16:15,410
What the hell?

995
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:19,844
I'll take any man wants to kick the shite
out of the Japs and the Huns.

996
01:16:21,249 --> 01:16:25,015
That's it, pack your gear.
We're going to war, gentlemen!

997
01:16:31,893 --> 01:16:33,656
<i>She had left a note.</i>

998
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:37,760
<i>She wrote,
"It was nice to have met you. "</i>

999
01:16:38,533 --> 01:16:40,125
<i>And that was it.</i>

1000
01:16:43,371 --> 01:16:46,431
<i>It wasn't the war any of us expected.</i>

1001
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:50,170
<i>We would just tow crippled ships,
scraps of metal, really.</i>

1002
01:16:50,779 --> 01:16:53,748
<i>If there was a war, we didn't see it.</i>

1003
01:16:55,650 --> 01:16:59,711
<i>There was a man assigned to us.
The Chief Gunner loved the Navy.</i>

1004
01:16:59,821 --> 01:17:02,016
<i>But most of all, he loved America.</i>

1005
01:17:02,124 --> 01:17:05,025
There is no other country in the world.

1006
01:17:05,127 --> 01:17:06,219
When you spell America...

1007
01:17:06,328 --> 01:17:10,492
<i>His name was Dennis Smith,
and he was a full-blooded Cherokee.</i>

1008
01:17:10,599 --> 01:17:13,693
<i>His family had been Americans
for over 500 years.</i>

1009
01:17:13,802 --> 01:17:18,330
These pacifists.
They say they won't fight on conscience.

1010
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:22,035
Now, where would be
if everybody decided to act

1011
01:17:22,144 --> 01:17:26,103
- according to their conscience?
- Keep it down, would you, Chief?

1012
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:45,700
Hey. I've been watching you.

1013
01:17:46,868 --> 01:17:48,665
You seem trustworthy.

1014
01:17:50,472 --> 01:17:52,565
If something happens to me,

1015
01:17:56,645 --> 01:17:59,205
could you see that this gets to my wife?

1016
01:17:59,314 --> 01:18:03,842
<i>He'd given me all of his pay.
Hadn't spent a dime of it.</i>

1017
01:18:05,754 --> 01:18:09,019
I want my family to know
I was thinking about them.

1018
01:18:13,795 --> 01:18:15,626
All hands on deck!

1019
01:18:42,224 --> 01:18:44,419
<i>The war had finally found us.</i>

1020
01:18:47,128 --> 01:18:48,595
All stop!

1021
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:53,324
Pleasant, man that light.

1022
01:19:01,209 --> 01:19:05,373
<i>A transport carrying 1,300 men
had been split by a torpedo.</i>

1023
01:19:07,782 --> 01:19:10,046
<i>We were first to arrive at the scene.</i>

1024
01:19:10,151 --> 01:19:13,712
- Cut the engines!
- All stop!

1025
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:20,760
<i>We were the only sound.</i>

1026
01:19:34,709 --> 01:19:36,108
Fellas!

1027
01:19:46,087 --> 01:19:47,145
Sub!

1028
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,758
We sure as hell
can't outrun them fuckers.

1029
01:19:56,498 --> 01:19:58,796
Battle stations!

1030
01:20:08,677 --> 01:20:09,666
Thank you, Chief.

1031
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:13,072
What?

1032
01:20:26,061 --> 01:20:27,858
Is that the last one?

1033
01:21:49,477 --> 01:21:50,705
Captain!

1034
01:22:06,361 --> 01:22:08,989
They shot the hell out of my painting!

1035
01:22:10,265 --> 01:22:12,096
Give me your other hand.

1036
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,496
You'll be all right, Captain.

1037
01:22:18,606 --> 01:22:22,872
They got a nice spot in Heaven
waiting for you. Nice spot.

1038
01:22:24,412 --> 01:22:27,438
You can be as mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

1039
01:22:30,452 --> 01:22:34,115
You could swear, curse the Fates.

1040
01:22:36,424 --> 01:22:38,551
But when it comes to the end,

1041
01:22:40,762 --> 01:22:42,491
you have to let go.

1042
01:22:49,504 --> 01:22:50,732
Captain?

1043
01:23:11,593 --> 01:23:14,892
<i>Thirteen hundred and twenty eight men
died that day.</i>

1044
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:20,429
<i>I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee,
Dennis Smith.</i>

1045
01:23:21,402 --> 01:23:24,599
<i>John Grimm, who was right,
he was gonna die there.</i>

1046
01:23:26,107 --> 01:23:28,803
<i>I sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his money.</i>

1047
01:23:29,644 --> 01:23:32,704
<i>I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody,</i>

1048
01:23:32,814 --> 01:23:37,478
<i>and to Mike Clark,
captain of the tugboat Chelsea.</i>

1049
01:23:39,954 --> 01:23:44,414
<i>I said goodbye to all the other men
who had dreams of their own,</i>

1050
01:23:44,526 --> 01:23:47,086
<i>all the men
who wanted to be insurance salesmen</i>

1051
01:23:47,195 --> 01:23:50,130
<i>or doctors or lawyers or Indian chiefs.</i>

1052
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:52,996
This don't get fixed.

1053
01:23:55,103 --> 01:23:58,163
<i>Out here, death didn't seem natural.</i>

1054
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:18,353
<i>I'd never seen a hummingbird
that far out to sea.</i>

1055
01:24:19,894 --> 01:24:21,486
<i>Before or since.</i>

1056
01:24:27,517 --> 01:24:33,752
<i>And in May of 1945,
when I was 26 years old,</i>

1057
01:24:33,857 --> 01:24:34,958
<i>I came home.</i>

1058
01:24:35,859 --> 01:24:38,453
I'm ready! I'm ready!

1059
01:24:38,561 --> 01:24:39,926
I'm coming!

1060
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:44,459
- I'm ready!
- All right, I'm coming, Miss Alfalina.

1061
01:24:44,567 --> 01:24:46,057
- Queenie?
- Yes?

1062
01:24:51,941 --> 01:24:57,846
Sweet Jesus! Oh, you're home!
Oh, Lord, you came back!

1063
01:24:58,748 --> 01:25:00,682
- Let me look at you.
- Who's that, Mama?

1064
01:25:00,784 --> 01:25:04,049
- Child, it's your brother, Benjamin.
- I didn't know he was my brother.

1065
01:25:04,154 --> 01:25:05,815
There's a shitload of things
you don't know, child.

1066
01:25:05,922 --> 01:25:07,082
Get on out there and finish sweeping.

1067
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:09,351
Come here, wash your hands,
help me with the table. Go on, now.

1068
01:25:09,459 --> 01:25:13,361
Turn around.
You look like you've been born again.

1069
01:25:13,463 --> 01:25:15,727
Younger than the springtime.

1070
01:25:15,832 --> 01:25:19,461
I think that preacher laid hands on you
gave you a second life.

1071
01:25:19,569 --> 01:25:23,198
I knew it that moment I saw you,
you were special.

1072
01:25:23,306 --> 01:25:25,171
I tell you what, my knees are sore,

1073
01:25:25,275 --> 01:25:27,800
'cause I've been on them every night
asking the Lord,

1074
01:25:27,911 --> 01:25:31,642
I said,
"God, just bring him home safely. "

1075
01:25:31,748 --> 01:25:34,239
Remember what I told you?

1076
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:35,977
"You never know
what's coming for you"?

1077
01:25:36,086 --> 01:25:37,986
That's right. Sit down.

1078
01:25:39,389 --> 01:25:43,485
Well, you learn anything
worth repeating?

1079
01:25:45,595 --> 01:25:49,827
- I sure saw some things.
- Oh, you seen some pain.

1080
01:25:51,334 --> 01:25:54,098
- Some joy, too?
- Sure. Sure, I did.

1081
01:25:54,204 --> 01:25:58,334
Yeah, that's what I want to hear.
Look at you.

1082
01:25:58,441 --> 01:26:01,933
- Where's Tizzy?
- Oh, baby.

1083
01:26:04,414 --> 01:26:08,282
Mr. Weathers died in his sleep
one night last April.

1084
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:11,842
- Mama, I'm so sorry.
- Don't you worry about that, baby.

1085
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:16,218
Yeah, well, it's only
one or two of them left now.

1086
01:26:16,326 --> 01:26:17,793
They all just about new.

1087
01:26:17,894 --> 01:26:21,796
Guess they're waiting their turn
like everybody else, huh?

1088
01:26:21,898 --> 01:26:24,628
I'm so glad you're back home with me!

1089
01:26:24,734 --> 01:26:27,862
Now, we're gonna have to find you
a wife and a new job! That's right.

1090
01:26:27,971 --> 01:26:29,836
Come on in here,
help me with this table.

1091
01:26:33,009 --> 01:26:34,601
Benjamin.

1092
01:26:34,711 --> 01:26:37,839
You're wasting your time, baby.
She's stone deaf.

1093
01:26:37,947 --> 01:26:41,974
Oh, and you'll be staying in
what was Mrs. DeSeroux's old room.

1094
01:26:42,085 --> 01:26:44,986
You're too big to be rooming
with anybody else.

1095
01:26:49,125 --> 01:26:51,719
<i>It's a funny thing about coming home.</i>

1096
01:26:52,395 --> 01:26:56,161
<i>Looks the same,
smells the same, feels the same.</i>

1097
01:26:58,935 --> 01:27:02,769
Did I ever tell you I've been struck
by lightning seven times?

1098
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:07,807
Once when I was sitting in my truck,
just minding my own business.

1099
01:27:13,683 --> 01:27:17,119
<i>You realize what's changed is you.</i>

1100
01:27:19,789 --> 01:27:23,816
<i>And late one morning,
not long after I'd been back...</i>

1101
01:27:24,227 --> 01:27:25,558
Thank you.

1102
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:48,708
Hey.

1103
01:27:53,289 --> 01:27:57,157
- Excuse me, is Queenie here?
- Daisy?

1104
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:04,525
- It's me, Benjamin.
- Benjamin?

1105
01:28:08,271 --> 01:28:10,239
Oh, my God!

1106
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:15,443
Of course it's you! Benjamin!

1107
01:28:17,547 --> 01:28:20,414
How are you?
It's been such a long time.

1108
01:28:20,516 --> 01:28:23,246
There's so much I want to know.
When did you get back?

1109
01:28:23,353 --> 01:28:24,752
Well, I got back a few weeks ago.

1110
01:28:24,854 --> 01:28:28,847
I spoke to Queenie, she said you were
in the war, somewhere at sea.

1111
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:32,689
- We were so, so worried about you.
- Oh, I'm okay.

1112
01:28:32,795 --> 01:28:36,663
Well, look at you. You're so lovely.

1113
01:28:38,468 --> 01:28:40,231
You stopped writing.

1114
01:28:42,338 --> 01:28:47,435
"When I had left, she was a girl.
And a woman had taken her place.

1115
01:28:47,777 --> 01:28:50,940
"She was the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen. "

1116
01:28:51,047 --> 01:28:52,378
Beautiful.

1117
01:28:54,584 --> 01:28:56,381
"The most beautiful. "

1118
01:28:58,187 --> 01:28:59,916
- You remember Grandma Fuller?
- Why, sure I do.

1119
01:29:00,023 --> 01:29:03,083
- She passed.
- I heard that. I'm sorry.

1120
01:29:03,192 --> 01:29:07,788
I just can't believe we're both here.
Must be fate.

1121
01:29:07,897 --> 01:29:09,865
No, no, what do they call it?

1122
01:29:09,966 --> 01:29:11,365
Kismet.

1123
01:29:11,467 --> 01:29:13,367
Do you know about Edgar Cayce,
the psychic?

1124
01:29:13,469 --> 01:29:14,458
I don't believe I...

1125
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:17,437
He says
that everything is predetermined,

1126
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:20,873
but I like to think of it as fate.

1127
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,345
I'm not sure how it works,
but I'm glad it happened.

1128
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:31,045
Have you been to Manhattan?
It's right across the river from me.

1129
01:29:31,154 --> 01:29:33,281
Now, I can see
the Empire State Building

1130
01:29:33,389 --> 01:29:35,152
if I stand on my bed.

1131
01:29:35,258 --> 01:29:37,249
What about you?
Where have you been?

1132
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,955
Tell me everything. Last time you wrote,
you said you'd been to Russia.

1133
01:29:41,064 --> 01:29:45,228
I've always wanted to go to Russia.
Is it as cold as they say?

1134
01:29:45,335 --> 01:29:48,099
- Twice as cold.
- My goodness.

1135
01:29:48,705 --> 01:29:53,369
We always said you were different.
But I think you really are.

1136
01:29:55,478 --> 01:29:59,005
You wrote that you met somebody.
Did it work out?

1137
01:29:59,515 --> 01:30:01,176
It ran its course.

1138
01:30:02,552 --> 01:30:04,577
Hey, do you remember this?

1139
01:30:15,498 --> 01:30:18,194
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo

1140
01:30:18,301 --> 01:30:20,394
"at 5:00 in the afternoon. "

1141
01:30:22,238 --> 01:30:24,433
Would you like to have dinner?

1142
01:30:31,948 --> 01:30:34,849
<i>Did I tell you
that I danced for Balanchine?</i>

1143
01:30:35,551 --> 01:30:40,045
<i>Oh, he's a famous choreographer.
He said that I had perfect line.</i>

1144
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:46,319
<i>You know, in a rehearsal once,
a dancer fell.</i>

1145
01:30:46,429 --> 01:30:49,227
<i>And he just...
He just put it right into the production.</i>

1146
01:30:49,332 --> 01:30:52,824
<i>I mean, can you imagine that?
Like in a... In a classical ballet?</i>

1147
01:30:52,935 --> 01:30:56,166
<i>You know, a dancer,
intentionally falling.</i>

1148
01:30:56,272 --> 01:30:59,901
<i>There's a whole new word
for dance now. It's called "abstract. "</i>

1149
01:31:00,009 --> 01:31:01,340
<i>No, he's not the only one, though.</i>

1150
01:31:01,444 --> 01:31:05,346
<i>There's Lincoln Kirstein
and Lucia Chase, and oh, my...</i>

1151
01:31:05,448 --> 01:31:07,939
<i>Oh, there's Agnes de Mille.</i>

1152
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:10,109
<i>She's just torn up all those conventions,</i>

1153
01:31:10,219 --> 01:31:12,187
<i>you know,
all that straight-up-and-down stuff.</i>

1154
01:31:12,288 --> 01:31:15,485
<i>It's not about the formality of the dance,
it's about what the dancer's feeling.</i>

1155
01:31:15,591 --> 01:31:18,287
<i>As she told me
about this big new world,</i>

1156
01:31:18,394 --> 01:31:20,885
<i>names that didn't mean a thing to me,</i>

1157
01:31:20,997 --> 01:31:23,056
<i>I didn't really hear very much
of what she was saying.</i>

1158
01:31:23,166 --> 01:31:25,396
<i>It's new and it's modern
and it's American.</i>

1159
01:31:25,501 --> 01:31:28,664
They understand our vigor
and our physicality.

1160
01:31:28,771 --> 01:31:30,898
Oh, my God.
I've just been talking and talking.

1161
01:31:31,073 --> 01:31:35,510
No, no, I've enjoyed listening.
I didn't know you smoked.

1162
01:31:35,611 --> 01:31:37,135
I'm old enough.

1163
01:31:40,516 --> 01:31:43,007
I'm old enough for a lot of things.

1164
01:31:45,955 --> 01:31:48,389
In New York, we stay up all night,

1165
01:31:49,659 --> 01:31:52,457
watch the sun come up
over the warehouses.

1166
01:31:54,797 --> 01:31:57,095
There's always something to do.

1167
01:32:14,784 --> 01:32:16,877
I have to go back tomorrow.

1168
01:32:18,054 --> 01:32:20,181
- So soon.
- Wish I could stay.

1169
01:32:24,994 --> 01:32:28,157
Dancers don't need costumes
or scenery anymore.

1170
01:32:28,264 --> 01:32:31,791
I can imagine
dancing completely naked.

1171
01:32:33,102 --> 01:32:35,468
Have you read D.H. Lawrence?

1172
01:32:35,571 --> 01:32:37,664
- Well...
- His books were banned.

1173
01:32:37,773 --> 01:32:41,300
The words are like making love.

1174
01:33:25,855 --> 01:33:30,451
In our company,
we have to trust each other.

1175
01:33:35,765 --> 01:33:39,428
Sex is a part of it.

1176
01:33:43,839 --> 01:33:46,740
You know,
a lot of the dancers are lesbians.

1177
01:33:48,878 --> 01:33:51,972
There was one woman
who wanted to sleep with me.

1178
01:33:59,288 --> 01:34:02,280
- Does that upset you?
- Which part?

1179
01:34:03,392 --> 01:34:05,826
Somebody wanting to sleep with me.

1180
01:34:06,362 --> 01:34:07,522
You're a desirable woman.

1181
01:34:07,630 --> 01:34:11,361
I would think most of them
would want to sleep with you.

1182
01:34:11,467 --> 01:34:13,526
Let's go back to the house.

1183
01:34:14,503 --> 01:34:16,903
Or we could get a room somewhere.

1184
01:34:19,875 --> 01:34:23,072
- We could lay down your jacket.
- I don't know, Daisy.

1185
01:34:23,179 --> 01:34:28,515
It's not that I wouldn't like to or anything.
I think I'll just disappoint you.

1186
01:34:29,452 --> 01:34:32,512
Oh, Benjamin, I've been with older men.

1187
01:34:33,322 --> 01:34:35,313
You're going back to New York
in the morning.

1188
01:34:35,424 --> 01:34:37,756
You should be with your friends.

1189
01:34:38,761 --> 01:34:41,252
- You're only young once.
- Oh, I'm old enough.

1190
01:34:41,364 --> 01:34:43,958
Daisy, just not tonight, is all.

1191
01:34:57,513 --> 01:34:59,640
We could go hear some music.

1192
01:35:01,917 --> 01:35:04,613
<i>Our lives are defined by opportunities.</i>

1193
01:35:05,454 --> 01:35:07,445
<i>Even the ones we miss.</i>

1194
01:35:08,324 --> 01:35:11,953
You look so handsome
and so distinguished.

1195
01:35:12,061 --> 01:35:14,222
They're saying the hurricane's
gonna miss us, blow right on by.

1196
01:35:14,330 --> 01:35:18,926
- Oh, that's great.
- I'll stay under the blankets with Mother.

1197
01:35:19,035 --> 01:35:23,096
She says nothing... Benjamin?

1198
01:35:25,041 --> 01:35:26,099
"Things were becoming different... "

1199
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,368
<i>...for me.</i>

1200
01:35:27,476 --> 01:35:31,071
<i>My hair had very little gray
and grew like weeds.</i>

1201
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:34,946
<i>My sense of smell was keener.
My hearing, more acute.</i>

1202
01:35:35,051 --> 01:35:37,679
<i>I could walk further and faster.</i>

1203
01:35:37,787 --> 01:35:43,555
<i>While everybody else was aging,
I was getting younger, all alone.</i>

1204
01:35:46,595 --> 01:35:47,823
Come in.

1205
01:35:49,231 --> 01:35:50,528
Benjamin.

1206
01:35:51,534 --> 01:35:54,731
- Do you remember me?
- Well, sure I do, Mr. Button.

1207
01:35:55,438 --> 01:35:58,999
- What happened to you?
- Darn foot. Got infected, so...

1208
01:36:00,676 --> 01:36:01,904
Welcome home, my friend.

1209
01:36:04,613 --> 01:36:07,707
I see you're still drinking
your Sazerac with whiskey.

1210
01:36:07,817 --> 01:36:09,045
Creature of habit.

1211
01:36:09,151 --> 01:36:11,244
You still visiting the house
on Bourbon Street?

1212
01:36:11,353 --> 01:36:13,082
Not for a long time.

1213
01:36:14,690 --> 01:36:16,783
Interesting times, though.

1214
01:36:16,892 --> 01:36:21,329
We went from making 40,000
to nearly half a million buttons a day.

1215
01:36:21,430 --> 01:36:23,421
We employed 10 times
the number of people.

1216
01:36:23,532 --> 01:36:26,023
We were operating around the clock.

1217
01:36:30,606 --> 01:36:31,971
Damn shame.

1218
01:36:33,109 --> 01:36:36,044
The war has been kind
to the button industry.

1219
01:36:38,781 --> 01:36:40,112
You know,

1220
01:36:42,384 --> 01:36:45,717
I'm sick.
I don't know how much longer I have.

1221
01:36:45,821 --> 01:36:48,654
- I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Button.
- No...

1222
01:36:50,059 --> 01:36:53,119
I don't have any people.
I keep to myself.

1223
01:36:55,631 --> 01:36:58,623
I hope you don't mind,
but, whenever possible,

1224
01:36:58,734 --> 01:37:00,725
I'd enjoy your company.

1225
01:37:00,836 --> 01:37:03,327
I'll certainly do what I can.

1226
01:37:06,642 --> 01:37:09,543
Benjamin, do you know anything
about buttons?

1227
01:37:13,149 --> 01:37:17,779
Now, Button's Buttons has been
in our family for 124 years.

1228
01:37:18,454 --> 01:37:23,050
My grandfather was a tailor,
and he had a small shop in Richmond.

1229
01:37:23,159 --> 01:37:25,559
After the Civil War,
he moved to New Orleans,

1230
01:37:25,661 --> 01:37:30,689
where my father had the wisdom
to make our own buttons.

1231
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:35,669
So, with his help,
the tailor shop grew to this.

1232
01:37:36,405 --> 01:37:38,999
And today, I can't sew a stitch.

1233
01:37:43,212 --> 01:37:45,544
That's very, very interesting.

1234
01:37:49,018 --> 01:37:51,612
You sure have done well for yourself.

1235
01:37:52,555 --> 01:37:56,616
So, what can I do for you, Mr. Button?

1236
01:37:59,161 --> 01:38:02,153
Benjamin? You're my son.

1237
01:38:09,705 --> 01:38:12,333
I'm so sorry I never told you before.

1238
01:38:14,510 --> 01:38:17,877
You were born
the night the Great War ended.

1239
01:38:19,782 --> 01:38:23,479
Your mother died giving birth to you.

1240
01:38:24,987 --> 01:38:27,182
I thought you were a monster.

1241
01:38:30,759 --> 01:38:34,024
I promised your mother
I'd make sure you were safe.

1242
01:38:40,469 --> 01:38:42,903
I should never have abandoned you.

1243
01:38:47,042 --> 01:38:48,373
My mother?

1244
01:38:49,745 --> 01:38:52,680
At the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

1245
01:38:52,781 --> 01:38:56,217
When I was a boy,
I'd love to wake up before anyone else,

1246
01:38:56,318 --> 01:38:59,310
run down to that lake
and watch the day begin.

1247
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:03,618
It was as if I was the only one alive.

1248
01:39:05,461 --> 01:39:08,157
I fell in love the first time I saw her.

1249
01:39:08,731 --> 01:39:11,359
Your mother's name
was Caroline Murphy.

1250
01:39:12,001 --> 01:39:14,868
She worked
in your grandfather's kitchen.

1251
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:19,801
She's from Dublin.

1252
01:39:20,476 --> 01:39:24,879
In 1903, Caroline and all her brothers
and sisters came to live here,

1253
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:26,504
in New Orleans.

1254
01:39:28,651 --> 01:39:31,484
I'd find excuses
to go down to that kitchen

1255
01:39:32,321 --> 01:39:34,448
just so I could look at her.

1256
01:39:40,829 --> 01:39:44,560
April 25th, 1918.
Happiest day of my life.

1257
01:39:45,334 --> 01:39:47,564
The day I married your mother.

1258
01:39:49,305 --> 01:39:51,432
Why didn't you just tell me?

1259
01:39:52,308 --> 01:39:55,141
I plan on leaving everything I have
to you.

1260
01:39:56,679 --> 01:39:59,113
- I have to go.
- Where?

1261
01:40:00,182 --> 01:40:01,547
Home.

1262
01:40:02,251 --> 01:40:03,582
And what does he think, anyway?

1263
01:40:03,686 --> 01:40:04,983
He thinks he can just show up

1264
01:40:05,087 --> 01:40:06,952
and everything's
supposed to be fine and dandy.

1265
01:40:07,056 --> 01:40:09,650
Everybody's just supposed to be friends.

1266
01:40:09,758 --> 01:40:12,659
Well, he got another thing coming,
that's for sure.

1267
01:40:12,761 --> 01:40:16,162
God be my witness,
he got another thing coming.

1268
01:40:16,265 --> 01:40:19,325
He left us $18 that night you was found.

1269
01:40:19,435 --> 01:40:21,266
Eighteen ratty dollars

1270
01:40:21,370 --> 01:40:23,065
- and a filthy diaper.
- Good night, Mama.

1271
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:25,634
Good night, baby.

1272
01:40:38,921 --> 01:40:43,255
Did I ever tell you
I was struck by lightning seven times?

1273
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,085
Once, I was walking my dog
down the road.

1274
01:40:52,101 --> 01:40:55,935
I'm blind in the one eye,
can't hardly hear,

1275
01:40:57,206 --> 01:41:01,802
get twitches and shakes out of nowhere,
always losing my line of thought.

1276
01:41:03,379 --> 01:41:05,040
But you know what?

1277
01:41:05,814 --> 01:41:08,749
God keeps reminding me
I'm lucky to be alive.

1278
01:41:14,523 --> 01:41:16,047
Storm's coming.

1279
01:41:43,986 --> 01:41:46,216
May I help you, sir?
Up the stairs, first bedroom.

1280
01:41:46,321 --> 01:41:47,379
Thank you.

1281
01:42:03,272 --> 01:42:04,500
Wake up.

1282
01:42:07,042 --> 01:42:08,907
Let's get you dressed.

1283
01:42:36,338 --> 01:42:37,965
Now that's something.

1284
01:42:41,276 --> 01:42:42,607
Thank you.

1285
01:43:42,771 --> 01:43:46,730
<i>You can be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.</i>

1286
01:43:46,842 --> 01:43:49,242
<i>You can swear and curse the Fates.</i>

1287
01:43:50,846 --> 01:43:53,041
<i>But when it comes to the end,</i>

1288
01:43:54,283 --> 01:43:56,012
<i>you have to let go.</i>

1289
01:44:18,006 --> 01:44:20,600
Well, it sure is a beautiful service.

1290
01:44:22,477 --> 01:44:25,275
He'll be buried
right next to your mother.

1291
01:44:26,748 --> 01:44:28,375
You're my mother.

1292
01:44:32,221 --> 01:44:33,449
My baby.

1293
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:40,187
<i>Now, I'd never seen New York.</i>

1294
01:46:08,383 --> 01:46:11,750
- Excuse me, I'm a friend of Daisy's.
- Right this way.

1295
01:46:12,821 --> 01:46:18,157
- Daisy has company. Daisy! Daisy!
- Yes!

1296
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:21,825
- We need the wardrobe.
- Is somebody looking for me?

1297
01:46:24,433 --> 01:46:25,463
- Benjamin.
- Hi.

1298
01:46:25,563 --> 01:46:26,623
- Benjamin.
- Hi.

1299
01:46:27,936 --> 01:46:31,702
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd come visit.

1300
01:46:31,807 --> 01:46:35,265
Spend some time with you, if I could.

1301
01:46:35,377 --> 01:46:41,247
Oh, well, I wish you would've called.
You took me by surprise.

1302
01:46:42,617 --> 01:46:46,747
- You can just throw them out.
- No. Thank you, they're lovely.

1303
01:46:47,389 --> 01:46:52,190
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.
I thought you were mesmerizing.

1304
01:46:54,229 --> 01:46:57,027
Thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.

1305
01:47:02,371 --> 01:47:04,396
I better get changed.
A group of us are going to a party.

1306
01:47:04,506 --> 01:47:07,771
- Would you want to come?
- Someone told me about a restaurant

1307
01:47:07,876 --> 01:47:09,138
I thought you might enjoy.

1308
01:47:09,244 --> 01:47:11,735
I made a reservation, just in case.

1309
01:47:11,847 --> 01:47:14,839
Just, all the dancers go out
after the show. You're...

1310
01:47:14,950 --> 01:47:18,750
You're welcome to come with us.
I'll get changed. All right?

1311
01:47:25,227 --> 01:47:27,320
She choreographs
for the Ballets Russes.

1312
01:47:27,429 --> 01:47:28,726
She's divine.

1313
01:47:29,364 --> 01:47:31,195
You were breathtaking.

1314
01:47:36,905 --> 01:47:38,133
Sweetie.

1315
01:47:39,307 --> 01:47:42,174
This is David.
He dances with the company.

1316
01:47:43,178 --> 01:47:45,203
- This is Benjamin.
- Who?

1317
01:47:45,313 --> 01:47:48,544
- I told you about him.
- Oh, yeah. How you doing?

1318
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:52,108
- I'll go get you a drink.
- All right. Thanks.

1319
01:47:59,828 --> 01:48:02,991
So, you were a friend
of her grandmother's?

1320
01:48:03,098 --> 01:48:04,998
Or something like that?

1321
01:48:06,168 --> 01:48:07,931
Something like that.

1322
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:09,794
Hey, excuse me.

1323
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:33,388
Come on.

1324
01:48:54,749 --> 01:48:55,807
Hey!

1325
01:48:56,785 --> 01:48:59,276
Now, I had no idea you were coming.

1326
01:49:00,322 --> 01:49:01,846
Lord, Benjamin.

1327
01:49:04,459 --> 01:49:08,327
What did you expect?
What, you want me to drop everything?

1328
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:10,398
Now, this is my life.

1329
01:49:10,499 --> 01:49:12,933
Babe! You going downtown?

1330
01:49:17,906 --> 01:49:21,000
Come on. You'll have a good time.

1331
01:49:21,877 --> 01:49:23,367
There's lots of musicians,
interesting people.

1332
01:49:23,478 --> 01:49:26,379
You don't have to do that.
This is my fault.

1333
01:49:27,482 --> 01:49:28,915
I should've called.

1334
01:49:29,017 --> 01:49:31,815
I thought I'd come here

1335
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:34,650
and sweep you off your feet
or something.

1336
01:49:36,157 --> 01:49:40,617
- Daisy! Come on! Let's go.
- Be right there.

1337
01:49:42,430 --> 01:49:43,795
Seems nice.

1338
01:49:45,166 --> 01:49:46,758
Do you love him?

1339
01:49:49,905 --> 01:49:51,270
I think so.

1340
01:49:53,408 --> 01:49:55,069
I'm happy for you.

1341
01:49:57,012 --> 01:49:59,105
Maybe I'll see you at home.

1342
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:02,842
Okay.

1343
01:50:04,886 --> 01:50:06,615
I enjoyed the show!

1344
01:50:14,262 --> 01:50:18,756
He came to tell me his father had died.

1345
01:50:20,268 --> 01:50:26,434
- You couldn't have known.
- I was 23. I... I just didn't care.

1346
01:50:29,010 --> 01:50:30,375
What did you do next?

1347
01:50:30,478 --> 01:50:37,407
Some photographs, I think,
in the front of my bag.

1348
01:50:39,521 --> 01:50:43,617
I was as good a dancer
as I was ever gonna be.

1349
01:50:45,527 --> 01:50:47,461
For five years, I...

1350
01:50:50,231 --> 01:50:51,994
I danced everywhere.

1351
01:50:53,468 --> 01:50:56,960
London, Vienna, Prague.

1352
01:50:57,572 --> 01:50:59,437
I've never seen these.

1353
01:51:02,777 --> 01:51:03,835
Mom.

1354
01:51:05,146 --> 01:51:07,842
You never talked about your dancing.

1355
01:51:07,949 --> 01:51:09,940
Well, I was the only American

1356
01:51:10,051 --> 01:51:14,988
to be invited to dance
with the Bolshoi, sugar.

1357
01:51:16,858 --> 01:51:18,849
<i>It was glorious.</i>

1358
01:51:23,331 --> 01:51:27,028
<i>But Benjamin was never far
from my thoughts.</i>

1359
01:51:30,205 --> 01:51:33,766
<i>And I'd find myself saying...</i>

1360
01:51:33,875 --> 01:51:35,672
Good night, Benjamin.

1361
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:41,308
- "Good night, Daisy. "
- He said that?

1362
01:51:43,485 --> 01:51:44,645
"Life wasn't all that complicated.

1363
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:48,284
<i>"If you want, you might say
I was looking for something. "</i>

1364
01:51:57,766 --> 01:52:00,735
Benjamin?
Mrs. La Tourneau just passed.

1365
01:52:07,142 --> 01:52:10,805
- Letter for Mr. Benjamin Button?
- That'd be me.

1366
01:52:13,715 --> 01:52:15,046
Thank you.

1367
01:52:41,376 --> 01:52:43,276
Miss Daisy Fuller.

1368
01:52:43,378 --> 01:52:46,176
- Just a minute. Please have a seat.
- Sure.

1369
01:52:53,655 --> 01:52:58,058
<i>Sometimes we're on a collision course
and we just don't know it.</i>

1370
01:52:58,626 --> 01:53:03,120
<i>Whether it's by accident or by design,
there's not a thing we can do about it.</i>

1371
01:53:05,967 --> 01:53:09,027
<i>A woman in Paris was on her way
to go shopping.</i>

1372
01:53:10,371 --> 01:53:14,137
<i>But she had forgotten her coat,
went back to get it.</i>

1373
01:53:14,242 --> 01:53:16,403
<i>When she had gotten her coat,
the phone had rung.</i>

1374
01:53:16,511 --> 01:53:19,503
<i>So she had stopped to answer it
and talked for a couple of minutes.</i>

1375
01:53:21,015 --> 01:53:22,812
<i>While the woman was on the phone,</i>

1376
01:53:22,917 --> 01:53:27,081
<i>Daisy was rehearsing for a performance
at the Paris Opera House.</i>

1377
01:53:27,188 --> 01:53:29,952
<i>And while she was rehearsing,
the woman, off the phone now,</i>

1378
01:53:30,058 --> 01:53:32,356
<i>had gone outside to get a taxi.</i>

1379
01:53:36,898 --> 01:53:39,196
<i>Now, a taxi driver had
dropped off a fare earlier,</i>

1380
01:53:39,300 --> 01:53:41,996
<i>and had stopped to get a cup of coffee.</i>

1381
01:53:42,904 --> 01:53:45,634
<i>And all the while, Daisy was rehearsing.</i>

1382
01:53:49,177 --> 01:53:51,675
<i>And this cab driver,
who dropped off the earlier fare</i>

1383
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:53,748
<i>and had stopped
to get the cup of coffee,</i>

1384
01:53:53,848 --> 01:53:55,543
<i>he picked up the lady
who was going shopping</i>

1385
01:53:55,650 --> 01:53:58,346
<i>and had missed getting the earlier cab.</i>

1386
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:01,720
<i>The taxi had to stop
for a man crossing the street,</i>

1387
01:54:01,823 --> 01:54:04,621
<i>who had left for work five minutes later
than he normally did</i>

1388
01:54:04,726 --> 01:54:07,217
<i>because he forgot to set his alarm.</i>

1389
01:54:08,029 --> 01:54:11,294
<i>While that man, late for work,
was crossing the street,</i>

1390
01:54:11,399 --> 01:54:14,835
<i>Daisy had finished rehearsing
and was taking a shower.</i>

1391
01:54:15,370 --> 01:54:16,667
<i>And while Daisy was showering,</i>

1392
01:54:16,771 --> 01:54:20,400
<i>the taxi was waiting outside a boutique
for the woman to pick up a package</i>

1393
01:54:20,508 --> 01:54:21,600
<i>which hadn't been wrapped yet,</i>

1394
01:54:21,709 --> 01:54:23,506
<i>because the girl
who was supposed to wrap it</i>

1395
01:54:23,611 --> 01:54:27,206
<i>had broken up with her boyfriend
the night before and forgot.</i>

1396
01:54:27,882 --> 01:54:31,079
<i>When the package was wrapped,
the woman, who was back in the cab,</i>

1397
01:54:31,186 --> 01:54:32,813
<i>was blocked by a delivery truck.</i>

1398
01:54:32,921 --> 01:54:35,651
<i>All the while,
Daisy was getting dressed.</i>

1399
01:54:37,158 --> 01:54:40,525
<i>The delivery truck pulled away,
and the taxi was able to move</i>

1400
01:54:40,628 --> 01:54:42,721
<i>while Daisy, the last to be dressed,</i>

1401
01:54:42,831 --> 01:54:46,358
<i>waited for one of her friends
who had broken a shoelace.</i>

1402
01:54:46,801 --> 01:54:49,736
<i>While the taxi was stopped,
waiting for a traffic light,</i>

1403
01:54:49,838 --> 01:54:53,740
<i>Daisy and her friend
came out the back of the theater.</i>

1404
01:54:53,842 --> 01:54:57,209
<i>And if only one thing
had happened differently,</i>

1405
01:54:57,312 --> 01:54:59,405
<i>if that shoelace hadn't broken</i>

1406
01:54:59,514 --> 01:55:02,005
<i>or that delivery truck
had moved moments earlier</i>

1407
01:55:02,116 --> 01:55:03,981
<i>or that package
had been wrapped and ready</i>

1408
01:55:04,085 --> 01:55:06,815
<i>because the girl hadn't broken up
with her boyfriend,</i>

1409
01:55:06,921 --> 01:55:10,584
<i>or that man had set his alarm
and got up five minutes earlier</i>

1410
01:55:10,692 --> 01:55:13,855
<i>or that taxi driver hadn't stopped
for a cup of coffee</i>

1411
01:55:13,962 --> 01:55:17,955
<i>or that woman had remembered
her coat and got into an earlier cab,</i>

1412
01:55:18,533 --> 01:55:21,195
<i>Daisy and her friend
would have crossed the street</i>

1413
01:55:21,302 --> 01:55:23,736
<i>and the taxi would have driven by.</i>

1414
01:55:34,816 --> 01:55:36,545
<i>But, life being what it is,</i>

1415
01:55:36,651 --> 01:55:39,643
<i>a series of intersecting lives
and incidents</i>

1416
01:55:39,754 --> 01:55:41,517
<i>out of anyone's control,</i>

1417
01:55:42,390 --> 01:55:45,086
<i>that taxi did not go by,</i>

1418
01:55:45,193 --> 01:55:48,026
<i>and that driver was
momentarily distracted.</i>

1419
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:49,997
<i>Daisy!</i>

1420
01:55:50,231 --> 01:55:51,459
<i>And that taxi hit Daisy.</i>

1421
01:55:51,566 --> 01:55:53,261
Daisy! Help!

1422
01:55:56,437 --> 01:55:58,405
<i>And her leg was crushed.</i>

1423
01:56:05,813 --> 01:56:06,973
Daisy?

1424
01:56:11,286 --> 01:56:13,811
- Who told you?
- Your friend wired me.

1425
01:56:14,889 --> 01:56:18,950
Very kind of you to come all this way
to see that I was all right.

1426
01:56:20,528 --> 01:56:22,519
You'd do the same for me.

1427
01:56:24,465 --> 01:56:25,659
My God.

1428
01:56:27,802 --> 01:56:31,260
Look at you. You're perfect.

1429
01:56:34,108 --> 01:56:38,602
I wish you hadn't come here.
I don't want you to see me like this.

1430
01:56:45,053 --> 01:56:47,351
<i>Her leg had been broken in five places.</i>

1431
01:56:47,455 --> 01:56:50,549
<i>And with therapy and time,
she might walk again.</i>

1432
01:56:52,126 --> 01:56:53,991
<i>But she'd never dance.</i>

1433
01:56:55,630 --> 01:56:58,064
I'm gonna take you home with me.

1434
01:56:58,166 --> 01:57:00,930
- I want to look after you.
- I'm not going back to New Orleans.

1435
01:57:01,035 --> 01:57:03,196
Then I'll stay here in Paris.

1436
01:57:03,838 --> 01:57:06,773
Don't you understand?
I don't want your help.

1437
01:57:07,875 --> 01:57:12,209
I know I'm feeling sorry for myself,
but I don't want to be with you.

1438
01:57:12,313 --> 01:57:16,044
Tried to tell you that in New York.
You don't listen.

1439
01:57:17,585 --> 01:57:19,553
You might change your mind.

1440
01:57:19,654 --> 01:57:22,589
We are not little children
anymore, Benjamin.

1441
01:57:24,625 --> 01:57:27,856
Just stay out of my life.

1442
01:57:50,718 --> 01:57:53,949
<i>I was awfully cruel.</i>

1443
01:57:55,056 --> 01:58:00,460
He didn't understand.
I couldn't have him see me like that.

1444
01:58:03,164 --> 01:58:04,529
"I didn't leave right away.

1445
01:58:07,168 --> 01:58:10,467
<i>"I stayed in Paris for a while
to look out for her. "</i>

1446
01:58:14,075 --> 01:58:15,906
I never knew that.

1447
01:58:19,313 --> 01:58:23,374
Oh, darling, could you get the nurse?

1448
01:58:27,088 --> 01:58:32,151
I taught myself to walk again.

1449
01:58:35,229 --> 01:58:37,754
I took the train to Lourdes.

1450
01:58:39,133 --> 01:58:44,696
Let's take a look. That's normal.
Pulse rate is slowing.

1451
01:58:44,806 --> 01:58:46,797
She is gonna struggle to breathe.

1452
01:58:46,908 --> 01:58:49,103
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

1453
01:59:02,290 --> 01:59:08,195
All right, he says, "I went back home. "
And then there's a lot of pages torn out.

1454
01:59:08,429 --> 01:59:12,126
"I listened to the sound of the house. "
I read that already.

1455
01:59:13,067 --> 01:59:14,125
He...

1456
01:59:15,103 --> 01:59:18,368
He spilt something on it,
so it's hard to read, Mom.

1457
01:59:19,507 --> 01:59:22,271
Something about sailing,
does that make sense?

1458
01:59:22,977 --> 01:59:26,378
<i>I learned to sail an old boat
of my father's from the lake house.</i>

1459
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:37,558
<i>I can't lie.</i>

1460
01:59:37,658 --> 01:59:40,456
<i>I did enjoy the company
of a woman or two.</i>

1461
01:59:48,803 --> 01:59:50,327
<i>Or maybe three.</i>

1462
02:00:26,874 --> 02:00:31,106
Don't know why you bother, Sam,
just gonna be there again tomorrow.

1463
02:00:35,483 --> 02:00:36,575
Mama.

1464
02:00:41,489 --> 02:00:43,957
<i>And in the spring of 1962,</i>

1465
02:00:47,828 --> 02:00:49,318
<i>she came back.</i>

1466
02:01:08,716 --> 02:01:12,345
- You want to know where I've been?
- No.

1467
02:01:14,355 --> 02:01:19,258
How come you didn't write or nothing?
Just disappearing like that.

1468
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,920
It was something I needed to do
for myself.

1469
02:01:22,029 --> 02:01:25,760
Yeah, well, I never took you
to be the selfish type.

1470
02:01:25,866 --> 02:01:28,300
I sure hope I'm not wrong.

1471
02:01:29,470 --> 02:01:31,529
I'm usually not wrong about people.

1472
02:01:31,639 --> 02:01:34,164
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

1473
02:01:35,142 --> 02:01:36,769
Y'all have fun.

1474
02:01:39,547 --> 02:01:43,881
- You haven't said two words.
- I don't want to ruin it.

1475
02:02:14,081 --> 02:02:16,379
- Sleep with me?
- Absolutely.

1476
02:02:54,155 --> 02:02:56,555
<i>I asked her to come away with me.</i>

1477
02:02:58,826 --> 02:03:01,886
<i>We sailed into the Gulf
along the Florida Keys.</i>

1478
02:03:43,270 --> 02:03:47,639
I am so glad we didn't find one another
when I was 26.

1479
02:03:47,742 --> 02:03:52,042
- Why do you say that?
- I was so young.

1480
02:03:52,146 --> 02:03:53,909
And you were so old.

1481
02:03:54,615 --> 02:03:57,516
It happened
when it was supposed to happen.

1482
02:03:57,618 --> 02:04:00,746
I will enjoy each and every moment
I have with you.

1483
02:04:05,926 --> 02:04:08,394
I bet I can stay out here longer than you.

1484
02:04:08,496 --> 02:04:10,088
I bet you can't.

1485
02:04:12,967 --> 02:04:15,458
Barely a line or a crease.

1486
02:04:15,903 --> 02:04:19,031
Every day I have more wrinkles.
It's not fair.

1487
02:04:20,708 --> 02:04:24,439
I love your wrinkles. Both of them.

1488
02:04:30,151 --> 02:04:32,449
What's it like growing younger?

1489
02:04:34,922 --> 02:04:39,518
I can't really say.
I'm always looking out my own eyes.

1490
02:04:44,565 --> 02:04:48,331
Will you still love me
when my skin grows old and saggy?

1491
02:04:48,436 --> 02:04:52,896
Will you still love me when I have acne?
When I wet the bed?

1492
02:04:54,241 --> 02:04:57,074
When I'm afraid
of what's under the stairs?

1493
02:05:04,552 --> 02:05:05,610
What?

1494
02:05:11,659 --> 02:05:15,618
- What are you thinking?
- Well, I was thinking how nothing lasts.

1495
02:05:18,032 --> 02:05:20,023
And what a shame that is.

1496
02:05:23,037 --> 02:05:24,664
Some things last.

1497
02:05:26,974 --> 02:05:31,172
- Good night, Daisy.
- Good night, Benjamin.

1498
02:05:47,595 --> 02:05:48,653
Mom?

1499
02:05:50,965 --> 02:05:54,958
- When did you meet Dad?
- Some time after that.

1500
02:05:58,138 --> 02:06:02,837
- Did you tell him about this Benjamin?
- He knew enough, darling.

1501
02:06:22,863 --> 02:06:23,955
Mama?

1502
02:06:31,171 --> 02:06:32,399
Queenie?

1503
02:06:35,576 --> 02:06:36,873
Hello?

1504
02:06:37,344 --> 02:06:40,939
Oh, hi, Mrs. Carter, it's Benjamin.
Where is everybody?

1505
02:06:41,048 --> 02:06:46,213
Oh, Benjamin. Queenie died.
I'm so sorry.

1506
02:07:14,915 --> 02:07:18,316
I'm so sorry for your loss.
She was a great woman.

1507
02:07:18,419 --> 02:07:20,216
Our deepest condolences.

1508
02:07:25,392 --> 02:07:28,384
<i>We buried her
beside her beloved Mr. Weathers.</i>

1509
02:07:35,402 --> 02:07:38,860
<i>And so we might have memories
of our own,</i>

1510
02:07:38,973 --> 02:07:40,907
<i>we sold my father's house
on Esplanade.</i>

1511
02:07:41,008 --> 02:07:43,602
It is a wonderful old place, darling.

1512
02:07:44,211 --> 02:07:47,146
I think we are going to be
so happy here.

1513
02:07:47,247 --> 02:07:50,114
Oh, what a long family history you have.

1514
02:07:50,217 --> 02:07:52,208
They come with the house.

1515
02:07:54,822 --> 02:07:57,723
- Come on.
- You have to see the master suite.

1516
02:07:59,259 --> 02:08:01,454
<i>We bought ourselves a duplex.</i>

1517
02:08:03,530 --> 02:08:05,555
I loved that house.

1518
02:08:08,002 --> 02:08:09,970
It smelled like firewood.

1519
02:08:11,105 --> 02:08:14,302
Don't... Don't stop, darling.

1520
02:08:14,942 --> 02:08:17,775
"It was one of the happiest times
of my life. "

1521
02:08:17,878 --> 02:08:20,403
<i>We didn't have a stick of furniture.</i>

1522
02:08:21,215 --> 02:08:23,945
<i>We would have picnics
in the living room.</i>

1523
02:08:27,454 --> 02:08:31,413
<i>We ate when we felt like it.
Stayed up all night when we wanted.</i>

1524
02:08:32,860 --> 02:08:34,828
<i>We vowed never to fall into routine,</i>

1525
02:08:34,928 --> 02:08:37,795
<i>to go to bed or wake up
at the same time.</i>

1526
02:08:37,898 --> 02:08:39,923
<i>We lived on that mattress.</i>

1527
02:09:15,669 --> 02:09:19,127
<i>Our neighbor, a Mrs. Van Dam,
was a physical therapist.</i>

1528
02:09:20,741 --> 02:09:23,471
<i>We lived four blocks from a public pool.</i>

1529
02:10:01,882 --> 02:10:04,646
You know, you might've got
a few more years out of it,

1530
02:10:04,752 --> 02:10:08,848
but you chose to do
something so special and unique

1531
02:10:10,290 --> 02:10:13,987
that there was only
a short window of time you could do it.

1532
02:10:15,829 --> 02:10:18,320
So, even if nothing ever happened,

1533
02:10:18,432 --> 02:10:21,526
you'd still be right here
where you are now.

1534
02:10:21,635 --> 02:10:23,865
I just don't like getting old.

1535
02:10:25,439 --> 02:10:27,930
They put too much chlorine in here.

1536
02:11:09,216 --> 02:11:13,084
I promise you I'll never lose myself
to self-pity again.

1537
02:11:17,457 --> 02:11:20,483
<i>And I think right there and then</i>

1538
02:11:20,594 --> 02:11:24,587
<i>she realized
none of us is perfect forever.</i>

1539
02:11:28,569 --> 02:11:30,161
<i>She found peace.</i>

1540
02:11:32,072 --> 02:11:34,973
<i>She opened a studio
and taught young girls how to dance.</i>

1541
02:11:35,075 --> 02:11:38,169
<i>And tendu.</i>

1542
02:11:38,278 --> 02:11:43,341
Come back the other way.
And spot, spot, spot. Excellent.

1543
02:11:45,052 --> 02:11:47,486
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Good night.

1544
02:12:12,980 --> 02:12:15,574
You certainly are beautiful to watch.

1545
02:12:17,417 --> 02:12:19,783
Dancing's all about the line.

1546
02:12:22,089 --> 02:12:23,954
The line of your body.

1547
02:12:25,359 --> 02:12:29,659
Sooner or later, you lose that line,
and you never get it back.

1548
02:12:35,569 --> 02:12:41,508
I figure, you were born in 1918,
49 years ago.

1549
02:12:41,608 --> 02:12:43,098
I'm 43.

1550
02:12:45,312 --> 02:12:47,837
We are almost the same age.

1551
02:12:51,151 --> 02:12:55,315
- We're meeting in the middle.
- We finally caught up with each other.

1552
02:12:56,523 --> 02:12:57,615
Wait.

1553
02:12:58,992 --> 02:13:01,620
I want to remember us
just as we are now.

1554
02:13:12,506 --> 02:13:13,973
I'm pregnant.

1555
02:13:31,692 --> 02:13:35,321
You know, I swear the nurse slipped
and said it was a boy.

1556
02:13:50,344 --> 02:13:52,312
But I think it's a girl.

1557
02:13:57,651 --> 02:14:01,212
- I know you're afraid.
- I'm not hiding it.

1558
02:14:01,321 --> 02:14:02,413
Okay.

1559
02:14:09,763 --> 02:14:10,994
- What's your worst fear?
- Baby born like me.

1560
02:14:11,094 --> 02:14:12,355
- What's your worst fear?
- Baby born like me.

1561
02:14:12,466 --> 02:14:14,866
Then I will love it all the more.

1562
02:14:16,903 --> 02:14:21,840
Okay. How can I be a father
when I'm heading in the other direction?

1563
02:14:22,509 --> 02:14:25,808
It's not fair to a child.
I don't want to be anybody's burden.

1564
02:14:25,912 --> 02:14:28,745
Sugar, we all end up in diapers.

1565
02:14:30,250 --> 02:14:32,275
I am gonna make this work.

1566
02:14:34,955 --> 02:14:37,856
I want this, and I want it with you.

1567
02:14:37,958 --> 02:14:41,359
I want you to have everything you want,
all of it.

1568
02:14:41,461 --> 02:14:44,658
I'm just not sure how to reconcile this.

1569
02:14:44,765 --> 02:14:46,824
Would you tell a blind man
he couldn't have children?

1570
02:14:46,933 --> 02:14:48,491
Here you go.

1571
02:14:48,602 --> 02:14:52,038
You'll be a father for as long as you can.

1572
02:14:52,139 --> 02:14:54,937
I know the consequences.
I've accepted that.

1573
02:14:55,042 --> 02:14:57,602
Loving you is worth everything to me.

1574
02:15:02,182 --> 02:15:03,809
I have to go pee.

1575
02:15:17,898 --> 02:15:20,128
<i>The oldest woman
to ever swim the English Channel</i>

1576
02:15:20,233 --> 02:15:21,962
<i>arrived here today in Calais...</i>

1577
02:15:22,069 --> 02:15:24,537
<i>- Keep it.
- ... having made the swim in 34 hours,</i>

1578
02:15:24,638 --> 02:15:26,833
<i>22 minutes and 14 seconds.</i>

1579
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:31,775
<i>The 68-year-old Elizabeth Abbott
arrived at 5:38 Greenwich mean time,</i>

1580
02:15:31,878 --> 02:15:33,641
<i>exhausted but happy.</i>

1581
02:15:33,747 --> 02:15:37,274
<i>Miss Abbott, how would you sum up,
in words, this achievement?</i>

1582
02:15:37,384 --> 02:15:38,942
<i>I suppose...</i>

1583
02:15:40,353 --> 02:15:42,082
<i>Anything's possible.</i>

1584
02:15:46,126 --> 02:15:47,286
<i>- All right?
- Yes. Thank you.</i>

1585
02:15:47,394 --> 02:15:48,361
<i>- You ready?
- Thank you very much.</i>

1586
02:15:48,462 --> 02:15:50,396
<i>Thank you. Thank you all.</i>

1587
02:15:50,497 --> 02:15:52,465
<i>- Yeah.
- You're very kind.</i>

1588
02:15:59,706 --> 02:16:03,574
<i>In the spring, on a day like any other...</i>

1589
02:16:04,344 --> 02:16:06,312
I'll be back in an hour!

1590
02:16:11,351 --> 02:16:12,511
Honey?

1591
02:16:14,621 --> 02:16:16,612
Go and call an ambulance!

1592
02:16:19,559 --> 02:16:21,220
The baby's coming.

1593
02:16:22,062 --> 02:16:23,086
Operator, I need an ambulance.

1594
02:16:23,196 --> 02:16:25,630
- The baby's coming!
-2714 Napoleon.

1595
02:16:32,873 --> 02:16:35,535
There you go. Keep breathing.

1596
02:16:36,476 --> 02:16:38,842
Deep breaths. Push.

1597
02:16:48,755 --> 02:16:50,154
There we go.

1598
02:17:06,573 --> 02:17:09,906
Everyone's fine.
She's a perfectly healthy baby girl.

1599
02:17:16,850 --> 02:17:18,010
Honey?

1600
02:17:19,986 --> 02:17:23,581
<i>She gave birth to a five pound,
four ounce baby girl.</i>

1601
02:17:39,806 --> 02:17:41,706
Did you count the toes?

1602
02:17:46,046 --> 02:17:47,536
She's perfect.

1603
02:17:47,981 --> 02:17:51,246
"And we named her
for my mother, Caroline. "

1604
02:17:54,988 --> 02:17:57,115
This Benjamin was my father?

1605
02:17:58,658 --> 02:18:00,785
And this is how you tell me?

1606
02:18:06,399 --> 02:18:07,730
Excuse me.

1607
02:18:18,245 --> 02:18:20,975
<i>...because all the ingredients are there
for a major storm,</i>

1608
02:18:21,081 --> 02:18:23,606
<i>possibly even up to a Category 5.</i>

1609
02:18:30,390 --> 02:18:34,053
Hey, I know it's hard.
You can't smoke in here.

1610
02:18:37,297 --> 02:18:39,629
<i>Nobody can tell you exactly
where it's gonna hit,</i>

1611
02:18:39,733 --> 02:18:41,530
<i>but we have to go with the guidance
that we have,</i>

1612
02:18:41,635 --> 02:18:45,332
<i>incorporate that information
and then pass it along to you.</i>

1613
02:18:52,212 --> 02:18:57,047
"You grew as the doctor had promised,
normal and healthy. "

1614
02:19:05,725 --> 02:19:08,819
You're gonna have to find a real father
for her.

1615
02:19:11,998 --> 02:19:13,761
What are you talking about?

1616
02:19:13,867 --> 02:19:17,132
She's gonna need someone
to grow old with.

1617
02:19:17,237 --> 02:19:20,070
She'll learn to accept
whatever happens. She loves you.

1618
02:19:20,173 --> 02:19:22,903
Honey, she needs a father,
not a playmate.

1619
02:19:27,047 --> 02:19:28,344
- Is it me?
- Of course not.

1620
02:19:28,448 --> 02:19:30,416
- Is my age beginning to bother you?
- Of course not.

1621
02:19:30,517 --> 02:19:34,510
- Is that what you're telling me?
- You can't raise the both of us.

1622
02:19:43,196 --> 02:19:48,099
<i>It was your first birthday.
We had a party for you.</i>

1623
02:19:48,868 --> 02:19:50,699
<i>The house was filled with children.</i>

1624
02:19:50,804 --> 02:19:52,738
- How are you?
- Hey, man.

1625
02:19:52,839 --> 02:19:56,468
Before you turn around,
they'll be in high school, dating.

1626
02:20:28,908 --> 02:20:32,901
<i>I sold the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain,</i>

1627
02:20:33,012 --> 02:20:35,708
<i>I sold Button's Buttons,</i>

1628
02:20:35,815 --> 02:20:40,343
<i>I sold my father's sailboat,
put it all into a savings account.</i>

1629
02:20:42,622 --> 02:20:45,819
<i>And so that you
and your mother might have a life,</i>

1630
02:20:47,060 --> 02:20:50,962
<i>I left,
before you could ever remember me.</i>

1631
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:42,773
"I left with just the clothes on my back. "

1632
02:21:44,250 --> 02:21:48,880
I don't want to read this now.
Can you just tell me where he went?

1633
02:21:50,356 --> 02:21:52,586
I don't really know.

1634
02:22:03,870 --> 02:22:08,807
It's for me. 1970. I was two.
"Happy Birthday.

1635
02:22:11,611 --> 02:22:14,444
"I wish
I could have kissed you good night. "

1636
02:22:19,552 --> 02:22:21,281
They're all for me.

1637
02:22:22,322 --> 02:22:27,282
Five. "I wish I could have taken you
to your first day of school. "

1638
02:22:31,831 --> 02:22:37,667
Six. "I wish I could have been there
to teach you to play piano. "

1639
02:22:41,140 --> 02:22:44,075
1981, 13.

1640
02:22:44,177 --> 02:22:47,476
"I wish I could have told you
not to chase some boy.

1641
02:22:48,815 --> 02:22:52,444
"I wish I could have held you
when you had a broken heart.

1642
02:22:53,953 --> 02:22:59,721
"I wish I could have been your father.
Nothing I ever did will replace that. "

1643
02:23:07,233 --> 02:23:09,758
I guess he went to India.

1644
02:23:09,869 --> 02:23:12,303
"For what it's worth, it's never too late,

1645
02:23:12,405 --> 02:23:14,202
<i>- "or, in my case, too early... "
- ... or, in my case, too early,</i>

1646
02:23:15,475 --> 02:23:17,443
<i>to be whoever you want to be.</i>

1647
02:23:21,514 --> 02:23:24,176
<i>There's no time limit.
Start whenever you want.</i>

1648
02:23:27,086 --> 02:23:31,546
<i>You can change or stay the same.
There are no rules to this thing.</i>

1649
02:23:34,127 --> 02:23:37,619
<i>We can make the best or the worst of it.</i>

1650
02:23:37,730 --> 02:23:40,028
<i>And I hope you make the best of it.</i>

1651
02:23:43,136 --> 02:23:45,832
<i>I hope you see things that startle you.</i>

1652
02:23:48,007 --> 02:23:51,499
<i>I hope you feel things
you never felt before.</i>

1653
02:23:53,980 --> 02:23:57,472
<i>I hope you meet people
with a different point of view.</i>

1654
02:23:58,651 --> 02:24:01,347
<i>I hope you live a life you're proud of.</i>

1655
02:24:04,357 --> 02:24:09,385
<i>And if you find that you're not,
I hope you have the strength</i>

1656
02:24:09,495 --> 02:24:12,692
<i>- to start all over again.
- "... start all over again. "</i>

1657
02:24:14,267 --> 02:24:17,964
He had been gone a long time.

1658
02:24:19,772 --> 02:24:21,865
I'll see you next Thursday.

1659
02:24:24,844 --> 02:24:28,211
- Good night, Miss Daisy.
- Oh, good night, sweetheart.

1660
02:24:46,065 --> 02:24:48,056
I'm sorry, we're closing.

1661
02:24:51,004 --> 02:24:52,528
Can I help you?

1662
02:24:54,140 --> 02:24:56,540
Are you here to pick somebody up?

1663
02:25:06,919 --> 02:25:08,784
Why did you come back?

1664
02:25:10,390 --> 02:25:11,652
Mom?

1665
02:25:12,725 --> 02:25:13,783
Mom?

1666
02:25:15,028 --> 02:25:16,518
You ready yet?

1667
02:25:19,532 --> 02:25:20,624
Mom, what's wrong?

1668
02:25:20,733 --> 02:25:24,294
I was just hearing a very sad story
about a mutual friend

1669
02:25:24,404 --> 02:25:27,100
who I hadn't seen for a very long time.

1670
02:25:28,374 --> 02:25:31,104
Caroline, this is Benjamin.

1671
02:25:31,210 --> 02:25:33,906
You knew him
when you were just a baby.

1672
02:25:36,382 --> 02:25:37,610
- Hi.
- Hi.

1673
02:25:39,552 --> 02:25:41,417
Hey.

1674
02:25:43,423 --> 02:25:48,258
- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were done.
- Oh, this is a friend of my family's.

1675
02:25:48,361 --> 02:25:53,298
Benjamin Button,
this is my husband, Robert.

1676
02:25:53,399 --> 02:25:55,799
- How do you do?
- A pleasure.

1677
02:26:03,943 --> 02:26:06,935
Well, it was very nice to meet you.

1678
02:26:07,046 --> 02:26:08,843
- We'll be in the car, darling.
- All right.

1679
02:26:08,948 --> 02:26:10,074
Bye.

1680
02:26:10,817 --> 02:26:12,580
I'm just locking up.

1681
02:26:17,356 --> 02:26:18,414
Wow.

1682
02:26:20,960 --> 02:26:23,827
She's beautiful. Like her mother.

1683
02:26:25,431 --> 02:26:27,899
- Does she dance?
- Not very well.

1684
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:29,900
I guess that'd be
from my side of things.

1685
02:26:30,002 --> 02:26:31,993
She's a dear, sweet girl.

1686
02:26:33,206 --> 02:26:37,540
She seems a little lost.
But then, who isn't at 12?

1687
02:26:37,744 --> 02:26:41,976
A lot of her reminds me of you.

1688
02:26:42,882 --> 02:26:46,818
My husband, he's a widower, or was...
Was a widower.

1689
02:26:47,220 --> 02:26:51,122
He's an incredibly kind, just bright,
adventurous man.

1690
02:26:54,293 --> 02:26:56,989
- He's been a terrific father.
- Good.

1691
02:27:01,701 --> 02:27:05,603
- You are so much younger.
- Only on the outside.

1692
02:27:07,707 --> 02:27:09,231
You were right.

1693
02:27:11,010 --> 02:27:14,377
I couldn't have been raising both of you.

1694
02:27:14,480 --> 02:27:16,243
I'm not that strong.

1695
02:27:20,453 --> 02:27:22,478
So, where are you staying?

1696
02:27:25,158 --> 02:27:26,147
What are you gonna do?

1697
02:27:26,259 --> 02:27:30,059
I'm staying at the Pontchartrain Hotel
on the Avenue.

1698
02:27:30,163 --> 02:27:33,690
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1699
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:34,960
But...

1700
02:27:41,474 --> 02:27:43,101
They're waiting.

1701
02:28:25,251 --> 02:28:28,516
I remember that. That was him?

1702
02:28:31,190 --> 02:28:32,350
The hurricane has changed directions.

1703
02:28:32,458 --> 02:28:34,289
It's going to make landfall
sometime soon.

1704
02:28:34,393 --> 02:28:36,122
- Am I supposed to do something?
- Arrangements are being made

1705
02:28:36,229 --> 02:28:37,457
to move people, but it's up to you.

1706
02:28:37,563 --> 02:28:39,428
No. No, we're... We're staying.

1707
02:28:39,532 --> 02:28:42,160
I'll let you know if anything changes.

1708
02:28:44,203 --> 02:28:48,537
"That night, while I was sitting
and wondering why I came back at all,

1709
02:28:48,641 --> 02:28:50,973
"there was a knock at the door. "

1710
02:28:54,614 --> 02:28:55,842
Come in.

1711
02:29:10,162 --> 02:29:11,823
Are you all right?

1712
02:29:14,934 --> 02:29:19,030
I'm sorry,
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1713
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:29,570
Nothing lasts.

1714
02:29:33,052 --> 02:29:35,384
I have never stopped loving you.

1715
02:29:41,394 --> 02:29:44,090
Oh, but, Benjamin,
I'm an old woman now.

1716
02:29:54,740 --> 02:29:56,935
Some things you never forget.

1717
02:30:17,229 --> 02:30:18,287
<i>...so few people even know</i>

1718
02:30:18,397 --> 02:30:20,092
<i>that you were ever in jail
in the first place.</i>

1719
02:30:20,199 --> 02:30:22,394
<i>I'll tell you, I am sick about it, too,</i>

1720
02:30:22,501 --> 02:30:25,061
<i>because, please,
if they're not gonna give you an award</i>

1721
02:30:25,171 --> 02:30:27,230
<i>like "Man of the Year,"
at least what they could do</i>

1722
02:30:27,340 --> 02:30:30,002
<i>is stop having you listed
as an ex-convict</i>

1723
02:30:30,109 --> 02:30:32,600
<i>which I think is, again, so unfair.</i>

1724
02:30:45,391 --> 02:30:47,188
Good night, Benjamin.

1725
02:30:48,728 --> 02:30:50,389
Good night, Daisy.

1726
02:30:53,599 --> 02:30:57,831
<i>And as I knew I would,
I watched her go.</i>

1727
02:31:00,573 --> 02:31:02,871
That's the last thing he wrote.

1728
02:31:04,043 --> 02:31:08,605
Sometime after your father passed,

1729
02:31:08,714 --> 02:31:11,547
there was a call.

1730
02:31:14,620 --> 02:31:15,780
Hello.

1731
02:31:16,889 --> 02:31:18,379
Yes, speaking.

1732
02:31:21,727 --> 02:31:24,218
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1733
02:31:34,073 --> 02:31:35,938
It's the corner house.

1734
02:31:58,130 --> 02:31:59,495
Come on in.

1735
02:32:05,104 --> 02:32:07,129
- I'm Daisy Fuller.
- I'm David Hernandez,

1736
02:32:07,239 --> 02:32:10,936
with the Orleans Parish Department
of Child Welfare Services.

1737
02:32:11,043 --> 02:32:13,671
He was living in a condemned building.

1738
02:32:15,481 --> 02:32:17,779
The police found this with him.

1739
02:32:17,883 --> 02:32:20,818
This address.
It's got your name in it a lot.

1740
02:32:22,021 --> 02:32:24,649
He's in very poor health.
He was taken to the hospital.

1741
02:32:24,757 --> 02:32:28,784
He doesn't seem to know who
or where he is. He's very confused.

1742
02:32:28,894 --> 02:32:32,455
I was telling Mr. Hernandez
that Benjamin is one of us.

1743
02:32:32,565 --> 02:32:36,399
If he needs a place to stay,
it's all right, he can stay here.

1744
02:33:05,865 --> 02:33:07,127
Benjamin?

1745
02:33:11,003 --> 02:33:12,800
You play beautifully.

1746
02:33:16,308 --> 02:33:18,139
He doesn't seem to like to be touched.

1747
02:33:18,244 --> 02:33:19,905
He goes in and out
of states of recognition.

1748
02:33:20,012 --> 02:33:21,639
The doctors say,
if they didn't know any better,

1749
02:33:21,747 --> 02:33:24,181
he has the beginnings of dementia.

1750
02:33:25,985 --> 02:33:27,714
Do you remember me?

1751
02:33:30,890 --> 02:33:32,221
I'm Daisy.

1752
02:33:34,827 --> 02:33:36,294
I'm Benjamin.

1753
02:33:42,001 --> 02:33:44,663
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

1754
02:33:46,372 --> 02:33:51,742
Would you mind if I sit with you?
I would love to hear you play.

1755
02:33:55,614 --> 02:33:57,104
Do I know you?

1756
02:34:02,087 --> 02:34:03,714
<i>- I want some breakfast.
- And every day,</i>

1757
02:34:03,822 --> 02:34:07,781
<i>I would stop by to make sure
that he was comfortable.</i>

1758
02:34:07,893 --> 02:34:10,521
- No, I didn't.
- You just finished eating.

1759
02:34:10,629 --> 02:34:12,961
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing!

1760
02:34:13,065 --> 02:34:15,795
You're all fucking liars!

1761
02:34:15,901 --> 02:34:18,826
He doesn't believe
he just had his breakfast.

1762
02:34:20,139 --> 02:34:23,768
Now, why don't we see

1763
02:34:23,876 --> 02:34:27,243
if we can't find something else
for you to do?

1764
02:34:27,413 --> 02:34:30,576
I have a feeling
there's a lot of things I can't remember.

1765
02:34:30,683 --> 02:34:32,583
Well, like what, sugar?

1766
02:34:33,852 --> 02:34:37,845
It's like there's this whole life I had,

1767
02:34:39,325 --> 02:34:41,725
and I can't remember what it was.

1768
02:34:44,530 --> 02:34:45,861
It's okay.

1769
02:34:47,967 --> 02:34:49,434
It's okay to forget things.

1770
02:34:49,668 --> 02:34:55,231
<i>Many times, he would simply forget
who or where he was.</i>

1771
02:34:55,574 --> 02:34:57,235
There he is, he's up there on the roof.

1772
02:34:57,343 --> 02:34:59,038
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

1773
02:34:59,144 --> 02:35:01,374
- Benjamin!
- I can see everything!

1774
02:35:01,480 --> 02:35:03,243
- I can see the big river!
- That's right,

1775
02:35:03,349 --> 02:35:05,078
you can see everything, sweetheart.

1776
02:35:05,184 --> 02:35:07,175
I can see the graveyard
where Mama's buried,

1777
02:35:07,286 --> 02:35:10,653
- and all those other people.
- I want you to come down!

1778
02:35:10,756 --> 02:35:14,487
- What if I could fly?
- I knew a man who could fly.

1779
02:35:15,494 --> 02:35:18,463
You come down
and I'll tell you all about him.

1780
02:35:22,034 --> 02:35:23,626
Somebody go up there.

1781
02:35:30,242 --> 02:35:33,211
<i>He was five when I moved in.</i>

1782
02:35:33,312 --> 02:35:37,772
<i>Nearly the same age I was
when I had met him.</i>

1783
02:35:43,789 --> 02:35:47,725
"This is the picture
of Old Man Kangaroo

1784
02:35:47,826 --> 02:35:50,260
"at 5:00 in the afternoon

1785
02:35:50,362 --> 02:35:53,820
"when he had got
his beautiful hind legs. "

1786
02:35:55,067 --> 02:35:56,364
<i>The days passed.</i>

1787
02:35:56,468 --> 02:36:00,700
<i>And I watched as he forgot how to walk</i>

1788
02:36:05,944 --> 02:36:08,378
<i>- and how to talk.
- What's my name?</i>

1789
02:36:08,847 --> 02:36:10,178
I'm Daisy.

1790
02:36:11,350 --> 02:36:13,113
Can you say "Daisy"?

1791
02:36:14,687 --> 02:36:19,954
<i>In 2002, they put up a new clock
in that train station.</i>

1792
02:36:26,799 --> 02:36:30,565
<i>And in the spring of 2003,</i>

1793
02:36:34,940 --> 02:36:36,601
<i>he looked at me</i>

1794
02:36:39,111 --> 02:36:44,174
<i>and I knew that he knew who I was.</i>

1795
02:36:47,720 --> 02:36:53,522
<i>And then he closed his eyes
as if to go to sleep.</i>

1796
02:37:26,091 --> 02:37:30,255
- I wish I'd known him.
- Now you do.

1797
02:37:34,767 --> 02:37:38,533
Mom, I think I should go see
what's going on.

1798
02:37:45,577 --> 02:37:47,602
Good night, Benjamin.

1799
02:38:10,002 --> 02:38:12,368
<i>We're expecting flash flooding
after the levee break.</i>

1800
02:38:12,471 --> 02:38:14,701
<i>It occurred in the Ninth Ward.</i>

1801
02:38:17,743 --> 02:38:20,576
<i>Some people are born to sit by a river.</i>

1802
02:38:22,114 --> 02:38:24,048
<i>Some get struck by lightning.</i>

1803
02:38:25,951 --> 02:38:28,044
<i>Some have an ear for music.</i>

1804
02:38:29,655 --> 02:38:31,282
<i>Some are artists.</i>

1805
02:38:32,624 --> 02:38:33,955
<i>Some swim.</i>

1806
02:38:35,394 --> 02:38:37,021
<i>Some know buttons.</i>

1807
02:38:38,831 --> 02:38:40,196
<i>Some know Shakespeare.</i>

1808
02:38:41,366 --> 02:38:43,129
<i>Some are mothers.</i>

1809
02:38:45,103 --> 02:38:48,129
<i>And some people dance.</i>
