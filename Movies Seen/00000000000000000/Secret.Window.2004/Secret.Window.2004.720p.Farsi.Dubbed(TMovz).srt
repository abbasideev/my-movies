Hey!

9
00:01:47,343 --> 00:01:48,776
Hey!

10
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,377
What the hell's going on
in here?

11
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:52,426
You stole my story.

12
00:04:54,062 --> 00:04:55,696
Well?

13
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:59,066
I'm sorry. Do I--?

14
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:00,901
- I don't believe I know you.
- I know that.

15
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:04,372
That doesn't matter. I know you,
Mr. Rainey, that's what matters.

16
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:06,540
You stole my story.

17
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:08,876
You're mistaken.
I don't read manuscripts.

18
00:05:08,878 --> 00:05:10,878
You read this one already.

19
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,480
You stole it.

20
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:13,947
I can assure you that I--

21
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:15,383
I know you can.
I know that.

22
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:17,017
I don't wanna be assured.

23
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:18,419
If you want to
talk to someone

24
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:21,622
about some grievance
you feel you may have,

25
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:23,457
you can call my literary agent
in New York.

26
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,360
This is between you and me.

27
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:31,832
We don't need any outsiders,
Mr. Rainey.

28
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:35,002
It is strictly
between you and me.

29
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:38,172
All right, look, mister,
whoever you are,

30
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:40,908
I don't like being accused
of plagiarism

31
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,077
if that is in fact what you're
accusing me of. Chico, inside.

32
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,680
I don't blame you for not
liking it,

33
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:47,515
but you did it.

34
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:49,016
You stole my story.

35
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:51,218
You're gonna have to leave.
I have nothing more to say.

36
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,219
Yeah, I'll go.

37
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:54,087
We'll talk more later.

38
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,756
I'm not taking that.

39
00:05:55,758 --> 00:05:57,124
Won't do you any good

40
00:05:57,126 --> 00:06:00,194
to play games with me,
Mr. Rainey.

41
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:01,862
This has got to be settled.

42
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:04,865
So far as I'm concerned,
it is.

43
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:25,446

00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,723
Never heard of you, pal.

46
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:40,027
Never heard of your story.

47
00:07:57,412 --> 00:07:58,979
Now,

48
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,951
where was I?

49
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:05,953
Oh.

50
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:07,154
Oh.

51
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:35,616
I'm open to suggestions.

52
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,695
If you don't go and bite her,
I'll kill her.

60
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:19,560
<i>No bad writing.</i>

61
00:09:23,632 --> 00:09:25,232
I think that solves it.

62
00:09:50,825 --> 00:09:53,928
Oh, I found one of your stories
in the trash, Mr. Rainey.

63
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,031
I thought you might want it,
so I put it on the table.

64
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,833
Yeah, I see that,
Mrs. Garvey.

I didn't know what to think.

Here, let me get this.
That's my job.

I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Garvey.
I really am.

I'll take care of this,
Mr. Rainey.

00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:49,116
Go on back to work.

81

No, it's not mine.

No.
No, I never used one.

I've never used one.

89
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,298
Oh, I can't imagine
why you would.

some made-up name.

No, no.

Mrs. Garvey,
what I'm trying to tell you

93
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:13,774
is that someone else
wrote this story.

Oh, my God, look,

I want to say.

127
00:13:58,107 --> 00:13:59,773
Oh, no.
Some women don't know

128
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,175

00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:02,709
Mm.

130
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:04,711
Some women don't know
they got the whole world

131
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,313
and it's right
in front of their nose.

132
00:14:06,315 --> 00:14:09,749
Mm-hmm.
There. That's it.

133
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:12,119
Not another word from me.

134
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:17,791

Hm.

Can I make you something
to eat?

136
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:21,728
No. I ate.

Well, earlier.

138
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:25,365
I'm gonna eat later.

139
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:26,900

You're up there all alone.

156

Anything could happen
and nobody would know.

157
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:06,566
<i>I'd know.</i>

158
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:07,734

What do you want?

163
00:16:14,276 --> 00:16:16,410
I had one of those feelings
I get.

164

166

<i>And, um,
I was making a sandwich</i>

167
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:25,385
<i>and I had this sensation
that you might not be okay.</i>

168
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:27,821
I held off as long as possible.

169
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:31,058
Um, but then I couldn't anymore,
so...here I am.

170
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,461
Well, I don't know what
to tell you except I'm fine.

171
00:16:34,463 --> 00:16:36,196
Nothing weird happened
or anything?

172
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:42,202
Do you remember "Secret Window"?

173
00:16:42,204 --> 00:16:43,603
<i>What?</i>

174
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:46,739
My story. You know,
the one where the...

The woman has the garden,

176
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,643
<i>and then the guy
has the, uh, shovel.</i>

177
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,112
Not one of my favorites.

178
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:53,347
That's good to know.

179
00:16:53,349 --> 00:16:55,449
Well, it was kind of hostile,
don't you think?

180
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:57,384
Gee, I miss
your constructive criticism.

181
00:16:57,386 --> 00:16:58,452
I really do.

182
00:16:58,454 --> 00:16:59,919
What about the story, Mort?

183
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:02,555
Well, I was just wondering,
do you think it's possible

184
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:05,625
that I might have been
influenced by anybody

185
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:07,394
or anything at that time?

186
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:09,562
Other than Jack Daniel's?

187
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:12,332
I know that part, Amy,
hence the question.

188
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:13,566
<i>I don't know.</i>

189
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:15,168
<i>You got kind of weird
on that one.</i>

190
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,837
<i>You'd write it mostly at night,
I think.</i>

191
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,639
What do you mean, "influenced,"
anyway?

192
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:20,840
<i>I don't know.</i>

193
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:22,442
<i>Like, by another story?</i>

194
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:23,877
Look...

195
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:24,878
Forget it.

196
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,813
Mort...

197
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:28,882
you swore the one time
was the only time.

198
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:31,251
<i>Forget it, please. Please,
just forget it. Come on.</i>

199
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,686
How's Ted?

200
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:36,390
He's fine.

201
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:38,392
I was thinking that

202
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:40,394
he and I should get together
sometime, have a drink

203
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:42,795
because, you know, we've been
to a lot of the same places.

204
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:44,297
You know what? I gotta go.

205
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:45,165
So do I.

206
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:48,768
Okay.

207
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,737
<i>Is he there?
No.</i>

208
00:17:50,739 --> 00:17:51,938
We're not together.

209
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:56,776
Wow, well...

210
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:58,078
I'd be lying if I said

211
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,414
I wasn't on the verge
of doing Snoopy dances.

212
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,182
No, Mort.

213
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:04,817
What I meant was

214
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:06,553
we're not together
at the moment.

215
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:08,455
<i>He's coming over later.</i>

216
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:12,325
<i>He hardly ever comes here.
I usually go to his house.</i>

217
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:14,994
There's a useful detail.
Thanks for that.

218
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:17,564
Don't ask, then. It was
working just fine that way.

219
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:19,999
<i>I think you should have him
over to the house more.</i>

220
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:21,401
Such a nice house,
I like it.

221
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:23,570
I mean, I love it.
That's why I bought it.

222
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:25,205
Goodbye, Mort.

223
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,041
Goodbye, Amy.

224
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:34,214
Oh, shit.

225
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:35,848
Shit. Shit. Shit.

226
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,951
<i>Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.</i>

227
00:18:56,604 --> 00:18:58,037
You read it?

228
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,473
I did.

229
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:02,576
I imagine it rang a bell,
didn't it?

230
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:05,145
Oh, it certainly did.

231
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:06,813
When did you write it?

232
00:19:06,815 --> 00:19:08,948
I thought
you'd ask that.

233
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,550
Well, sure, that's
the whole point, isn't it?

234
00:19:10,552 --> 00:19:12,152
Two writers show up
with the same story,

235
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:13,987
it's all about who wrote
the words first.

236
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:14,988
Wouldn't you say
that's true?

237
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,323
I suppose I would.

238
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:17,457
I suppose that's why

239
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:19,726
I came all the way up here
from Mississippi.

240
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,470
I wrote it
seven years ago,

241
00:19:30,472 --> 00:19:32,972
1997.

242
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:34,641
How'd you get it?

243
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:36,809
That's what
I really want to know.

244
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:38,311
How in the hell did

245
00:19:38,313 --> 00:19:40,614
a big money-scribbling asshole
like you

246
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:43,416
get down to a little
shitsplat town in Mississippi

247
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:46,253
and steal my goddamn story?

248
00:19:46,255 --> 00:19:48,155
Drop it.
Drop it?

249
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:52,359
Drop it. What in the hell
do you mean, drop it?

250
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:54,394
You said you wrote
your story in 1997.

251
00:19:54,396 --> 00:19:56,563
I wrote mine
in late '94.

252
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:58,064
It was published
for the first time

253
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:00,267
in June 1995
in a magazine.

254
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:01,368
Nice try,
Mr. Shooter,

255
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,270
but I beat you
by two years.

256
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:05,705
So if anybody's got a bitch
about plagiarism, it's me.

257
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:07,940
You lie!

258
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,509
No, I don't!

259
00:20:09,511 --> 00:20:10,677
Prove it!

260
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,679
I don't have to prove a thing
to you.

261
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:14,147
Go look for yourself.

262
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:17,551
<i>Ellery Queen's
Mystery Magazine, June 1995.</i>

263
00:20:17,553 --> 00:20:19,786
And how am I supposed
to find that?

264
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:20,787
That's not my problem.

265
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:22,389
Am I supposed to drive

266
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:24,991
down to your house
in Riverdale, New York,

267
00:20:24,993 --> 00:20:27,794
and ask your wife, Amy,
for it?

268
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:30,697
I read it on your book jacket.

269
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:33,800
That's not my house.
That's hers.

270
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:35,235
What the hell does that mean?

271
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:37,036
What do you think it means,
you ignorant hick?

272
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:38,938
I'm in the middle of a divorce.

273
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,808
D-I-V-O-R-C-E.

274
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,909
Divorce.

275
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:46,145
You strike me as the kind of guy

276
00:20:46,147 --> 00:20:50,817
who's on the lookout for a head
he can knock off with a shovel.

277
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:52,985
But what
you don't understand is,

278
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:54,854
if we do start to fight...

279
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,425
it's not gonna end

280
00:20:58,427 --> 00:21:01,194
until one or the other of us
is dead.

281
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:09,302
Hold your water,
I'm just getting my smokes.

282
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:12,004
I don't smoke.

283
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:13,773
I'll give you three days.

284
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:15,842
You call your ex
and get her to send you

285
00:21:15,844 --> 00:21:17,611
the magazine
with your story in it,

286
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:20,046
if there is such a magazine,

287
00:21:20,048 --> 00:21:21,548
and I'll be back.

288
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,551
If I show it to you, will you go
back to wherever you came from

289
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:25,918
and leave me alone?

290
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,357
Three days.

291
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:33,260
Always a pleasure
to meet a reader.

292
00:21:53,548 --> 00:21:55,915
I don't want to call her.

293
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:58,685
I want to go to sleep.
I want to take a nap.

294
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,353
Huh?

295
00:22:00,355 --> 00:22:01,888
Okay. No nap.

296
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,825
I give her a call
about the magazine,

297
00:22:05,827 --> 00:22:09,262
I go write some crap
for a couple of hours

298
00:22:09,264 --> 00:22:11,898
and then I get to take a nap.
Right?

299
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:14,200
Chico?

300
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,771
♪ Chico

301
00:22:17,773 --> 00:22:20,473
♪ Don't be discouraged ♪

302
00:22:20,475 --> 00:22:23,276
All right, go ahead and be
discouraged, you blind bastard.

303
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:24,210
See if I care.

304
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:29,582
And returned to the couch...

305
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,853
in shame...

306
00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:35,755
degradation...

307
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:44,831
and sloth.

308
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,232
Sloth.

309
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:08,808
Shooter!

310
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:16,349
I'll get you for this!

311
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,118
You hear me?

312
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,521
I'll get you for this!

313
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,319
Chico? He killed Chico?

314
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:56,489
Yeah. Last night around 9.
I was asleep.

315
00:25:56,491 --> 00:25:58,992
He left this.

316
00:25:58,994 --> 00:26:02,161
"You have three days.
Am not joking. No police."

317
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:06,232
Anytime somebody sits down
and writes "No police,"

318
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:07,901
that's just about
exactly the time

319
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:10,369
<i>that a fella should get himself
over to the police.</i>

320
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:12,906
Yeah. Yeah, well,
that's what I figured.

321
00:26:12,908 --> 00:26:15,307
So, what I've got is
a detailed description of him.

322
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:16,943
I've got a detailed description
of his car.

323
00:26:16,945 --> 00:26:18,044
Type a little harder.

324
00:26:18,046 --> 00:26:20,413
You have to get
through the carbon.

325
00:26:20,415 --> 00:26:22,481
You know what? I didn't get
the license plate number

326
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:24,417
but I'm sure that it had
Mississippi tags.

327
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,753
And I think
that it started with an A.

328
00:26:26,755 --> 00:26:28,588
At least, that's what I see
in my mind.

329
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,256
Needlepoint.
Can you believe it?

330
00:26:30,258 --> 00:26:32,625
Doc says it's good
for the arthritis.

331
00:26:32,627 --> 00:26:34,594
Yeah.

332
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:36,863
Anyway, anything you can
find out about this guy,

333
00:26:36,865 --> 00:26:37,864
I'd really appreciate it.

334
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:39,999
I must cut
quite an intimidating

335
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,434
law-enforcement figure, huh?

336
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:44,871
I-- I'd like to know
what I'm dealing with here,

337
00:26:44,873 --> 00:26:47,974
because maybe he's got a--
A violent history.

338
00:26:47,976 --> 00:26:50,009
I mean, maybe you can find him,
talk to him.

339
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:51,410
I think that would probably
be better.

340
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:54,047
So you got yourself a member
of the crazy folks tribe?

341
00:26:55,683 --> 00:26:58,350
Yeah. I mean, they pop up
every once in a while.

342
00:26:58,352 --> 00:27:00,820
I suppose it's just the price
of selling a few books.

343
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,957
Sorry.

344
00:27:05,793 --> 00:27:08,527
Here's the, uh--
Here's that description.

345
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:11,864
Killing an animal
isn't like killing a man.

346
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:14,133
I'm not even sure that
it's a crime, come to think.

347
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:16,502
Come on, it's gotta be.
What about animal cruelty?

348
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:18,771
What about destruction
of private property?

349
00:27:18,773 --> 00:27:21,507
What about--?
Yeah, yeah. Maybe.

350
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:23,743
Okay.

351
00:27:23,745 --> 00:27:26,813
First thing I'm gonna need
is a description.

352
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:31,584
Tell me the truth.
Did you steal it?

353
00:27:31,586 --> 00:27:33,285
What? No!

354
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:36,388
Kind of an amazing coincidence,
don't you think?

355
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,290
The stories being so much alike?

356
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,093
Well, obviously the guy
copied it from me.

357
00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:42,095
Would you like to choose a side
before we continue?

358
00:27:42,097 --> 00:27:44,931
I'm on your side. But I still
need to know the truth.

359
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:46,933
Which kind of situation is this?

360
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:49,268
Is he a regular wacko
like you've had before,

361
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,004
in which case I can help,

362
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:53,640
or is this something you should
be talking to your lawyer about?

363
00:27:53,642 --> 00:27:56,342
No. This guy is just simply
out of his mind.

364
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:57,677
That's all it is.

365
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,979
Fine. Okay.

366
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:01,781
What do you want me to do?

367
00:28:01,783 --> 00:28:05,518
I want you to help me
in the same way that...

368
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,089
In the same way
that you did before.

369
00:28:10,091 --> 00:28:11,958
He wasn't this crazy.

370
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,093
That guy was just
an obsessed reader

371
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:15,494
who couldn't tell real life

372
00:28:15,496 --> 00:28:17,429
from the crap
you make up for a living.

373
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:19,132
No offense.

374
00:28:19,134 --> 00:28:22,601
Now, this Shooter guy,
he threaten your life?

375
00:28:22,603 --> 00:28:24,671
He put a screwdriver
through my dog.

376
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:25,972
Well, he did break a law,

377
00:28:25,974 --> 00:28:27,974
but it doesn't seem to be
a very important law

378
00:28:27,976 --> 00:28:29,175
in Tashmore Lake.

379
00:28:29,177 --> 00:28:30,643
The sheriff...

380
00:28:30,645 --> 00:28:31,944
must be a cat person.

381
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:33,746
Yeah, well,
I don't exactly feel safe

382
00:28:33,748 --> 00:28:37,550
with a 70-year-old arthritic
sheriff watching my back.

383
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:39,585
Are you gonna help me or not?

384
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:41,387
Uh, let's see.

385
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:43,089
I got a...

386
00:28:43,091 --> 00:28:45,692
corporate loyalty thing
I got to be back for on Friday,

387
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:48,194
but I can give you
a couple of days.

388
00:28:48,196 --> 00:28:49,696
Okay.

389
00:28:49,698 --> 00:28:52,065
My story came out
a couple years...

390
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,769
before he says he wrote his.

391
00:28:56,771 --> 00:28:59,172
So I've got a copy of
the original up at Amy's house.

392
00:28:59,174 --> 00:29:00,372
I was just gonna stop by

393
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:01,974
on my way upstate
and pick it up.

394
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:04,443
Amy's house?
Yeah.

395
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:06,579
Amy and I split up
about six months ago.

396
00:29:06,581 --> 00:29:08,414
I'm sorry.

397
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:09,849
Yeah, me too.

398
00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:11,684
Amicable?
Not remotely.

399
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:13,686
What happened? Did you finally
nail one of your groupies

400
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:15,421
at a book signing?

401
00:29:15,423 --> 00:29:17,556
The Omaha Barnes and Noble?

402
00:29:22,863 --> 00:29:26,265
That was a dick thing to say,
you know? Rotten profession.

403
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:28,968
I apologize.

404
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,371
You were saying?
I was saying...

405
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:35,674
that if it's just proof
that this guy, Shooter, wants...

406
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:36,876
Fine.
I show him the magazine.

407
00:29:36,878 --> 00:29:38,677
But I think maybe
you should be with me

408
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:39,879
when I show it to him.

409
00:29:39,881 --> 00:29:41,680
No shit,
I'm gonna be with you.

410
00:29:41,682 --> 00:29:43,415
You remember my rate?
Yeah.

411
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:45,084
An obscene fortune, right?

412
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:46,719
Look, you'll see
a black Cadillac

413
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,354
in the driveway tonight
when you get home.

414
00:29:48,356 --> 00:29:50,890
Don't freak out, it's me
keeping an eye on things.

415
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:52,458
Okay.

416
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,394
Get a good night's sleep.
You don't look too hot.

417
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:38,905
<i>This is not my beautiful house.</i>

418
00:30:38,907 --> 00:30:41,841
<i>This is not my beautiful wife.</i>

419
00:30:41,843 --> 00:30:46,445
<i>Anymore.</i>

420
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:54,313
Oh!

421
00:31:58,652 --> 00:32:02,355
You scared the shit out of me.
Hey. Hey, I'm sorry about that.

422
00:32:02,357 --> 00:32:04,991
This last week must have
finally caught up with me.

423
00:32:04,993 --> 00:32:07,659
That's very reassuring. Thanks.
Hey, relax, Hemingway.

424
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:09,929
I was only out 10 minutes,
swear to God.

425
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:12,431
Already checked the place.
Everything is fine.

426
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:14,800
Just waiting for you to get back
to let you know.

427
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:19,939
You think you'll be
sticking around tonight, or...?

428
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:21,407
No.

429
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:22,875
Not unless you want me to.

430
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:27,280
No. No.

431
00:32:27,282 --> 00:32:29,882
No, I'm sure
it's fine in...

432
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:31,183
In there.

433
00:32:32,386 --> 00:32:33,419
Nope.

434
00:32:34,555 --> 00:32:36,255
No monsters up here.

435
00:32:36,257 --> 00:32:37,890
You check under my bed?

436
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:39,558
Even in your toy chest.

437
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,029
I'll be back in the morning.
Start asking around town.

438
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:45,231
What the hell you gonna
do with that, sailor?

439
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:47,967
Find out who else
saw your nut-job.

440
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:49,735
Tom Greenleaf.
Huh?

441
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:53,005
Tom Greenleaf passed by

442
00:32:53,007 --> 00:32:54,873
when I was talking to Shooter
on Lake Drive.

443
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,676
He waved at us, so he must have
gotten a good look at him.

444
00:32:57,678 --> 00:33:00,546
Hmm. Tom Greenleaf.
How do I get ahold of him?

445
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:02,915
Bowie's store,
breakfast every morning, 9 a.m.

446
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:05,251
Okay, I got it.
Don't worry.

447
00:33:05,253 --> 00:33:08,254
Once I find out where
this Shooter's staying

448
00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:10,356
I'll stop in for
a little freak-me-out chat.

449
00:33:10,358 --> 00:33:12,658
Use the word "we" a lot.

450
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,227
"We know what you're doing.
We want it to stop.

451
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:17,496
We're watching you."
Yeah.

452
00:33:17,498 --> 00:33:19,731
Trust me,
he'll hit the road so hard,

453
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:21,233
it'll hit back.

454
00:33:21,235 --> 00:33:22,201
Yeah.

455
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:25,537
Hey. You know what? Um...

456
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:26,905
Are you staying
in town tonight?

457
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:29,075
Yeah, some motel
out by Route 9.

458
00:33:29,077 --> 00:33:31,410
Uh, Irv's Lakesider,
I think it's called.

459
00:33:31,412 --> 00:33:32,278
You know the place?

460
00:33:34,982 --> 00:33:36,582
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know the place.

461
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:38,351
Okay. Good night.

462
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:14,720
Hello?

463
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:25,197
Shit.

464
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:05,531
I know you're in there,
shithead!

465
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:12,771
If you don't come out
by the time I count to five,

466
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:16,041
I'm gonna come in swinging.

467
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:23,249
One.

468
00:36:24,984 --> 00:36:26,752
Two!

469
00:36:35,895 --> 00:36:37,296
I killed a mirror.

470
00:36:44,604 --> 00:36:46,472
And my shower door.

471
00:37:44,063 --> 00:37:46,798
I don't care.
I'm just gonna smoke.

472
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,534
I'm just gonna totally smoke.

473
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:50,569
I'll finish these,
go to the store

474
00:37:50,571 --> 00:37:53,706
get a brand-new pack,
smoke the shit out of that one.

475
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:17,229
Thought you didn't smoke.

476
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:25,271
I took it up recently
for my health.

477
00:38:25,273 --> 00:38:28,206
How are you, Mr. Rainey?

478
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:31,277
Oh, I'm just peachy,
Mr. Shooter. How are you?

479
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:33,178
Well, it sounded like you
pitched a fit

480
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,013
or something in there.

481
00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:38,684
I don't think you're really
all that well.

482
00:38:38,686 --> 00:38:40,686
Stealing from another man,

483
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:44,156
that don't seem to have
ever bothered you none.

484
00:38:44,158 --> 00:38:45,824
Being caught up on, though...

485
00:38:47,627 --> 00:38:51,129
Or maybe it's just that
successful writers like you

486
00:38:51,131 --> 00:38:55,066
throw tantrums when things
don't go the way they expect.

487
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:57,135
Why didn't you get
that magazine?

488
00:38:57,137 --> 00:39:00,673
You were down there
at her house today, weren't you?

489
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:04,142
If I get this story
and I show it to you,

490
00:39:04,144 --> 00:39:06,378
will you then
kindly disappear?

491
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:11,216
There isn't any magazine with
that story in it, Mr. Rainey.

492
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:13,185
You and me, we know that.

493
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:14,920
Okay, then.

494
00:39:16,255 --> 00:39:19,591
What can we do to make you
feel better?

495
00:39:26,566 --> 00:39:29,100
I want you to fix it.

496
00:39:29,102 --> 00:39:30,836
What would you like me to fix?

497
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:32,938
My ending.

498
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,674
The one you wrecked.

499
00:39:35,676 --> 00:39:37,876
I can't decide
what's worse,

500
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:41,880
stealing my story
or ruining the ending.

501
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,682
Mine was perfect.

502
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:45,517
I don't think I even read
your whole story.

503
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:47,953
Oh, I bet you did.

504
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:52,290
"I know I can do it,
Todd Downey said,

505
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:56,995
"helping himself to another ear
of corn from the steaming bowl.

506
00:39:56,997 --> 00:39:58,697
"I'm sure that in time

507
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:03,201
her death will be a mystery
even to me."

508
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:06,304
That's how the story ends,
pilgrim.

509
00:40:06,306 --> 00:40:08,273
It's the only ending.

510
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:11,877
You're going to write it for me
and get it published.

511
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:14,413
And it's gonna have
my name on it.

512
00:40:14,415 --> 00:40:17,249
I'd be more than happy to write
your ending, Mr. Shooter.

513
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:24,122
Saw that wife of yours
coming out of the house.

514
00:40:25,558 --> 00:40:29,060
She's purty.
My wife?

515
00:40:29,062 --> 00:40:31,329
Why don't we just
leave her out of this.

516
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:35,233
Would if I could,

517
00:40:35,235 --> 00:40:36,835
but I'm starting to think

518
00:40:36,837 --> 00:40:39,037
you ain't gonna leave me
that option.

519
00:40:44,243 --> 00:40:46,912
You want to wake up from
one of your stupid naps

520
00:40:46,914 --> 00:40:49,481
and find Amy nailed
to your garbage bin?

521
00:40:49,483 --> 00:40:51,617
Or turn on the radio
some morning

522
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,585
and hear she came off
second-best

523
00:40:53,587 --> 00:40:58,924
in a match with the chain saw
you keep out in the shed?

524
00:40:58,926 --> 00:41:00,626
Do you?

525
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:04,696
You can't get away with it.

526
00:41:08,735 --> 00:41:10,302
I know what
you did

527
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,003
and I ain't quitting

528
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:14,907
until right gets put right.

529
00:42:35,855 --> 00:42:37,188
Is that you, John Wayne?

530
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,857
<i>Mort?</i>

531
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:40,759
<i>Are you there? Mort?</i>

532
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:43,395
Yes, Amy, I'm here.
Just lower your voice a little.

533
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:44,930
<i>What is it?
Where have you been?</i>

534
00:42:44,932 --> 00:42:46,765
<i>I have been trying to get ahold
of you</i>

535
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:47,933
<i>all night and this morning.</i>

536
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,334
I was asleep.

537
00:42:49,336 --> 00:42:52,303
<i>Oh, great, so you unplugged
the phone?</i>

538
00:42:52,305 --> 00:42:54,105
How may I assist you, Amy?

539
00:42:54,107 --> 00:42:56,441
<i>Oh, God, Mort.</i>

540
00:42:56,443 --> 00:42:58,410
What happened? What?

541
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:02,213
<i>Someone burned down our house.
That's what happened, okay?</i>

542
00:43:02,215 --> 00:43:05,751
<i>What?
Someone burned down our house!</i>

543
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:27,172
Bye, babe.

544
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,275
Pardon me, miss.

545
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:32,811
I noticed that you, left $100 on the dresser.
Shut up!

546
00:43:32,813 --> 00:43:35,113
Well, surely the escort service
told you that I was 3.

547
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,114
Shhh. Please.

548
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:39,618
I mean, some guys are less,
some guys are 100

549
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,019
if you like that
kind of thing.

550
00:43:41,021 --> 00:43:43,021
Some guys are even less
than that, but I'm 3.

551
00:43:43,023 --> 00:43:44,289
I happen to be 3.

552
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:46,357
There's something
on your mouth just there.

553
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:47,726
Bye.

554
00:43:59,271 --> 00:44:00,772
Mort!

555
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,047
Hi.
Hi.

556
00:44:11,383 --> 00:44:13,518
I'm really sorry
about all this, Amy.

557
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,553
So am I.

558
00:44:15,555 --> 00:44:17,455
Me too.

559
00:44:17,457 --> 00:44:18,857
Thank you, Ted.

560
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:19,992
Mr. and Mrs. Rainey?

561
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:21,292
No.
Yes.

562
00:44:21,294 --> 00:44:22,560
You the owners?

563
00:44:22,562 --> 00:44:25,797
Yes, we are.
We were the owners.

564
00:44:25,799 --> 00:44:28,734
Were the owners?
What do you mean?

565
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:30,702
You don't own it anymore?

566
00:44:30,704 --> 00:44:33,705
<i>Were Mr. and Mrs. Rainey.
Are the owners.</i>

567
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:35,907
I'm Steven Bradley,
a detective with Riverdale P.D.

568
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:37,208
How do you do?
Ted Milner.

569
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,409
This is Fire Chief Wickersham.

570
00:44:38,411 --> 00:44:39,410
Chief.
Hi.

571
00:44:39,412 --> 00:44:40,679
We won't keep you long.

572
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,914
The insurance investigator
needs to see you at 3.

573
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:44,650
You're definitely
the victims of arson.

574
00:44:44,652 --> 00:44:46,685
The fire was started
by an incendiary device

575
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:48,720
made with a champagne bottle

576
00:44:48,722 --> 00:44:50,522
and a couple of quarts
of plain old gasoline.

577
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:52,057
Oh, that really works,
then, eh?

578
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:53,825
So first question:

579
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:55,694
Enemies.
You got any?

580
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:59,397
No. No one.
No, no. Not a soul.

581
00:44:59,399 --> 00:45:02,167
Bother you if I answer
one or two of these, Ted?

582
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:04,102
It's okay. It's cool.

583
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,541
Yeah.

584
00:45:10,877 --> 00:45:12,744
I have an enemy.

585
00:45:12,746 --> 00:45:15,346
Sorry I wasn't there
to meet you this morning.

586
00:45:15,348 --> 00:45:17,348
I spent most of last night
poking around the site

587
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:20,686
with a flashlight
and a Polaroid.

588
00:45:20,688 --> 00:45:23,188
Oops. Broke one
of my own rules.

589
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,790
I don't like to call it
"the site."

590
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:26,858
It wasn't a site,
it was a house.

591
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,828
Your house, and I'm very sorry
for your loss.

592
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:32,630
Thank you very much...
Mrs. Evans.

593
00:45:32,632 --> 00:45:35,600
It still says "Mrs."
Fran is fine.

594
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:38,403
These meetings are hard.

595
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:41,239
People in your situation
are already upset,

596
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:43,541
and quite often they take
the presence of an investigator

597
00:45:43,543 --> 00:45:46,544
as an accusation that they've
torched their own property.

598
00:45:46,546 --> 00:45:48,413
And in this case,
you've certainly given us

599
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,415
a plausible suspect, who
we'll investigate aggressively

600
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,017
along with the police.

601
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:53,418
But in the meantime,

602
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,553
that's a list of
your claimed insurable property.

603
00:45:55,555 --> 00:45:57,555
You look it over,
then you'll sign an affidavit

604
00:45:57,557 --> 00:46:00,058
swearing that the listed items
still belong to you

605
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,493
and that they were still in the
house when the fire occurred.

606
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:05,130
I'm told there was a separation
of residence recently

607
00:46:05,132 --> 00:46:07,232
so that last bit might be
particularly important.

608
00:46:07,234 --> 00:46:09,601
We're going through a divorce.
It's not final yet.

609
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:12,137
Well, the settlement agreement's
all done.

610
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:13,638
Everything's been negotiated,

611
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,807
we're just waiting for it
to be signed

612
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:17,743
by, um, both parties.

613
00:46:17,745 --> 00:46:20,011
I moved out about six months ago

614
00:46:20,013 --> 00:46:21,880
and just hadn't gotten around

615
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:23,548
to hauling all the stuff out
yet, so...

616
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,550
Been down that road.

617
00:46:25,552 --> 00:46:26,918
Sucks.

618
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,255
These things just have to follow
their natural course.

619
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:32,057
Things will wrap up when

620
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:34,259
everybody's ready
for that to happen.

621
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:38,296
That's been my feeling.

622
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:40,932
In the meantime, do the best
you can with the list.

623
00:46:40,934 --> 00:46:42,333
Thanks.

624
00:46:59,718 --> 00:47:01,787
I'm sorry. Excuse me. Do you
actually intend to rubberneck?

625
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:04,055
I hardly think my concern could
be construed as rubbernecking.

626
00:47:04,057 --> 00:47:05,957
Amy, he's rubbernecking.
Okay.

627
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:07,759
I'm not gonna freak out
about this, but...

628
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:09,761
What the hell's the point?
This is our stuff.

629
00:47:09,763 --> 00:47:11,797
- It's our stuff.
- No. All right. He's right.

630
00:47:11,799 --> 00:47:13,431
Why are we here?
This is our stuff.

631
00:47:13,433 --> 00:47:14,432
He's right.
He's right, Ted.

632
00:47:14,434 --> 00:47:15,433
He is right, Mr. Milner.

633
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:16,835
The law says
you have no right

634
00:47:16,837 --> 00:47:18,636
to be looking
at the listed items at all.

635
00:47:18,638 --> 00:47:20,806
We wink at things like this
if nobody minds,

636
00:47:20,808 --> 00:47:23,141
but it looks like
Mr. Rainey does.

637
00:47:23,143 --> 00:47:24,276
Yes.

638
00:47:24,278 --> 00:47:25,710
Mr. Rainey minds a lot.

639
00:47:27,246 --> 00:47:28,446
Uh...

640
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:29,547
Would it help matters

641
00:47:29,549 --> 00:47:32,017
if I took a walk
around the block?

642
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:34,319
Yes, thanks.
Sure.

643
00:47:36,022 --> 00:47:39,024
Oh, heck, Ted, live a little.
Make it two.

644
00:47:41,427 --> 00:47:42,961
Rubbernecker.

645
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,181
Mort.

646
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:04,983
Wait, Mort.
I need to ask you something.

647
00:48:04,985 --> 00:48:07,886
What?
This guy, Shooter. His story.

648
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:10,322
I mean, is this situation
like the other time?

649
00:48:10,324 --> 00:48:11,689
Oh...
I'm sorry.

650
00:48:11,691 --> 00:48:14,326
I wouldn't bring it up,
but it did happen once before.

651
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:16,494
Look, that is the only time

652
00:48:16,496 --> 00:48:17,996
I've ever done anything
remotely like that.

653
00:48:17,998 --> 00:48:19,831
I paid the guy everything
he wanted.

654
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:21,399
Never happened before or since.

655
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:22,500
Okay.
Okay.

656
00:48:22,502 --> 00:48:23,969
Okay.

657
00:48:25,537 --> 00:48:26,404
Amy.

658
00:48:27,273 --> 00:48:28,306
What?

659
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:32,510
You and me and the lawyers
are the only people

660
00:48:32,512 --> 00:48:34,812
that know about that, right?
Right.

661
00:48:34,814 --> 00:48:37,315
Because you haven't said
anything to Ted. Certainly not.

662
00:48:37,317 --> 00:48:38,950
No.

663
00:48:38,952 --> 00:48:40,385
Have you said something
to Ted?

664
00:48:40,387 --> 00:48:41,286
Come on!

665
00:48:43,055 --> 00:48:45,090
Well, do I have timing or what?

666
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:46,724
Yes, you do.

667
00:48:46,726 --> 00:48:48,326
I'm real sorry
you had to miss that.

668
00:48:48,328 --> 00:48:49,928
I know how much
you like my things.

669
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,062
Oh, Jesus.

670
00:48:51,064 --> 00:48:52,864
You and me are gonna have
a little talk.

671
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:54,766
Be back in 10 minutes.

672
00:48:56,135 --> 00:48:58,003
I'm in trouble.

673
00:49:02,241 --> 00:49:03,975
Look, I've had about enough
of your bullshit.

674
00:49:03,977 --> 00:49:05,777
You're a dick.

675
00:49:06,578 --> 00:49:08,280
Do you feel better?

676
00:49:08,282 --> 00:49:09,747
Yes, I do.

677
00:49:09,749 --> 00:49:11,482
Yeah, look, uh,
marriages end.

678
00:49:11,484 --> 00:49:14,052
I'm sorry,
but I didn't end yours.

679
00:49:14,054 --> 00:49:16,054
All that was done by the time
I got there.

680
00:49:16,056 --> 00:49:17,188
Oh, really?

681
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:18,390
You must've thought
her wedding ring

682
00:49:18,392 --> 00:49:20,025
was a little bit strange.
Oh, man.

683
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:23,295
Listen, I apologized
to you months ago.

684
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:25,863
Now, look. I know
you don't want me in your life.

685
00:49:25,865 --> 00:49:27,665
Guess what? I don't want you
in mine either.

686
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:29,700
But until this little divorce
thing's done,

687
00:49:29,702 --> 00:49:31,236
not much we can do about it.

688
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:32,637
But I'll tell you something.

689
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,308
I will not let you upset Amy
any more than you already have.

690
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:38,810
So why don't we just wrap this
little thing up, all right?

691
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:40,211
And get out of
each other's lives--?

692
00:49:43,382 --> 00:49:47,152
Are we getting the message
I'm sending?

693
00:49:48,421 --> 00:49:49,854
Where are we from, Teddy?

694
00:49:51,657 --> 00:49:53,724
Uh, Tennessee.

695
00:49:53,726 --> 00:49:54,926
"Morty."

696
00:49:56,862 --> 00:49:59,264
I was gonna say Mississippi.

697
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:02,067
No. Long way from there.

698
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:03,801
Little place
called Shooter's Bay.

699
00:50:24,323 --> 00:50:26,057
Come on, Karsch.

700
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:29,327
Five hundred dollars a day.
Where are you when I need you?

701
00:50:56,656 --> 00:50:57,922
What--?

702
00:50:59,725 --> 00:51:01,893
What fresh hell?

703
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:02,960
Yeah?

704
00:51:02,962 --> 00:51:04,396
<i>Where you been all day?</i>

705
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:07,232
Ha, I might ask you
the same question.

706
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:10,335
<i>Relax, you're fine. I checked
the cabin an hour ago.</i>

707
00:51:10,337 --> 00:51:13,238
Yeah? Well, he showed up an hour
after you left last night.

708
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,740
<i>Oh, really?
Then he had a busy night.</i>

709
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:18,910
My office called me about
your Riverdale house. I'm sorry.

710
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:21,046
<i>Well, the worst part is
I hadn't had a chance</i>

711
00:51:21,048 --> 00:51:22,247
<i>to get the magazine out.</i>

712
00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:24,449
<i>The one with the story
he says I stole.</i>

713
00:51:24,451 --> 00:51:26,084
<i>That's gone up in smoke now.</i>

714
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,086
Do you still want to go through
with it?

715
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:29,587
Meeting him?
Showing him the magazine?

716
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:31,156
Hell, yes, man.

717
00:51:31,158 --> 00:51:32,590
I've had a shitty year.

718
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:34,825
I want it settled. Now.
Everything.

719
00:51:34,827 --> 00:51:36,428
<i>Good. Because I called
your agent</i>

720
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:37,728
<i>when I heard about
the house.</i>

721
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,265
I figured he'd have a copy
of the magazine.

722
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:43,435
He sent the original
by UPS overnight today.

723
00:51:43,437 --> 00:51:45,437
You can pick it up tomorrow
after 3.

724
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:47,305
I knew there was a reason
I hired you.

725
00:51:47,307 --> 00:51:48,673
<i>There's something else.</i>

726
00:51:48,675 --> 00:51:51,943
I caught up with
your Tom Greenleaf today.

727
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:54,779
The guy who drove past you
and Shooter on the lake road.

728
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,347
<i>Well, he's a weird one.</i>

729
00:51:56,349 --> 00:51:59,717
<i>First he says he did go down
to the Lake Drive on Tuesday</i>

730
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:01,752
<i>and he saw you like you said.</i>

731
00:52:01,754 --> 00:52:04,055
But then he gets nervous
and says:

732
00:52:04,057 --> 00:52:06,091
"No, no, no.
Come to think of it, I didn't.

733
00:52:06,093 --> 00:52:07,292
"Didn't see anybody.

734
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:09,227
Wasn't even on
Lake Drive on Tuesday."

735
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:10,861
Yeah, well...

736
00:52:10,863 --> 00:52:13,531
Tom's old.
Maybe just slipped his mind.

737
00:52:13,533 --> 00:52:14,999
Don't be naive.

738
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:17,902
He was scared shitless.
Somebody got to him.

739
00:52:17,904 --> 00:52:19,770
Come on, wait.

740
00:52:19,772 --> 00:52:23,141
Why would...Shooter care if
Tom Greenleaf knows he's here?

741
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:25,776
<i>Well, it depends.
On what?</i>

742
00:52:25,778 --> 00:52:28,079
On what he plans to do to you.

743
00:52:28,081 --> 00:52:29,880
I'm revising my opinion, Mort.

744
00:52:29,882 --> 00:52:31,816
I don't think Shooter's
just some nut.

745
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:33,985
<i>We need to consider
the possibility</i>

746
00:52:33,987 --> 00:52:36,321
<i>that he was hired to do this.</i>

747
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:38,156
<i>Somebody with a grudge
against you</i>

748
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:41,092
<i>hires a tough guy
to rattle you,</i>

749
00:52:41,094 --> 00:52:43,060
<i>scare you to death.</i>

750
00:52:43,062 --> 00:52:45,730
But he hires the wrong guy.

751
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:48,032
Things get out of control.

752
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:50,668
They go further
than they're supposed to.

753
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,504
Dead dogs,

754
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:55,140
burnt-down houses.

755
00:52:55,142 --> 00:52:56,741
Now he can't call him off.

756
00:52:59,077 --> 00:53:02,213
<i>Ted.
Who?</i>

757
00:53:02,215 --> 00:53:03,848
Ted. Amy's Ted.

758
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,817
The Ted that Amy left me for.

759
00:53:06,819 --> 00:53:08,819
Maybe that's why the guy
calls himself Shooter.

760
00:53:08,821 --> 00:53:10,288
Ted wants me to know it's him.

761
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:11,456
He's trying to intimidate me,

762
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:13,191
he's trying to...
send me a message.

763
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:14,659
Why? What does he want?

764
00:53:14,661 --> 00:53:15,660
<i>I don't know.</i>

765
00:53:15,662 --> 00:53:17,562
<i>Did you piss him off?</i>

766
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:19,297
Get the fuck out!

767
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:23,000
<i>I might have.
Okay, here's what we do.</i>

768
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:26,271
What proof do you have
that Shooter was there?

769
00:53:26,273 --> 00:53:27,905
<i>Other than the manuscript.</i>

770
00:53:27,907 --> 00:53:30,107
<i>Physical evidence,
I'm talking about.</i>

771
00:53:30,109 --> 00:53:31,543
Bruises.

772
00:53:31,545 --> 00:53:34,111
<i>I got bruises on my arms
from where he grabbed me.</i>

773
00:53:34,113 --> 00:53:36,614
All right.

774
00:53:36,616 --> 00:53:39,250
You and me are gonna go see
Greenleaf together.

775
00:53:39,252 --> 00:53:40,652
<i>All right.</i>

776
00:53:40,654 --> 00:53:43,388
Bring the manuscript.
Bring your bruises.

777
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:44,955
I'm gonna push the guy hard,

778
00:53:44,957 --> 00:53:47,024
make it impossible for him
to lie.

779
00:53:47,026 --> 00:53:49,126
If he'll tell the police
he was threatened too,

780
00:53:49,128 --> 00:53:50,027
then we've got something.

781
00:53:51,397 --> 00:53:53,130
Bowie's store, breakfast?

782
00:53:53,132 --> 00:53:54,632
9 a.m. sharp.

783
00:53:54,634 --> 00:53:56,067
<i>All right.
I'll see you there.</i>

784
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:57,702
And bring your six-gun, pilgrim.

785
00:54:09,548 --> 00:54:11,683
It is a good ending.

786
00:54:27,499 --> 00:54:29,100
Oh, shit.

787
00:55:00,482 --> 00:55:01,649
Oh, shit.

788
00:56:24,065 --> 00:56:25,600
Pall Mall.

789
00:56:26,935 --> 00:56:28,202
Cracker bastard.

790
00:56:55,897 --> 00:56:57,164
Sorry.

791
00:57:04,873 --> 00:57:06,273
Ken?

792
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,581
Tom?

793
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:42,009
Would you like a pack?

794
00:57:43,178 --> 00:57:44,178
I don't smoke.

795
00:57:48,384 --> 00:57:50,885
Did a guy come in here
looking for me around 9:00?

796
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:51,952
No.

797
00:57:51,954 --> 00:57:54,422
Big guy, kind of
a New York-cop type.

798
00:57:54,424 --> 00:57:56,624
No.
No, that doesn't ring a bell.

799
00:57:56,626 --> 00:57:58,058
I overslept.

800
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,961
Well, maybe he did too,
because he wasn't here.

801
00:58:03,231 --> 00:58:04,399
Yeah.

802
00:58:49,745 --> 00:58:50,845
What are you doing here?

803
00:58:50,847 --> 00:58:51,979
Matter of fact,
I was--

804
00:58:51,981 --> 00:58:54,715
I was just on my way
over to your place.

805
00:58:55,584 --> 00:58:56,484
Where's your buddy?

806
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,920
Came alone.

807
00:58:58,922 --> 00:59:00,387
Sure you did.

808
00:59:10,298 --> 00:59:11,365
I know what you're up to.

809
00:59:13,969 --> 00:59:15,369
Uh...

810
00:59:16,137 --> 00:59:18,840
Look, Mort, uh...

811
00:59:18,842 --> 00:59:22,343
A lot of what's going on
right now is my fault.

812
00:59:22,345 --> 00:59:24,211
Most of it, in fact.

813
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:26,313
What do you want?

814
00:59:29,117 --> 00:59:30,585
I want you
out of our life.

815
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,522
Gotta sign
your papers, Mort.

816
00:59:37,926 --> 00:59:39,360
My divorce papers?
Mm-hmm.

817
00:59:39,362 --> 00:59:40,962
Tell her to send them
to my lawyer.

818
00:59:40,964 --> 00:59:42,329
Yeah, well, she did.

819
00:59:42,331 --> 00:59:44,331
And he said you won't
return his calls for weeks.

820
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:45,533
That's what this
is all about?

821
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,734
Getting me to sign
this settlement?

822
00:59:46,736 --> 00:59:47,802
No. Just calm down.
Money!

823
00:59:47,804 --> 00:59:49,003
It's not money.
It's all money.

824
00:59:49,005 --> 00:59:50,404
What this
is about...

825
00:59:50,406 --> 00:59:51,873
is getting
this thing done.

826
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:53,073
Because I'm afraid
if we don't,

827
00:59:53,075 --> 00:59:54,341
who knows
where it might go.

828
00:59:54,343 --> 00:59:56,143
And I think you know
what I'm talking about.

829
00:59:56,145 --> 00:59:58,913
Well, Teddy, I think I do,
but here's the problem:

830
00:59:58,915 --> 01:00:00,882
I don't respond well
to intimidation.

831
01:00:00,884 --> 01:00:02,550
Makes me feel icky.
You know?

832
01:00:03,418 --> 01:00:04,986
Oh.

833
01:00:04,988 --> 01:00:08,255
You know, I'm attempting to have
a normal conversation here.

834
01:00:08,257 --> 01:00:09,891
I buried my dog, mister.

835
01:00:12,127 --> 01:00:13,928
This whole thing is
out of your control now.

836
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,496
You know it,
and I know it.

837
01:00:15,498 --> 01:00:17,832
You started this shit,
I'm gonna finish it.

838
01:00:18,901 --> 01:00:20,234
Now, do me a favor.

839
01:00:20,236 --> 01:00:22,703
Go back and tell that
to your filthy little friend.

840
01:00:25,074 --> 01:00:27,107
God!

841
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:28,910
Bummer, Ted.

842
01:01:06,815 --> 01:01:08,115
Yeah?

843
01:01:08,117 --> 01:01:10,250
<i>Go to where
we met the other day.</i>

844
01:01:10,252 --> 01:01:12,086
<i>Walk down the path
a little way.</i>

845
01:01:12,088 --> 01:01:13,387
Why?

846
01:01:13,389 --> 01:01:15,522
<i>I'll catch up with you
this afternoon.</i>

847
01:01:15,524 --> 01:01:17,625
<i>Anybody you call
between now and then</i>

848
01:01:17,627 --> 01:01:19,093
<i>is your responsibility.</i>

849
01:02:07,075 --> 01:02:08,442
Tom?

850
01:02:14,449 --> 01:02:16,017
Greenleaf?

851
01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:01,896
Quarter past 2.

852
01:03:03,065 --> 01:03:06,100
You been out about three hours.

853
01:03:06,102 --> 01:03:09,904
Your leg's sleeping.
You laid on the damn thing.

854
01:03:09,906 --> 01:03:13,240
Now, I would've moved you,
but I didn't wanna wake you.

855
01:03:13,242 --> 01:03:15,009
Got tired of waiting.

856
01:03:15,011 --> 01:03:18,212
Almost pinned a note on you.
Decided not to.

857
01:03:18,214 --> 01:03:20,480
You scare too easy.

858
01:03:20,482 --> 01:03:22,950
I wouldn't go too far
if I were you.

859
01:03:22,952 --> 01:03:26,386
I hooked you to those two men
in more ways than you know.

860
01:03:26,388 --> 01:03:28,355
You're insane.
I'm going to the police.

861
01:03:28,357 --> 01:03:32,326
Whose screwdriver you think
is in that fella's head?

862
01:03:34,629 --> 01:03:36,931
If you leave them here
and I disappear,

863
01:03:36,933 --> 01:03:38,065
you gonna find yourself

864
01:03:38,067 --> 01:03:39,900
standing with your head
in the noose

865
01:03:39,902 --> 01:03:42,569
and your feet
in Crisco.

866
01:03:42,571 --> 01:03:44,371
What do you want from me?

867
01:03:44,373 --> 01:03:47,108
Why, I told you that already,
Mr. Rainey.

868
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:51,078
I want you to fix my story.
The one you stole.

869
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,413
Or ain't you ready
to admit it yet?

870
01:03:53,415 --> 01:03:56,784
I did not steal your story.

871
01:03:56,786 --> 01:03:58,886
Oh, I expect
you'll let yourself...

872
01:03:58,888 --> 01:04:00,821
go to Greenhaven
for murder

873
01:04:00,823 --> 01:04:02,823
before you'll admit it.

874
01:04:02,825 --> 01:04:04,925
I have the magazine,
you lunatic!

875
01:04:04,927 --> 01:04:06,660
I have the magazine!

876
01:04:06,662 --> 01:04:10,064
I have
the goddamn magazine!

877
01:04:10,066 --> 01:04:11,065
You have this

878
01:04:11,067 --> 01:04:13,567
so-called magazine
right now?

879
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:16,036
On me, no.

880
01:04:16,038 --> 01:04:18,438
I was gonna go
pick it up at 3:00.

881
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,275
There can't be any magazine.

882
01:04:21,277 --> 01:04:25,880
Not with that story in it.
That story is mine.

883
01:04:25,882 --> 01:04:27,481
What do you want?
You wanna kill me?

884
01:04:27,483 --> 01:04:29,283
Why don't you just do it?
Just kill me.

885
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:31,118
No, sir.

886
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,155
These others here were gonna get
in the way of our business.

887
01:04:34,157 --> 01:04:36,757
I couldn't have that.

888
01:04:36,759 --> 01:04:39,559
You bring me that story...

889
01:04:39,561 --> 01:04:41,328
if it exists.

890
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:42,930
Your house in two hours.

891
01:04:42,932 --> 01:04:44,865
You got some heavy lifting
here first.

892
01:04:44,867 --> 01:04:47,835
I'd get to it
if I were you.

893
01:04:47,837 --> 01:04:49,804
By the way,

894
01:04:49,806 --> 01:04:52,472
if you talk to that sheriff
of yours again

895
01:04:52,474 --> 01:04:55,843
or if you don't show up
at 4:00,

896
01:04:55,845 --> 01:04:58,813
I will burn your life
and every person in it

897
01:04:58,815 --> 01:05:01,748
like a cane field
in a high wind.

898
01:05:03,084 --> 01:05:04,618
And when I show you
the magazine

899
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,453
that has my name
on the contents page

900
01:05:06,455 --> 01:05:09,890
with my story inside...

901
01:05:09,892 --> 01:05:10,991
then what?

902
01:05:10,993 --> 01:05:12,893
Then I turn myself in.

903
01:05:12,895 --> 01:05:16,197
But I'd take care of myself
before a trial, Mr. Rainey.

904
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:18,498
Because if things
turn out that way,

905
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,735
then I suppose
I am crazy.

906
01:05:21,737 --> 01:05:24,038
And that kind of crazy man

907
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:27,074
has no reason
or excuse to live.

908
01:05:29,878 --> 01:05:31,611
Listen, you got my hat.

909
01:05:31,613 --> 01:05:32,713
I want it,

910
01:05:32,715 --> 01:05:34,614
one way or the other.

911
01:06:41,182 --> 01:06:43,083
Whoa!

912
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:25,159
Oh!

913
01:08:14,742 --> 01:08:15,742
Hello?

914
01:08:15,744 --> 01:08:17,644
<i>Mort?
Oh.</i>

915
01:08:17,646 --> 01:08:19,179
Yeah, hi.

916
01:08:19,181 --> 01:08:21,548
I've been so worried about you.
Are you okay?

917
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:23,583
I'm okay.
I'm okay, Amy. Wh--?

918
01:08:23,585 --> 01:08:24,951
<i>Are you sure?</i>

919
01:08:24,953 --> 01:08:27,921
When I saw you yesterday,
you seemed so strained. I mean--

920
01:08:30,425 --> 01:08:31,291
What?

921
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:34,694
<i>Do you...?</i>

922
01:08:34,696 --> 01:08:36,430
Do you think things would've
been different

923
01:08:36,432 --> 01:08:38,399
if we hadn't lost the baby?

924
01:08:38,401 --> 01:08:40,567
Oh... Jesus Christ,
I don't--

925
01:08:40,569 --> 01:08:43,103
Amy, I don't know.
Look-- Let me call you later.

926
01:08:43,105 --> 01:08:44,838
I-- I gotta go.
I gotta be somewhere.

927
01:08:47,609 --> 01:08:50,077
<i>What? What is it, Amy?</i>

928
01:08:51,879 --> 01:08:54,714
Breathe. Breathe.

929
01:08:54,716 --> 01:08:56,216
Take a breath.

930
01:08:58,119 --> 01:09:00,387
Where are you? You at Ted's?

931
01:09:00,389 --> 01:09:01,721
<i>Yeah.</i>

932
01:09:03,091 --> 01:09:05,625
How we feeling about
old Ted these days?

933
01:09:08,496 --> 01:09:10,230
I don't know.

934
01:09:11,632 --> 01:09:12,966
I love him, I guess.

935
01:09:13,868 --> 01:09:15,269
Oh.

936
01:09:16,538 --> 01:09:17,837
That's good.

937
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:19,839
<i>I didn't go with other men,
you know.</i>

938
01:09:19,841 --> 01:09:21,375
<i>I always wanted to tell you
that.</i>

939
01:09:21,377 --> 01:09:22,909
<i>I didn't go
with other men.</i>

940
01:09:22,911 --> 01:09:24,911
Only Ted,
and only the last few months

941
01:09:24,913 --> 01:09:26,613
after you and me
were already over.

942
01:09:26,615 --> 01:09:27,881
Well...

943
01:09:27,883 --> 01:09:29,883
if we were over
while we were still together,

944
01:09:29,885 --> 01:09:31,985
you might've mentioned it,
because it was news to me.

945
01:09:31,987 --> 01:09:34,588
That's because
you weren't there anymore.

946
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:36,323
You were gone all the time.

947
01:09:36,325 --> 01:09:38,058
I worked at home, Amy!

948
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:41,661
That's not what I mean.

949
01:09:41,663 --> 01:09:44,431
Even when you were with me,
you were gone, up in your head.

950
01:09:44,433 --> 01:09:47,101
<i>I don't think
that I looked in your eyes</i>

951
01:09:47,103 --> 01:09:48,802
<i>and actually saw you
looking back at me.</i>

952
01:09:48,804 --> 01:09:51,338
<i>I mean, really with me,
for the last two years.</i>

953
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:52,672
You know what, you're right.

954
01:09:52,674 --> 01:09:53,974
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

955
01:09:53,976 --> 01:09:55,709
<i>It's all my fault.
No.</i>

956
01:09:55,711 --> 01:09:57,544
I was a chickenshit.

957
01:10:00,181 --> 01:10:02,182
Ted wanted us to go
and tell you together.

958
01:10:02,184 --> 01:10:05,352
He kept asking,
and I kept putting it off.

959
01:10:05,354 --> 01:10:08,455
<i>I'll never forget that look
on your face.</i>

960
01:10:08,457 --> 01:10:09,956
Get out! Get out!

961
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:11,791
I gotta go.

962
01:10:11,793 --> 01:10:12,959
<i>Mort, wait. Can't we just--?</i>

963
01:10:12,961 --> 01:10:14,961
No! No.
I-- I've gotta go.

964
01:10:14,963 --> 01:10:16,796
Will you call me if you need me?

965
01:10:16,798 --> 01:10:17,797
<i>I doubt it.</i>

966
01:10:17,799 --> 01:10:18,932
<i>Can I come up there?</i>

967
01:10:18,934 --> 01:10:20,567
Why on earth
would you do that, Amy?

968
01:10:21,936 --> 01:10:24,804
You still haven't signed
the papers yet, Mort.

969
01:10:24,806 --> 01:10:26,406
<i>I know you don't wanna
deal with it.</i>

970
01:10:26,408 --> 01:10:27,807
<i>I don't wanna
deal with it either.</i>

971
01:10:27,809 --> 01:10:29,309
<i>Everything's been negotiated.</i>

972
01:10:29,311 --> 01:10:30,677
<i>We don't disagree on a thing.</i>

973
01:10:30,679 --> 01:10:32,312
<i>I don't understand
why you won't sign.</i>

974
01:10:32,314 --> 01:10:34,148
<i>Don't you wanna
just get it over with?</i>

975
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:36,483
Unbelievable.

976
01:10:36,485 --> 01:10:39,419
You were worried about me,
and I believed you.

977
01:10:39,421 --> 01:10:41,688
<i>What an idiot.
I am worried.</i>

978
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:43,423
You sound like you did
six months ago,

979
01:10:43,425 --> 01:10:45,992
and I think it's my fault.

980
01:10:45,994 --> 01:10:48,195
It's my fault,
and I wish I could take it back,

981
01:10:48,197 --> 01:10:49,496
but I can't.

982
01:10:49,498 --> 01:10:51,398
Well, I guess you shouldn't have
fucked him, then!

983
01:11:03,344 --> 01:11:04,944
You're not going up there?

984
01:11:04,946 --> 01:11:07,581
I am not gonna dance around
this anymore.

985
01:11:07,583 --> 01:11:09,183
Once he signs the papers,
it'll be over.

986
01:11:09,185 --> 01:11:10,984
And we won't have to have
these horrible conversations

987
01:11:10,986 --> 01:11:12,152
every other day.

988
01:11:12,154 --> 01:11:13,654
All right,
well, I'm going with you.

989
01:11:13,656 --> 01:11:14,788
I just--

990
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:17,891
I really think
I should go alone, Ted.

991
01:11:17,893 --> 01:11:19,859
Well, that makes
no sense.

992
01:11:19,861 --> 01:11:22,362
Just the sight of you
is gonna send him.

993
01:11:22,364 --> 01:11:24,164
I was married to the guy
for 10 years,

994
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:25,632
I know how to talk to him.

995
01:11:25,634 --> 01:11:28,802
All I want is for this
to be over.

996
01:11:28,804 --> 01:11:30,237
Excuse me.

997
01:11:31,272 --> 01:11:33,373
I'll be back around 7.

998
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,179
Ah!

999
01:11:48,989 --> 01:11:50,691
Hey, Mr. Rainey!

1000
01:11:50,693 --> 01:11:52,359
I'd like to--
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1001
01:11:58,165 --> 01:11:59,866
Hey. Mr. Rainey.

1002
01:12:02,837 --> 01:12:05,105
Mr. Rainey,
are you all right?

1003
01:12:05,107 --> 01:12:06,506
I'm sorry,
my throat just kind of

1004
01:12:06,508 --> 01:12:08,342
double-clutched on me
there for a second.

1005
01:12:08,344 --> 01:12:09,376
You're very pale.

1006
01:12:09,378 --> 01:12:10,844
Yeah, thank you.

1007
01:12:10,846 --> 01:12:12,479
Did the, um...

1008
01:12:12,481 --> 01:12:14,248
UPS guy drop anything off
for me?

1009
01:12:16,016 --> 01:12:17,484
Just the one thing.

1010
01:12:17,486 --> 01:12:19,085
Pardon me?

1011
01:12:19,087 --> 01:12:20,754
Just the one thing, I said.

1012
01:12:20,756 --> 01:12:22,188
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah. Thank you.

1013
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:23,257
Welcome.

1014
01:12:23,259 --> 01:12:25,091
You know...
The Post Office would have a cow

1015
01:12:25,093 --> 01:12:26,926
if they knew we handled
the UPS guy's stuff.

1016
01:12:26,928 --> 01:12:27,927
I know that,

1017
01:12:27,929 --> 01:12:29,363
and I certainly
appreciate it.

1018
01:12:29,365 --> 01:12:32,399
Thank you.
You won't tell them, will you?

1019
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:33,734
No way.
Good.

1020
01:12:35,103 --> 01:12:37,103
Because I saw
what you did.

1021
01:12:42,377 --> 01:12:43,777
I'm sorry?

1022
01:12:43,779 --> 01:12:45,245
I said, they'd shoot me
if you did.

1023
01:12:46,748 --> 01:12:49,349
You ought to go home
and lie down, Mr. Rainey.

1024
01:12:49,351 --> 01:12:51,251
You really don't
look well at all.

1025
01:12:51,253 --> 01:12:52,952
Yeah, that's...

1026
01:12:52,954 --> 01:12:54,521
That's a good idea.

1027
01:12:58,793 --> 01:13:00,294
Ooh, cute.

1028
01:13:16,645 --> 01:13:17,644
Got a minute?

1029
01:13:17,646 --> 01:13:19,078
Well... No.

1030
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,079
I really don't right now.

1031
01:13:20,081 --> 01:13:21,080
But, uh...

1032
01:13:21,082 --> 01:13:22,148
I'll give you a call later.

1033
01:13:23,785 --> 01:13:25,752
Okay. Sure.

1034
01:13:31,426 --> 01:13:33,760
I'm gonna call you
on the phone, okay?

1035
01:13:41,436 --> 01:13:42,803
Okay.

1036
01:13:49,276 --> 01:13:50,143
Ah!

1037
01:14:13,968 --> 01:14:16,002
Nineteen ninety-five.

1038
01:14:17,071 --> 01:14:18,472
Contents...

1039
01:14:20,941 --> 01:14:22,208
Eighty-three.

1040
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:23,309
Eighty-three.

1041
01:14:27,515 --> 01:14:29,516
Eighty-one.

1042
01:14:29,518 --> 01:14:31,618
Eighty-two.

1043
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:33,653
Ninety-nine.

1044
01:14:39,293 --> 01:14:41,094
Ninety-nine.

1045
01:14:42,463 --> 01:14:43,963
You cut it out.

1046
01:14:45,466 --> 01:14:47,734
You son of a bitch.

1047
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:52,672
Cut it...

1048
01:14:53,808 --> 01:14:56,777
out of the magazine.

1049
01:14:56,779 --> 01:15:00,179
<i>Wait a minute.
How would he do that?</i>

1050
01:15:00,181 --> 01:15:01,815
I don't know.

1051
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:05,419
But he did it.

1052
01:15:05,421 --> 01:15:07,086
<i>Think about it.</i>

1053
01:15:08,689 --> 01:15:09,989
<i>How?</i>

1054
01:15:11,826 --> 01:15:13,760
I don't know.

1055
01:15:57,121 --> 01:15:59,088
<i>Why'd you put it on?</i>

1056
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:01,124
I don't know.

1057
01:16:01,126 --> 01:16:03,059
<i>Maybe he wanted you to.</i>

1058
01:16:03,061 --> 01:16:05,395
Why would he want me
to put his hat on?

1059
01:16:05,397 --> 01:16:08,064
<i>Maybe he wants you to...</i>

1060
01:16:08,066 --> 01:16:09,666
Maybe he wants me
to what?

1061
01:16:10,768 --> 01:16:12,468
To get confused.

1062
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:14,704
Oh, I'm already confused,
pilgrim.

1063
01:16:14,706 --> 01:16:16,006
Plenty confused.

1064
01:16:16,008 --> 01:16:18,241
So don't talk to me
about confusion.

1065
01:16:18,243 --> 01:16:20,544
Wait a minute now.
Back up just a sec.

1066
01:16:20,546 --> 01:16:22,445
What about that?

1067
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:24,113
What about what?

1068
01:16:24,115 --> 01:16:26,983
Well, "pilgrim,"
"Shooter's Bay,"

1069
01:16:26,985 --> 01:16:28,552
and the half a dozen
other details

1070
01:16:28,554 --> 01:16:29,819
you've chosen to ignore.

1071
01:16:29,821 --> 01:16:31,421
You know what?
You're nuts.

1072
01:16:31,423 --> 01:16:34,090
I don't need to listen
to this shit from you.

1073
01:16:34,092 --> 01:16:36,292
Are all these things
coincidences?

1074
01:16:36,294 --> 01:16:38,795
I'm wearing his bruises,
aren't I?

1075
01:16:38,797 --> 01:16:40,129
Aren't I?!

1076
01:16:40,131 --> 01:16:41,264
Are you?

1077
01:16:42,366 --> 01:16:43,533
Well...

1078
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,441
This doesn't make any sense.

1079
01:16:51,443 --> 01:16:54,044
Would you like to hear something
that does make sense?

1080
01:16:54,046 --> 01:16:55,545
Call the police.

1081
01:16:55,547 --> 01:16:56,646
Call Dave Newsome,

1082
01:16:56,648 --> 01:16:58,514
tell him to get down here
right this second

1083
01:16:58,516 --> 01:16:59,515
and lock you up

1084
01:16:59,517 --> 01:17:01,785
before you can do
any more damage.

1085
01:17:01,787 --> 01:17:04,854
I'm gonna get a knife
and cut you out of me.

1086
01:17:04,856 --> 01:17:07,323
<i>Before you kill anyone else.</i>

1087
01:17:08,392 --> 01:17:10,259
I didn't kill anybody.

1088
01:17:15,933 --> 01:17:16,933
<i>You had a gun.</i>

1089
01:17:16,935 --> 01:17:18,802
<i>Wasn't loaded.</i>

1090
01:17:18,804 --> 01:17:20,737
Really?
No.

1091
01:17:20,739 --> 01:17:22,338
You almost killed them.

1092
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,473
You wanted to.

1093
01:17:23,475 --> 01:17:25,241
The gun was not loaded!

1094
01:17:25,243 --> 01:17:27,143
You still want to.
Shut up!

1095
01:17:27,145 --> 01:17:29,679
Listen to me,
because this is how it happens.

1096
01:17:29,681 --> 01:17:31,915
This is how it happens to people.
Shut up!

1097
01:17:31,917 --> 01:17:34,584
There is no John Shooter.

1098
01:17:34,586 --> 01:17:36,185
Ra.

1099
01:17:36,187 --> 01:17:38,454
There never has been. You invented him.
Ra?

1100
01:17:38,456 --> 01:17:39,522
Ra, ra.

1101
01:17:39,524 --> 01:17:41,524
Listen to me,
not to him,

1102
01:17:41,526 --> 01:17:42,558
before it's too late.

1103
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,193
Leave me alone!

1104
01:17:47,665 --> 01:17:49,565
<i>You are alone.</i>

1105
01:18:10,621 --> 01:18:12,488
<i>You're not handling this.</i>

1106
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:14,090
<i>What you're doing is wrong.
Everything is wrong.</i>

1107
01:18:14,092 --> 01:18:15,792
<i>You have no idea
what you're doing.</i>

1108
01:18:15,794 --> 01:18:18,194
<i>You've been eating potato chips
this way for 30 years.</i>

1109
01:18:18,196 --> 01:18:20,229
<i>What you're doing is wrong.
For 30 years.</i>

1110
01:18:25,503 --> 01:18:27,737
<i>Sister found out about
the broken window.</i>

1111
01:18:27,739 --> 01:18:30,206
<i>And the school had to be
withdrawn from the competition.</i>

1112
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:33,176
<i>Sister found out about
the broken windows.</i>

1113
01:18:33,178 --> 01:18:34,577
<i>Then she got up from the table.</i>

1114
01:18:34,579 --> 01:18:37,947
<i>And didn't talk for the rest
of the night.</i>

1115
01:18:37,949 --> 01:18:40,449
<i>Todd Downey thought a woman
who would steal your love--</i>

1116
01:18:40,451 --> 01:18:42,752
<i>What does Todd Downey got to do
with it? Everything.</i>

1117
01:18:42,754 --> 01:18:44,620
<i>I'm starting to believe
Todd Downey was right.</i>

1118
01:18:44,622 --> 01:18:47,023
<i>Everything that you're doing
is wrong.</i>

1119
01:18:48,258 --> 01:18:50,626
What is happening to me?

1120
01:18:50,628 --> 01:18:52,428
Oh, I think you know.

1121
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:56,833
I think you have
a real good idea.

1122
01:18:56,835 --> 01:18:58,234
You don't exist.

1123
01:18:58,236 --> 01:18:59,769
Me?

1124
01:18:59,771 --> 01:19:02,972
I exist,
Mr. Rainey.

1125
01:19:02,974 --> 01:19:04,908
I exist because...

1126
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:06,475
you made me.

1127
01:19:06,477 --> 01:19:09,312
<i>Check it out.
You thought me up.</i>

1128
01:19:09,314 --> 01:19:11,715
I'm a dairy farmer from Mississippi.

1129
01:19:11,717 --> 01:19:13,683
Gave me my name.

1130
01:19:13,685 --> 01:19:16,652
Told me everything
you wanted me to do.

1131
01:19:29,567 --> 01:19:33,136
I did them things
so you wouldn't have to.

1132
01:19:33,138 --> 01:19:35,571
Right up there, Tom.
We were standing right there.

1133
01:19:35,573 --> 01:19:37,573
Yeah, I know, Mort.
I saw you.

1134
01:19:37,575 --> 01:19:41,477
I didn't want to say it in front
of him, but you were alone.

1135
01:19:41,479 --> 01:19:43,880
I know, Tom. Look,
just pull over for a second.

1136
01:19:43,882 --> 01:19:45,715
I want to show you something.

1137
01:19:48,585 --> 01:19:51,520
Didn't have the stomach
to do it yourself,

1138
01:19:51,522 --> 01:19:52,688
but you knew I did.

1139
01:19:55,392 --> 01:19:56,993
Are we done yet?

1140
01:19:56,995 --> 01:20:00,596
We got things all cleaned up
around here?

1141
01:20:00,598 --> 01:20:03,199
What's the real reason
I come for?

1142
01:20:05,069 --> 01:20:07,937
Fix the story.
That's right.

1143
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:10,606
Fix the ending.

1144
01:20:10,608 --> 01:20:12,175
Gotta fix the ending.

1145
01:20:12,177 --> 01:20:15,211
And how exactly do you suppose
we ought to do that?

1146
01:20:40,037 --> 01:20:41,470
Mort?

1147
01:21:29,486 --> 01:21:30,987
Mort?

1148
01:21:33,224 --> 01:21:35,892
Are you there?
I saw your car outside.

1149
01:21:40,231 --> 01:21:41,697
Hello?

1150
01:22:08,592 --> 01:22:10,093
Mort?

1151
01:22:16,066 --> 01:22:17,233
Chico?

1152
01:22:42,526 --> 01:22:44,493
That explains a lot.

1153
01:22:48,198 --> 01:22:49,832
What the hell?

1154
01:24:17,121 --> 01:24:18,554
H-Hi.

1155
01:24:25,562 --> 01:24:27,497
Jesus, Mort.

1156
01:24:30,734 --> 01:24:32,868
W-Where'd you get
that old thing? The attic?

1157
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:34,770
It's mine.

1158
01:24:34,772 --> 01:24:37,773
Wasn't ever anybody else's.

1159
01:24:40,511 --> 01:24:42,645
Mort, what's wrong?

1160
01:24:42,647 --> 01:24:45,014
You got you
a wrong number, missus.

1161
01:24:47,052 --> 01:24:48,984
Ain't no Mort here.

1162
01:24:48,986 --> 01:24:50,920
Mort's dead.

1163
01:24:50,922 --> 01:24:52,655
He did a whole lot
of squirming around

1164
01:24:52,657 --> 01:24:54,657
but in the end he couldn't lie
to himself anymore,

1165
01:24:54,659 --> 01:24:57,226
let alone to me.

1166
01:24:57,228 --> 01:25:00,596
Now, I never put a hand on him,
missus. I swear.

1167
01:25:00,598 --> 01:25:02,432
He took the coward's way out.

1168
01:25:02,434 --> 01:25:04,100
Why are you talking
this way, Mort?

1169
01:25:04,102 --> 01:25:05,468
That's just the way I talk.

1170
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:06,869
You're scaring me.

1171
01:25:06,871 --> 01:25:07,903
It don't matter.

1172
01:25:07,905 --> 01:25:09,038
You won't be scared long.

1173
01:25:27,224 --> 01:25:28,424
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1174
01:26:07,464 --> 01:26:10,433
I'm about done fussing with you.

1175
01:26:25,916 --> 01:26:28,518
I am so sorry, missus

1176
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:31,020
but right is right
and fair is fair

1177
01:26:31,022 --> 01:26:33,189
and something
has got to be done.

1178
01:26:35,193 --> 01:26:36,825
By the way,
I want you to know

1179
01:26:36,827 --> 01:26:38,327
that none of this
was my idea.

1180
01:26:38,329 --> 01:26:40,196
It was Mr. Rainey
all along.

1181
01:26:40,198 --> 01:26:42,532
You are Mort Rainey.

1182
01:26:42,534 --> 01:26:44,333
I got a place for you.

1183
01:26:44,335 --> 01:26:46,502
You are Mort Rainey.

1184
01:26:46,504 --> 01:26:48,404
I got it all picked out.

1185
01:26:49,839 --> 01:26:52,208
You are Mort Rainey.

1186
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,254
Mort.

1187
01:27:07,925 --> 01:27:09,458
Mort...

1188
01:27:11,628 --> 01:27:13,062
Amy?

1189
01:27:15,965 --> 01:27:16,965
Amy?

1190
01:27:16,967 --> 01:27:18,100
Ted.

1191
01:27:21,405 --> 01:27:22,538
Amy?

1192
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,373
Ted! No!

1193
01:27:28,044 --> 01:27:29,078
Ted!

1194
01:27:40,724 --> 01:27:41,790
No!

1195
01:27:51,235 --> 01:27:55,104
"I know I can do it,'
Todd Downey said,

1196
01:27:55,106 --> 01:27:59,308
"helping himself to another ear
of corn from the steaming bowl.

1197
01:28:01,077 --> 01:28:03,412
"I'm sure that in time,

1198
01:28:05,115 --> 01:28:08,050
"her death will be a mystery

1199
01:28:09,686 --> 01:28:11,554
even to me."

1200
01:28:31,241 --> 01:28:33,476
Hi.

1201
01:28:33,478 --> 01:28:34,910
Hi.

1202
01:28:39,783 --> 01:28:41,817
I'm, uh...

1203
01:28:41,819 --> 01:28:42,885
kind of late.

1204
01:28:52,462 --> 01:28:54,430
Hi.

1205
01:28:54,432 --> 01:28:56,432
Hi.

1206
01:28:56,434 --> 01:28:58,567
Braces.
Yeah.

1207
01:28:58,569 --> 01:29:00,636
Getting a few things
straightened out.

1208
01:29:05,575 --> 01:29:06,609
Hey, you know,
I--

1209
01:29:06,611 --> 01:29:09,244
I was kind of
wondering if, um...

1210
01:29:09,246 --> 01:29:10,780
sometime you might possibly
be interested in--?

1211
01:29:10,782 --> 01:29:12,848
I don't need a bag.

1212
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:44,847
Mr. Rainey?

1213
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:49,719
Your front door's open.
I'm coming in.

1214
01:30:14,711 --> 01:30:16,278
Mr. Rainey?

1215
01:30:17,647 --> 01:30:18,781
Mort Rainey?

1216
01:30:19,816 --> 01:30:21,884
Oh, hi, Dave.

1217
01:30:21,886 --> 01:30:23,853
I didn't hear you.
Come on up.

1218
01:30:26,923 --> 01:30:29,258
Glad you're here.
I could use the break.

1219
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:30,493
Working lunch.

1220
01:30:30,495 --> 01:30:32,194
I'm on a roll.

1221
01:30:34,398 --> 01:30:35,731
Yeah.

1222
01:30:37,434 --> 01:30:39,101
Listen, both you and I
know what you did.

1223
01:30:39,803 --> 01:30:41,336
Oh.

1224
01:30:41,338 --> 01:30:43,539
Maybe we don't have enough
to put you away right now,

1225
01:30:43,541 --> 01:30:45,107
but eventually...

1226
01:30:45,109 --> 01:30:47,276
we'll find those bodies.

1227
01:30:47,278 --> 01:30:49,011
We'll tie you to them

1228
01:30:49,013 --> 01:30:50,646
and you're going away.

1229
01:30:52,449 --> 01:30:53,849
In the meantime,
I'd appreciate it

1230
01:30:53,851 --> 01:30:56,051
if you didn't come
into town anymore.

1231
01:30:57,454 --> 01:30:58,987
It makes people uncomfortable.

1232
01:31:01,925 --> 01:31:04,326
You can do your shopping
in New London.

1233
01:31:06,763 --> 01:31:08,997
Did you hear what I said?

1234
01:31:11,401 --> 01:31:12,835
Sure.

1235
01:31:12,837 --> 01:31:14,036
No problem.

1236
01:31:15,772 --> 01:31:18,006
You know...

1237
01:31:18,008 --> 01:31:20,042
the only thing that matters...

1238
01:31:20,044 --> 01:31:22,177
is the ending.

1239
01:31:22,179 --> 01:31:24,847
It's the most important part
of the story, the ending.

1240
01:31:25,916 --> 01:31:27,349
And this one...

1241
01:31:29,285 --> 01:31:30,920
is very good.

1242
01:31:33,957 --> 01:31:35,658
This one's perfect.

1243
01:31:45,969 --> 01:31:48,871

1244
