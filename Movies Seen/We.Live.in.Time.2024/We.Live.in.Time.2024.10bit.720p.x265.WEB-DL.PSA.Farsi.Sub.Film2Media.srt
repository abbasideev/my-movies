1
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:52,892
Good morning, ladies.

2
00:01:52,994 --> 00:01:54,199
Hello.

3
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:56,700
<i>Hello!</i>

4
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,540
Thank you.

5
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:45,509
Mmm.

6
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:47,483
Babe.

7
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:49,850
I need a second opinion.

8
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:51,784
Oh. Okay.

9
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:03,433
What is it?

10
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:06,802
Um,
it's a Douglas fir parfait.

11
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:09,340
Oh.

12
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:14,418
- Darling, what time is it?
- Please.

13
00:03:14,442 --> 00:03:15,520
Please can you just try it?

14
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:50,744
Hmm.

15
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:03,158
Okay.

16
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,791
So no gush or trickle or fluid

17
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:08,129
or unusual amount of dampness
in your underwear?

18
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:09,963
- Uh-uh.
- Mucus plug?

19
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:16,907
Who even are you?

20
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:19,338
Erm, okay.

21
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,708
Fluids?

22
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:22,885
Didn't you just ask me
that question?

23
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:25,046
- No, to drink. Have you...
- No, nothing.

24
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:26,846
Jesus.

25
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:29,387
Make sure you keep drinking.

26
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:31,788
Okay.

27
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:38,096
So as and when you, erm...
You have any...

28
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:39,962
Yeah, you'll be
the first to know.

29
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:46,470
Good to go on that.

30
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,442
Just a little more.

31
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:54,139
- Table five.
- Yes, Chef.

32
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,316
Sauce?

33
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:05,085
Right,
that's ready for service.

34
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:07,402
Don't look so terrified, Chef.

35
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:09,526
- That's fucking majestic.
- Thank you, Chef.

36
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:25,010
Chef?

37
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:27,010
Do you need anything?

38
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:28,146
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

39
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:29,808
Leave me alone.
Go back to your station.

40
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:38,121
<i>So what happens now?</i>

41
00:05:38,223 --> 00:05:39,685
I'm going to recommend

42
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:42,091
starting with a course
of chemotherapy.

43
00:05:42,193 --> 00:05:43,757
Why not just remove it?

44
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:46,556
Sorry, I mean, why...
Why can't we just operate?

45
00:05:46,658 --> 00:05:48,733
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

46
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:50,534
It's too big.

47
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:54,002
The first thing
we have to do is shrink it.

48
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,372
Slow it down.

49
00:05:55,474 --> 00:05:58,069
Once we achieve that,
then we can operate.

50
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,737
And then... And then what?

51
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,507
Once you recover from surgery,

52
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:03,707
you'll need to complete

53
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,584
another course
of chemotherapy.

54
00:06:06,686 --> 00:06:09,215
We really don't want to be
leaving anything behind here.

55
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:10,488
Hmm.

56
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:14,357
Given this is a reoccurrence,

57
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,593
we need an aggressive
treatment plan.

58
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:20,564
Okay.

59
00:06:22,428 --> 00:06:23,795
So...

60
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:26,369
Just to check that I...
It would go...

61
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:28,071
- A course of chemotherapy...
- Mmm-hmm.

62
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:29,768
...followed by surgery,

63
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,137
followed by another,
hopefully final...

64
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:36,166
- course of chemotherapy?
- Correct.

65
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:37,449
Okay, great.

66
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:40,111
And what about work?

67
00:06:42,086 --> 00:06:43,314
What about work?

68
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:46,554
Well, how much time off,
do you think,

69
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,190
realistically,
we should be considering?

70
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:50,428
What do you think?

71
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,924
Well, given the physical
nature of your profession,

72
00:06:54,026 --> 00:06:56,232
honestly, if you
and your colleagues

73
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,096
can find a workable solution,

74
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,802
I would advocate
stepping back.

75
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:07,446
Maybe it's time
to finally get a dog.

76
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:11,676
I read somewhere
that pets, dogs,

77
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:13,184
are really good for children,

78
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:14,717
helping them
to cope with, like,

79
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:17,786
big, life stuff.

80
00:07:19,353 --> 00:07:20,756
Hmm.

81
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,432
Because once they've gone
through the death of a pet,

82
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:23,758
their ability

83
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,927
to handle all the other
terrible shit goes up.

84
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:30,562
So...

85
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:33,438
So you think
we should procure a dog

86
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,342
in order to end its life
prematurely as a way of...

87
00:07:37,444 --> 00:07:40,138
I'm obviously not suggesting
we kill a dog.

88
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:44,945
Maybe just a really old one.

89
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:51,355
What...

90
00:07:51,457 --> 00:07:54,724
What would you say
if I said to you...

91
00:07:58,196 --> 00:08:01,126
Erm, I'm not sure...

92
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:05,768
I know how to go through
all of that all over again?

93
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,042
- Erm...
- 'Cos let's...

94
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:13,144
Let's just say...

95
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:16,009
Let's just say it goes to plan

96
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:18,312
and...

97
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,381
In whatever it is,
like, six to eight months...

98
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:23,652
Mmm-hmm.

99
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,716
...I receive the all-clear
and it's great

100
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:28,527
and all of a sudden,

101
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:32,095
it feels, like, great.

102
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:33,257
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

103
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:36,832
That'd be great. Agreed, yeah.

104
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:40,869
But what happens
if it doesn't?

105
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,038
All of a sudden
you're in this weird position

106
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,712
where instead of making
the most out of those...

107
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:55,180
six, seven, eight,
maybe nine months,

108
00:08:56,887 --> 00:08:58,794
you're gonna realise that
all you did was go bald

109
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:00,185
and puke your guts up.

110
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,662
Mmm-hmm.

111
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:13,096
Okay. Yeah.

112
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:15,469
So you're saying that
in that scenario,

113
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:17,004
for you it would be...

114
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:21,809
Erm, more
about quality than quantity?

115
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:24,246
I'm saying I'm not
particularly interested

116
00:09:24,348 --> 00:09:25,749
in a treatment plan

117
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:28,884
that accidentally
wastes our time.

118
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,652
I'm saying,
in that particular scenario,

119
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:35,419
I'd much rather we...

120
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:40,027
We have six fucking amazing,
fantastic, proactive months...

121
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:47,133
Than 12 really,
really shitty passive ones.

122
00:09:53,713 --> 00:09:56,447
I'm not saying I don't want
to do the treatment.

123
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:59,350
I'm just saying...

124
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:02,285
I want it to be
the right choice.

125
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:30,375
Knock, knock.

126
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:32,007
- Breakfast. You got time?
- Yeah.

127
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:35,345
Kumquats or eggs?

128
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:37,411
Mmm.

129
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:38,516
You tell me.

130
00:11:38,618 --> 00:11:40,089
Then dealer's choice it is.

131
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:42,185
- Nice threads, by the way.
- Oh.

132
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:43,287
Thanks, Dad.

133
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,089
<i>Hello,
my name is Tobias Durand.</i>

134
00:11:51,191 --> 00:11:53,125
And I'm part of
the Weetabix IT team,

135
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:55,726
fulfilling the role
of Master Data Steward.

136
00:11:55,828 --> 00:11:57,194
Fabulous.

137
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:58,747
If you could just go ahead
and tell me

138
00:11:58,771 --> 00:12:00,733
what you had for breakfast
this morning.

139
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:02,400
Honeyed kumquats on toast.

140
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:06,506
Followed by
a bowl of Weetabix.

141
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:07,610
Okey-dokey.

142
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:13,549
<i>I think the thing
that I enjoy most</i>

143
00:12:13,652 --> 00:12:14,760
<i>about working here at Weetabix</i>

144
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:16,216
<i>is the feeling of family.</i>

145
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:18,821
<i>Despite the fact
that we're all of us</i>

146
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:22,090

147
00:12:22,756 --> 00:12:24,221
<i>there's...</i>

148
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:26,429
There's still
a real family feeling.

149
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,107
Okay.

150
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:48,513
Okay.

151
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,877
Divorce.

152
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:47,202
<i>Patient number 14.</i>

153
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:19,267
They needed the bed back.

154
00:15:20,874 --> 00:15:22,554
What's happened
to my underwear?

155
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,851
Oh, I literally have no idea.

156
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,311
This, erm...
This was all you...

157
00:15:31,176 --> 00:15:32,478
All you had on you.

158
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:36,482
The Chocolate Orange was
pronounced dead at the scene.

159
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,594
Er... Erm...

160
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:46,426
I'm Almut, by the way.

161
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:51,596
Almut?

162
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:55,699
Almut.

163
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,707
Tobias.

164
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:08,250
So sorry,
but do we know each other?

165
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:11,521
Oh.

166
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:13,618
Yeah... No. Erm...

167
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:17,061
Sorry. I...

168
00:16:18,597 --> 00:16:20,526
I... I ran you over.

169
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:24,494
Oh.

170
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:26,468
<i>Patient number 17.</i>

171
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,570
Sorry.

172
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:30,874
It's all right.

173
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,072
Hello and welcome
to Red Wagon Diner.

174
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:35,473
Here at Red Wagon Diner,

175
00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:37,541
we pride ourselves
on offering our customers

176
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:40,345
a taste of the classic
'50s American diner

177
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,414
here on
the great British roadside.

178
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:44,951
All our burgers are made
to our special recipe

179
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:46,988
using 100% British beef

180
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,518
and our top dollar shakes
are made

181
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,128
with real dairy ice cream
to die for.

182
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,328
What can I get you?

183
00:16:54,397 --> 00:16:56,463
I work for Weetabix.

184
00:16:58,366 --> 00:16:59,763
As in the breakfast cereal?

185
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:01,901
Mmm-hmm.

186
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:03,971
Well, the company...

187
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:05,769
Sorry. The company also own...

188
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:09,410
Weetos, Alpen,
Ready Brek. But, yeah.

189
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:11,613
Wow.

190
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:15,119
You must be really regular.

191
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:23,457
Ow, ow.

192
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,529
Um, how... How about yourself?

193
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:32,103
I'm a chef/restaurant owner.

194
00:17:34,373 --> 00:17:35,906
Oh.

195
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:39,110
Er, what kind of cuisine
do you, er...

196
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,606
...do?

197
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:45,782
Er, modern European takes
on classic Alpine dishes.

198
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:50,721
So, basically, Anglo-Bavarian.

199
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:52,123
Well, that's the plan, anyway.

200
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,488
Supposed to open
in a few weeks.

201
00:17:55,995 --> 00:17:57,722
How's it going?

202
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:00,993
Er...

203
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:02,863
Oh.

204
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:04,766
Oh, no.

205
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:06,097
No, it's going fine.

206
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:07,435
It's gonna be great.

207
00:18:11,544 --> 00:18:13,210
You should come.

208
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:15,476
No, honestly, I feel like
that's the least I could do.

209
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:18,479
- Oh.
- And your wife too.

210
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,118
- Darling?
- Yeah?

211
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,220
Yeah.

212
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:31,123
There is something

213
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:33,128
that your daddy and I...

214
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,898
Something that
mommy and me want to...

215
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,144
We want to talk to you about.

216
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:39,166
Yeah.
Something a little...

217
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,632
A little bit important, actually.

218
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:44,238
- It's a bit serious, though.
- Yeah.

219
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,381
Yeah, a bit serious

220
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:46,525
- and a bit grown-up.
- Yeah.

221
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:48,512
A bit serious, a bit grown-up,
a bit important.

222
00:18:48,614 --> 00:18:49,675
Yeah.

223
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:52,648
So mommy didn't realize it

224
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,644
but mommy's...

225
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:55,686
mommy's actually
been feeling quite ill.

226
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:56,746
Got a bit of a tummy ache,

227
00:18:56,748 --> 00:18:58,616
kind of a pretty nasty
tummy ache.

228
00:18:58,717 --> 00:18:59,995
And the doctors
have basically said...

229
00:19:00,018 --> 00:19:03,594
Hi, there! What a delicious
looking ice cream sundae.

230
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:04,556
Yummo!

231
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:06,223
My name's Noel.
What's your name?

232
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:07,427
Ella, and I'm three.

233
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,977
So sorry, we're actually
in the middle...

234
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:10,043
How would you like
to see me make

235
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,969
this entire bottle disappear?

236
00:19:12,071 --> 00:19:13,447
- Yes, please.
- Noel? Noel, seriously.

237
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:15,446
- We can't do this right now.
- This is not a good time.

238
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,133
Will you help me say
the magic words?

239
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:18,368
Noel!

240
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,541
Go... Go away. Go away.

241
00:19:23,113 --> 00:19:24,743
Sorry, it's just not the time.

242
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:31,350
So...

243
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:34,184
Where were we?

244
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:35,719
Mmm-hmm!

245
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:40,759
That's too much tea.

246
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:42,525
Can I make you one?

247
00:19:42,627 --> 00:19:44,432
<i>All right, you two.</i>

248
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:47,265
It's bath time and
it's bedtime for both of you.

249
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:48,435
No.

250
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:50,084
Am I gonna have to come
and get you?

251
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:51,835
- No.
- Are you nodding?

252
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:53,617
- I'm gonna come and get you!
- Grab Teddy.

253
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:54,749
What are we gonna do?
Do you want me to...

254
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:56,124
- Oh, I don't know if I can...
- Oh!

255
00:19:56,148 --> 00:19:58,013
- Sorry, mommy.
- No!

256
00:19:58,116 --> 00:20:00,212
You tricked me!

257
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:03,324
We're going
all the way. We're going...

258
00:20:03,348 --> 00:20:04,853
I like her best.

259
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,320
- Yep.
- Yeah.

260
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:08,618
- And I like her best.
- I know you do.

261
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,426
She has great hair,
doesn't she?

262
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,862
You were really great with her
this afternoon, by the way.

263
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,799
Yeah, well...

264
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:23,169
Yeah, I'm... I'm glad
we decided just to talk to her

265
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:24,770
instead of killing a dog.

266
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:30,743
Yeah.

267
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:37,915
So...

268
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,984
I was thinking...

269
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:45,824
Maybe, erm,

270
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,266
we...

271
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:51,764
Should have some sex

272
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:56,340
before my treatment begins.

273
00:21:05,782 --> 00:21:06,847
Now?

274
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,044
Mmm-hmm.

275
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:13,423

I meant to say,

286
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:07,510
I got the weirdest message
from Simon.

287
00:22:13,551 --> 00:22:16,585
You know,
Simon Maxson, my old boss?

288
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:19,852
Well, he, erm...

289
00:22:20,487 --> 00:22:22,393
He wanted to know if I...

290
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:25,388
If I was interested in trying
out for the Bocuse d'Or.

291
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:38,937
As soon as all this is over,

292
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:44,074
we're... We're gonna make sure
that you have

293
00:22:46,184 --> 00:22:48,217
the opportunity and the time

294
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,916
to take on whatever it is
you want.

295
00:22:51,484 --> 00:22:52,687
But I really...

296
00:22:54,154 --> 00:22:57,192
I really think that right now
we ought to just slow down

297
00:22:57,295 --> 00:22:59,397
- and focus on get...
- Relax.

298
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:01,597
I said no.

299
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:04,394
Just thought
it was interesting,

300
00:23:04,496 --> 00:23:05,496
that's all.

301
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,667
Yes!

302
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:13,303
Come on.

303
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,113
That was perfect!

304
00:23:16,215 --> 00:23:17,745
That's a perfect throw.

305
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:20,958
<i>Thank you for joining us</i>

306
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:24,620
<i>in the countdown to our
New Year's Eve celebrations.</i>

307
00:23:24,722 --> 00:23:26,602
<i>What are you up to tonight?
Are you going out...</i>

308
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,490
- Oh!
<i>- ...to watch some fireworks?</i>

309
00:23:28,592 --> 00:23:30,293
<i>- Staying in with the kids?</i>
- Mmm.

310
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:31,789
<i>Have you got friends
coming round?</i>

311
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:33,596
- Mmm!
<i>- Ring in and let us know</i>

312
00:23:33,698 --> 00:23:35,670
<i>- what you're planning to do...</i>
- Thank you.

313
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:37,499
Mmm!

314
00:23:37,602 --> 00:23:40,498
Oh, fuck! Mmm, motherfucker!

315
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,406
Oh!

316
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:44,308
They're definitely getting
stronger, you know.

317
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,503
Mmm.

318
00:23:50,877 --> 00:23:52,510
Lasting a minimum now
of 60 seconds

319
00:23:52,612 --> 00:23:53,851
every five to ten minutes.

320
00:23:56,054 --> 00:23:57,180
Great. Thank you.

321
00:23:57,957 --> 00:23:59,017
See you very soon.

322
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:13,203
That's fine.

323
00:24:13,305 --> 00:24:14,543
- That's fine.
- Yeah?

324
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:16,405
Yeah. Yeah.

325
00:24:16,507 --> 00:24:17,747
Mmm, hang on a second.
Hang on.

326
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:19,735
Ooh. Yeah, yeah,
take a moment.

327
00:24:19,837 --> 00:24:21,275
Take a beat, take a beat.

328
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,412
Okay.

329
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:32,987
Ready?

330
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:34,190
Okay.

331
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:38,089
Here we go.

332
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:56,345
Sorry.

333
00:24:56,447 --> 00:24:58,348
Shit. I'm sorry.

334
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,942
I'm fine to walk.
Honestly. Honestly.

335
00:25:00,044 --> 00:25:01,346
- Fuck. I'm so sorry.
- Honestly.

336
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:05,584
Fucking fuckface!

337
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:07,588
Oh, this is ridiculous!

338
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:11,131
Very sorry. Sorry.

339
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:18,598
Oh, fuck!

340
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,297
I'm sorry.
Okay, okay. You okay?

341
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:24,102
Yeah.

342
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:26,371
That's it. Well done.
You're doing a great job.

343
00:25:26,473 --> 00:25:27,809
Yes, you are.

344
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:31,113
Okay.

345
00:25:32,076 --> 00:25:34,615
Well, good news is,
mom and Dad,

346
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:36,419
the baby's heart rate
is all good.

347
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:38,923
mom, same goes
for your BP and pulse.

348
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:41,755
Bad news, I'm afraid, mom,

349
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:44,487
is that you're still
only two centimetres,

350
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:45,626
if that.

351
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
So, I'm sorry,
but you're going to have

352
00:25:47,366 --> 00:25:49,666
to go back home again
and wait.

353
00:25:53,602 --> 00:25:55,672
I'm sorry.

354
00:26:00,611 --> 00:26:02,375
You wanted
to see me, Chef?

355
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,977
I did, yeah. Please.

356
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,547
Er, actually, would you...

357
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:07,859
Would you mind
closing the door?

358
00:26:07,883 --> 00:26:09,745
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Wait, sorry. No, no. Sorry.

359
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:11,215
- My fault.
- Oh.

360
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:20,995
Chef, is this about the thing
with the scallops?

361
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,865
What? No, no.

362
00:26:24,432 --> 00:26:25,603
- Oh.
- No.

363
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:28,966
Tell me something, Chef.

364
00:26:29,068 --> 00:26:31,272
What... What do
you know about the...

365
00:26:34,906 --> 00:26:36,308
Do you need the room?

366
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:37,846
'Fraid so.

367
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:42,549
What do you know about
the Bocuse d'Or?

368
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:45,916
Erm, I mean,
it's like the...

369
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:47,851
The culinary Olympics.

370
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:49,185
There is no higher accolade.

371
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:52,756
Sorry, Chef. We are running
low on celeriac.

372
00:26:52,858 --> 00:26:54,894
Strictly between us, Chef,

373
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:57,030
and I mean that,
not a word to another soul,

374
00:26:58,267 --> 00:27:00,198
I, erm...

375
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,471
I've been asked if I would
like to compete this year

376
00:27:03,573 --> 00:27:05,841
to represent the UK, and I...

377
00:27:06,807 --> 00:27:08,239
I'd like you to be my commis.

378
00:27:09,347 --> 00:27:10,347
- What?
- But listen.

379
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:11,678
Holy shit, Chef!

380
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,847
We have two heats
to get through.

381
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,748
And you seriously really need
to consider...

382
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,619
- Chef, I'm in!
- Time. Time, Chef.

383
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,028
You really need
to think about time.

384
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:20,095
Chef, it's literally
the easiest...

385
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,479
If we make it
to the European heat,

386
00:27:21,553 --> 00:27:25,024
that is three to four days
a week minimum, training wise.

387
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:27,464
Make it to the final,
that is five days a week.

388
00:27:27,566 --> 00:27:30,094
- Five days, full time.
- Chef, I'm in.

389
00:27:30,196 --> 00:27:33,704
- And there'll be no let-up.
- I'm in. 100%.

390
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:42,240
Let's get out of here.

391
00:27:47,878 --> 00:27:49,753
Mmm-hmm.

392
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:59,296
Yeah, I'm probably gonna have
to wet-shave you back here.

393
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:01,094
It's looking a little furry.

394
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:04,068
Really?

395
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:09,300
- Oh.
- Lovely.

396
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,941
Yeah, that's the ticket.

397
00:28:20,518 --> 00:28:22,115
I'm jealous. You realize that?

398
00:28:24,215 --> 00:28:26,485
Jay Rayner
just published a rave.

399
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:30,391
Okay.

400
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:35,532
- Okay.
- Go on.

401
00:28:35,634 --> 00:28:37,735
- You'll be fine.
- All right, thanks. Bye.

402
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,306
Hi. How are you doing
this evening?

403
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:54,277
Do you have a reservation
with us?

404
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:57,683
Er, yeah. Tobi...
Tobias Durand. I don't...

405
00:28:57,785 --> 00:29:00,186
Oh, my God. Mr. Weetabix.

406
00:29:00,853 --> 00:29:02,787
This is so great.

407
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:04,687
How's the arm? Poor thing.

408
00:29:06,526 --> 00:29:07,825
Oh.

409
00:29:07,927 --> 00:29:09,459
- Yeah.
- Well, listen.

410
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:11,560
We're so excited to have you
with us this evening.

411
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:13,802
We're gonna make sure you have
the time of your life.

412
00:29:13,905 --> 00:29:16,633
I have you down
as a table for two, correct?

413
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:18,440
Erm, no.

414
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:19,803
Sorry, that's my fault.

415
00:29:19,905 --> 00:29:22,311
Just me in the end.

416
00:29:22,413 --> 00:29:24,314
Oh, don't apologize.

417
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:25,549
- Follow me.
- Okay.

418
00:29:30,314 --> 00:29:31,849
I'll let Chef know
you're here.

419
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:45,001
A little something
to get you started.

420
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:46,103
Oh.

421
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,036
Weisswurst amuse-bouche.

422
00:29:49,138 --> 00:29:51,974
AKA Bavarian white sausage
with a modern twist.

423
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:55,874
On top, we have for you
a lemon mustard gel. Enjoy.

424
00:29:55,976 --> 00:29:57,980
Thank you. Thank you.

425
00:30:22,967 --> 00:30:24,933
- Hi.
- Hi.

426
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:27,904
Marks out of 10
for my tiny sausage?

427
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:29,642
It's 10.

428
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,559
I'm sorry to hear
your wife couldn't make it.

429
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:33,583
Is everything all right?

430
00:30:33,685 --> 00:30:35,545
Erm, we're actually
not, erm...

431
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:38,714
Well, I mean...

432
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:42,123
Technically speaking, we still
are but legally speaking...

433
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,961
we're also...

434
00:30:47,661 --> 00:30:48,860
Divorced.

435
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:06,210
Mmm.

436
00:31:06,312 --> 00:31:08,344
The back of your neck
is so smooth.

437
00:31:08,446 --> 00:31:10,547
My dad shaved it for me.

438
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:13,885
Oh, is he some kind of barber?

439
00:31:13,987 --> 00:31:15,654
- Architect.
- Mmm.

440
00:31:24,197 --> 00:31:25,735
Oh, how is the neck,
by the way?

441
00:31:25,837 --> 00:31:27,666
Yeah, it's, erm, get...
Getting there.

442
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:32,170
I don't think
I've ever had the pleasure

443
00:31:32,272 --> 00:31:33,807
of sleeping with an invalid
before.

444
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:38,179
Erm...

445
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,013
What?

446
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:44,119
I suppose I'm a bit, erm,
out of practice.

447
00:31:45,857 --> 00:31:48,619
I'm also just
suddenly aware I...

448
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:51,590
I don't... I don't have any
kind of prophylactic on me.

449
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:55,361
Such low expectations.

450
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:07,109
Also,
by the way, erm...

451
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:11,843
My staff are desperate to know
if you get free Weetabix.

452
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:15,616
Well...

453
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,254
I can confirm to you

454
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:23,458
that on occasion,

455
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,892
I do have access

456
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:27,030
to complementary
Weetabix, yeah.

457
00:33:50,913 --> 00:33:53,611
- Morning.
- Oh, er...

458
00:33:55,084 --> 00:33:57,450
Adrienne Duvall.

459
00:33:58,923 --> 00:34:01,216
We worked together
back in the day.

460
00:34:01,318 --> 00:34:03,291
Oh.

461
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:06,763
And it made me realise,
well...

462
00:34:06,865 --> 00:34:08,626
Quite so competitive?

463
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,132
I probably ought
to get going.

464
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:16,667
Why?

465
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:19,406
Who says?

466
00:34:23,207 --> 00:34:25,048
I don't know.

467
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,248
Er, you're right.
I don't know why I said that.

468
00:34:28,351 --> 00:34:30,653
I mean, unless you have
shit to do, then...

469
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:32,122
I have nothing.

470
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:36,288
But if you...

471
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,888
I mean, have shit to do,
then, you know...

472
00:34:39,257 --> 00:34:40,257
I have nothing.

473
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:01,951
Thank you.

474
00:35:02,053 --> 00:35:04,019
Hello.
How are you doing?

475
00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:05,129
- Good, thank you.
- Hi.

476
00:35:05,153 --> 00:35:06,618
Right, tasting time.

477
00:35:08,588 --> 00:35:10,891
Are you a cheese person?

478
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:14,824
Mmm.

479
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:17,766
Do you like tapenade?

480
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:20,368
Okay, I'll... Thank you.

481
00:35:21,899 --> 00:35:23,677
- Can I get these, please?
- Of course.

482
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:26,203
- And do you want a coffee?
- Sure, yeah.

483
00:35:44,961 --> 00:35:46,290
Actually, that's not true.

484
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:51,300
A lot of it was
decidedly unhappy.

485
00:35:52,765 --> 00:35:56,701
We were starting to maybe
think about children.

486
00:35:59,943 --> 00:36:01,739
Then she got a position

487
00:36:02,946 --> 00:36:04,676
in Sweden, which was...

488
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:08,913
Great for her.

489
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,952
So then we discussed it
and then we tried it,

490
00:36:13,054 --> 00:36:14,123
me here, her there,

491
00:36:14,225 --> 00:36:16,424
both of us going back
and forth depending.

492
00:36:17,623 --> 00:36:19,490
And then eventually,
she just said, oh,

493
00:36:19,592 --> 00:36:21,297
she didn't want to do that
any more.

494
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,499
I'm sorry.

495
00:36:30,372 --> 00:36:33,173
Adrienne really wanted us

496
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,509
to start thinking
about family.

497
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:39,612
What did... What did you want?

498
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:43,385
Erm, I...

499
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:47,356
I guess there's a world
where...

500
00:36:48,586 --> 00:36:50,359
Kids aren't really my thing.

501
00:36:53,598 --> 00:36:54,598
Come on.

502
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:56,965
I'm gonna make you

503
00:36:57,002 --> 00:36:58,994
the tastiest eggs
of your life.

504
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,666
Right.

505
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:05,069
Do you know the best way
to crack an egg?

506
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,906
Always on a flat surface.

507
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,648
What's the thinking
behind the two bowls?

508
00:37:16,822 --> 00:37:18,187
Practically speaking,

509
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:21,283
it's much easier
to fish out a broken shell

510
00:37:21,385 --> 00:37:22,521
from the one egg

511
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:25,454
rather than fishing it out
from eight eggs.

512
00:37:25,556 --> 00:37:27,762
Mmm.

513
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:34,865
The versatility of the egg
knows no bounds.

514
00:37:59,663 --> 00:38:00,663
Oh.

515
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:22,973
You said something to me,
erm...

516
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:26,114
Couple weeks ago.

517
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:32,554
You said... You said kids
aren't really your thing.

518
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:38,723
That's fine. I mean, no.

519
00:39:38,826 --> 00:39:41,530
Of course, it...
Of course it is. Just, erm...

520
00:39:43,864 --> 00:39:47,965
Truthfully, kids kind of
might be, maybe, or...

521
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:52,002
Are my thing.

522
00:39:53,372 --> 00:39:54,576
And, erm...

523
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:58,243
At least I think
they might be, anyway.

524
00:39:58,345 --> 00:39:59,944
And I... I hate...

525
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:04,651
Hate to even
have to, erm...

526
00:40:04,753 --> 00:40:06,753
It's just diff...
It's just different, isn't it?

527
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:10,520
You know,
meeting someone at our age.

528
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:11,989
Whether we like it or not,

529
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:14,427
the clock is ticking.

530
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:15,837
I'm sorry,
but what the actual fuck

531
00:40:15,861 --> 00:40:17,599
are you even talking about
right now?

532
00:40:18,462 --> 00:40:19,669
Well...

533
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:22,571
It would seem to me preferable

534
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:25,274
to have a moderately-awkward
conversation right now

535
00:40:25,376 --> 00:40:27,274
rather than a completely
destructive one

536
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:28,543
in five to ten years' time.

537
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:31,775
Firstly, I'm thirty-four,
not fifty-fucking-five,

538
00:40:31,877 --> 00:40:33,944
so how about
we ease the fuck up on...

539
00:40:34,046 --> 00:40:37,919
On the whole biological clock
bullshit thing?

540
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,621
And secondly,

541
00:40:40,623 --> 00:40:43,856
I don't know, I'm, like,
"Back the fuck off."

542
00:40:45,327 --> 00:40:46,822
And calm the fuck down.

543
00:40:46,924 --> 00:40:48,260
What... What...
What's the rush?

544
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,159
Because I'm worried

545
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:52,995
that's there's a very distinct
and real possibility

546
00:40:53,097 --> 00:40:54,999
that I am about
to fall in love with you.

547
00:41:04,777 --> 00:41:06,142
I'm sorry,
I'm just not someone

548
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:08,914
who's interested in making
that kind of a promise.

549
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:15,388
And in fact, there's this
little bit of me that thinks,

550
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,824
"Fuck you" for even asking.

551
00:42:20,686 --> 00:42:23,087
Hi.

552
00:42:26,426 --> 00:42:27,597
How was work?

553
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:30,967
Er...

554
00:42:31,628 --> 00:42:32,800
Yeah.

555
00:42:35,607 --> 00:42:38,937
- How was bedtime?
- Yeah. It was fine.

556
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:41,237
We read <i>Julian Is A Mermaid.</i>

557
00:42:43,315 --> 00:42:45,747
A lot.

558
00:42:49,415 --> 00:42:51,181
So...

559
00:42:55,856 --> 00:42:57,256
You know,
the day of your diagnosis,

560
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:01,089
you said something to me.

561
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:03,564
You said that
you would rather have

562
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:08,800
six fucking fantastic months
than 12...

563
00:43:08,902 --> 00:43:10,600
Than 12 really shitty,
passive ones.

564
00:43:10,702 --> 00:43:12,070
Yeah, passive ones.

565
00:43:12,972 --> 00:43:16,274
At that time,
I was guilty of having

566
00:43:16,876 --> 00:43:21,376
no coherent
or cohesive response

567
00:43:21,478 --> 00:43:24,682
but what you said has really,
really stayed with me.

568
00:43:24,784 --> 00:43:26,983
And I now do have a response

569
00:43:27,085 --> 00:43:28,988
that I would like
to share with you.

570
00:43:30,126 --> 00:43:31,126
Okay.

571
00:43:31,523 --> 00:43:32,728
Okay.

572
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:35,163
Erm...

573
00:43:35,265 --> 00:43:36,996
I'm sorry.

574
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:39,361
"Although...

575
00:43:40,271 --> 00:43:41,836
"Although in the past,

576
00:43:42,504 --> 00:43:44,971
- "you have..."
- Mmm.

577
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,136
Erm...

578
00:43:48,238 --> 00:43:50,707
- What the...
- It's all right.

579
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:52,413
Take your time.

580
00:43:52,515 --> 00:43:54,211
- I'm nervous.
- It's okay.

581
00:43:58,583 --> 00:43:59,755
Erm...

582
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:02,087
"Although...

583
00:44:03,286 --> 00:44:07,994
"Although in the past,
you have, erm..."

584
00:44:11,165 --> 00:44:13,298
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Shall I...

585
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,401
I'm sorry.

586
00:44:17,636 --> 00:44:18,807
Here.

587
00:44:52,706 --> 00:44:54,073
Fuck it. Let's do it.

588
00:44:55,807 --> 00:44:57,010
Yeah, let's do it.

589
00:45:06,051 --> 00:45:07,724
- That too much?
- Yes.

590
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,762

Er, did anyone order a man
as well as a pizza?

602
00:46:03,714 --> 00:46:05,291
I'll take him.

611
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:31,808
Interruption?

612
00:46:40,014 --> 00:46:41,880
I saw you the o...
The o... Last week,

613
00:46:41,982 --> 00:46:43,316
I was passing
by the restaurant.

614
00:46:43,418 --> 00:46:44,418
Erm...

615
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:48,583
And it made me realize,
well...

616
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:50,958
...two things.

617
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,897
First of which, I was still
quite angry with you

618
00:46:57,134 --> 00:46:59,275
because although I might have
been somewhat insensitive,

619
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:04,533
you were rude to me,
which, yeah, a lot, hurt.

620
00:47:05,806 --> 00:47:07,071
And the second thing,

621
00:47:07,173 --> 00:47:11,577
I was guilty of
focusing on the wrong,

622
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:13,876
erm...

623
00:47:13,978 --> 00:47:16,311
...thing, aspect.

624
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:18,613
Looking ahead
instead of right...

625
00:47:20,887 --> 00:47:23,420
In front of me, at you.

626
00:47:34,902 --> 00:47:36,598
I knew he was gonna do that.

627
00:47:40,373 --> 00:47:42,274
So are you gonna catch
mommy's hair?

628
00:47:43,176 --> 00:47:45,109
Perfect, yeah.
Open your little box.

629
00:47:45,211 --> 00:47:47,208
Yeah.

630
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,247
Aw, that felt like a good one.

631
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:50,994
- Oh, yeah. Nice and clean.
- That sounded like...

632
00:47:51,018 --> 00:47:52,160
- That's perfect!
- It's nice and...

633
00:47:52,184 --> 00:47:54,250
That's it.

634
00:47:54,352 --> 00:47:55,830
How much hair
do you wanna keep, mommy?

635
00:47:59,864 --> 00:48:02,193
Yeah. Yeah, I got you.

636
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,359
- We're getting chunky now.
- Yeah, just do it.

637
00:48:04,461 --> 00:48:06,434
- We're getting chunky.
- Oh, amazing.

638
00:48:06,536 --> 00:48:07,536
Pat it down, Ells.

639
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:10,137
Good girl.

640
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:13,475
Hold that up there for me,
darling. Thank you.

641
00:48:13,577 --> 00:48:15,274
- Well done, girly.
- Oh.

642
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,582
- Oh, lovely.
- Really nice.

643
00:48:19,684 --> 00:48:21,047
- Really nice?
- Really nice.

644
00:48:27,088 --> 00:48:30,593
Whoa, okay.

645
00:48:30,695 --> 00:48:33,523
Wow. Wow. Mmm.

646
00:48:34,892 --> 00:48:36,460
Ooh, ooh.

647
00:48:39,096 --> 00:48:41,437
- Aw.
- Aw.

648
00:48:46,973 --> 00:48:48,436
You look beautiful.

649
00:48:48,538 --> 00:48:50,708
Doesn't she look
so beautiful?

650
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,014
Sorry.

651
00:48:58,282 --> 00:48:59,484
- Yes?
- Happy?

652
00:48:59,586 --> 00:49:00,682
Yes.

653
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,622
Anywhere from
200 to 600 seated guests,

654
00:49:07,724 --> 00:49:10,891
access to over four acres
of private gardens.

655
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:12,132
Wow.

656
00:49:12,234 --> 00:49:15,902
Along with its own
secure car-parking area.

657
00:49:16,004 --> 00:49:18,506
- Marble flooring.
- Wow.

658
00:49:18,608 --> 00:49:20,108
Roman nobles.

659
00:49:21,139 --> 00:49:22,804
Around about 120 guests,

660
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:28,150
expanding to around about 140
for your evening reception.

661
00:49:28,252 --> 00:49:31,279
And the great hall is licensed
for music and entertainment.

662
00:49:31,381 --> 00:49:33,522
Hear that, Ells?

663
00:49:33,624 --> 00:49:35,750
- Ooh.
- Dancing.

664
00:49:40,765 --> 00:49:43,832
Our conservatory
is licensed for

665
00:49:43,934 --> 00:49:46,967
up to and including
160 guests...

666
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:49,403
...for a seated dinner.

667
00:49:49,505 --> 00:49:50,466
Or 200...

668
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:51,937
Touch his bum.

669
00:49:52,038 --> 00:49:53,202
...for a standing buffet.

670
00:49:53,304 --> 00:49:55,176
Fairy lights, optional extra.

671
00:49:57,377 --> 00:49:58,519
Have you seen the ceiling?

672
00:49:58,543 --> 00:50:00,981
Though I should add
that the use of drones

673
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:03,184
is strictly prohibited.

674
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,153
This one's going
to take 20 minutes,

675
00:50:40,256 --> 00:50:42,319
give or take, then we'll flush
out the system

676
00:50:42,421 --> 00:50:43,821
and get you started
on number two.

677
00:50:43,923 --> 00:50:44,993
Okay, thank you.

678
00:50:45,096 --> 00:50:46,101
Right. Give us a shout
if you need anything.

679
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:47,561
Will do.

680
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:27,394
Chefs,
how are we all doing?

681
00:51:27,496 --> 00:51:29,131
Sorry to keep you waiting.

682
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:31,170
Technical bullshit.

683
00:51:31,272 --> 00:51:32,548
Apologies, everyone,
for the delay.

684
00:51:32,572 --> 00:51:35,174
Good news is, audience is in,
ready and raring.

685
00:51:35,276 --> 00:51:37,276
So, er, just a little heads-up
from me.

686
00:51:37,378 --> 00:51:38,988
Erm, I'll kick things off,
a little intro,

687
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,314
little bit about me,

688
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:43,217
little bit about my role as
Bocuse d'Or UK head coach.

689
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:45,349
Overview of the rules,
what's up for grabs today,

690
00:51:45,451 --> 00:51:47,116
place at the European
semi-finals,

691
00:51:47,218 --> 00:51:48,657
so on and so forth.

692
00:51:48,759 --> 00:51:50,185
General frenzy-whipping.

693
00:51:50,287 --> 00:51:52,386
Excitement. Good.

694
00:51:52,488 --> 00:51:54,795
Any questions? Excellent.

695
00:51:54,897 --> 00:51:57,298
All right, Chefs. Onwards.

696
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:03,967
- Hello, you.
- Hi! Hello.

697
00:52:05,138 --> 00:52:06,205
- Good to see ya.
- Yeah.

698
00:52:06,307 --> 00:52:08,676
- Congrats on the star.
- Same to you.

699
00:52:08,778 --> 00:52:09,606
Yeah, well, I think

700
00:52:09,607 --> 00:52:10,951
I'm a little
old hat at this point.

701
00:52:10,975 --> 00:52:12,210
No.

702
00:52:12,312 --> 00:52:14,543
This is Jade Khadime,
my commis.

703
00:52:14,645 --> 00:52:16,180
- And the real deal.
- Hello, Jade.

704
00:52:16,282 --> 00:52:18,215
Well, best of luck out there.

705
00:52:18,317 --> 00:52:19,397
Excellent hair, by the way.

706
00:52:19,449 --> 00:52:20,983
- Oh, thank you.
- Yes.

707
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:27,229
Er, just gonna pop to the loo.

708
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:35,437
Oh, fuck!

709
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,305
Chef!

710
00:53:12,407 --> 00:53:14,167
Chef, they're ready for us.

711
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,879
It's fine, honestly.
Honestly, I'm fine.

712
00:53:18,981 --> 00:53:20,249
I'm... I'm... I'm coming.

713
00:53:22,852 --> 00:53:23,978
Chef, are you using?

714
00:53:26,755 --> 00:53:28,153
What?

715
00:53:28,255 --> 00:53:30,457
Chefs' circle of trust, Chef.

716
00:53:37,534 --> 00:53:38,564
No.

717
00:53:42,799 --> 00:53:45,835
No, I have stage three
ovarian cancer.

718
00:53:53,846 --> 00:53:56,912
Do you want to call time
on the whole competing thing?

719
00:53:59,921 --> 00:54:00,921
No, I do not.

720
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:12,994
Thank you.

721
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:31,820
Let's do it.

722
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:34,594
That's okay.
Is that right?

723
00:54:34,622 --> 00:54:35,902
- Yeah, it's fine.
- That's brilliant.

724
00:54:42,527 --> 00:54:44,098
All right.

725
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,344
Best of luck
out there, everyone.

726
00:54:47,301 --> 00:54:48,964
<i>♪ Darling, hold my hand ♪</i>

727
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:52,836
<i>♪ Oh, won't you
Hold my hand? ♪</i>

728
00:56:01,242 --> 00:56:02,444
Hi.

729
00:56:07,985 --> 00:56:09,744
Penny for your thoughts.

730
00:56:09,846 --> 00:56:12,520
- Hi. Hi.
- So.

731
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:16,996
I think I like this one

732
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,890
but I suspect I'm pretty easy
either way.

733
00:56:25,265 --> 00:56:26,633
Could I sleep on it?

734
00:56:28,035 --> 00:56:29,035
Yeah.

735
00:56:31,205 --> 00:56:32,408
Yeah, absolutely.

736
00:56:39,915 --> 00:56:40,915
What?

737
00:56:43,546 --> 00:56:44,750
What's going on?

738
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:48,556
Tired.

739
00:56:49,893 --> 00:56:50,893
Okay.

740
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:28,123
Okay. Huh, mmm-hmm.

741
00:57:43,345 --> 00:57:45,213
Oh, don't forget your, erm...

742
00:57:45,315 --> 00:57:46,977
Waterproof.

743
00:58:19,645 --> 00:58:21,316
- Hello.
<i>- It's us!</i>

744
00:58:21,418 --> 00:58:23,217
Hi!

745
00:58:23,319 --> 00:58:24,549
Okay, I'm gonna buzz you up.

746
00:58:24,651 --> 00:58:26,482
They're here.

747
00:58:26,584 --> 00:58:27,820
All right.

748
00:58:34,295 --> 00:58:35,864
- Mama!
- Hello!

749
00:58:36,995 --> 00:58:38,715
- I love that dress.
- Thank you.

750
00:58:38,797 --> 00:58:39,874
Kind of matches, actually.

751
00:58:39,898 --> 00:58:41,006
Sorry I haven't
brought you anything.

752
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,310
It's okay.
You brought me a baby.

753
00:58:42,398 --> 00:58:43,945
- I brought you a baby.
- Ben, how are you?

754
00:58:43,969 --> 00:58:45,251
Oh, sorry, babies.

755
00:58:45,275 --> 00:58:47,975
Babies want attention. Hi, hi.

756
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,783
- Unbelievable.
- Hi, loves. Come on in.

757
00:58:50,807 --> 00:58:51,976
- Wow!
- Thank you. Wow!

758
00:58:52,078 --> 00:58:53,952
- It goes back so far.
- I know, and I have a bath.

759
00:58:53,976 --> 00:58:55,347
- And a double bed.
- Ah, hi.

760
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:56,717
Go on.

761
00:58:56,819 --> 00:58:57,715
- You've never been here.
- Really, so grown-up.

762
00:58:57,716 --> 00:58:58,828
Have you? I've just realized.

763
00:58:58,851 --> 00:58:59,961
- It's so cool.
- No, I haven't. No.

764
00:58:59,985 --> 00:59:01,127
My goodness.
Look at the little...

765
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:03,455
Hi!
Sorry, didn't mean to, er...

766
00:59:03,557 --> 00:59:04,885
- Hi, I'm so sorry.
- Hi.

767
00:59:04,987 --> 00:59:06,027
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

768
00:59:06,123 --> 00:59:07,399
- I'm Almut's sister, Leah.
- I'm Reginald.

769
00:59:07,423 --> 00:59:08,837
- That's my dad, yeah.
- Lovely to meet you.

770
00:59:08,861 --> 00:59:10,037
Reginald,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

771
00:59:10,061 --> 00:59:11,170
- It smells amazing.
- Thank you.

772
00:59:11,194 --> 00:59:12,872
- Likewise.
- Hi, I'm Almut's brother,

773
00:59:12,896 --> 00:59:14,069
- Lucas.
- Welcome, welcome.

774
00:59:14,171 --> 00:59:15,297
Thank you, thank you.

775
00:59:15,399 --> 00:59:16,580
Well, it's not my home, but
I'm welcoming everyone anyway.

776
00:59:16,604 --> 00:59:17,470
Hey, I'm the other brother,
Ben.

777
00:59:17,472 --> 00:59:18,478
- Hi. Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

778
00:59:18,502 --> 00:59:19,604
You too.

779
00:59:19,706 --> 00:59:20,783
- Thanks for this.
- Oh, pleasure.

780
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:24,639
Bea said we had to go
to Salt Lake.

781
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,647
She said, "You'll love it,"
she says.

782
00:59:27,749 --> 00:59:30,784
And so... And so we're there
and it's winter.

783
00:59:31,419 --> 00:59:32,714
It's... It's snowing.

784
00:59:32,816 --> 00:59:35,654
It's beautiful and, erm,

785
00:59:35,756 --> 00:59:37,184
we decide to visit
the Tabernacle.

786
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:39,122
- I don't know if you know it.
- Oh, yeah.

787
00:59:39,224 --> 00:59:41,494
It's, erm...

788
00:59:41,596 --> 00:59:43,057
Well, I don't even
know how late

789
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:45,766
and, er,
we've watched the sun go down.

790
00:59:46,863 --> 00:59:48,670
And it's been the most...

791
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:51,134
You know,

792
00:59:51,236 --> 00:59:53,468
the most wonderful day
of our entire fucking lives.

793
00:59:54,743 --> 00:59:57,745
And I turned to her
and I said... I say...

794
00:59:59,583 --> 01:00:01,512
"Bea, don't know about you,

795
01:00:01,614 --> 01:00:03,012
"but I think this is how

796
01:00:03,114 --> 01:00:05,552
"I'd like to spend
the rest of my life."

797
01:00:05,654 --> 01:00:07,982
No ring, nothing, just...

798
01:00:08,084 --> 01:00:11,326
- Said it.
- And what did she say?

799
01:00:11,428 --> 01:00:13,093
"Don't be
so fucking sentimental."

800
01:00:16,459 --> 01:00:20,801
"I don't need a roomful of
people and a piece of paper

801
01:00:20,903 --> 01:00:23,302
"to know I want to spend
the rest of my life with you,"

802
01:00:23,404 --> 01:00:25,140
- she said.
- Yeah.

803
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:26,242
- Amen.
- Yeah.

804
01:00:26,337 --> 01:00:29,304
So when were you... When were
you all in Salt Lake?

805
01:00:30,279 --> 01:00:32,777
Erm, 15 years ago.

806
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,178
- Give or take.
- Business or pleasure?

807
01:00:38,818 --> 01:00:41,019
What? What's going on?

808
01:00:42,684 --> 01:00:45,654
I... I just happened to be in
a competition that year, so...

809
01:00:45,756 --> 01:00:46,920
Happened, just...

810
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:48,296
- Don't.
- Competition?

811
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:50,297
What sort of a competition?

812
01:00:50,399 --> 01:00:51,928
It was, erm...

813
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:53,932
I used to...
I used to figure-skate.

814
01:00:54,034 --> 01:00:57,899
Erm... ISU World
Championships.

815
01:00:58,001 --> 01:00:59,708
She was unbe-fucking-lievable.

816
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:01,686
I can't believe you haven't
told these guys this.

817
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:02,750
- Stop.
- It was, it was.

818
01:01:02,774 --> 01:01:03,974
- Check it out.
- No.

819
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,908
- Check it out.
- You have to see this,

820
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:07,254
- Reginald, it's...
- I'm speechless.

821
01:01:07,278 --> 01:01:08,691
- ...absolutely remarkable.
- Here she goes.

822
01:01:08,715 --> 01:01:10,185
Here she goes. Here she goes.

823
01:01:11,884 --> 01:01:13,027
Oh!

824
01:01:13,051 --> 01:01:14,948
- This is you?
- Yeah, watch this.

825
01:01:18,723 --> 01:01:19,723
Oh!

826
01:01:19,793 --> 01:01:21,113
Oh, my goodness me.

827
01:01:21,192 --> 01:01:23,426
Stop. Stop, stop.
Please. I said no.

828
01:01:23,529 --> 01:01:24,929
I said no.

829
01:01:25,032 --> 01:01:27,032
- You should be proud.
- Yeah, bloody marvelous.

830
01:01:28,505 --> 01:01:29,585
Thanks, mom.

831
01:01:32,241 --> 01:01:33,707
Yeah.

832
01:01:33,809 --> 01:01:35,942
Wine. Anyone for any wine?

833
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:40,709
You know
it isn't even just you?

834
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:45,314
Like, honest to God,
no one knows about it.

835
01:01:54,926 --> 01:01:56,127
Thank you.

836
01:01:59,635 --> 01:02:01,968
It was Dad
who got me into skating.

837
01:02:05,106 --> 01:02:07,266
I think he actually really
wanted a sporty child and...

838
01:02:07,303 --> 01:02:10,075
And I suppose
I was his last chance.

839
01:02:11,445 --> 01:02:12,946
And I guess...

840
01:02:13,614 --> 01:02:15,111
He was right to push me

841
01:02:15,213 --> 01:02:18,881
because it turned out
I fucking loved it

842
01:02:18,983 --> 01:02:20,987
and I was really good at it.

843
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:26,657
And in the beginning,
he would drive me to Swindon

844
01:02:26,759 --> 01:02:28,929
virtually every weekend.

845
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,897
Hmm.

846
01:02:30,999 --> 01:02:34,330
And then when he was ill,
when he was sick, I...

847
01:02:35,802 --> 01:02:38,906
I wanted to help out and...

848
01:02:40,169 --> 01:02:43,405
I took some time off from it.

849
01:02:46,579 --> 01:02:47,579
And then...

850
01:02:51,782 --> 01:02:54,889
After that,

851
01:02:55,957 --> 01:03:00,092
skating without him around
was just joyless.

852
01:03:00,792 --> 01:03:02,226
So you just stopped?

853
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,298
I think it just really
reminded me of him.

854
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:18,173
You okay?

855
01:03:18,275 --> 01:03:20,442
- What?
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

856
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,445
Okay.

857
01:03:24,618 --> 01:03:26,585
Whoa, whoa. Okay.

858
01:03:26,687 --> 01:03:28,116
I'm cautiously optimistic

859
01:03:28,218 --> 01:03:30,152
we're dealing with
an infection.

860
01:03:30,254 --> 01:03:31,987
But, listen,
once the fluid is out,

861
01:03:32,089 --> 01:03:33,257
we're gonna run some tests,

862
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:35,660
and if we find anything,
you'll be the first to know.

863
01:03:35,762 --> 01:03:37,261
- Okay.
- In the meantime,

864
01:03:37,363 --> 01:03:39,072
I'd like to get you started
with some antibiotics,

865
01:03:39,096 --> 01:03:40,430
just to help with the pain.

866
01:03:40,999 --> 01:03:42,074
- All right?
- Mmm-hmm.

867
01:03:42,098 --> 01:03:43,470
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

868
01:03:43,572 --> 01:03:44,834
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

869
01:04:02,222 --> 01:04:04,453
<i>Tobias, I had a call
from the hospital.</i>

870
01:04:07,063 --> 01:04:09,458
They called to see if I could
come in, and so I did.

871
01:04:09,892 --> 01:04:11,097
Speaking.

872
01:04:14,803 --> 01:04:16,432
They said
it wasn't an infection.

873
01:04:16,966 --> 01:04:18,170
What is it?

874
01:04:21,806 --> 01:04:23,343
What is it?

875
01:04:23,445 --> 01:04:24,445
I've made notes.

876
01:04:25,181 --> 01:04:26,181
Erm,

877
01:04:27,748 --> 01:04:30,116
they are recommending

878
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:35,649
either a partial
or a full-blown hysterectomy.

879
01:04:47,763 --> 01:04:51,203
Your note-taking is incredibly
thorough, by the way.

880
01:04:52,642 --> 01:04:54,173
Every cloud...

881
01:04:56,406 --> 01:04:58,074
All right,
so let me just check, I...

882
01:04:58,176 --> 01:05:00,748
- Mmm-hmm.
- Option One would be...

883
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:02,676
If we ever want
to conceive naturally...

884
01:05:03,684 --> 01:05:04,848
Freeze embryos.

885
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:06,917
Mmm.

886
01:05:07,019 --> 01:05:09,085
- Followed by...
- Surgery.

887
01:05:09,187 --> 01:05:10,988
So removing one ovary,
not both.

888
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:12,789
- Followed by...
- Chemo. Shit.

889
01:05:12,891 --> 01:05:14,193
Shit ton of chemo.

890
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:16,256
- Followed by...
- Shagging.

891
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:18,193
Or, well, yeah, whatever. IVF.

892
01:05:18,295 --> 01:05:20,762
Oh, I...
I vote shagging, but okay.

893
01:05:23,302 --> 01:05:26,908
Alternatively, Option Two.

894
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:30,011
Way more invasive
but way lower risk of relapse.

895
01:05:30,913 --> 01:05:32,908
Ovaries and uterus,
they take it.

896
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:34,213
They take it all.

897
01:05:34,879 --> 01:05:36,050
Okay.

898
01:05:37,485 --> 01:05:38,485
Okay.

899
01:05:41,223 --> 01:05:42,461
- I think...
- Listen... Oh, sorry.

900
01:05:42,485 --> 01:05:44,687
- No. Do you want...
- No. No, you.

901
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:45,994
Okay.

902
01:05:48,761 --> 01:05:49,965
I guess...

903
01:05:51,229 --> 01:05:53,397
I think,
unless you think I'm...

904
01:05:54,836 --> 01:05:57,637
Insane, I think I am inclined

905
01:05:57,739 --> 01:06:01,108
to say that I would...

906
01:06:03,574 --> 01:06:06,278
I would like to hang on
to at least one of my...

907
01:06:07,609 --> 01:06:11,679
Fucking addled
cancer-ridden ovaries.

908
01:06:16,921 --> 01:06:19,656
Because, well...

909
01:06:20,425 --> 01:06:23,058
Just because I never,
in a general sense,

910
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,528
saw myself having kids,

911
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,331
doesn't mean
that there isn't a world

912
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:33,437
where I couldn't see myself,
in time,

913
01:06:35,438 --> 01:06:37,738
deciding to have them
with you.

914
01:07:18,687 --> 01:07:20,121
I'm in remission.

915
01:07:28,692 --> 01:07:30,465
<i>We should do something
to celebrate.</i>

916
01:07:33,462 --> 01:07:35,832
Come on! Come on!

917
01:07:40,704 --> 01:07:42,770
- ...the throne or something.
- What?

918
01:07:45,106 --> 01:07:46,106
No.

919
01:07:47,717 --> 01:07:49,315
That serves you right.

920
01:07:51,549 --> 01:07:54,017
- Everything's great!
- Everything's fine.

921
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:09,636
Wait, wait,
wait, wait!

922
01:08:42,003 --> 01:08:44,403
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

923
01:09:58,643 --> 01:10:00,581
<i>Breathe in.</i>

924
01:10:03,117 --> 01:10:04,684
<i>Breathe out.</i>

925
01:10:06,821 --> 01:10:07,821
Ooh.

926
01:10:07,884 --> 01:10:10,724
<i>Breathe in.</i>

927
01:10:14,092 --> 01:10:15,092
One second.

928
01:10:30,076 --> 01:10:31,906
Oh, fuck me.

929
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:38,146
<i>Feeling relaxed and calm.</i>

930
01:10:40,788 --> 01:10:41,788
Almut?

931
01:10:43,726 --> 01:10:45,821
Al? Almut?

932
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:10,714
Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

933
01:11:22,598 --> 01:11:23,793
Oh.

934
01:11:27,202 --> 01:11:29,666
I'm gonna get a drink.

935
01:11:29,768 --> 01:11:31,865
That is...
Yes, £20 with the fuel.

936
01:11:31,967 --> 01:11:34,003
Thank you. Cheers.

937
01:11:34,106 --> 01:11:35,310
Thank you.

938
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:39,043
Hiya.

939
01:11:39,112 --> 01:11:40,975
Oh, shit.

940
01:11:42,579 --> 01:11:44,549
- Sorry. Thank you.
- Hiya.

941
01:11:44,651 --> 01:11:46,296
- Hi, how are you?
- Yeah, good, thank you.

942
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,356
- There you go. Any fuel?
- Er, no.

943
01:11:53,256 --> 01:11:54,494
Sorry.

944
01:11:56,863 --> 01:11:57,963
Al?

945
01:12:00,296 --> 01:12:02,436
Al? Al?

946
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,100
Sorry. One second, sorry.

947
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:13,477
Al?

948
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,816
- Mmm-hmm?
- Hi. Everything okay?

949
01:12:15,918 --> 01:12:18,315
Hmm. Kind of.

950
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:21,587
- What?
- Erm...

951
01:12:21,689 --> 01:12:24,022
Well, you see, I thought...
I thought I needed a poo.

952
01:12:24,124 --> 01:12:26,290
- Yeah.
- And, er,

953
01:12:26,393 --> 01:12:28,689
- now that I'm in here...
- Yeah?

954
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:30,160
...I think
I might need to push.

955
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:31,863
No. No, no. No, no.

956
01:12:31,965 --> 01:12:32,999
No! Okay?

957
01:12:33,101 --> 01:12:35,202
Sorry, but you can't push.

958
01:12:35,304 --> 01:12:37,338
If you let me in, I can...
I can help.

959
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,768
We have biscuits now, Al.
We have biscuits, okay?

960
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:42,440
- Okay.
- Okay, come on. Let me in.

961
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:43,816
Oh, no, I can't.

962
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,909
What? Just un...
Unlock it and open it.

963
01:12:46,011 --> 01:12:48,509
I can't. It's not happening.
It's not... It's not working.

964
01:12:48,611 --> 01:12:50,748
Wait.

965
01:12:51,549 --> 01:12:52,813
Sorry. I'm sorry. My, erm...

966
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:54,487
My partner is stuck
in the, erm...

967
01:12:54,589 --> 01:12:56,583
Do you have the... For the...
The key for the...

968
01:12:56,685 --> 01:12:58,353
- Yeah.
- So sorry, er...

969
01:12:59,724 --> 01:13:01,134
- Thank you.
- Hey, Jane, I'll just...

970
01:13:01,158 --> 01:13:03,924
Okay, Al, we have the key.
We have the key, don't worry.

971
01:13:04,027 --> 01:13:05,377
It's okay. Sorry about this.

972
01:13:05,401 --> 01:13:06,745
- No, no, it's fine.
- Thank you very much.

973
01:13:06,769 --> 01:13:08,367
Okay.

974
01:13:08,469 --> 01:13:09,789
Okay, just...
Just don't push, Al.

975
01:13:09,832 --> 01:13:11,049
Whatever you do,
just don't pu...

976
01:13:15,871 --> 01:13:19,812
Erm, it's just...
Got broken off.

977
01:13:19,914 --> 01:13:21,047
Erm...

978
01:13:21,149 --> 01:13:22,546
- So, Al?
- Yeah?

979
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,483
I'm gonna need you
to stand back, okay?

980
01:13:24,585 --> 01:13:25,893
- What?
- Standing... Standing back

981
01:13:25,917 --> 01:13:27,631
- away from the door.
- Wait, wait, wait. Why?

982
01:13:27,655 --> 01:13:29,399
All the way back.
Right the way back. All right?

983
01:13:29,423 --> 01:13:30,633
- Why?
- I'm so, so sorry.

984
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:32,990
I think she might be
about to give birth.

985
01:13:38,133 --> 01:13:39,259
- Yeah, erm...
- Maybe...

986
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:41,444
I'll... I'll... I'm gonna get
Jane, 'cause she'll know...

987
01:13:41,468 --> 01:13:43,436
Okay, get Jane.
Jane? Jane?

988
01:13:43,538 --> 01:13:45,367
Jane, pregnant lady
stuck in the khazi.

989
01:13:47,176 --> 01:13:49,174
- Just bear with me.
- Fine.

990
01:13:49,276 --> 01:13:50,775
The key snapped in the...

991
01:13:52,147 --> 01:13:53,914
- How many weeks?
- Forty.

992
01:13:54,016 --> 01:13:56,014
Huh. Mazel tov.

993
01:14:03,226 --> 01:14:04,784
Okay.

994
01:14:06,755 --> 01:14:08,195
Keep standing back, Al.

995
01:14:08,297 --> 01:14:09,824
- Shall I have a go?
- Yeah, yeah.

996
01:14:09,926 --> 01:14:11,562
No, it's not. Nah.

997
01:14:11,664 --> 01:14:14,933
Okay. Okay, Al,
still standing back?

998
01:14:15,035 --> 01:14:16,365
Okay?

999
01:14:24,444 --> 01:14:27,347
- Hi.
- I can't. I'm sorry.

1000
01:14:27,449 --> 01:14:28,489
What...
What do you mean, you can't?

1001
01:14:28,513 --> 01:14:29,982
Move. I can't. I'm sorry.

1002
01:14:30,084 --> 01:14:31,546
I can feel it.

1003
01:14:31,648 --> 01:14:33,319
- No.
- Mmm.

1004
01:14:33,421 --> 01:14:34,981
- No, I know, but we can't.
- Mmm.

1005
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:36,887
We have to... We don't...
Not... Not here.

1006
01:14:36,989 --> 01:14:38,701
- We... We don't... It's not...
- Mmm, listen to me.

1007
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:40,001
- It's not safe.
- It's just coming. It is.

1008
01:14:40,025 --> 01:14:41,733
It is. It's coming.
I can feel it. I can feel it.

1009
01:14:41,757 --> 01:14:43,429
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1010
01:14:43,531 --> 01:14:45,560
I'm sorry but I... It's...
This is...

1011
01:14:45,662 --> 01:14:48,134
It's it. It's it. It's it.

1012
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:55,471
Yeah, it seems like we have

1013
01:14:55,573 --> 01:14:56,970
almost everything we need.

1014
01:14:57,072 --> 01:14:58,642
Except for a midwife.

1015
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,706
- Except for a midwife.
- Yeah.

1016
01:15:02,349 --> 01:15:04,211
Ooh. Ah. Ah.

1017
01:15:04,313 --> 01:15:05,961
<i>Is that a push I hear there?</i>

1018
01:15:05,985 --> 01:15:07,892
Yeah, I think this might...
This might be a push.

1019
01:15:07,916 --> 01:15:08,960
- Do you wanna push?
- Yeah.

1020
01:15:08,984 --> 01:15:10,657
- Yes, she wants to push.
- Yeah.

1021
01:15:10,759 --> 01:15:12,234
Watch your head. Watch
your head. Watch your head.

1022
01:15:13,255 --> 01:15:14,907
Understood, yeah.
She... She... She can push.

1023
01:15:17,994 --> 01:15:19,632
Al, Al, I'm gonna have
to check again

1024
01:15:19,734 --> 01:15:21,514
to see if I can see any
body parts. Is that okay?

1025
01:15:21,538 --> 01:15:23,338
I'm not exactly in a position
to say no, am I?

1026
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:24,935
Okay.

1027
01:15:28,204 --> 01:15:30,377
- Yes, I can see the head.
- Wait, what?

1028
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:32,478
- What? Tobias?
- Shh. Erm... Sorry.

1029
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:33,890
- Wait, no, I'm sorry, no.
- Tobias? Tobias?

1030
01:15:33,914 --> 01:15:35,394
Sorry, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1031
01:15:35,418 --> 01:15:36,460
Okay, listen to me.
You've got this.

1032
01:15:36,484 --> 01:15:37,561
- A head?
- Sorry, sorry.

1033
01:15:37,585 --> 01:15:38,795
I'm gonna put you on
speakerphone.

1034
01:15:38,819 --> 01:15:39,960
Hold on one second.
Can you, can you, can you...

1035
01:15:39,984 --> 01:15:41,160
- Dig deep, babe.
- I got it.

1036
01:15:41,184 --> 01:15:42,501
- Thank you. Sorry, still here.
<i>- Hello?</i>

1037
01:15:42,525 --> 01:15:43,835
Can you say
that last bit again, please?

1038

<i>With each contraction,

01:16:30,365 --> 01:16:31,879
<i>...the front door is unlocked
and open?</i>

1069
01:16:31,903 --> 01:16:33,383
Yeah. It's a...
It's a petrol station.

1070
01:16:33,435 --> 01:16:35,735
Yeah, it's a petrol station.
You just walk straight in.

1071
01:16:37,975 --> 01:16:39,776
Ooh, I can feel it,
I can feel it.

1072
01:16:39,878 --> 01:16:40,954
The head, it's coming.
It's coming.

1073
01:16:40,978 --> 01:16:43,679
Okay, here we go.

1074
01:16:43,782 --> 01:16:45,480
Here we go.

1075
01:16:45,582 --> 01:16:46,913
Whoa-ho!

1076
01:16:47,015 --> 01:16:48,355
Lean into me. That's it.

1077
01:16:48,457 --> 01:16:49,566
There's a face!
There's a face!

1078
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:50,790
There's a face!
I mean, a head.

1079
01:16:50,887 --> 01:16:52,259
There's a head! It's great.

1080
01:16:52,361 --> 01:16:53,470
Head's out.

1081
01:16:53,494 --> 01:16:54,694
- Oh, my God!
- You're amazing.

1082
01:16:54,763 --> 01:16:56,071
Yeah, she's doing great.
She is. She's doing great.

1083
01:16:56,095 --> 01:16:58,002
You're doing great.
You're doing so fucking great!

1084
01:16:58,026 --> 01:17:00,631
Oh, my God!

1085
01:17:00,733 --> 01:17:01,810
All right, yes!

1086
01:17:01,834 --> 01:17:03,800
Got the shoulders.
Shoulders are out.

1087
01:17:03,902 --> 01:17:05,667
That's it.

1088
01:17:05,769 --> 01:17:07,001
Yes. That's it. That's it.

1089
01:17:07,103 --> 01:17:09,237
Ah. Oh. She's out.

1090
01:17:09,339 --> 01:17:11,250
- Yes, yes! You did it!
- Oh! Oh, my God. She is?

1091
01:17:11,274 --> 01:17:13,613
<i>That's great.
That's fantastic.</i>

1092
01:17:13,715 --> 01:17:15,314
<i>Is baby crying, Dad?
Is baby breathing?</i>

1093
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:16,416
Both.

1094
01:17:16,483 --> 01:17:17,844
- Both.
- We did it!

1095
01:17:17,946 --> 01:17:19,317
- We did it!
- Wow!

1096
01:17:19,419 --> 01:17:20,655
You are incredible.

1097
01:17:20,757 --> 01:17:23,085
<i>What I need you to do now,
is get a clean towel</i>

1098
01:17:23,187 --> 01:17:25,723
<i>and gently wipe
and dry baby off, okay, Dad?</i>

1099
01:17:25,825 --> 01:17:27,626
- Yeah. Yeah.
<i>- Nose and mouth first.</i>

1100
01:17:27,728 --> 01:17:29,003
<i>- All right?</i>
- She's gorgeous.

1101
01:17:29,027 --> 01:17:30,729
- Yeah, okay.
- She's gorgeous.

1102
01:17:30,832 --> 01:17:32,896
- Can I see her?
- Yeah, she's coming.

1103
01:17:32,998 --> 01:17:34,107
Can you put that towel
underneath for me?

1104
01:17:34,131 --> 01:17:35,440
Can I see her?
I have to see her.

1105
01:17:35,464 --> 01:17:36,812
- She's coming. She's coming.
- Oh, my God. There she is.

1106
01:17:36,836 --> 01:17:38,539
Thank you, Sanjaya.

1107
01:17:38,641 --> 01:17:40,503
- Hi.
- That's your mommy.

1108
01:17:40,605 --> 01:17:41,941
That's your mommy.

1109
01:17:42,043 --> 01:17:44,441
<i>I can hear her. You did say
"her", didn't you, "she"?</i>

1110
01:17:44,543 --> 01:17:46,080
Her. She.

1111
01:17:46,182 --> 01:17:48,007
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1112
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:49,877
<i>Congratulations, Mom and Dad.</i>

1113
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:51,881
<i>Now, I need you to make sure</i>

1114
01:17:51,983 --> 01:17:53,721
<i>baby is wrapped in a towel,
okay?</i>

1115
01:17:53,823 --> 01:17:55,529
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
<i>- Can you do that for me, Dad?</i>

1116
01:17:55,553 --> 01:17:56,556
Ah.

1117
01:17:56,658 --> 01:17:57,968
<i>Without pulling the cord
too tight,</i>

1118
01:17:57,992 --> 01:18:00,159
<i>I want you to put baby
in mom's arms, all right?</i>

1119
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:01,123
Al, Al, Al.

1120
01:18:01,124 --> 01:18:02,662
<i>And I'm gonna need you
to make sure</i>

1121
01:18:02,764 --> 01:18:04,726
<i>that mom and baby
are kept warm, okay?</i>

1122
01:18:04,828 --> 01:18:06,025
- Yeah.
- Hi.

1123
01:18:06,128 --> 01:18:07,629
- I've got you.
- Yeah.

1124
01:18:07,731 --> 01:18:09,763
Oh, my God. Hi!

1125
01:18:09,865 --> 01:18:12,468
Oh, she's beautiful!

1126
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:13,966
Thanks, Jane.

1127
01:18:14,068 --> 01:18:15,342
Shh.

1128
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:16,844
<i>Dad, I've got some good news.</i>

1129
01:18:16,946 --> 01:18:19,540
<i>Ambulance should be with you
any minute now, all right?</i>

1130
01:18:19,642 --> 01:18:21,080
Okay.

1131
01:18:21,182 --> 01:18:22,690
<i>In the meantime, contractions
might start up again, okay...</i>

1132
01:18:22,714 --> 01:18:23,849
Do you want the... Yeah.

1133
01:18:23,951 --> 01:18:25,393
<i>...because mom's got
to deliver the placenta,</i>

1134
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:28,486
<i>so I'm going to need you to
try and keep her nice and calm</i>

1135
01:18:28,588 --> 01:18:29,588
<i>- and warm. Okay?</i>
- Yeah.

1136
01:18:29,687 --> 01:18:30,689
Okay, I can do that.

1137
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:34,260
Yeah.

1138
01:18:55,747 --> 01:18:57,513
Happy New Year.

1139
01:19:01,657 --> 01:19:04,121
<i>...Happy New Year...</i>

1140
01:19:06,793 --> 01:19:08,393
Happy New Year.

1141
01:19:08,495 --> 01:19:09,764
Happy New Year.

1142
01:19:24,574 --> 01:19:28,145
Not only have we been
unable to shrink the tumor,

1143
01:19:28,247 --> 01:19:31,951
but in fact the disease
seems to have metastasised.

1144
01:19:33,048 --> 01:19:34,787
Which means, I'm afraid,

1145
01:19:34,889 --> 01:19:37,154
we're still not in a position
to operate.

1146
01:19:39,159 --> 01:19:42,696
But there are plenty of
reasons to remain positive.

1147
01:19:42,799 --> 01:19:45,625
Other treatment options
are still available.

1148
01:19:45,727 --> 01:19:49,934
Failure first time around has
almost no bearing whatsoever

1149
01:19:50,036 --> 01:19:52,268
on the likelihood
of second-line success.

1150
01:20:00,679 --> 01:20:01,882
It's fine. I'm fine.

1151
01:20:05,818 --> 01:20:07,847
I'm okay. It's okay, honestly.

1152
01:20:07,949 --> 01:20:09,153
Yeah.

1153
01:20:10,954 --> 01:20:13,025
It's okay not to be okay.

1154
01:20:15,363 --> 01:20:16,363
It's a lot.

1155
01:20:17,326 --> 01:20:19,427
You've been through a lot,
both of you.

1156
01:20:25,707 --> 01:20:27,803
Gosh. Christ.

1157
01:20:27,905 --> 01:20:30,143
Sorry.

1158
01:20:35,785 --> 01:20:38,212
Oh, my God. Are you sure?

1159
01:20:38,314 --> 01:20:40,879
Not exactly haute cuisine.

1160
01:20:40,982 --> 01:20:42,048
Thank you.

1161
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:45,288
Oh. Thanks.

1162
01:20:47,255 --> 01:20:48,896
What did you go for?

1163
01:20:50,398 --> 01:20:51,927
Twix.

1164
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:53,664
- Nice.
- Yeah.

1165
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:56,101
- What about you?
- Bounty.

1166
01:20:59,739 --> 01:21:02,976
When in Rome.

1167
01:21:20,594 --> 01:21:21,962
Meant to ask, erm...

1168
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:25,761
I have a feeling my 4:00
is gonna overrun.

1169
01:21:25,863 --> 01:21:27,264
I don't suppose

1170
01:21:27,366 --> 01:21:29,570
there's any chance you might
be able to do pick-up?

1171
01:21:29,672 --> 01:21:31,037
Erm, only if
you have the time.

1172
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:35,404
- Definitely.
- Thank you. That'd be great.

1173
01:21:37,576 --> 01:21:38,638
Pleasure.

1174
01:21:57,228 --> 01:21:59,431
Okay, so that is
15 minutes over.

1175
01:21:59,533 --> 01:22:00,533
Fuck.

1176
01:22:13,777 --> 01:22:15,015
Sixteen.

1177
01:22:15,948 --> 01:22:18,046
Fuck, fuck. It's fucked. Stop.

1178
01:22:18,148 --> 01:22:19,308
It's fucked. It's... We're...

1179
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:20,865
We're still far
too fucking slow on the prep.

1180
01:22:20,889 --> 01:22:22,199
And this whole
sous vide situation

1181
01:22:22,223 --> 01:22:23,995
- is fucking killing us!
- All right. All right. Easy.

1182
01:22:24,019 --> 01:22:25,021
Let's take five.

1183
01:22:25,123 --> 01:22:26,323
No, I don't wanna
take a break.

1184
01:22:26,425 --> 01:22:27,865
I don't wanna take five.
I wanna go back to the start.

1185
01:22:27,889 --> 01:22:29,974
I need to look at the plans.
I need to look at the timings.

1186
01:22:29,998 --> 01:22:31,558
I need to figure this shit
the fuck out.

1187
01:22:32,028 --> 01:22:34,001
Sick of this shit!

1188
01:22:41,709 --> 01:22:43,943
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1189
01:22:44,046 --> 01:22:45,676
<i>Yeah, you're right.
Let's take a break.</i>

1190
01:22:45,778 --> 01:22:46,876
<i>Let's take five.</i>

1191
01:23:46,135 --> 01:23:47,305
Right, what's next?

1192
01:23:48,138 --> 01:23:49,840
- Octopus?
- Yep.

1193
01:24:10,492 --> 01:24:11,732
Where the hell were you?

1194
01:24:15,671 --> 01:24:16,531
You said you were gonna

1195
01:24:16,532 --> 01:24:18,092
- do pick-up.
- I was in the restaurant.

1196
01:24:21,203 --> 01:24:23,374
- Oh, my God.
- No.

1197
01:24:23,476 --> 01:24:25,704
You weren't in the restaurant,
cos I spoke to Skye.

1198
01:24:25,807 --> 01:24:27,291
She didn't know where the hell
you were either.

1199
01:24:27,315 --> 01:24:29,155
Was everything okay
with the... With the pick-up?

1200
01:24:29,179 --> 01:24:30,447
No, not particularly.

1201
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:34,550
Jesus.

1202
01:24:37,424 --> 01:24:39,585
I was this close to calling
round A&E departments.

1203
01:24:39,687 --> 01:24:41,524
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

1204
01:24:46,468 --> 01:24:47,468
Erm...

1205
01:24:55,703 --> 01:24:58,376
I'm in training
for the Bocuse d'Or.

1206
01:25:05,486 --> 01:25:06,486
Hmm.

1207
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:09,993
- Beg your pardon?
- Not... Not the final.

1208
01:25:10,054 --> 01:25:11,054
Just the Euros.

1209
01:25:11,123 --> 01:25:13,754
We, erm... We won the UK heat.

1210
01:25:15,024 --> 01:25:16,830
How long?

1211
01:25:16,932 --> 01:25:18,726
- Huh?
- How long have you been

1212
01:25:18,828 --> 01:25:21,099
prioritising fucking cooking
instead of getting better?

1213
01:25:21,201 --> 01:25:23,103
Er, the UK heat
was back in October

1214
01:25:23,205 --> 01:25:26,006
and the, er, Euro qualifiers
are coming up soon.

1215
01:25:26,108 --> 01:25:28,806
Do... Do the hospital know?
Did they, erm...

1216
01:25:28,908 --> 01:25:31,442
Did you... Please.

1217
01:25:33,079 --> 01:25:34,156
Please. Please tell me that...

1218
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:36,214
That they, erm,
and that you...

1219
01:25:36,316 --> 01:25:38,180
What difference does it make
if they know?

1220
01:25:38,282 --> 01:25:41,815
Oh, grow up, will you, Almut?

1221
01:25:42,954 --> 01:25:44,554
You have cancer.

1222
01:25:45,452 --> 01:25:46,519
You have cancer, Al.

1223
01:25:46,621 --> 01:25:49,127
No, you grow up,
you fucking dick.

1224
01:25:49,229 --> 01:25:52,525
The difference
this could make is...

1225
01:25:52,627 --> 01:25:55,202
It's vast.

1226
01:25:56,103 --> 01:25:57,864
Why?
Why are you taking the risk?

1227
01:25:59,207 --> 01:26:02,008
- Isn't it obvious?
- No, actually, it's not.

1228
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:03,384
- Not to me.
- I'm... I'm not exactly

1229
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:06,146
gonna get the chance again,
am I?

1230
01:26:06,248 --> 01:26:08,059
What is that supposed to mean?
In what reality...

1231
01:26:08,083 --> 01:26:10,148
It means I'm not
particularly interested

1232
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,144
in dying with fuck all
to show for it.

1233
01:26:12,246 --> 01:26:15,286
Oh, okay.

1234
01:26:15,388 --> 01:26:17,418
So we're not...
We're not enough for you?

1235
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,660
Is that...
Is that what it is?

1236
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:22,963
Award-winning chef

1237
01:26:23,065 --> 01:26:25,657
cum-former
figure-skating nutcase...

1238
01:26:25,759 --> 01:26:27,228
No, now
you're just being mean.

1239
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:29,168
No, no, no. No, I'm not.

1240
01:26:29,271 --> 01:26:31,107
I'm... I'm honestly...
I'm trying to understand

1241
01:26:31,131 --> 01:26:36,374
what it is that motivates
an otherwise perfectly sane...

1242
01:26:36,476 --> 01:26:39,210
Of course you factor
into my thinking, you fuck!

1243
01:26:39,312 --> 01:26:40,843
Okay, so, then,
I don't understand.

1244
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:42,048
I'm sorry.

1245
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:43,457
But, I really...
Honest to God, I don't.

1246
01:26:43,481 --> 01:26:45,649
Maybe... I mean, Jesus!

1247
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:47,684
I mean,
did it ever occur to you

1248
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:50,752
that maybe I don't wanna just
be someone's dead fucking mom?

1249
01:26:54,329 --> 01:26:56,324
I mean, at this point
nothing terrifies me more

1250
01:26:56,426 --> 01:26:58,098
than the thought of having her

1251
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,266
having nothing whatsoever
to remember me by.

1252
01:27:01,369 --> 01:27:03,103
And it's like there's this...
This bit of me

1253
01:27:03,205 --> 01:27:05,069
that is fucking desperate
for her to know

1254
01:27:05,171 --> 01:27:06,504
that I didn't just give up.

1255
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:09,837
And wouldn't it be
quite the thing

1256
01:27:09,939 --> 01:27:13,078
if maybe one day she decided
to look back on this time,

1257
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:14,808
she actually chose
to look back

1258
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:18,752
on this entire godforsaken
episode and thought,

1259
01:27:18,854 --> 01:27:21,182
"Wow, that's my mom"?

1260
01:27:26,189 --> 01:27:27,360
I don't...

1261
01:27:28,856 --> 01:27:31,592
I don't want my relationship
with Ella

1262
01:27:31,694 --> 01:27:34,932
to be solely defined
by my decline.

1263
01:27:51,383 --> 01:27:52,812
Or maybe
I actually just can't bear

1264
01:27:52,914 --> 01:27:54,915
the thought
of being forgotten.

1265
01:27:57,454 --> 01:27:58,985
I'm not sure which is worse.

1266
01:28:15,903 --> 01:28:18,744
Wanting us to remember
your achievements

1267
01:28:18,846 --> 01:28:19,846
is one thing.

1268
01:28:21,812 --> 01:28:24,450
Wanting us to somehow remember
your achievements

1269
01:28:24,552 --> 01:28:26,551
that we have absolutely
no fucking knowledge of...

1270
01:28:26,653 --> 01:28:29,188
Okay, I get it, I fucked up.
I fucked up. Please stop.

1271
01:28:29,290 --> 01:28:31,457
Please.
Please stop going on about it.

1272
01:28:39,163 --> 01:28:40,334
When is it?

1273
01:28:43,036 --> 01:28:44,797
The thing?

1274
01:28:44,899 --> 01:28:47,869
The European qualifying,
what... Whatever?

1275
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,412
June.

1276
01:28:53,407 --> 01:28:54,612
June?

1277
01:29:01,922 --> 01:29:03,951
June the, erm...

1278
01:29:05,621 --> 01:29:07,394
It's the 5th and 6th of June.

1279
01:29:13,835 --> 01:29:16,633
Oh, right.

1280
01:29:16,735 --> 01:29:19,637
I'm so sorry, Tobias.

1281
01:29:21,272 --> 01:29:23,272
I am.

1282
01:32:11,772 --> 01:32:13,140
Aerodynamic, innit?

1283
01:32:32,262 --> 01:32:34,407
Chef, I think
I might be about to throw up.

1284
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:39,203
Oh, shit. Erm, do you...
Do you have a buck...

1285
01:32:39,305 --> 01:32:40,265
Can I have a bucket?

1286
01:32:40,267 --> 01:32:42,609
Like a cup, or...

1287
01:32:43,609 --> 01:32:44,647
Okay, there you go.

1288
01:32:48,609 --> 01:32:50,584

Five.

1367

Okay, do you remember

1372
01:42:07,138 --> 01:42:09,341
the best way to crack an egg?

1373
01:42:09,944 --> 01:42:11,606
Always on a flat surface, yeah?

1374
01:42:13,475 --> 01:42:15,247

- And then in there.

1375
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,621

Stop.

1381
