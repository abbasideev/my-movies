00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,000
Elisabeth!

2
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,208
- We love you!
- We love you, Elisabeth!

3
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,916
- Please!
- Over here!

4
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:57,625
Oh my God, we love you!

5
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,667
I love her.

6
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,125
Sparkle!

7
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,000
...my favourite.

8
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,624
Wanna get something to eat?

9
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,833
Yeah, I'll get a pretzel,
or something.

10
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,250
- Remember her?
- She was in that movie... Uh!

11
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,458
We're gonna have to let her
know we're gonna be late.

12
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,208
Yeah, I'll give her a text.

13
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:33,083
He owes me 20 bucks.

14
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,018
Get out the way!

15
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,167
<i>Vamos</i>!

16
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,292
Shit!

17
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:27,417
You got it!

18
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,542
Feel that power, ladies!

19
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,042
And march! Get those knees up.

20
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,208
You got it!

21
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,250
Come on!

22
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:40,875
Front.

23
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:42,208
Kick!

24
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:43,958
Kick!

25
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:46,042
Oh yeah, you got it!

26
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,042
Square.

27
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,917
Think about those bikini bods.

28
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,875
You wanna look
like a giant jellyfish on the beach?

29
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:54,667
Come on.

30
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:56,417
Cross.

31
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,208
Push.

32
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:01,125
Kick! Come on, you got it!

33
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,542
Hang in there, ladies, you've got it.

34
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,708
You've got it!

35
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,833
Whoo!

36
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,667
Great workout, ladies.

37
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,875
Alright, I hope I see you next week
for <i>Sparkle Your Life</i>.

38
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:19,583
We're gonna work on the lateral abs,

39
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,042
you know,
the most difficult part to sculpt.

40
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,625
But in the meantime,

41
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:25,375
take care of yourself.

42
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:31,583
Move it back, position one.

43
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,000
Great job, ladies.

44
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,666
You got it.

45
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,707
Alright,
get these lights down for me.

46
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:56,875
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, thank you.

47
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,083
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you.

48
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,583
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

49
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't care if we have to see every
fucking young girl in this fucking town

50
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:30,375
in the next few weeks!

51
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:32,333
Look,

52
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:33,708
I'll make it simple.

53
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:35,583
We need her young.

54
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,708
We need her hot.

55
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,542
We need her now.

56
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:43,417
How the old bitch has been able
to stick around for this long,

57
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:45,625
that's the fucking mystery to me.

58
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,707
Oh, Oscar winner my ass.

59
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,666
When was that? Back in the 30s,

60
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,625
what, for <i>King Kong</i>?

61
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,917
<i>- ...promised her...</i>
- No.

62
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,417
I don't give a fuck
what we promised her!

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,708
This is network TV,
not a fucking charity.

64
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,042
Find me somebody new!

65
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:10,207
Now!

66
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:16,875
Hey, did you know that a woman's fertility
starts to decrease about the age of 25?

67
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,708
How old is Jennifer?

68
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,042
You better get busy!

69
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,583
<i>It's like when you see
someone fart on screen.</i>

70
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,792
People just love that.

71
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:09,542
I mean, that's just the way it is.

72
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:12,541
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

73
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,082
People are just people.

74
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,750
And I have to give people
what they want.

75
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,083
That's what keeps the shareholders happy.

76
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,917
And people always ask
for something new.

77
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,833
Renewal

78
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:27,958
is inevitable.

79
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,208
And at 50...

80
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:31,707
well...

81
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:34,500
it stops.

82
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,667
What stops?

83
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,750
What?

84
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,375
What stops?

85
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,958
Um...

86
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,917
you know, the...

87
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,417
the...

88
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,208
Oh, George!

89
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:56,207
Oh, oh!

90
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,249
I'm sorry, I gotta run.

91
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,437
Harvey!

92
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,625
George, those ratings are insane!

93
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,332
You're a genius!

94
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,333
Oh what a mensch, you're a genius!

95
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,291
Let's buy you a drink, come on.

96
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,750
Well, it's your lucky day,
Miss Sparkle,

97
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:03,791
'cause we have X-rayed
you from head to toe,

98
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:05,833
and you don't have so much
as a cracked molar.

99
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:08,417
So, you are good to go.

100
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,958
Um, vaccination, okay.

101
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,624
Not currently
on any medication.

102
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,042
By the way, I just want to say, my...

103
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:19,292
my wife is a huge fan.

104
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,375
Um...

105
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,208
Blood type...

106
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,208
Oh hey, it's your birthday!

107
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,813
Happy bir...

108
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,583
Oh, uh, that's an emergency,
I'm sorry, I have to...

109
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:42,333
Have a good...

110
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,042
Bye.

111
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:53,333
One moment.

112
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,875
There's just one last exam to perform.

113
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:57,667
I thought he said I was good to go.

114
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,000
- Is there a problem?
- No, it's perfect.

115
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,833
You're a good candidate.

116
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,667
I mean, you're good to go.

117
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,042
I wish you the best.

118
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,208
Lizzie?

119
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,917
Lizzie Sparkle?

120
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,958
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

121
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:19,333
Fred!

122
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,917
Fred, from 10th grade home room!

123
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,458
Oh...

124
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,916
Fred, of course!

125
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:29,833
You haven't changed a bit.

126
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,792
You're still the most beautiful girl
in the whole wide world.

127
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,958
You know, I followed your career.
What a success! I mean...

128
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,625
Wow, wow, wow!

129
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:41,166
Wow.

130
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:42,291
Hey...

131
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:44,750
Why don't we go out
maybe for a drink some time?

132
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:47,000
Now that we're,
you know, "reconnected".

133
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:48,250
Um...

134
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:49,916
- Oh, of course,
- I'm...

135
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:52,125
- I'm stupid, you're super busy.
- But you know what?

136
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:54,500
Why don't you give me your card?

137
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:55,792
I mean, you never know.

138
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:56,792

140
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,792
This will do.

141
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't look at my cholesterol levels,
they're a disaster.

142
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,750
- Oh, God!
- Oh, that's...

143
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:12,125
There.

144
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,124

00:36:57,708 --> 00:36:58,792
Thanks.

188
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,208
We'll let you know by next week.

189
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:03,458
Thank you so much.
I'm just dying to get the part.

190
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,458
Great dancer.

191
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:15,750
Too bad her boobs aren't in the middle
of her face instead of that nose.

192
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,792
Mm-hmm.

193
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,083
Next!

194
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:36,667
Looks like everything
sure is in the right place this time.

195
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,708
Please say your name,
age, measurements.

196
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,125
I'm...

197
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:56,457
Sue.

198
00:38:00,543 --> 00:38:02,083
I'm Sue.

199
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,708
<i>Sue. Sue. Sue.</i>

200
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,792
<i>Sue. Sue. Sue.</i>

201
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:16,583
Where is she?

202
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,417
Where is she?

203
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,417
What a gorgeous

204
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:35,167
little

205
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:36,458
angel!

206
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:47,792
You're hired.

207
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:49,667
We want a show

208
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:52,750
that's just like you.

209
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:54,083
Beautiful and happy.

210
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,082
People want to be happy.

211
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,667
We air in two weeks,
so let's get to work.

212
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:02,917
I'm gonna let you organize
the rest with my assistant...

213
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:03,958
Um...

214
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,583
Um...

215
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:07,958
Isabella.

216
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:10,667
Isa, Isa, Isa...

217
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:11,958
who has time to say that?

218
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,208
We're gonna make you Cindy.

219
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,375
It's shorter.

220
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,833
It's better.

221
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:20,917
So, I'm gonna let you organise
everything else with Cindy.

222
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,083
Oh... Um,

223
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:23,875
before you go,

224
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:26,000
I just have to mention a...

225
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:28,042
small scheduling issue.

226
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:30,000
I have to be

227
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,500
out of town every other week.

228
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,833
To take care of my mother.

229
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,458
Who's very sick.

230
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:49,124
I want you for this show.

231
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:52,375
And we will work around
any mother, brother,

232
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,250
fucking sick puppy

233
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:56,125
you need to take care of.

234
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,458
Mm?

235
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:04,167
Gorgeous, with a pure heart.

236
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,792
People are gonna love that.

237
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:37,583
Perfect.

238
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:05,042
So you jump out.

239
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:07,125
Touch your elbows.

240
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:08,666
Head

241
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:09,708
down.

242
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:11,167
Contract.

243
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:16,500
And five, six, seven, eight.

244
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:17,750
Elbows.

245
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:45,375
Oh!

246
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,500
There she is!

247
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:48,875
Oh.

248
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:54,583
Where have you been?

249
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:58,250
We've all been wanting to have
a drink with you for your departure.

250
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,167
Anyway...

251
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:03,000
we all chipped in,

252
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:06,375
and we got you just a little something.

253
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,375
To keep you busy.

254
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:10,000
It's French.

255
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:13,000
My wife, she swears by it.
Oh, I love my wife.

256
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:16,167
Oops, I gotta run.

257
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:20,542
But it's always great to see you.

258
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,124
<i>And we're ba...</i>

259
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:03,916
<i>Which is the most valuable seafood?</i>

260
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:06,583
<i>...are expensing stock options.
Most of the nation...</i>

261
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:09,249
<i>Bob and Judy, are you ready?</i>

262
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,875
<i>...know what you'll be toting
around for the rest of your days?</i>

263
00:46:11,876 --> 00:46:13,458
<i>...the field, kids on the f...</i>

264
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:49,750
The antelope and
the deer moving about.

265
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:52,663
<i>A hunt through the...</i>

266
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:57,750
<i>...only

267
00:46:57,751 --> 00:47:00,250
<i>we have a beautiful, beautiful</i>

268
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:02,750
<i>straight outta Africa...</i>

269
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:05,958
<i>...$8.99, 99.</i>

270
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:09,833
<i>In less than a minute
we have it here today</i>

271
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:14,125
<i>...99, 99. I can't believe this price...</i>

272
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:46,167
<i>...98, with remote.</i>

273
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,000
<i>I cannot believe the incredible price.</i>

274
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,375
<i>For $49.98, shoppers.</i>

275
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:54,375
<i>Look at the quality of this thing.
This thing is sturdy.</i>

276
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:55,750
<i>Beautiful.</i>

277
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:58,395
<i>Listen to your music at home, shoppers.</i>

278
00:47:58,396 --> 00:48:00,093
<i>$49.98, I'll take one myself.</i>

279
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:01,791
<i>Put it right there,</i>

280
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:03,667
<i>hold that one for me,
that one's mine.</i>

281
00:48:03,668 --> 00:48:04,958
<i>How can you ever...</i>

282
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:36,792
<i>God damn it, lady, come on!</i>

283
00:49:36,793 --> 00:49:38,499
<i>I haven't slept in three nights!</i>

284
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,375
<i>Open up! God damn it!</i>

285
00:49:41,376 --> 00:49:42,792
Are you gonna open...

286
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:46,625
Um...

287
00:49:46,626 --> 00:49:47,667
Sorry.

288
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:49,833
I thought that Ms. Sparkle...

289
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:52,250
She moved out.
I'm the new tenant.

290
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:55,042
Sue.

291
00:49:55,417 --> 00:49:57,417
Oler...

292
00:49:57,418 --> 00:49:58,542
Oler...

293
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,499
Oliker.

294
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,500
You wanted to complain
about something?

295
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,792
Oliver?

296
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:06,750
What?

297
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,083
No.

298
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:09,875
No, no, no...

299
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:13,667
I think it's awesome when there's stuff
going on in the building.

300
00:50:13,668 --> 00:50:15,917
You know what I mean?

301
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:17,833
Um...

302
00:50:18,417 --> 00:50:19,875
I'm actually...

303
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:21,333
quite handy.

304
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:22,750
If you ever need...

305
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:26,875
need me to be of aid in any way.

306
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,333
I got a sack of tools, and...

307
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,083
I got a big hammer.

308
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,000
You know what I mean.

309
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:39,937
Anyways, I live right here.

310
00:50:39,938 --> 00:50:42,083
So you know where to find me.

311
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:43,333
Anytime.

312
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,375
Day or night.

313
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:46,833
Later.

314
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:43,457
Hi everybody.

315
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:45,083
I'm Sue.

316
00:52:45,084 --> 00:52:47,333
And it's time to pump it up!

317
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,542
Are you ready?

318
00:52:48,543 --> 00:52:49,708

Thank you so much, everybody.

336
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,500
I'll see you next week.

337
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:25,042
Oh...

338
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,000
And in the meantime...

339
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:30,792
take care of yourself.

340
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:38,250
Where is she?

341
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:41,562
There she is!

342
00:54:42,792 --> 00:54:44,792
Wonderful, wonderful.

343
00:54:45,292 --> 00:54:47,542
That's what I'm talking about!

344
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:06,583
I won't be out late,
so just wait for me.

345
00:56:12,667 --> 00:56:14,208
Don't eat too fast.

346
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:33,208
Let's go!

347
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,167
Are you alright?

348
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:33,958
Yes, I'll be right back.

349
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:11,542
<i>Are you alright?</i>

350
00:59:57,417 --> 00:59:58,708
What did you do?

351
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:01,208
You seem
even more beautiful than before.

352
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:36,625
<i>Yes?</i>

353
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:38,292
Yes, hi.

354
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:40,875
This is Elisabeth Sparkle.

355
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:48,375
I'm 503.

356
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:50,125
<i>Yes.</i>

357
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:52,125
Yes, hi.

358
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:55,125
There's been a slight

359
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:57,167
misuse of the Substance.

360
01:02:57,833 --> 01:03:02,125
A few extra hours were accidentally

361
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:03,833
used.

362
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:05,500
Causing um...

363
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:08,417
an alteration.

364
01:03:09,542 --> 01:03:12,082
So I'm just looking for
the procedure to reverse it.

365
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:16,000
<i>What has been used
on one side is lost on the other side.</i>

366
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,125
<i>There's no going back.</i>

367
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:25,125
No... um...

368
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:27,583
I don't know what she was thinking.

369
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:30,042
And obviously she was drunk.

370
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,958
<i>Remember,
there is no "she" and "you".</i>

371
01:03:32,959 --> 01:03:34,333
<i>You are one.</i>

Sue?

384
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,208
I just saw you on TV.

385
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:24,125
Holy moly!

386
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:27,208
Makes me wanna join your class.

387
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:29,958
You don't give private lessons,
do you?

388
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:33,417
Hey, um...

389
01:05:34,542 --> 01:05:37,167
What about a drink at my place tonight?

390
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:41,167
Come on, don't be shy.

391
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:44,125
I see you standing behind
the door there, gorgeous.

392
01:05:47,292 --> 01:05:48,375
Alright.

393
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:49,875
Take your time.

394
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,333
But it's a date.

What can I get you?

400
01:07:28,917 --> 01:07:30,667
Mocha latte.

401
01:07:39,333 --> 01:07:41,750
It's long, isn't it?

402
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,792
Excuse me?

403
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,458
Seven days.

404
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:22,417
Did you follow me here?

405
01:08:23,458 --> 01:08:25,000
I was just curious

406
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,750
to find out how things
were going for you.

407
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,542
Each time, you feel a little more...

408
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:33,458
lonely.

409
01:08:34,417 --> 01:08:35,458
Don't you think?

410
01:08:37,042 --> 01:08:39,083
I don't know what you're talking about.

411
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:41,875
I'm fine.

412
01:08:43,167 --> 01:08:44,750
Everything's fine.

413
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:46,958
It gets harder each time

414
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:49,292
to remember that you

415
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,125
still deserve

416
01:08:51,292 --> 01:08:52,750
to exist!

417
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:57,458
That this part
of yourself

418
01:08:57,708 --> 01:08:59,958
is still worth something,

419
01:08:59,959 --> 01:09:01,792
that you

420
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:04,625
still matter!

421
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,125
Has she started yet?

422
01:09:12,542 --> 01:09:15,125
Eating away at you?

423
01:09:32,292 --> 01:09:33,625
Fuck!

424
01:09:33,626 --> 01:09:34,917
Watch out!

425
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,542
What?

426
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:56,250
Hey!

427
01:09:56,417 --> 01:09:57,417
Move!

428
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:31,417
<i>You're still the most beautiful girl
in the whole wide world.</i>

429
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:42,458
<i>Hello?</i>

430
01:10:42,459 --> 01:10:44,000
Hi, Fred.

431
01:10:44,001 --> 01:10:45,542
It's Lizzie.

432
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:49,708
Hello?

433
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,125
<i>Sorry, I'm in shock.</i>

434
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:55,250
- Oh.
<i>- Wow, wow, wow!</i>

435
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:58,042
<i>I thought I'd never
hear from you again after...</i>

436
01:10:58,043 --> 01:10:59,812
Oh gosh, no, not at all.

437
01:10:59,813 --> 01:11:01,583
I've just, I've just...

438
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,583
I've just been really busy lately.

439
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:05,208
So listen,

440
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:07,875
I was thinking that...

441
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:12,833
maybe we could get together
and grab a drink?

442
01:11:18,292 --> 01:11:19,583
Are you still there?

443
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:22,500
<i>Sorry, I'm in shock again.</i>

444
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:25,895
<i>Um...</i>

445
01:11:25,896 --> 01:11:28,208
<i>I could book Luigi's at 8?</i>

446
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,917
Eight at Luigi's it is.

447
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:32,708
I...

448
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:34,958
I will see you tonight.

449
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,042
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

450
01:16:31,958 --> 01:16:34,875
<i>And we're back!
And welcome back to...</i>

451
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:37,042
<i>Bob and Judy, are you ready?</i>

452
01:16:42,917 --> 01:16:44,333
Hi everybody!

453
01:16:45,417 --> 01:16:47,833
Okay, here we go everyone,
clear the set, please.

454
01:16:47,834 --> 01:16:49,416
First positions, thank you.

455
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:51,000
Roll cameras.

456
01:16:51,167 --> 01:16:52,292
And in...

457
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:53,667
Three, two...

458
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:55,124
one...

459
01:16:58,042 --> 01:17:00,375
And squat, squat, squat.

460
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:03,375
Circle those hips.

461
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:05,167
Circle those hips.

462
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,875
Contract, contract, contract.

463
01:17:08,417 --> 01:17:11,083
Contract, contract, contract.

464
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:13,167
Head between your legs!

465
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,875
Cut!

466
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:24,082
Um...

467
01:17:24,083 --> 01:17:25,375
I'm sorry, I thought I...

468
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:28,208
I thought I...

469
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:30,917
I just got distracted.

470
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,430
Not a problem, let's get right back to it.

471
01:17:33,792 --> 01:17:34,875
Back to one, please.

472
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:39,625
Sorry, it's the control room now.

473
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:42,167
The director said he saw
something bizarre on the monitor.

474
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:43,958
Bring up the replay on camera 2.

475
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:45,125
Camera 2!

476
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,667
Forward.

477
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:04,458
Can I have my dressing gown?

478
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:07,500
- Sorry, it's in your dressing room.
- Well then, go and get it!

479
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:09,417
Let's just take this frame by frame.

480
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:24,917
I need five minutes.

481
01:20:23,833 --> 01:20:26,417
<i>- Yes?</i>
- This balance is not working!

482
01:20:26,418 --> 01:20:28,417
I barely have any time to enjoy myself,

483
01:20:28,418 --> 01:20:31,292
while she wastes seven days,

484
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:33,082
stuffing her face in front of the TV!

485
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:35,250
<i>Remember,
there is no "she" and "you".</i>

486
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:36,333
<i>You are...</i>

487
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,875
Hello everybody...

488
01:20:45,667 --> 01:20:47,167
What's happening?
Where is everybody?

489
01:20:47,292 --> 01:20:48,833
The taping's been cancelled.

490
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:50,875
What? Why?

491
01:20:51,042 --> 01:20:52,042
Sue.

492
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,750
Harvey wants to see you
in his office immediately.

493
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,458
Okay.

494
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:58,208
I'll go change...

495
01:20:58,209 --> 01:20:59,541
No, he said "Now".

496
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,792
I'll get right to the point.

497
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,750
We can't keep you
on the morning show.

498
01:21:23,167 --> 01:21:25,375
But why? I just started.

499
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:28,292
Ratings are through the roof.

500
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:31,292
We started at 42.

501
01:21:31,542 --> 01:21:32,875
Now we're up to, like...

502
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:35,250
216.

503
01:21:35,251 --> 01:21:37,542
It's phenomenal!

504
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:40,250
People love you!

505
01:21:40,708 --> 01:21:42,166
They adore you!

506
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:43,917
They want more and more,

507
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:45,583
and more of you.

508
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:47,583
That is why we have decided

509
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:50,500
that we want you to host

510
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:53,167
the New Year's Eve show.

511
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,457
You mean the...

512
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:58,583
The network's biggest show.
Fifty million viewers.

513
01:21:58,792 --> 01:21:59,791
Live.

514
01:21:59,792 --> 01:22:02,250
You can't go higher than that!

515
01:22:04,542 --> 01:22:05,707
Now, it's gonna be intense.

516
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:08,292
We only have a few months
to pull it off, so...

517
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:10,292
Are you in?

518
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:23,750
If you don't open the door
when opportunity knocks

519
01:22:23,751 --> 01:22:25,167
you won't get another chance.

520
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:28,458
You of all people know this.

521
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:43,375
Just one more day,
and then I have a whole week off

522
01:22:43,376 --> 01:22:44,500
we can switch.

523
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:03,958
We're doing the cover of Vogue!

524
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,750
Just one more day, okay?

525
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:45,417
No!

526
01:24:15,042 --> 01:24:15,999
<i>Yes?</i>

527
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
She didn't respect the balance!

528
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:21,292
She's stealing
more and more time from me.

529
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:24,917
Completely without consideration
to the consequences.

530
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:26,833
She's a selfish bitch!

531
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,440
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

532
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:32,167
Stop?

533
01:24:32,292 --> 01:24:33,625
<i>You are the matrix.</i>

534
01:24:33,958 --> 01:24:37,208
<i>If you are not satisfied,
you can put an end to the experience</i>

535
01:24:37,209 --> 01:24:40,125
<i>and go back to being just you,
on your own.</i>

536
01:24:40,417 --> 01:24:41,458
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

537
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:47,041
Will it go back to the way it was before?

538
01:24:47,042 --> 01:24:49,333
<i>What has been transferred
won't come back.</i>

539
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,833
<i>But you can stop
the experience as of now.</i>

540
01:24:51,958 --> 01:24:53,292
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

541
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:56,208
<i>To go back to being just you,
on your own?</i>

542
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:00,167
No.

543
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:04,000
No, no, no...

544
01:25:04,292 --> 01:25:05,667
I can't stop.

545
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:07,749
She...

546
01:25:09,917 --> 01:25:10,917
I...

547
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:18,625
The balance just needs to be respected.

548
01:25:18,626 --> 01:25:19,707
<i>So respect it.</i>

549
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:24,417
Just stop it. Stop it.

550
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:26,333
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

551
01:25:35,542 --> 01:25:37,958
<i>Bob, you are the winner!</i>

552
01:25:38,167 --> 01:25:41,000
<i>So Bob, congratulations,
you've won $25,000.</i>

553
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:44,417
<i>Now you have one final chance
to answer a single question</i>

554
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:48,708
<i>in our big question round
and play for $250,000!</i>

555
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,000
<i>Now, you'll have just 45 seconds...</i>

556
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,917
<i>Just a little something
to keep you busy.</i>

557
01:27:08,708 --> 01:27:10,125
Fuck...

558
01:27:36,625 --> 01:27:39,000
<i>Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
she is here.</i>

559
01:27:39,001 --> 01:27:40,708
<i>The superstar</i>

560
01:27:40,709 --> 01:27:42,917
<i>of the moment, Sue!</i>

561
01:27:43,167 --> 01:27:45,083
<i>Are you ready? Let's welcome her!</i>

562
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:46,416
<i>Sue!</i>

563
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:53,208
You popped up out of nowhere
on our screens like a tornado!

564
01:27:53,209 --> 01:27:54,958
I don't think anybody

565
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:56,792
was really prepared for this whirlwind.

566
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:07,292
It all started with the morning show.

567
01:28:07,417 --> 01:28:08,792
And rumour has it,

568
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:12,292
that you are up
for Tom Grant's next movie.

569
01:28:14,251 --> 01:28:15,417
<i>Ah, wait...</i>

570
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:16,708
just a moment.

571
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,041
I'm being told you are going to host

572
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:21,500
the New Year's Eve show,
can you confirm this?

573
01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:23,333
Yes, that's right.

574
01:28:23,625 --> 01:28:25,207
Yes, that's right.

575
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:30,417
Oh my God! That is huge news!

576
01:28:33,583 --> 01:28:35,124
<i>Tell us a little bit about yourself.</i>

577
01:28:35,125 --> 01:28:37,625
Where are you from,
how did you get discovered?

578
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:40,750
I want, we want to know everything.

579
01:28:43,729 --> 01:28:45,250
Well, I mean...

580
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:48,083
there's really not very much to tell.

581
01:28:48,667 --> 01:28:49,999
I'm just a girl

582
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,750
from a very small town in Indiana.

583
01:28:53,958 --> 01:28:55,708
I'm sure that you've never heard of it.

584
01:28:55,833 --> 01:28:57,832
In fact, it's not even a town.

585
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,917
I'm not sure you could
really even call it a village. It's...

586
01:29:01,917 --> 01:29:03,187
a farm, perhaps?

587
01:29:10,458 --> 01:29:12,292
<i>But, ever since I can remember,</i>

588
01:29:12,293 --> 01:29:14,042
it has always been my dream

589
01:29:14,208 --> 01:29:15,417
<i>to be on the screen.</i>

590
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,125
This is my dream.

591
01:29:18,292 --> 01:29:20,208
As a child I used to put
on shows for my family.

592
01:29:21,167 --> 01:29:22,500
Your family.

593
01:29:22,667 --> 01:29:23,750
How sweet.

594
01:29:26,667 --> 01:29:27,708
<i>So...</i>

595
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,167
everyone is aware

596
01:29:30,417 --> 01:29:31,875
that you replaced

597
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,583
Elisabeth Sparkle.

598
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:37,875
And no doubt about it, you stepped in,

599
01:29:37,876 --> 01:29:39,812
you turned up the volume,

600
01:29:39,813 --> 01:29:41,750
and you rocked their world.

601
01:29:42,042 --> 01:29:43,667
Were you a fan of her show?

602
01:29:47,833 --> 01:29:49,458
Um...

603
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:51,292
<i>Well...</i>

604
01:29:52,542 --> 01:29:54,250
Well, I can't...

605
01:29:54,625 --> 01:29:57,292
I can't really say that I actually watched

606
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:58,458
<i>her show.</i>

607
01:29:59,083 --> 01:30:02,625
You do know that we're not exactly
from the same generation.

608
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,041
And you have to admit

609
01:30:05,042 --> 01:30:06,417
it was a bit old-fashioned.

610
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:11,042
Jurassic Fitness, really.

611
01:30:12,230 --> 01:30:13,427
Jurassic Fitness?

612
01:30:13,428 --> 01:30:14,625
It needed a change.

613
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:18,500
I'll fucking show you.

614
01:30:19,792 --> 01:30:21,750
You wanna see some Jurassic Fitness?

615
01:30:25,042 --> 01:30:26,167
You want it?

616
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:28,083
Come on,

617
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:30,667
come get
your fucking Jurassic Fitness!

618
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:41,333
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

619
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:45,667
So every morning,

620
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:47,208
rain or shine,

621
01:30:48,458 --> 01:30:50,417
<i>Sparkle Your Life</i> was on TV.

622
01:30:50,667 --> 01:30:52,667
So, in a way, I grew up with her.

623
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:54,292
Whether I liked it or not.

624
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:58,458
I guess that's why you can say
we have some sort of connection.

625
01:30:58,708 --> 01:31:00,333
"Some sort of connection."

626
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,708
You wouldn't exist

627
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,083
without me.

628
01:31:14,458 --> 01:31:16,333
It is time, ladies and gentlemen,

629
01:31:16,334 --> 01:31:18,750
for our final question.

630
01:31:18,875 --> 01:31:20,666
The question that we ask

631
01:31:20,667 --> 01:31:24,333
each and every one of our guests.

632
01:31:24,334 --> 01:31:25,416
Okay.

633
01:31:25,417 --> 01:31:28,667
Would you share one of your little

634
01:31:28,668 --> 01:31:30,167
beauty secrets with us?

635
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,708
Just one little trick of yours

636
01:31:33,875 --> 01:31:37,292
that helps you look so incredibly
stunning, I mean, look at you.

637
01:31:37,293 --> 01:31:39,042
- I don't know...
- Say it!

638
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:41,417
Say it!

639
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:44,000
- Let me think.
- Say it.

640
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:46,417
Tell them
who your little beauty secret is.

641
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:47,583
I guess...

642
01:31:47,625 --> 01:31:49,934
Why don't we just show them right here?

643
01:31:49,958 --> 01:31:51,458
Here's your little beauty secret.

644
01:31:51,583 --> 01:31:53,250
<i>I guess I just try to be myself.</i>

645
01:31:53,417 --> 01:31:54,417
<i>To be sincere</i>

646
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:56,708
<i>and grateful for all that I have.</i>

647
01:31:57,458 --> 01:31:59,375
<i>And to always remember
to lead with my heart.</i>

648
01:31:59,708 --> 01:32:01,417
<i>Aw, America's sweetheart.</i>

649
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:13,708
I just...

650
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:16,125
I try to be myself.

651
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,958
Stop it!

652
01:32:20,042 --> 01:32:21,500
Stop it.

653
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:23,417
You're taking it from me.

654
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:25,750
That's your little secret.

655
01:32:25,917 --> 01:32:27,458
Stop it!

656
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:30,458
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

657
01:32:41,917 --> 01:32:43,375
You have to...

658
01:32:43,542 --> 01:32:45,999
...control yourself!

659
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:08,083
I can't go back inside her.

660
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:17,708
Gross, old,

661
01:33:17,833 --> 01:33:19,083
fat,

662
01:33:19,875 --> 01:33:20,917
disgusting!

663
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:42,833
Coming to bed?

664
01:34:43,542 --> 01:34:44,542
Yes.

665
01:34:45,333 --> 01:34:46,625
I'll be right there.

666
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:46,417
Fuck.

667
01:35:51,542 --> 01:35:52,917
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Hi!

668
01:35:53,042 --> 01:35:54,833
Hi, this is an emergency.

669
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:56,833
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

670
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,167
Hello?

671
01:36:01,458 --> 01:36:03,042
It's fucking 503.

672
01:36:03,167 --> 01:36:04,208
<i>Yes.</i>

673
01:36:05,083 --> 01:36:07,750
I'm telling you, this is urgent.
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

674
01:36:07,751 --> 01:36:09,708
<i>It means
you've reached the end.</i>

675
01:36:12,167 --> 01:36:13,333
What do you mean, the end?

676
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:15,083
<i>You've drained it all out.</i>

677
01:36:15,084 --> 01:36:16,249
<i>If you want more,</i>

678
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,875
<i>you must let the fluid regenerate.</i>

679
01:36:18,958 --> 01:36:20,416
Tell me how to do it,

680
01:36:20,417 --> 01:36:22,667
I need to stabilize myself right now.

681
01:36:23,042 --> 01:36:24,667
<i>You simply have to switch.</i>

682
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:28,541
Excuse me?

683
01:36:28,542 --> 01:36:31,208
<i>The switch reboots
the fluid secretion process</i>

684
01:36:31,417 --> 01:36:33,875
<i>so you can continue
to enjoy the experience.</i>

685
01:36:33,876 --> 01:36:35,875
No, no, no.

686
01:36:36,167 --> 01:36:37,583
I can't switch, I can't.

687
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:39,791
Especially not now.

688
01:36:39,792 --> 01:36:41,625
<i>There is no other option.</i>

689
01:37:08,167 --> 01:37:09,292
Sue?

690
01:37:21,667 --> 01:37:22,833
Babe?

691
01:37:25,917 --> 01:37:26,958
Sue?

692
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:28,583
You alright?

693
01:37:34,417 --> 01:37:35,750
Stressed out about tomorrow?

694
01:37:41,292 --> 01:37:42,708
Babe?

695
01:37:47,333 --> 01:37:48,375
Babe.

696
01:37:56,042 --> 01:37:58,208
Sue? Is something wrong?

697
01:38:03,333 --> 01:38:05,708
You a little cranky because
of your lady business?

698
01:38:10,167 --> 01:38:11,500
Sue, open the door.

699
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:14,167
<i>Come on, Sue.</i>

700
01:38:14,583 --> 01:38:16,458
<i>It's not funny, I need to take a piss.</i>

701
01:38:17,708 --> 01:38:19,042
<i>Sue, open the door.</i>

702
01:38:19,958 --> 01:38:21,667
<i>Open the door, Sue. Come on.</i>

703
01:38:23,146 --> 01:38:24,333
<i>Babe.</i>

704
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:29,000
<i>Open the door.</i>

705
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:41,333
<i>Sue...</i>

706
01:38:49,126 --> 01:38:50,500
<i>Open the door!</i>

707
01:38:51,417 --> 01:38:52,708
Get out!

708
01:38:53,333 --> 01:38:54,667
What the fuck?

709
01:38:55,833 --> 01:38:57,500
Get the fuck out!

710
01:38:57,833 --> 01:38:59,958
Who's this? Who the fuck is this?

711
01:39:00,083 --> 01:39:01,375
And leave me alone!

712
01:39:10,292 --> 01:39:12,125
What the fuck!

713
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:06,250
<i>Yes?</i>

714
01:40:07,208 --> 01:40:08,250
I...

715
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:11,167
It's 503,

716
01:40:12,292 --> 01:40:13,812
and I want to stop.

717
01:40:13,813 --> 01:40:15,332
<i>Are you sure?</i>

718
01:40:15,333 --> 01:40:17,333
<i>Once you stop, you can't go back.</i>

719
01:40:17,542 --> 01:40:19,124
I wanna stop!

720
01:40:19,125 --> 01:40:21,417
I wanna fucking stop.

721
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:23,583
I wanna stop!

722
01:40:24,125 --> 01:40:25,249
<i>We'll deliver.</i>

723
01:41:12,417 --> 01:41:13,541
Sue? I...

724
01:41:13,542 --> 01:41:14,667
Fuck off!

725
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,792
<i>Are you sure?</i>

726
01:42:38,708 --> 01:42:41,167
<i>Once you stop, you can't go back.</i>

727
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:43,417
<i>You will simply remain on your own.</i>

728
01:42:44,667 --> 01:42:46,624
<i>Just on your own.</i>

729
01:42:48,583 --> 01:42:50,353
<i>Just on your own.</i>

730
01:42:50,354 --> 01:42:51,760
<i>On your own...</i>

731
01:42:51,761 --> 01:42:53,167
Shut the fuck up!

732
01:42:53,583 --> 01:42:54,749
<i>On your...</i>

733
01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:44,791
<i>Elisabeth!</i>

734
01:43:44,792 --> 01:43:47,417
<i>We love you!</i>

735
01:43:48,417 --> 01:43:49,832
<i>Over here!</i>

736
01:43:49,833 --> 01:43:51,687
<i>We love you!</i>

737
01:43:56,208 --> 01:43:57,500
I can't.

738
01:43:58,667 --> 01:44:00,000
I can't.

739
01:44:00,542 --> 01:44:02,333
I can't do this.

740
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:06,750
I need you.

741
01:44:07,375 --> 01:44:08,542
Cause...

742
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:10,458
I hate myself.

743
01:44:13,417 --> 01:44:16,625
You gotta...
you gotta get ready,

744
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,500
it's our big, it's our big night.

745
01:44:20,375 --> 01:44:22,792
Come on, they're gonna
love you so much.

746
01:44:23,792 --> 01:44:24,833
Come on.

747
01:44:26,083 --> 01:44:27,083
Come on.

748
01:44:27,292 --> 01:44:28,458
One, two...

749
01:44:28,625 --> 01:44:30,167
you're the only lovable part of me,

750
01:44:30,168 --> 01:44:31,792
you have to come back.

751
01:44:32,208 --> 01:44:33,500
You have to come back!

752
01:44:33,501 --> 01:44:34,542
Come back...

753
01:44:58,458 --> 01:44:59,458
Come on.

754
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:02,292
Come on.

755
01:45:08,833 --> 01:45:09,833
Come on!

756
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
[Soft, uneasy violin music;
synth beat

757
01:51:12,542 --> 01:51:14,500
Got an hour and a half
for makeup. Hair...

758
01:51:14,625 --> 01:51:16,895
And then we gotta get you
to the fitting room, into your dress.

759
01:51:16,896 --> 01:51:19,167
After that we have one final test
on stage for lighting and sound.

760
01:51:19,168 --> 01:51:20,708
We have a bit of downtime
before the show starts.

761
01:51:20,709 --> 01:51:21,958
You got it?

762
01:51:22,125 --> 01:51:23,167
Okay, let's go.

763
01:51:23,292 --> 01:51:24,291
Come on.

764
01:51:31,167 --> 01:51:32,208
The dress.

765
01:51:32,750 --> 01:51:34,125
Wonderful!

766
01:51:34,625 --> 01:51:35,667
Perfect!

767
01:51:43,542 --> 01:51:46,000
And here you go...

768
01:51:52,250 --> 01:51:53,875
Good.

769
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:55,500
Can we get the dance light?

770
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:02,875
I'm gonna be right back, sorry.

771
01:53:28,542 --> 01:53:31,583
<i>Sue, they need to see you on stage
to set the lights.</i>

772
01:53:33,375 --> 01:53:34,457
Huh?

773
01:53:55,458 --> 01:53:56,958
<i>Have you ever dreamt</i>

774
01:53:58,125 --> 01:54:00,500
<i>of a better version of yourself?</i>

775
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:02,708
<i>More beautiful,</i>

776
01:54:03,083 --> 01:54:04,500

777
01:54:04,792 --> 01:54:06,833
<i>Sue?</i>

778
01:54:07,708 --> 01:54:09,292
Yes, let me meet you there.

779
01:54:09,458 --> 01:54:11,333
<i>Okay, so I'll wait for you on stage.</i>

780
01:54:21,125 --> 01:54:23,292
Oh! Sue!

781
01:54:27,876 --> 01:54:28,917
Sue?

782
01:54:32,458 --> 01:54:34,875
Let me introduce you to the shareholders.

783
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,208
They have been dying to meet you.

784
01:54:41,667 --> 01:54:43,042
Is everything...

785
01:54:44,292 --> 01:54:45,625
okay?

786
01:54:50,333 --> 01:54:52,667
So, smile!

787
01:54:59,292 --> 01:55:01,458
It's what we want tonight!

788
01:55:02,667 --> 01:55:06,249
Pretty girls should always smile.

789
01:55:08,251 --> 01:55:09,333
Girls, come on.

790
01:55:09,542 --> 01:55:10,917
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

791
01:55:12,958 --> 01:55:14,208
Come on, we gotta go.

792
01:55:16,708 --> 01:55:18,792
Tiffany, Cindy, Ashley.

793
01:55:18,958 --> 01:55:20,208
Go, go, go!

794
01:55:20,375 --> 01:55:22,667
Feathers! Feathers! Feathers!

795

Hey, ready for tonight?

796
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:07,542
I need a better version of myself.

797
01:57:07,708 --> 01:57:10,458
Please give me
a better version of myself, please.

798
01:57:16,333 --> 01:57:17,833
Please!

Come on!

800
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:19,500

At last, we were starting to worry.
Hurry up, you're up in five.

808
02:03:21,583 --> 02:03:23,875
There she is, so beautiful.

We could never do it without you.

814

You're irreplaceable.

815
02:04:04,917 --> 02:04:07,000
Girls, come on, let's go.
What are we waiting for?

816
02:04:07,208 --> 02:04:08,333
Alright, come on, everybody.

Let's go, let's go.

You will not be disappointed.
