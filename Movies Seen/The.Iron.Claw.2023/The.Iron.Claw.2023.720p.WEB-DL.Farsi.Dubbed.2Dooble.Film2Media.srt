1
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:49,977
It's over, Rick, they're
gonna disqualify you.

2
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:54,815
One, two, three. Come on.

3
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,093
Get him out of the corner.

4
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,273
Do you wanna quit?

5
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:23,811
I'll break it!
I'll snap his neck!

6
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,275
One, two, three.

7
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,677
Ring the bell! It's
over. It's over.

8
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,203
Let's go.

9
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,936
Hey, now. Hey,
Kevin. Hey, David.

10
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,138
- You crushed that guy, Pop.
- I sure did.

11
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,241
Oh! The Iron Claw!

12
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:19,108
Kevin's got me in the Iron Claw!

13
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,177
You're getting strong.

14
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,079
Nice to have you
guys here for once.

15
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,781
Hi.

16
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,916
- Did you see anything, Dottie?
- Not a chance!

17
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,419
But it sure sounded like
everyone was angry at you.

18
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,944
That's the idea.

19
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:41,898
What is that thing
attached to our home?

20
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,767
You guys like it?

21
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,169
Oh, Dad. It's incredible.

22
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,837
Yeah, it's incredible.

23
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,341
Jack, where is our car?

24
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:54,244
I had the boys swap it
out during the show.

25
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,112
Surprise!

26
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:59,649
Wait. What are you thinking?
We can't afford this.

27
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,718
Well, hear me out.

28
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,053
I was talking to the promoter,

29
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,790
and he said if I wanna be a
star, I need to act like a star.

30
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,692
So, he told me to
rent a Cadillac.

31
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,519
I'm not even gonna
ask how much it costs.

32
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,535
How much does it cost?

33
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,397
It's gonna be fine,
Dottie. I'm almost there.

34
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:28,312
We need a real house. A safe
place to raise these guys.

35
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:31,915
How does blowing a bunch of money
on a fancy car get us a house?

36
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,483
The only way to
beat this thing...

37
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,051
There's no "thing."

38
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,853
The only way to beat it
is to be the toughest,

39
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,822
the strongest, the
most successful,

40
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,490
the absolute best.

41
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,883
To rely on no one but ourselves.

42
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,595
I will get us there.

43
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,733
I will be the NWA World
Heavyweight Champion

44
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,659
and nothing will
hurt us ever again.

45
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,905
Let the morning bring me
word of your unfailing love,

46
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,507
for I have put my trust in you.

47
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:01,301
Show me the way I should go,
for in you, I entrust my life.

48
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,248
We've been through hell,

49
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:08,976
and we're gonna leave all
that behind. I promise.

50
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,107
- What?
- Let's go for a run.

51
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,700
- Go for a run?
- Yeah.

52
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,116
- Come on. Let's go!
- No, no. I'm not doing that.

53
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,374
All right.

54
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:44,371
<i>Ever since I was a child, people
said my family was cursed.</i>

55
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,485
<i>We never talked about it.</i>

56
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,621
<i>And I don't know if my brothers
and I believed it back then,</i>

57
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,514
<i>but bad things kept happening.</i>

58
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,327
<i>Mom tried to
protect us with God.</i>

59
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,754
<i>Pop tried to protect
us with wrestling.</i>

60
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:07,094
<i>He said if we were the toughest, the
strongest, the most successful...</i>

61
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,397
<i>nothing could ever hurt us.</i>

62
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,934
<i>I believed him. We all did.</i>

63
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,604
<i>We loved our father.</i>

64
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:19,883
<i>And we loved wrestling.</i>

65
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,816
One, two, three, four!

66
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,329
One, two...

67
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,498
That's an eye gouge!

68
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:05,929
That's a trip!

69
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,141
And stay out, you
son of a bitch!

70
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,900
Or I'll come out of retirement!

71
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:55,712
One, two, three!

72
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,452
Yeah!

73
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,555
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

74
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:10,093
<i>the winner and the new
Texas Heavyweight Champion,</i>

75
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:13,362
<i>Kevin Von Erich!</i>

76
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,365
- Congratulations, Son. You did well.
- Thanks, Pop.

77
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,703
This is just the start. Tomorrow
you're back working harder than ever!

78
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:22,095
- Proud of you!
- Yes, sir!

79
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,350
Morning.

80
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,894
- Morning.
- Morning, Son.

81
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,055
Pants tomorrow please, David.

82
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,556
Sorry, Ma. I couldn't find them.

83
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,225
They are in the
wash. Heard of it?

84
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,251
Michael, breathe.

85
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,495
Eat like you're starving mutt.

86
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,831
Good morning.

87
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:50,658
That's why I eat quickly.
They take my food, Ma.

88
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,560
No!

89
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,807
Mike, you need to start
hitting the weights more, kid.

90
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,943
You're growing well,
but you need to bulk up,

91
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,811
get some strength in those arms.

92
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,412
I'll always have
your back, Michael.

93
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,514
You won't always be around.

94
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,050
Mike's fine, Pop.

95
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:10,086
Kid won't be able
to defend himself.

96
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:16,110
Well, may not be the strongest,
but I still can eat the most.

97
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,362
It's not a joke.

98
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:22,165
Kerry is about to become
the family's first Olympian.

99
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,400
Kevin is the NWA Texas Champion.

100
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,036
- David is about to make his ring debut.
- Pop, come on.

101
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,097
It's time for you to start thinking
about what you're gonna be.

102
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,878
Now we all know Kerry's my favourite,
then Kev, then David then Mike,

103
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:37,914
but the rankings
can always change.

104
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,007
Everyone can work
their way up or down.

105
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,786
Good.

106
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,424
Hold it up a little higher.
Hold it up a little higher.

107
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,403
That's it. Now push forward.

108
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,305
Goddamn it, Mike!

109
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,832
Come on!

110
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,604
Come on, David, I
gotta take a dump.

111
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,378
- Hurry up in there, man!
- Mike, shut up! Give me a second.

112
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,087
David!

113
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,599
Come in.

114
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,003
- Hi, Ma.
- Hey, Kevin.

115
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,974
Hey, I've been thinking. Can
I talk to you about something?

116
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,867
Baby, that's what
your brothers are for.

117
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,345
I know, but...

118
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,204
I don't want to be late.

119
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,419
Dad's too tough on Mike, Ma.

120
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,012
You gotta say something.

121
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,885
- Please?
- Kevin, that's between them.

122
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:00,563
Now go, get ready.

123
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,155
We leave in 15 minutes.

124
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,625
All right.

125
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,707
Hey, how are you?
How you been?

126
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,109
Nice to see you.

127
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,343
Hi.

128
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,411
Come on in.

129
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,146
- How are you?
- Good.

130
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,314
Hi, how you doing?

131
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,648
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

132
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,617
Howdy. How you doing?
All right, good.

133
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,952
- This is your biggest fan.
- Thank you.

134
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,520
Yeah. It's nice
to see you again.

135
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,313
Likewise. Likewise.

136
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,725
Thank you so much.

137
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,560
Thanks for coming out, yeah.

138
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,962
How are you?

139
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,363
Good to see you again.
You see this guy?

140
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,960
Yeah, that was good. That
was... That was good.

141
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,562
- All right, bye.
- See you later.

142
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,630
How was orchestra
practice, Michael?

143
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,200
It was great. Thanks, Ma.

144
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:47,070
I'm starving. Uh... Can
we get burgers on the way?

145
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:48,561
We got food in the cooler.

146
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,040
I miss Kerry.

147
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,408
He would get burgers
for me right now.

148
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,143
I'll eat a burger with
you, little brother.

149
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,045
- Come on.
- Come on, Kev.

150
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,413

Hi, Kevin!

165
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,354
Welcome back, ladies
and gentlemen.

166
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,390
We have the newly crowned Texas
Heavyweight Champion, Kevin Von Erich here,

167
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,260
and he is scheduled to fight in
a tag-team match later on tonight

168
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,163
against Gino Hernandez
and Bruiser Brody.

169
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:50,233
But his partner is
still a mystery.

170
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,968
That's right, Bill.

171
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:54,637
First off, I just
wanna say to Gino,

172
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:57,941
you've been running that mouth
of yours way, way too long,

173
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,408
and I'm here to take care of it.

174
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,210
Boy, oh, boy.

175
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,770
Do I have somethin' special
for you tonight, buddy.

176
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,550
- Can we just do that again from the top, yeah?
- Yeah, absolutely.

177
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,018
- Thank you.
- Take it from the top, okay?

178
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,086
Okay.

179
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:12,956
- Ready?
- Yeah.

180
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,490
Ready.

181
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,159
Welcome back, ladies
and gentlemen.

182
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:18,761
We have the newly crowned
Texas Heavyweight Champion,

183
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,229
Kevin Von Erich here tonight,

184
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,665
and he's scheduled to
fight in a tag-team match

185
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,001
against Gino Hernandez
and Bruiser Brody.

186
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,136
But his partner is
still a mystery.

187
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,371
That's right, Bill.

188
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:31,040
First off, I just
wanna say that, Gino,

189
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:35,268
you've been shooting your mouth off way,
way too long about me and my family.

190
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:39,172
I got something special
for you, boy, oh, boy.

191
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,718
It ain't gonna be
all roses... Fuck.

192
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,254
It's okay. We'll go again.

193
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,790
- David, I hear you. Stop.
- I didn't say anything.

194
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,693
Welcome back, ladies
and gentlemen.

195
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,728
We have the newly crowned
Texas Heavyweight Champion,

196
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,530
Kevin Von Erich here

197
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,400
and he is scheduled to fight in
a tag-team match later on tonight

198
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:00,103
against Gino Hernandez
and Bruiser Brody.

199
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:03,030
But his partner still
remains a mystery.

200
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,398
That's right, Bill.

201
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:10,803
I got something special for... that the
hometown crowd fans are really gonna love

202
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:12,781
tonight.

203
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,085
You know, first off, I
just wanna say, Gino,

204
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,421
you've been shooting your
mouth... shooting your

205
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,023
shoot... shooting your mouth...

206
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:22,091
- Shoobadoobadoo.
- Shit, sorry.

207
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,560
David.

208
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,996
If it's so easy, you get
up here and do it then.

209
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,331
Yeah, I mean I... I'd love to,

210
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:29,765
but it'll kind of ruin
the surprise, you know?

211
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,100
Yeah, I know.

212
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,635
- You're not helping.
- All right.

213
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,969
Just get out of here.

214
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,073
- Wanna try again?
- Yeah, yes. Okay.

00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,063
I tag Gino in, fight him back.

226
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,532
Give him a body
slam, an elbow drop.

227
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,135
He's gonna drive you to
the corner, stay there

228
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,869
'cause I'm gonna be coming
in and take the post.

229
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,139
And I'm a go straight up top, so
don't leave me there too long.

230
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,474
- Okay? Cross body.
- I'll still be sellin', my feet up.

231
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,842
- And then double drop kick?
- Yeah.

232
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,177
- Then the Claw?
- Right, yeah.

233
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,478
You been working on
that with your dad?

234
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,979
A little, yeah.

235
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,715
All right, just don't fuck
with my hair too much, okay?

236
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,184
All right, David.
Welcome to the show.

237
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,670
One, two...

238
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,972
And a kick out from Gino...

239
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,841
Let's go, David!

240
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:21,744
David picks up Gino, but he
pushes him in the corner.

241
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:25,214
And here comes Brody
charging across the ring.

242
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:28,417
He misses him. He misses him. And comes
all the way back over to the side.

243
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,443
Kevin getting up
on the top rope.

244
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,321
Brody dazed now.

245
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:36,091
And a huge flying cross body

246
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,884
knocks down Brody.

247
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,730
The brothers line up
a double drop kick.

248
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:45,268
An incredible double drop kick!
Blowing the roof off of this place!

249
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,437
Can you hear these people?

250
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,942
And here comes the Iron Claw,

251
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,237
his father's notorious
signature move.

252
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,418
Oh, and he slaps it
on Gino. Look at him.

253
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:07,956
The pain is too much. Gino taps
out, and the Von Erichs win!

254
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,725
Look out, NWA!

255
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,295
David and Kevin
Von Erich are here!

256
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,755
<i>David and Kevin Von Erich!</i>

257
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,401
- No problem.
- Excuse me. Can you make it out to Emily?

258
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,303
- Emily. That's for you.
- Thank you, thank you.

259
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,937
Thank you. Thanks
for coming, guys.

260
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,173
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

261
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,041
Yeah, thanks for coming.
Come next week, all right?

262
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,276
I'm gonna go.

263
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,677
- Okay, bye!
- Bye, bye.

264
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,069
All right.

265
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,516
Hi, Kevin. Hey, um...

266
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,184
Can I get your autograph?

267
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,819
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

268
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,681
Oh, don't you wanna ask
me who to make it out to?

269
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,916
Oh, yeah. Sure.

270
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,061
It's Pam.

271
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,554
- Pam.
- Mmm-hmm.

272
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:53,660
You're supposed to say,
"Nice to meet you, Pam."

273
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,340
Yeah, I'm sorry.

274
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,841
Uh, it is nice to meet you, Pam.

275
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,133
It's nice to meet
you too, Kevin.

276
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,480
Did you, uh, want
my brother to sign?

277
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,639
No, just you.

278
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,009
Okay, then.

279
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:17,216
Your folks not teach you
how to ask questions?

280
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,387
Like what?

281
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,799
Well, like, you know,

282
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:27,970
"Who shall I make this
out to?" Or, um, or...

283
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:31,498
"Would you like to have a
drink with me sometime, Pam?"

284
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,610
Are you asking me out?

285
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:37,045
Make me feel a little
worse while you're at it.

286
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,706
No, no, no. Sorry, no, I, uh...

287
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,185
I would love to go
out with you, Pam.

288
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,604
Wasn't that... Yeah, I just...
I've just never been asked before.

289
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,358
Oh.

290
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,226
Well, hopefully, it will go well

291
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,186
and then no one else will have
the chance to ask you again.

292
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,791
Yeah.

293
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:01,928
Morning.

294
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,231
Morning.

295
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,311
David's good.

296
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:10,078
David's good.

297
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,441
Got the Saturday ratings back.

298
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,476
Highest numbers ever.

299
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:21,189
And somebody called
me from over at ESPN.

300
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:24,651
They wanna offer us a national
slot for Saturday nights.

301
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,197
That's great news.

302
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,733
Break it down for me.

303
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:33,235
Well, it's good financial base.

304
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,438
Uh, we'll have ad revenue.

305
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,873
Bigger and bigger
names coming through.

306
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:43,879
But if we perform and we have a World
Heavyweight Champion in our roster,

307
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,839
we could be the biggest
promotion in wrestling.

308
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,453
Oh, we'll have a World
Heavyweight Champion.

309
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,311
I can promise you that.

310
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,424
- Let's move forward.
- Okay.

311
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:57,960
- There you go.
- Thanks.

312
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,895
Yeah, have a good one.

313
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,588
Are you this famous everywhere?

314
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,099
No, not everywhere.

315
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,101
- They're not such big fans up in Missouri.
- Oh.

316
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,126
That's for sure.

317
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,071
You travel a lot?

318
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:12,475
Uh, yeah. Yeah. We
go out on the road.

319
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,276
But we don't have
to as much anymore,

320
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,211
because our show
is doing so well.

321
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:23,710
So, what do you want in
life, Kevin Von Erich?

322
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:27,680
More ribs.

323
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:31,594
I wanna be World
Heavyweight Champion.

324
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:34,062
Hmm. Well, can you
just explain that to me

325
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,623
'cause ain't it all just fake?

326
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:38,224
Fake?

327
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,869
There's nothing fake
about what we do.

328
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,471
Okay. All right.

329
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:45,107
All right. Not fake.

330
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:46,365
Um...

331
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,836
Prearranged? Written?

332
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,116
Look, you move up
in any industry

333
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,384
based on your
performances, right?

334
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,152
Mmm-hmm.

335
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:02,181
So a belt, like my Texas title,
is really just a job promotion.

336
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,994
The promoters keep you
moving up if you do well.

337
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,464
And if you reach the top,

338
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:11,199
you become World
Champ as a reward,

339
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,594
because you're the best
based on your ability

340
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:18,030
and on how the crowd
responds to you.

341
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,867
Is that all you want?

342
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,670
No. Of course not.

343
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,138
I wanna be with my family.

344
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,451
You know, be with my brothers.

345
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,710
Mmm, that's sweet.

346
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,580
What do you like to
do with your brothers?

347
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:37,717
Anything. I don't know.

348
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,897
Just being together,
we can do anything.

349
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,823
Hmm.

350
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,234
What about you?

351
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,303
Well, I wanna be a vet.

352
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,706
I want kids. I want
my own practice.

353
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,732
I want a man who's
okay with that.

354
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,711
Cool.

355
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,345
So, would you be okay with that?

356
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,248
Oh, damn right, I would.

357
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,718
We could be one of those
modern super couples.

358
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,053
We can have our own ranch.

359
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,756
Everyone could come live with us.
All my brothers, their families.

360
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,248
Okay.

361
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:14,563
You know, you have
oldest brother syndrome.

362
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:17,766
- Yeah, you wanna take care of everyone.
- Maybe.

363
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,759
I'm not the oldest, though.

364
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,296
When I was five, my big
brother, Jack Jr., he died.

365
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,178
Oh. Oh, my God. Kevin, I'm
so sorry. I had no idea.

366
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,740
Oh, it's all right. I don't
really think about it.

367
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,742
Not anymore.

368
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:38,711
What was that like?

369
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,549
I don't know. It was strange.

370
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,484
As a kid, he just, uh...

371
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,656
He just wasn't there
to play with one day.

372
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,601
So, I'm not the oldest.

373
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,137
I must have the, uh

374
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,072
the second-oldest
brother syndrome.

375
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,318
I'm so sorry.

376
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:33,609
It's a part of the
family curse, I guess.

377
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,034
What's that?

378
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,403
Oh, I'm just joking.

379
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,215
What, you never heard of
the curse of the Von Erichs?

380
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,617
No.

381
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:43,819
- Really?
- No.

382
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:47,590
Oh, it's uh...
it's a silly story.

383
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:48,857
Hmm?

384
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,860
My dad changed his
last name to Von Erich,

385
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,086
which was my
grandma's last name.

386
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:58,524
And I don't know, I guess her
family had all sorts of tragedy.

387
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,869
So, when my brother died,

388
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:04,463
people started saying
that it was this curse.

389
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:07,533
But I don't believe
in any of that.

390
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:10,269
I know it was all just bad luck.

391
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,817
Well, I don't believe in curses,

392
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,743
and I don't believe in luck.

393
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,578
I think we make our own luck.

394
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,482
You're lucky then.

395
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,275
- Kev.
- Hey, Pop.

396
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:44,036
Get in here. Come
in, Son. Sit down.

397
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,908
Big news for you.

398
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:53,421
I booked Harley Race to
come to the Sportatorium.

399
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:57,016
You are gonna fight the
World Heavyweight Champion.

400
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,194
No way.

401
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,887
You kidding me, Pop?

402
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:04,132
Your first match will
be a non-title fight,

403
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:08,603
but if you put a whooping on him and show
the world who you are and what you can do,

404
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,906
you will become the
number one contender

405
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,041
for the World
Heavyweight Championship

406
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,867
and get your title shot.

407
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:17,269
Pop, thank you.

408
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,472
Thank you. I... I will
make you so proud.

409
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,443
I've dreamed of having that belt
in this house my whole career

410
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:29,424
but the NWA never gave
me the chance I deserved.

411
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,794
I got close many times,

412
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,262
but they always robbed
me at the last minute.

413
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,899
So you have to take
this opportunity.

414
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:39,591
You can be the one to
bring it home for us.

415
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,095
Yes, sir.

416
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:48,310
I am the four-time World
Heavyweight Champion.

417
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:54,334
Me, Harley Race, the real
World Heavyweight Champion.

418
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,552
Not any of this plastic nonsense

419
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:00,646
that you all parade
around with, out there.

420
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,626
You have all these
guys walking around

421
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,620
talking loud about
how they are the man.

422
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:15,194
Ric Flair, Dusty
Rhodes, Tommy Rich,

423
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:19,165
or one of your snot-nosed
Von Erich kids.

424
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,901
Well,

425
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:28,240
this belt is the only
measure of who is the man.

426
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:31,410
And that man is me.

427
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:37,993
The World's Heavyweight
Champion, Harley Race.

428
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,024
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen,

429
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,993
and welcome to an exciting night

430
00:29:11,017 --> 00:29:14,529
of World Class Championship
Wrestling on ESPN.

431
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:17,565
Tonight, we have a
momentous main event,

432
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,703
NWA World Heavyweight Champ
Harley Race is in town

433
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:26,108
to take on Texas
Champion, Kevin Von Erich.

434
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:35,650
And here we go, folks.

435
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,485
You can feel the excitement here

436
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,823
at the world-famous Sportatorium
in downtown Dallas, Texas.

437
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:42,224
As that man right there,

438
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:44,259
local hero Kevin Von Erich

439
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,594
faces his biggest
challenge to date.

440
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:51,723
Four-time World Champion,
the indomitable Harley Race.

441
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,370
What an occasion this
is for Von Erich family.

442
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:58,841
The 3,500 fans in the building
and everyone watching at home

443
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:02,744
as we are broadcasting in 62
countries around the world.

444
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:05,337
All eyes are on this contest.

445
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,316
Now this is a non-title fight.

446
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,218
The belt cannot change
hands here, tonight.

447
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:13,088
But it is a tremendous
opportunity for Kevin.

448
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:16,791
If he can win, he would become
the number one contender.

449
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:19,794
And they lock up,

450
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,188
Harley Race overpowering
Kevin into the corner.

451
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,269
And he delivers a big
blow to the midsection,

452
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:29,604
knocks the wind
right out of him.

453
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,239
Not a great start
for the young man

454
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,943
looking to make an
impression here tonight.

455
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,880
And a devastating shot to the
lower back puts Kevin on the mat.

456
00:30:37,904 --> 00:30:39,714
He's lining up a big shot,

457
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,850
and Kevin blocks it
and returns a punch.

458
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:43,809
Connects once. Twice.

459
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,321
And three times.

460
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,924
Hits Harley Race again
pretty hard on that one.

461
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,494
Kevin coming off the
ropes with a clothesline.

462
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,596
The champ doesn't budge.

463
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,664
Kevin again off the ropes.
Oh, and he knocks him down!

464
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,667
He knocks down the old
oak tree, Harley Race,

465
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,070
with a spectacular
flying clothesline.

466
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:04,439
But the champ is right
back up. Shaking it off.

467
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:06,474
Kevin goes straight
into a bear hug.

468
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,510
Looking for that
belly-to-back suplex.

469
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,145
Hey, break it
off. Break it off!

470
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:12,447
Oh, and a low blow.

471
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,249
Oh, I don't think
the ref saw that.

472
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:16,251
Kevin's struggling now.

473
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:20,355
A vicious tactic from Race who looks
to get back on top in this contest.

474
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,581
Let's go for a ride, kid.

475
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,162
Oh, and he... he tosses
Kevin over the top rope.

476
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:30,822
My goodness! Kevin crashes
down on that concrete floor.

477
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:36,671
Race, absolutely ruthless,
gets Kevin in a suplex.

478
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:38,673
Oh, no. I hope he doesn't
do it. And he does!

479
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:41,776
Harley Race puts
a standing suplex

480
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,079
on Kevin Von Erich, directly
onto the concrete floor.

481
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:49,384
Kevin is down. This
crowd is stunned!

482
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,888
Kevin is not moving, folks.
Kevin Von Erich is not moving.

483
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,490
Harley Race gets
back up to the ring.

484
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,549
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!

485
00:31:58,517 --> 00:31:59,751
One!

486
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:03,355
Two!

487
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:07,202
Three!

488
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,372
Come on! Get up!

489
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:11,597
Four!

490
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:14,366
Five!

491
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:17,803
Six!

492
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:22,350
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!

493
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,775
Seven!

494
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:28,690
Eight!

495
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:30,592
He's starting to step up!

496
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:31,984
Nine!

497
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:37,966
Unbelievable what this
man has been through.

498
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,769
He's seen it all. He's...
Well, he's self-sacrificed.

499
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,871
He's worked very, very hard,

500
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,308
and here he is, back in
the ring with Harley Race.

501
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:51,746
Kick to the ribs! That
has to do some damage.

502
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,915
And this is why Harley Race

503
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:56,375
is the most dominant
champion of our time.

504
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,287
Kevin's gasping for air

505
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,923
as Race gets him into
yet another suplex.

506
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:05,427
But Kevin spins out and
a knee right in the jaw,

507
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,962
knocking the champ
flat on his back.

508
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,897
He's back in this match.

509
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,934
And here he comes off the
ropes. And a big splash!

510
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,569
This could be it!

511
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,104
- One, two...
- One, two!

512
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:18,773
And Race gouges Kevin's eyes!

513
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:21,076
The ref cautioning, but
he doesn't wanna hear.

514
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,810
Oh, and he throws the ref out!

515
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,613
And that's it. Surely,
he will be disqualified.

516
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,283
Yes, and there's
the bell, folks.

517
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:29,617
The boos ring out.

518
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:32,620
The fans did not want
to see it end like this.

519
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,357
<i>And the winner by
disqualification,</i>

520
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:37,225
<i>Kevin Von Erich.</i>

521
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,427
Oh, oh, here comes
David Von Erich!

522
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:44,823
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

523
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,203
I dare you to come back in!

524
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:50,496
Harley Race, I dare you!

525
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:57,812
Go on! Get out of here! You
ain't got no place here!

526
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,441
Harley Race.

527
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:06,745
You coward.

528
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:11,717
You afraid I was gonna beat you

529
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,455
so...

530
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:22,137
Harley Race, tonight,

531
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:25,507
we showed you what
we're made of.

532
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:27,709
All right?

533
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:31,803
You came into our
building with our fans...

534
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,482
And my brother here

535
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:37,243
put a good old-fashioned
Texas whooping on you.

536
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,090
You are the past, my friend.

537
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:43,791
We are the future of this sport.

538
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:47,395
So, you keep on running,
but everyone sees you.

539
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,797
Oh, yeah. Everyone sees you.

540
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,766
And we'll catch you

541
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,569
whether you're man enough
to stop back through Dallas

542
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,838
or if we have to chase
you down in Missouri.

543
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,840
My brother here
deserves his rematch

544
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:02,644
and he will fight you anywhere,
anytime for a fair shot

545
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:05,947
at that NWA World
Heavyweight title.

546
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:19,151
You were long getting up.

547
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:24,089
Yeah. I've just never hit
the floor that hard before.

548
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:28,536
You gotta take it and get up.

549
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,329
Yeah, I know.

550
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,499
He wasn't supposed to
throw me out of the ring.

551
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:36,110
Caught me off guard.

552
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,603
There was nothing I could do.

553
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,473
I physically... I
just couldn't move.

554
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,042
This is how they test you.

555
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:51,025
- Did I do enough to get my rematch?
- Of course, you did.

556
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:52,794
We'll see.

557
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:56,021
Those rat bastards will use any
excuse they can to screw us over.

558
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,157
But I'll chase 'em.

559
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,294
David.

560
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,898
Great on the mic,
Son. Really great.

561
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,369
We'll get you out on the road,

562
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:12,671
get you some more exposure.

563
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:14,640
Okay.

564
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:24,025
Hey, listen. Dad's
downplaying it

565
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:25,893
'cause he doesn't wanna
get your hopes up.

566
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,295
But you were
incredible out there.

567
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:29,431
Why didn't you let me talk?

568
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:30,756
Well, you didn't.

569
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:33,892
You should've let me talk.

570
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,331
Yeah, I'm sorry, Kev, I
thought I was helping.

571
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:45,012
Hey, smile, man.

572
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,196
You just beat the World
Heavyweight Champion out there.

573
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,356
All right, Kerry, let's
make this a big one.

574
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,914
Ready?

575
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,485
You all set?

576
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,439
<i>In my judgment,
what we are doing</i>

577
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:20,074
<i>is preserving the principles
and the quality of the Olympics,</i>

578
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,009
<i>not destroying it.</i>

579
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:26,781
<i>It is absolutely imperative
that we and other nations</i>

580
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,717
<i>who believe in freedom and
who believe in human rights,</i>

581
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:34,756
<i>let our voices be heard
in an absolutely clear way</i>

582
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,760
<i>and not add the
imprimatur of approval</i>

583
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:41,663
<i>to the Soviet Union
and its government</i>

584
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:47,687
<i>while they have 105,000 heavily armed
invading forces in the freedom-loving,</i>

585
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:51,129
<i>and innocent, and deeply
religious country of Afghanistan.</i>

586
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:55,377
<i>And I hope recognition
of a grateful nation</i>

587
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:57,545
<i>will at least partially make up</i>

588
00:38:57,569 --> 00:39:00,448
<i>for the sacrifice that you'll
have to make this summer</i>

589
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:04,009
<i>in not going to Moscow
for the Summer Olympics.</i>

590
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:11,049
<i>I can't say at this moment
what other nations will not go.</i>

591
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,886
<i>Ours will not go.</i>

592
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:50,989
Hi!

593
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,059
- Hey!
- Kerry.

594
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:03,068
Welcome home, Kerry.

595
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,775
I'm sorry it didn't
work out, Pop.

596
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:12,077
Me too, Son.

597
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,846
- Hey.
- Hey, Ma.

598
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:20,428
- Hey.
- Hey, boys. Hi.

599
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:21,896
Come here, man.

600
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,065
Oh, Mikey. Look at you!

601
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,867
Ready, set!

602
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:27,192
Hike!

603
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,310
You're the fastest
in the family, Kev!

604
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:38,412
No one could ever catch you.

605
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,271
You still got it, Son.

606
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:44,786
Gotta put him on his ass before
he breaks past you, Kerry.

607
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,212
Blue 82. Hut, hike!

608
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,928
That's how you make
a hit on someone.

609
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,763
- What?
- What? Come on!

610
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,558
Hut, hike!

611
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,910
You gotta dive for them, Mike.

612
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:10,712
You gotta lay out for that.

613
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:12,079
Come on, Son.

614
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,304
Hike!

615
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:19,310
Oh, my God, look at that!

616
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:23,958
That's why you're the best
linebacker in the state, Kerry!

617
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,093
Coach Royal called me from UT.

618
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:28,530
He said, "Why is the best
linebacker in the state"

619
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:30,632
"watching from the stands?"

620
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:32,157
Good job, Son.

621
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:35,570
- Hey, Pam.
- Hmm?

622
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:38,239
I can pour you some more...
more lemonade or something.

623
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:39,998
Sure, thanks, Mike.

624
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:44,045
You keep a hold on her,
Son. She's a good one.

625
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:46,548
You put that down, someone
else will pick it up.

626
00:41:46,572 --> 00:41:47,949
Yes, sir.

627
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:50,985
Hey, I, uh... I saw
the new show, Pop.

628
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,620
It's great.

629
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:55,156
And I was real proud watching
you fight Harley, Kev.

630
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,758
Thanks, Kerry.

631
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:58,950
Now, when's the rematch?

632
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,529
Uh, I'm not sure yet.

633
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:03,064
We just haven't got the call.

634
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:04,823
- Oh.
- I'm working on it.

635
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,368
Hey, Ker, you see all
the new camera angles?

636
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:09,837
- They're cool, right?
- Yep.

637
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,640
We're talking about
wrestling, not camera angles.

638
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:15,476
Your brother fought the World
Champion on national TV.

639
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,468
Who gives a damn
about camera angles?

640
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,114
Hey, how's the
music coming, Mike?

641
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:22,674
Hmm? Hey, what do you play?

642
00:42:23,642 --> 00:42:25,486
Lots of things. Um...

643
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:29,547
Viola, violin, piano,
some other instruments.

644
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:32,483
Musical like his father.

645
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:35,129
What?

646
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:36,964
Dad's musical?

647
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,000
When I first met your father,

648
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:41,202
he was classically
trained on the clarinet

649
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:44,038
and had a Music scholarship
to University of Texas.

650
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,573
Wow.

651
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:47,474
But he gave it up to play
football at Southern Methodist.

652
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:48,743
Wow.

653
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:51,045
Decided there was
no future in music.

654
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,648
I chose sport and I was right.

655
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:58,720
He used to play the most
beautiful pieces for me

656
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:00,378
when we first dated.

657
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,223
Aww.

658
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,726
Such a well-rounded man.

659
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,251
Not like anyone I ever met.

660
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:09,087
Dottie, please.

661
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:14,736
I've been meaning
to tell everyone, I

662
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,170
well, I got this...

663
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:18,740
I got this quartet that
I'm a part of from school

664
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:23,611
and um, well, we... we
actually have a gig.

665
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:26,547
- Yeah?
- Michael, that's great. When?

666
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:28,582
That's the thing. It's

667
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,618
well, it's tonight
at UT, Dallas.

668
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:33,020
Oh. No.

669
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:36,090
You're too young to set
foot on a university campus

670
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,192
- on a Saturday night.
- Ma... Kev...

671
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:40,361
Kev went on national
tour at 17. Excuse me.

672
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:42,120
That was for work.

673
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,431
Your mom said no and
that's the end of it.

674
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,457
This is work. We're...
We're getting paid.

675
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:52,573
- I mean, we could take him.
- Yeah. Yeah, we could.

676
00:43:52,597 --> 00:43:54,599
He could play the gig, and
we'll leave right after.

677
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,078
- Sure.
- No.

678
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:59,280
The answer is no.

679
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,474
Shh!

680
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:10,916
Get down, get down.

681
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:23,829
Okay, come on.

682
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:45,016
Watch out.

683
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,233
Oh, yeah.

684
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,361
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

Yeah, Kerry can put

705
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,868
That's good. He's
letting off steam.

706

So, what do you think?
Like, we're a lot.

707

Ow.

- Yeah?

717
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,105
Have you ever?

What? Why?

719
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,479
Why, would that be a problem?

720

What? No. No, no,
no. Not at all, no.

721

What is it then?

722
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:01,179
I just, uh... I just...

Honey, never?

Not never, never.

Oh, Kevin, you sweet thing.

726
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,539
Okay.

727
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:40,361
<i>One, two, three!</i>

728
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:43,064
<i>He did it! He did it!</i>

729
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:45,432
<i>Ric Flair has just defeated</i>

730
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:49,270

Champion, Harley Race!</i>

<i>There you see, he's up

732
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,331
<i>Ric Flair, the new...</i>

733
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:34,105
- Kerry.
- Yes, sir.

734
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,552
I don't know if you've been
thinking about your future,

735
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:40,887
but you should think
about wrestling.

736
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,624
Now, I wouldn't wish
wrestling on any of you.

737
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,692
I only wrestled to
provide for you all.

738
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:48,362
And I always hoped you boys
would choose another profession.

739
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:50,464
But the Olympics has
been taken from you

740
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,857
the way professional
football was taken from me.

741
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:57,071
The world keeps taking from
us, and I'm sick of it.

742
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:58,972
I wanna fight back.

743
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:02,576
And the more of us in
it together, the better.

744
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,813
So, Kerry, I want you to join
your brothers in the ring.

745
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,006
Yes, sir, I'd love that.

746
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:11,952
Glad to hear it, Son.

747
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:13,544
Thank you.

748
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:23,664
Get you training,
little brother.

749
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:24,922
Whoo!

750
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:27,958
Okay!

751
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:55,689
One, two...

752
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:08,293
Come on!

753
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:21,939
Whoo!

754
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:03,123
We get Kerry front-row St. Louis
and the crowd was electrified.

755
00:53:03,147 --> 00:53:05,883
He's gonna be World
Heavyweight Champion one day.

756
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:09,763
You aren't pressing.
This is pressing.

757
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,765
You feel that? You feel that?

758
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:12,833
Now push.

759
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:15,168
Damn it! Well, you
gotta get this!

760
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:19,039
Freebirds, ever since
you've arrived in the WCCW,

761
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:22,276
you've done nothing but lie, bully and cheat
your way to victory. And we're sick of it.

762
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,010
There you go!

763
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,947
Now, you've made this about
Georgia versus Texas and it isn't.

764
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:29,206
It's about filth versus
decency. And you know it.

765
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,653
And we're here today to
restore justice and order

766
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:34,087
to the wrestling federation

767
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:37,123
that our father built
with his own two hands.

768
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:39,693
The hands that were
passed down to us.

769
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:42,329
The hands that will deliver
the Iron Claw to you.

770
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:54,875
Whoo!

771
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:09,923
<i>Welcome to WCCW.</i>

772
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:14,485
<i>The only promotion being

773
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:20,000
<i>To my left at a combined

00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:35,482
<i>And the challengers</i>

778
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:37,484
<i>from Denton, Texas,</i>

779
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:42,188
<i>weighing in at a combined
weight of 690 pounds,</i>

780
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:48,212
<i>Kevin, Kerry, and
David Von Erich!</i>

781
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:01,642
It's total mayhem.

782
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:05,446
Gordy kicks out and
Hayes elbows his own man.

783
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,614
Kerry moving out of
the way just in time.

784
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:10,183
All hell has broken loose.

785
00:55:10,207 --> 00:55:13,820
Kevin tossing Michael
Hayes through the ropes,

786
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:15,889
the ref trying to
restore some order here.

787
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:17,858
He forces Kevin
back to his corner.

788
00:55:17,882 --> 00:55:20,994
Buddy Roberts comes in.
Two-on-one on Kerry.

789
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:23,897
Oh, no. But Kerry flips
Buddy over the top rope.

790
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:26,967
Kerry off the ropes
with a cross body.

791
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:30,504
Terry Gordy catches him. What
he's going to do with him?

792
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:32,439
Here comes David
with a drop kick!

793
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:35,308
Kerry falls on
Gordy. And that's it!

794
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,943
That's it!

795
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:39,012
The Von Erichs win!

796
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:41,281
What a special moment today!

797
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:47,153
<i>The winners and new NWA World's
six-man tag team champions,</i>

798
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:52,583
<i>Kevin, Kerry, and
David Von Erich!</i>

799
00:55:53,418 --> 00:55:55,829
You did it! I'm
real proud of you!

800
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,661
- So?
- Freebirds,

801
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:10,477
tonight, you saw the strength
and resilience of my family.

802
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:17,117
We're sending a
message to Sam Muchnick

803
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:21,321
and every other territory
out there in the NWA.

804
00:56:21,345 --> 00:56:25,526
WCCW is the best
in the business!

805
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,723
The Von Erichs are the
best in the business!

806
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,938
And we're coming for y'all.

807
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,207
Well, Fritz, calling out the man

808
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,877
who runs the NWA on air by name.

809
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:46,212
That's a bold and
unprecedented move.

810
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,348
It's necessary, Bill,

811
00:56:48,372 --> 00:56:52,519
because I will make it my
life's work to see to it

812
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:55,355
that David Von Erich
will be the next.

813
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:58,692
NWA World Heavyweight Champion!

814
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,232
And then each and
every one of my sons

815
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,903
starting with Kevin,
then Kerry, then Mike.

816
00:57:14,565 --> 00:57:19,446
All one day will lift that
World Heavyweight title belt,

817
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:23,884
because the Von Erichs
are and will forever be

818
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:27,888
the greatest family in
the history of wrestling!

819
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:31,124
Congratulations, boys.

820
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,083
I'm sure he doesn't
mean me first.

821
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:36,521
Pop doesn't make
mistakes like that.

822
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:40,124
Is there a problem?

823
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,260
No, sir.

824
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:32,042
Boys, I've got good news.

825
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:36,723
We are finally getting a
World Heavyweight title shot

826
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:38,348
with Ric Flair.

827
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,318
And they want it
to be you, David.

828
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,055
Don't look to your brother.

829
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:49,570
This is your time,
your opportunity.

830
00:58:49,594 --> 00:58:52,496
You've been chosen.
You earned it.

831
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,175
You'll go on the road
and feud with Flair

832
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,111
in every territory in America
over the next six months.

833
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:00,981
Then you'll go to Japan.

834
00:59:01,005 --> 00:59:03,841
You can't be World Champion
unless you win over Japan.

835
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,187
Then you'll fight with Flair
at Parade of Champions in May

836
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:08,746
at Texas Stadium.

837
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,124
Are you up for it?

838
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:12,617
Of course I am.

839
00:59:13,517 --> 00:59:15,019
I love you, Pop.

840
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:18,422
I love you too, Son.

841
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:22,002
I've waited my whole
life to have that belt.

842
00:59:22,026 --> 00:59:25,606
We've had a couple of
setbacks, but I can feel it.

843
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:29,033
If you perform, the
title will be ours.

844
00:59:31,836 --> 00:59:34,371
Now, this wouldn't be happening
without the two of you.

845
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,118
You've made your brother better,

846
00:59:38,142 --> 00:59:41,445
and your collective effort
has pushed him to the top.

847
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,248
Keep it up out there.

848
00:59:44,882 --> 00:59:47,127
You never know when your
opportunity will come.

849
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:48,853
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

850
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,328

01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:48,248
Shit, Brother.

873
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:50,250
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

874
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:52,709
Yeah... just some
stomach cramps.

875
01:01:58,816 --> 01:02:00,517
Jesus, man.

876
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:04,865
- You need to see a doctor.
- No, I'm fine.

877
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:07,591
You're not fine.

878
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:10,203
No, it's just a bug I
picked up on the road.

879
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,738
Don't worry about it.

880
01:02:18,702 --> 01:02:22,082
Maybe you're pushing too hard.

881
01:02:22,106 --> 01:02:23,740
You need to rest.

882
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,276
I'm almost there.

883
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:30,356
You think it's gonna slow down
when you become world champion?

884
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:34,227
I'm fine, Kev. Seriously,
I'm just sick. I'll be good.

885
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,486
I don't think you should
go to Japan next week.

886
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:44,237
Okay. All right, yeah.

887
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:45,538
- Shit.
- For sure.

888
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:57,074
- Hey, Dave.
- Hmm?

889
01:02:58,375 --> 01:02:59,944
I just wanna say,

890
01:03:00,911 --> 01:03:03,948
I didn't take it so well,
you jumping me and all.

891
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:06,783
I understand.

892
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,288
I got pretty angry.

893
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:15,292
Not at you. Just at
the whole situation.

894
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,764
Thing is, I didn't even
really want it that bad.

895
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:25,735
I just love being out
there with you guys.

896
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:30,474
It's the only thing
that matters to me.

897
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:36,422
Look at you, man.
Married two hours

898
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:38,724
and already losing
your competitive edge.

899
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:42,219
Maybe.

900
01:03:45,923 --> 01:03:48,692
I'll be pretty happy to
focus on my family, though.

901
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:51,228
Family?

902
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:54,474
Turns out this is
a shotgun wedding.

903
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:57,410
- You rat bastard.
- Don't tell anyone.

904
01:03:57,434 --> 01:03:59,445
Goddamn it, Kev!

905
01:04:00,704 --> 01:04:03,107
Oh, man, that makes me so happy.

906
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:05,042
Shit.

907
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:08,821
- I'm gonna be an uncle?
- Yes, sir.

908
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,580
Gonna be an uncle, all right.

909
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:14,294
I'm happy for you guys. Now we
got some dancing to do. Come on.

910
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:15,695
Hold on. Let me look
at you real quick.

911
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:17,263
No, I'm good. Let's go.

They're a great couple.

924
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:48,661
Reminds me of a
couple I knew once.

925

How about we get
out of here, Dottie?

926
01:04:53,924 --> 01:04:55,725
Well, I could use some air.

927
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:58,795
We could take advantage
of the situation.

928
01:04:59,496 --> 01:05:01,265
No boys in the house.

929
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:05,302
And I don't have to worry about
you getting me pregnant anymore.

930
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,671
Big stud.

Pop, what is it?

945
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:37,127
David.

946
01:06:39,596 --> 01:06:40,997
What happened?

947
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:45,835
He died in his
hotel room in Japan.

948
01:06:49,706 --> 01:06:51,641
A ruptured intestine.

949
01:06:57,714 --> 01:06:59,283
How does that happen?

950
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:19,569
Take those sunglasses off.

951
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:23,707
All of you.

952
01:07:24,808 --> 01:07:26,076
No hiding.

953
01:07:27,111 --> 01:07:29,012
And I don't wanna see any tears.

954
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:34,194
The Lord decided it was
time for David to move on.

955
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:36,296
We have to accept that.

956
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,365
In his 25 years, he lived
75 years' worth of life.

957
01:08:31,241 --> 01:08:35,555
<i>Kev, sorry I sent
this to the house.</i>

958
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:37,447
<i>I couldn't remember
your new address.</i>

959
01:08:38,248 --> 01:08:40,025
<i>I miss you, Brother.</i>

960
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:42,362
<i>You gotta come
with me next time.</i>

961
01:08:42,386 --> 01:08:43,987
<i>It's wild over here.</i>

962
01:08:45,922 --> 01:08:47,567
<i>Someone asked me for
an autograph today</i>

963
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:49,159
<i>because they thought I was you.</i>

964
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,329
<i>It made me very happy.</i>

965
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,711
<i>I'll probably be home by
the time you get this,</i>

966
01:08:58,735 --> 01:09:00,646
<i>so this is stupid.</i>

967
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,372
<i>But just wanted to send.</i>

968
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:05,542
<i>See you soon.</i>

969
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:41,144
Come on, hon.

970
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:55,024
I am here if you wanna talk.

971
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,861
No. I'm good.

972
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:07,371
It's hard to see clearly
in this dark moment,

973
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,510
but we cannot let this
tragedy define us.

974
01:10:16,246 --> 01:10:20,083
Our greatness will be measured
by our response to adversity.

975
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:27,166
Now, David's title
match against Ric Flair

976
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:30,560
at Parade of Champions is
a moment of a lifetime.

977
01:10:32,128 --> 01:10:36,409
We still have a chance to bring the
World Heavyweight Championship home

978
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:40,670
if one of you will step up
and wrestle in his place.

979
01:10:41,705 --> 01:10:44,183
Everything we have ever
worked for in the ring

980
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:46,075
is riding on this moment.

981
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:50,780
I'll do it.

982
01:10:52,882 --> 01:10:54,551
I can do it, Dad.

983
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,954
I can do it, too.

984
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:00,966
Kerry, I'll do it.

985
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,392
I'm ready, Dad.

986
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,694
I want it.

987
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:08,040
You don't have to. It's my mess.

988
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:09,709
No! I deserve it, too!

989
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:11,577
Boys, boys.

990
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,303
It's a tough decision.

991
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:16,081
You are the oldest, Kev,

992
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,207
but Kerry's been getting
the most heat lately.

993
01:11:19,843 --> 01:11:21,511
We're gonna flip a coin.

994
01:11:22,245 --> 01:11:24,247
That's the only
fair way to decide.

995
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:29,786
Heads for Kerry.
Tails for Kevin.

996
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:43,809
<i>Texas Stadium, please welcome
the modern-day warrior,</i>

997
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:48,237
<i>Kerry Von Erich!</i>

998
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:11,637
<i>35,000 people
here to celebrate</i>

999
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:13,473
<i>the life of David Von Erich.</i>

1000
01:12:13,497 --> 01:12:15,975
<i>Make sure you're on for his
brother, Kerry Von Erich.</i>

1001
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:19,244
<i>Ric Flair here,
can't find a handle.</i>

1002
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:22,748
<i>The champion is always the
favourite in a match like this.</i>

1003
01:12:22,772 --> 01:12:24,917
<i>Here on the biggest stage.</i>

1004
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:29,455
<i>Step over to the hold from Flair,
and Kerry puts a stop to that.</i>

1005
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:30,647
<i>He knocks it away.</i>

1006
01:12:31,147 --> 01:12:34,460
<i>Here's Flair, to the ropes.
Wants to toss Kerry, but...</i>

1007
01:12:34,484 --> 01:12:37,162
<i>Kerry's... Kerry's got him.
He's got him in a backslide.</i>

1008
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:40,966
<i>There's the pin. Two, three!</i>

1009
01:12:42,826 --> 01:12:46,138
<i>Kerry Von Erich, the NWA
World Heavyweight Champion!</i>

1010
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:49,274
<i>He wins it for his brother
David, for his father Fritz,</i>

1011
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:51,811
<i>and for the whole
Von Erich family!</i>

1012
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:56,682
<i>The winner and new World
Heavyweight Champion,</i>

1013
01:12:56,706 --> 01:13:00,252
<i>Kerry Von Erich!</i>

1014
01:13:11,655 --> 01:13:15,435
Hey, I didn't know
you were still here.

1015
01:13:15,459 --> 01:13:17,226
Yeah, just helping Pop.

1016
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:20,096
I'm about to head home.

1017
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,701
How you doing?

1018
01:13:28,371 --> 01:13:30,883
I'm having trouble coming down.

1019
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,518
Yeah.

1020
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:34,143
Yeah, I bet.

1021
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:43,953
I can't believe it's
finally in our family.

1022
01:13:47,524 --> 01:13:48,558
Yeah.

1023
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:58,968
You know what? I think I'm gonna
go for a ride or something.

1024
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:03,206
- All right. Yeah, be careful.
- Hmm.

1025
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:08,612
- Hey, Ker.
- Yeah.

1026
01:14:10,013 --> 01:14:11,380
You were great today.

1027
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:18,054
Thank you.

1028
01:16:40,363 --> 01:16:42,031
Is everything correct?

1029
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:48,648
Actually, his last
name will be Adkisson.

1030
01:16:48,672 --> 01:16:50,515
That's my birth name.

1031
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:52,942
- Do you have your birth certificate?
- Yes, I do.

1032
01:16:57,046 --> 01:16:58,457
- Thank you.
- Let me update it

1033
01:16:58,481 --> 01:16:59,725
and I'll be right back.

1034
01:16:59,749 --> 01:17:01,493
- Mmm-hmm.
- Thanks.

1035
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:03,595
Are you sure you
want to do that?

1036
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,088
No.

1037
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:08,668
I just... I'll feel
safer for him, I think.

1038
01:17:08,692 --> 01:17:11,527
Kev, you know it's got
nothing to do with the name.

1039
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:13,629
Yeah, I know.

1040
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:18,001
Don't cross your
damn feet. Shuffle.

1041
01:17:20,603 --> 01:17:22,605
Yup. Stand tall.
Use your height!

1042
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:27,419
Hey! That doesn't mean
anything, all right?

1043
01:17:27,443 --> 01:17:29,412
Twist it again, make
it mean something.

1044
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:32,557
Headlock.

1045
01:17:34,784 --> 01:17:37,262
Keep that S grip tight. I
don't wanna see any windows.

1046
01:17:37,286 --> 01:17:39,064
There's no air in there.

1047
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:41,490
Switch your hips.
Switch your feet.

1048
01:17:43,026 --> 01:17:45,404
Come on, Goddamn it!
Switch your feet!

1049
01:17:45,428 --> 01:17:47,163
- Like that?
- Yes.

1050
01:17:49,565 --> 01:17:50,976
There it is.

1051
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,045
Let's do it again.
It's... it's still not...

1052
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:55,247
It's fine, Mike. You're
doing fine. Just keep going.

1053
01:17:55,271 --> 01:17:56,439
Circle up.

1054
01:17:59,575 --> 01:18:02,154
Michael Von Erich,
moving around the ring.

1055
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,655
He looks ready for this match.

1056
01:18:39,482 --> 01:18:40,817
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1057
01:18:42,285 --> 01:18:44,864
Come on. Where does it hurt?

1058
01:18:44,888 --> 01:18:46,531
Come here! Come here.

1059
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,667
- Ow!
- Where does it hurt?

1060
01:19:09,846 --> 01:19:12,224
- Hey, Doc.
- Kevin. Fritz.

1061
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:13,382
How'd it go?

1062
01:19:14,217 --> 01:19:18,030
Um... we completed the
surgery as planned.

1063
01:19:18,054 --> 01:19:21,233
We repaired the shoulder, but it
was trickier than we anticipated.

1064
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:23,368
<i>Mike's temperature skyrocketed.</i>

1065
01:19:23,392 --> 01:19:25,004
<i>We worked really hard
to bring it down,</i>

1066
01:19:25,028 --> 01:19:26,405
<i>but it was close to 107 degrees</i>

1067
01:19:26,429 --> 01:19:28,040
<i>for almost two hours.</i>

1068
01:19:28,064 --> 01:19:31,076
<i>We believe he suffered
toxic shock syndrome.</i>

1069
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,078
<i>What does that mean?</i>

1070
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:35,304
<i>I'm sorry to say that
Mike is in a coma.</i>

1071
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,350
<i>What? How?</i>

1072
01:19:38,374 --> 01:19:40,085
<i>It was a routine
shoulder surgery.</i>

1073
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:42,445
<i>Well, it's rare,
but it happens.</i>

1074
01:19:43,646 --> 01:19:46,691
<i>All we can do now is wait
and pray he pulls through.</i>

1075
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:48,184
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

1076
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:55,224
<i>Why is this happening to us?</i>

1077
01:19:58,227 --> 01:20:00,005
Why does it just keep happening?

1078
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:03,208
<i>Okay, baby, stay
with me. Okay?</i>

1079
01:20:03,232 --> 01:20:05,001
But it keeps happening.

1080
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:08,280
It's taken over.

1081
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:11,183
<i>It was a terrible accident.</i>

1082
01:20:11,207 --> 01:20:13,185
<i>Nothing more.</i>

1083
01:20:13,209 --> 01:20:15,287
He shouldn't have
even been in the ring.

1084
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,180
<i>This is not your fault.</i>

1085
01:20:18,114 --> 01:20:20,926
<i>If you want to blame someone,
you blame your father,</i>

1086
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:23,228
<i>but it is not your fault.</i>

1087
01:20:23,252 --> 01:20:25,931
- I should've stopped him.
<i>- No. No.</i>

1088
01:20:25,955 --> 01:20:27,532
<i>What could you do, Kevin?</i>

1089
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:30,026
<i>There is no getting
through to that man.</i>

1090
01:20:42,005 --> 01:20:44,349
Hey. Hey, hon.
I'm late for work,

1091
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:46,685
and I can't get him to settle.

1092
01:20:46,709 --> 01:20:49,345
Can you take him for me?

1093
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:52,324
- I can't.
- What? Just...

1094
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,793
Okay, just take him till your
mom gets here. I gotta go.

1095
01:20:54,817 --> 01:20:57,229
I can't.

1096
01:20:57,253 --> 01:20:58,621
Kevin?

1097
01:21:00,556 --> 01:21:03,268
Kevin! Come on.

1098
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:05,504
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Here.

1099
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:07,106
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

1100
01:21:12,668 --> 01:21:13,903
Hey.

1101
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:19,075
It's okay.

1102
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:24,756
It's okay.

1103
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,458
<i>Thank you all for coming,</i>

1104
01:21:26,482 --> 01:21:29,852
and thank you all
the love and support.

1105
01:21:30,753 --> 01:21:33,098
Hey, Mike, are
you feeling okay?

1106
01:21:33,122 --> 01:21:34,390
Yeah.

1107
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:40,296
We're all just so excited
that Mike pulled through.

1108
01:21:41,664 --> 01:21:43,532
Shows how much of
a fighter he is.

1109
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:46,135
And uh

1110
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:49,048
after losing David, it's just

1111
01:21:49,072 --> 01:21:51,440
it's too much to think that
we almost lost Mike, too.

1112
01:21:54,843 --> 01:22:00,025
I... I'm moved that, uh,

1113
01:22:00,049 --> 01:22:05,164
my whole family is here
with me through everything.

1114
01:22:05,188 --> 01:22:06,522
And uh

1115
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:13,062
that y'all out
there sent flowers.

1116
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:15,931
Uh,

1117
01:22:16,832 --> 01:22:20,036
and um, I'm thankful
to everyone.

1118
01:22:20,836 --> 01:22:23,772
So what's the time frame for
your return to the ring, Mike?

1119
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:28,487
I know I'll be back,

1120
01:22:28,511 --> 01:22:30,522
uh... soon.

1121
01:22:30,546 --> 01:22:32,615
Yeah, soon.

1122
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:37,762
Mike's a fighter more than
people even realize, I think.

1123
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:42,225
And... he's gonna be back
in the ring in no time.

1124
01:23:59,702 --> 01:24:02,947
One, two, three!

1125
01:24:05,341 --> 01:24:06,575
Whoo!

1126
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:40,896
Fuck!

1127
01:26:48,136 --> 01:26:50,539
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1128
01:26:56,479 --> 01:27:00,583
That's the house I grew
up in. I painted that.

1129
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:05,621
What... what? Why
didn't you tell anyone?

1130
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:08,867
I had my reasons.

1131
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:11,059
Just don't remember 'em anymore.

1132
01:27:15,798 --> 01:27:17,433
I'm scared, Ma.

1133
01:27:21,704 --> 01:27:24,316
God loves you, Michael.

1134
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:26,509
There is nothing
to be scared of.

1135
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,913
I'm not David.

1136
01:27:32,848 --> 01:27:34,249
What?

1137
01:27:35,551 --> 01:27:37,886
Everybody wants me to be David,

1138
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,456
but I can't replace him.

1139
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:35,511
♪ I've got a fever these days

1140
01:28:38,947 --> 01:28:43,728

♪ I wanna live

1145
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:06,609
Ow!

1146
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:16,227
I see how much pain you're in.

1147
01:29:16,251 --> 01:29:19,254
We can't rush this. It's
gonna take time, Kerry.

1148
01:29:20,322 --> 01:29:22,967
I'm ready. I'm ready. Again!

1149
01:29:22,991 --> 01:29:25,837
Maybe this is God trying
to tell you to slow down.

1150
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:27,439
Huh?

1151
01:29:27,463 --> 01:29:29,908
Maybe you should do something
else with your life.

1152
01:29:29,932 --> 01:29:31,233
Why?

1153
01:29:32,435 --> 01:29:34,470
So, you're the only
brother left in the ring?

1154
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:38,082
You get all Daddy's
attention? Fuck you.

1155
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:40,819
I want you in the ring! I
can't do this by myself!

1156
01:29:40,843 --> 01:29:43,211
Come on! Come on!

1157
01:29:43,946 --> 01:29:45,648
Can't just hide this, Kerry!

1158
01:30:02,064 --> 01:30:03,398
You want back in?

1159
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:05,333
Then get up!

1160
01:30:06,935 --> 01:30:08,904
You want back in, then get up!

1161
01:30:10,573 --> 01:30:11,840
Get up!

1162
01:30:29,692 --> 01:30:31,727
<i>I'm sorry if I hurt you,</i>

1163
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:36,098
<i>but I'm going to a better place.</i>

1164
01:30:39,067 --> 01:30:40,402
Mike!

1165
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:46,675
Mike!

1166
01:30:49,311 --> 01:30:50,613
Mikey!

1167
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:02,357
Mike!

1168
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:09,031
No, Mike! Mike!

1169
01:31:29,552 --> 01:31:32,855
Doris, honey, we should go.

1170
01:31:37,425 --> 01:31:39,294
I can't put it on.

1171
01:31:43,766 --> 01:31:45,801
Everyone will recognize it. I...

1172
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:52,007
I can't.

1173
01:31:55,377 --> 01:31:59,123
I can't. I... I need
a... a new dress.

1174
01:31:59,147 --> 01:32:01,092
Honey.

1175
01:32:01,116 --> 01:32:03,795
Honey, listen to me.
People here love you.

1176
01:32:03,819 --> 01:32:06,221
All right? They don't care.

1177
01:32:07,322 --> 01:32:08,523
Doris

1178
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:13,137
we all love you.

1179
01:32:14,997 --> 01:32:16,498
All right, come on.

1180
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:21,236
- All right.
- Come on.

1181
01:32:22,671 --> 01:32:24,472
Today we are here

1182
01:32:26,474 --> 01:32:28,510
to lay to rest our son,

1183
01:32:29,344 --> 01:32:32,523
Michael Brett Adkisson,

1184
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:36,384
my sweet, beautiful boy.

1185
01:32:39,788 --> 01:32:43,191
Kind, funny,

1186
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:45,594
and uh

1187
01:32:47,462 --> 01:32:48,731
truly good.

1188
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:53,268
Are you coming home tonight?

1189
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:03,245
I don't know.

1190
01:33:04,647 --> 01:33:06,014
I'm not sure.

1191
01:33:09,718 --> 01:33:13,965
Um, I know how
painful this is. I do.

1192
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:16,735
And uh, I'm trying
to be patient.

1193
01:33:16,759 --> 01:33:19,662
But this... this
doesn't work for me.

1194
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:23,031
- - Okay?
- I know.

1195
01:33:23,899 --> 01:33:26,845
So, just come home, all right?

1196
01:33:26,869 --> 01:33:28,570
Just be with us.

1197
01:33:30,572 --> 01:33:31,807
Hey.

1198
01:33:32,775 --> 01:33:34,509
I don't want him to get it.

1199
01:33:35,744 --> 01:33:37,421
I don't want you
guys to catch it.

1200
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:40,158
- Kevin, you can't be serious.
- I'm sorry.

1201
01:33:40,182 --> 01:33:43,094
- Just...
- I'm sorry.

1202
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:44,996
Come home.

1203
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:47,598
I can't, okay?

1204
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:49,400
Okay.

1205
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:54,596
Okay.

1206
01:35:06,634 --> 01:35:07,779
<i>Ever since I was a child,</i>

1207
01:35:07,803 --> 01:35:09,504
<i>people said my
family was cursed.</i>

1208
01:35:13,608 --> 01:35:15,643
<i>It never seemed to
worry my father.</i>

1209
01:35:18,013 --> 01:35:21,459
<i>He said if we were the
toughest, the strongest...</i>

1210
01:35:21,483 --> 01:35:23,494
<i>The toughest, the strongest.</i>

1211
01:35:23,518 --> 01:35:25,296
<i>- The most successful...</i>
<i>- The most successful,</i>

1212
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,823
<i>- the absolute best...</i>
<i>- The absolute best,</i>

1213
01:35:28,957 --> 01:35:30,869
<i>nothing could ever hurt us.</i>

1214
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,972
Faster!

1215
01:35:33,996 --> 01:35:35,898
<i>I believed him.</i>

1216
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,035
Faster!

1217
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:43,538
<i>We all did.</i>

1218
01:35:54,917 --> 01:35:57,495
<i>This match is
scheduled for one fall</i>

1219
01:35:57,519 --> 01:36:02,166
<i>and it's for the NWA World
Heavyweight Championship.</i>

1220
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:04,035
<i>Now, Ric, there's
been a lot of talk</i>

1221
01:36:04,059 --> 01:36:07,305
<i>that you've been resisting
coming down to the Sportatorium</i>

1222
01:36:07,329 --> 01:36:10,265
<i>to defend your title
against Kevin Von Erich.</i>

1223
01:36:12,901 --> 01:36:17,705
<i>It is so hard to be humble</i>

1224
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:22,710
<i>when you're looking
like Ric Flair.</i>

1225
01:36:23,545 --> 01:36:27,992
<i>You see the
difference between me</i>

1226
01:36:28,016 --> 01:36:31,495
<i>and a lot of these
so-called big-time stars</i>

1227
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:36,100
<i>is that I'm custom-made
from head to toe.</i>

1228
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:38,469
<i>That's why I've got
the biggest house,</i>

1229
01:36:38,493 --> 01:36:44,208
<i>on the biggest hill on
the biggest side of town.</i>

1230
01:36:44,232 --> 01:36:47,745
<i>That's why this sports
coat costs $800.</i>

1231
01:36:47,769 --> 01:36:49,413
<i>And I don't know
what that costs!</i>

1232
01:36:49,437 --> 01:36:51,582
<i>I'd be ashamed to wear it!</i>

1233
01:36:51,606 --> 01:36:55,719
<i>That's why I've got on lizard
shoes and a Rolex watch,</i>

1234
01:36:55,743 --> 01:36:58,957
<i>and I've got a limousine
out there, a mile long</i>

1235
01:36:58,981 --> 01:37:00,624
<i>with 25 women in it</i>

1236
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:04,228
<i>just dying for me to go,</i>

1237
01:37:04,252 --> 01:37:05,964
<i>"Whoo!"</i>

1238
01:37:05,988 --> 01:37:10,634
<i>Now, let's get to the
less pretty facts of life.</i>

1239
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:13,037
<i>Kevin, your daddy got together
with the powers that be</i>

1240
01:37:13,061 --> 01:37:15,273
<i>and ordered me back
down here to Dallas</i>

1241
01:37:15,297 --> 01:37:19,143
<i>a nothing-happenin',
second-rate sports community.</i>

1242
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:21,880
<i>I am the World's
Heavyweight Champion,</i>

1243
01:37:21,904 --> 01:37:24,815
<i>because I am the greatest
wrestler alive today,</i>

1244
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:27,318
<i>the toughest
wrestler alive today.</i>

1245
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:31,189
<i>I have bled and
sweat for this title</i>

1246
01:37:31,213 --> 01:37:34,658
<i>and no daddy's boy is
going to take that from me.</i>

1247
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:37,352
<i>This is professional wrestling.</i>

1248
01:37:38,253 --> 01:37:41,799
<i>It is the most grueling of
all professional sports.</i>

1249
01:37:41,823 --> 01:37:45,961
<i>I've been stabbed,
hit by chairs,</i>

1250
01:37:47,029 --> 01:37:49,140
<i>beat up by everybody.</i>

1251
01:37:49,164 --> 01:37:50,641
<i>I don't cry.</i>

1252
01:37:50,665 --> 01:37:53,811
<i>I don't complain. I carry on.</i>

1253
01:37:53,835 --> 01:37:56,080
<i>But the bottom line is...</i>

1254
01:37:56,104 --> 01:37:57,949
<i>- You're denying...</i>
<i>- I am talking right now.</i>

1255
01:37:57,973 --> 01:38:00,084
<i>Hey, listen to me! Listen to me.</i>

1256
01:38:00,108 --> 01:38:02,720
<i>I'll tell you what, you like
talking to me on the show.</i>

1257
01:38:02,744 --> 01:38:04,956
<i>You'll listen to me
talk while I'm out here.</i>

1258
01:38:06,681 --> 01:38:10,285
<i>The bottom line is,
if you're a man,</i>

1259
01:38:12,187 --> 01:38:13,831
<i>you take the ups and downs.</i>

1260
01:38:13,855 --> 01:38:17,368
<i>If you're a real man,
you'll never go down.</i>

1261
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:18,893
<i>You'll just stay up.</i>

1262
01:38:20,395 --> 01:38:24,066
<i>That's why I am the World's
Heavyweight Champion.</i>

1263
01:38:25,533 --> 01:38:27,979
<i>And I can go through
Kevin Von Erich,</i>

1264
01:38:28,003 --> 01:38:32,774
<i>or any Von Erich in the
worst day of my life.</i>

1265
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:40,724
<i>Whoo!</i>

1266
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:44,052
<i>Whoo! Whoo!</i>

1267
01:38:45,087 --> 01:38:49,257
<i>Walk the aisle, daddy's
boy! Walk the aisle!</i>

1268
01:38:52,995 --> 01:38:54,572
<i>And here comes Kevin.</i>

1269
01:38:54,596 --> 01:38:56,240
<i>A meteoric rise
these last two months</i>

1270
01:38:56,264 --> 01:38:58,042
<i>to become the
number one contender</i>

1271
01:38:58,066 --> 01:39:00,278
<i>for the NWA World
Heavyweight title,</i>

1272
01:39:00,302 --> 01:39:02,680
<i>the most prized belt
in all of wrestling,</i>

1273
01:39:02,704 --> 01:39:04,682
<i>the only title that
escaped his father,</i>

1274
01:39:04,706 --> 01:39:06,741
<i>living legend Fritz Von Erich.</i>

1275
01:39:16,884 --> 01:39:18,420
Whoo!

1276
01:39:24,392 --> 01:39:25,769
Ric, come on.

1277
01:39:25,793 --> 01:39:28,106
Oh, no, no, no, no!

1278
01:39:32,434 --> 01:39:35,103
Come on! Come on!

1279
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,883
Kevin, come on, now.

1280
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:04,275
Hey, Kevin, come on now!

1281
01:40:04,299 --> 01:40:05,767
What are you doing?

1282
01:40:46,374 --> 01:40:48,719
One, two, three...

1283
01:40:48,743 --> 01:40:50,354
Come on, Kev, break the hold!

1284
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,924
- Come on, Kev, back up.
- Leave me alone!

1285
01:40:53,948 --> 01:40:56,251
- Come on, Kev!
- Leave me alone!

1286
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:58,662
Ring the bell!

1287
01:41:01,423 --> 01:41:03,567
<i>Winner by disqualification</i>

1288
01:41:03,591 --> 01:41:05,769
<i>and still NWA World
Heavyweight Champion...</i>

1289
01:41:05,793 --> 01:41:07,571
What are you doing? Come
on! Hey! Come on, Kev.

1290
01:41:07,595 --> 01:41:08,706
Come on!

1291
01:41:08,730 --> 01:41:10,641
<i>Ric Flair!</i>

1292
01:41:10,665 --> 01:41:14,269
<i>Kevin Von Erich has
been disqualified.</i>

1293
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:20,308
What the fuck happened, Kev?

1294
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:29,417
I don't know.

1295
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,521
I don't know.

1296
01:41:36,057 --> 01:41:37,568
Whoo!

1297
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:38,836
Ah, Kevin.

1298
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:41,205
Oh, man. You were great.

1299
01:41:41,229 --> 01:41:44,007
You were crazy, you were
one crazy son of a bitch.

1300
01:41:44,031 --> 01:41:46,877
I mean, I always thought
you were a little soft,

1301
01:41:46,901 --> 01:41:48,612
but, baby, you got it.

1302
01:41:48,636 --> 01:41:50,248
I'll give you a rematch any day.

1303
01:41:50,272 --> 01:41:53,451
Christ, let's get a drink.

1304
01:41:53,475 --> 01:41:55,786
Where can we get
fucked up around here?

1305
01:41:55,810 --> 01:41:57,979
Oh, I'm... I'm good. Thanks.

1306
01:41:59,347 --> 01:42:01,825
All right, well, if you
change your mind, let me know.

1307
01:42:01,849 --> 01:42:03,961
I'll be down at the
Holiday Inn. Phew!

1308
01:42:03,985 --> 01:42:06,488
Oh.

1309
01:42:13,795 --> 01:42:15,129
Come on, Son.

1310
01:42:50,565 --> 01:42:53,110
Oh, God. Hang on.

1311
01:42:53,134 --> 01:42:55,703
I hear you. Hang on, I'm
just gonna have to...

1312
01:43:17,492 --> 01:43:19,870
Hey. ROSS: What's up?

1313
01:43:19,894 --> 01:43:21,905
- Hey, guys.
- Hi!

1314
01:43:21,929 --> 01:43:23,541
- How you doing? How was your day?
- Good.

1315
01:43:23,565 --> 01:43:25,509
- It was amazing, yeah.
- What'd you learn?

1316
01:43:25,533 --> 01:43:27,134
We have learnt...

1317
01:43:30,372 --> 01:43:32,607
Hey, boys, come
set up for dinner.

1318
01:43:38,913 --> 01:43:41,191
A couple more pieces of it.

1319
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:42,760
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Mom!

1320
01:43:42,784 --> 01:43:44,194
Hi, Mom.

1321
01:43:44,218 --> 01:43:46,630
Oh, hello, hello.

1322
01:43:46,654 --> 01:43:47,955
I love you.

1323
01:43:51,192 --> 01:43:52,936
May I be excused?

1324
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,438
Have one more piece of broccoli.

1325
01:43:54,462 --> 01:43:56,197
- All right.
- Make it two.

1326
01:43:58,833 --> 01:44:00,735
All right. Get out of here.

1327
01:44:03,371 --> 01:44:06,274
Hey, how was your day?

1328
01:44:07,174 --> 01:44:08,786
It was

1329
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:10,678
- long.
- Yeah.

1330
01:44:12,847 --> 01:44:16,250
- You?
- Yeah, all right.

1331
01:44:23,425 --> 01:44:25,660
I think we need
to make a change.

1332
01:44:28,029 --> 01:44:29,797
We need a bigger boat.

1333
01:45:00,595 --> 01:45:02,697
So, what did you decide, boss?

1334
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:07,545
I think we need to cut
down again to one show.

1335
01:45:07,569 --> 01:45:09,337
Two is still too many.

1336
01:45:09,904 --> 01:45:12,215
We can get the guys
touring during the week.

1337
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:14,308
Bring 'em home for
a Saturday night.

1338
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:19,781
That sounds
painful, but smart.

1339
01:45:21,082 --> 01:45:22,726
The numbers just
haven't been there

1340
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:25,353
since Kerry went to the WWF.

1341
01:45:28,556 --> 01:45:32,069
Jerry called again this
morning. It's a good offer.

1342
01:45:32,093 --> 01:45:33,695
You should think about it.

1343
01:45:49,511 --> 01:45:50,812
Hey, Dad.

1344
01:45:53,114 --> 01:45:55,659
So, we have an offer

1345
01:45:55,683 --> 01:45:57,685
on the table from Jerry Jarrett.

1346
01:46:00,321 --> 01:46:01,889
He wants to buy us out.

1347
01:46:07,529 --> 01:46:10,340
Son, I didn't give
you the company

1348
01:46:10,364 --> 01:46:12,567
so you could turn
around and sell it.

1349
01:46:14,836 --> 01:46:18,740
I need to think
about my family, Dad.

1350
01:46:21,108 --> 01:46:22,986
I'm almost broke.

1351
01:46:23,010 --> 01:46:25,022
We need a house.

1352
01:46:25,046 --> 01:46:27,190
And we can't fit in
that apartment anymore.

1353
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:29,259
If you sell,

1354
01:46:29,283 --> 01:46:32,195
you can forget about stepping
through these doors again.

1355
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:34,031
Damn, you're almost
40 years old.

1356
01:46:34,055 --> 01:46:35,523
Still can't take
care of yourself.

1357
01:46:38,693 --> 01:46:40,361
I've been through the books.

1358
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:42,697
It doesn't add up.

1359
01:46:44,666 --> 01:46:47,769
I didn't make nearly
what it says I did.

1360
01:46:48,503 --> 01:46:50,605
I did what was right all along.

1361
01:46:51,539 --> 01:46:53,741
You think living
here was a free ride?

1362
01:46:54,509 --> 01:46:56,210
Don't you dare question me.

1363
01:46:58,245 --> 01:47:00,491
One, two, three!

1364
01:47:00,515 --> 01:47:01,725
Yes!

1365
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:05,219
Attaboy, Kerry.
That's how you do it.

1366
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,665
Look at your uncle, boys.

1367
01:47:17,331 --> 01:47:18,876
Hey!

1368
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:20,678
- Welcome home, champ.
- Hi.

1369
01:47:20,702 --> 01:47:22,312
We've been watching
every match on the TV.

1370
01:47:22,336 --> 01:47:23,647
Thanks. Thanks, Pop.

1371
01:47:23,671 --> 01:47:25,816
- Oh, Hands Man.
- What's going on?

1372
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,851
Hey, Pam. Where's the
babies? Where's the babies?

1373
01:47:27,875 --> 01:47:29,252
- They're asleep.
- Yeah?

1374
01:47:29,276 --> 01:47:31,054
- Hey!
- Hi.

1375
01:47:31,078 --> 01:47:33,023
- You're late.
- Yeah, I know.

1376
01:47:33,047 --> 01:47:36,259
- Who's this?
- That's uh... that's Tania.

1377
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:37,595
- Hi.
- Hey.

1378
01:47:37,619 --> 01:47:39,396
- How do you do?
- It's so nice to meet you.

1379
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:40,755
Let me get a look at you.

1380
01:47:41,889 --> 01:47:43,634
You look strong, Son.

1381
01:47:43,658 --> 01:47:46,670
WWF Intercontinental Champion,

1382
01:47:46,694 --> 01:47:48,506
second-biggest
title in wrestling

1383
01:47:48,530 --> 01:47:50,373
since your brother
ruined our promotion.

1384
01:47:50,397 --> 01:47:52,209
Knew it was time to
retire when I did.

1385
01:47:52,233 --> 01:47:53,977
Kerry, Kerry. Can you
get me a drink, honey?

1386
01:47:54,001 --> 01:47:56,446
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dad, I got you, um...

1387
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:58,015
I got you something
for Christmas

1388
01:47:58,039 --> 01:48:00,083
and I... I don't wanna wait.
I wanna give it to you now.

1389
01:48:00,107 --> 01:48:01,852
- Is that all right?
- No! Kerry, no.

1390
01:48:01,876 --> 01:48:03,754
We wait for Christmas.

1391
01:48:03,778 --> 01:48:05,556
Oh, come on, Mom. It's
so good, it's so good.

1392
01:48:05,580 --> 01:48:06,957
And Tania and I,
we're going to, uh,

1393
01:48:06,981 --> 01:48:08,759
to Mexico for Christmas. Right?

1394
01:48:08,783 --> 01:48:10,393
I thought you were
home for Christmas.

1395
01:48:10,417 --> 01:48:12,062
I'm here now,

1396
01:48:12,086 --> 01:48:13,631
but we got this great deal

1397
01:48:13,655 --> 01:48:15,999
on a Christmas day
flight to Mexico.

1398
01:48:16,023 --> 01:48:19,226
And, you know, I need the
rest. Been hitting it hard.

1399
01:48:20,928 --> 01:48:22,196
That's, um...

1400
01:48:23,798 --> 01:48:24,999
That's for you.

1401
01:48:26,033 --> 01:48:27,268
Go ahead.

1402
01:48:30,404 --> 01:48:34,618
Now, that's a Smith &
Wesson 35725th anniversary.

1403
01:48:34,642 --> 01:48:35,986
What do you think?

1404
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:39,389
Hmm. It's beautiful, Son.

1405
01:48:39,413 --> 01:48:41,282
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1406
01:48:43,450 --> 01:48:45,362
Don't... don't do that. Don't
do that. What are you doing?

1407
01:48:45,386 --> 01:48:47,665
- You gotta shoot that.
- Oh, I don't wanna shoot it now.

1408
01:48:47,689 --> 01:48:49,767
Well, you always shoot
a gun when you get it.

1409
01:48:49,791 --> 01:48:52,169
- I don't wanna shoot it, Kerry.
- Why the fuck not?!

1410
01:48:52,193 --> 01:48:53,837
Kerry, what is wrong with you?

1411
01:48:53,861 --> 01:48:55,472
What, me? What's
wrong with him?!

1412
01:48:55,496 --> 01:48:58,809
Watch it, Son. You brought
company to the house.

1413
01:48:58,833 --> 01:49:00,944
Now, we don't wanna be rude.

1414
01:49:00,968 --> 01:49:03,380
Just settle down and
we'll have a nice dinner

1415
01:49:03,404 --> 01:49:05,607
that your mother
worked hard to prepare.

1416
01:49:10,845 --> 01:49:12,013
Yeah.

1417
01:49:13,848 --> 01:49:15,425
Yeah, okay.

1418
01:49:15,449 --> 01:49:17,294
Now, come tell me.

1419
01:49:17,318 --> 01:49:20,063
When are you getting your
world title shot over there?

1420
01:49:20,087 --> 01:49:21,665
Hmm?

1421
01:49:21,689 --> 01:49:23,533
I see your old tag team
partner Hellwig's holding.

1422
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:25,769
That guy's got nothing
on you. Never has.

1423
01:49:25,793 --> 01:49:28,262
Oh, soon. Soon, Pop. Soon.

1424
01:49:31,132 --> 01:49:33,644
Are these the boys?

1425
01:49:33,668 --> 01:49:35,302
They're so cute!

1426
01:49:36,203 --> 01:49:37,447
Yeah.

1427
01:49:42,543 --> 01:49:43,821
- Hi.
- Hey!

1428
01:49:45,146 --> 01:49:46,790
Hey, man! Oh, I'm so
excited to be home.

1429
01:49:46,814 --> 01:49:48,726
- Yeah, I can see.
- Good to see you.

1430
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:50,284
Let me look at you. Hmm.

1431
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:55,866
- You look good.
- Yeah, you too.

1432
01:49:59,193 --> 01:50:00,871
Hey, stop. Stop.

1433
01:50:00,895 --> 01:50:04,708
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

1434
01:50:04,732 --> 01:50:06,844
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Never been better.

1435
01:50:06,868 --> 01:50:08,402
Yeah, okay.

1436
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:20,157
Hello.

1437
01:50:20,181 --> 01:50:21,992
<i>Oh, hey.</i>

1438
01:50:22,016 --> 01:50:23,918
<i>Good. Good. You're still up.</i>

1439
01:50:25,953 --> 01:50:28,089
Yeah, yeah, I'm up.

1440
01:50:29,523 --> 01:50:30,925
Where are you?

1441
01:50:31,592 --> 01:50:33,828
<i>Oh, I'm in some
hotel in Dallas.</i>

1442
01:50:36,430 --> 01:50:39,633
Why didn't you go
home? You okay?

1443
01:50:42,837 --> 01:50:44,171
<i>Kerry?</i>

1444
01:50:47,909 --> 01:50:49,677
No, I'm scared, man.

1445
01:50:52,947 --> 01:50:55,049
I'm scared. I'm out of control.

1446
01:50:56,984 --> 01:50:58,953
<i>Well, you've got
to get some help.</i>

1447
01:51:00,788 --> 01:51:02,223
I'm in pain.

1448
01:51:04,826 --> 01:51:07,437
I'm in pain all the time.
I'm fucking deformed!

1449
01:51:07,461 --> 01:51:09,130
It takes too much to hide it.

1450
01:51:09,964 --> 01:51:11,933
Well, it doesn't
show in the ring.

1451
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:14,702
<i>They're not giving
me a new contract.</i>

1452
01:51:16,403 --> 01:51:18,773
<i>And they got me in
house shows from now on.</i>

1453
01:51:20,274 --> 01:51:21,976
<i>They don't want me anymore.</i>

1454
01:51:22,609 --> 01:51:24,922
<i>Well, I got... I
got nowhere to go.</i>

1455
01:51:24,946 --> 01:51:26,313
<i>I've got no one.</i>

1456
01:51:27,681 --> 01:51:29,059
Where's Tania?

1457
01:51:29,083 --> 01:51:31,919
- Who?
<i>- Tania.</i>

1458
01:51:32,653 --> 01:51:34,155
Ain't... That was nothing. I...

1459
01:51:38,659 --> 01:51:40,294
I need someone.

1460
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:44,641
You know, I need a family.

1461
01:51:44,665 --> 01:51:46,367
Just come here.

1462
01:51:47,835 --> 01:51:49,336
Stay with us.

1463
01:51:50,872 --> 01:51:53,507
<i>No, I can't. I can't let
your boys see me like this.</i>

1464
01:51:57,879 --> 01:52:00,347
Well, then let's get
breakfast somewhere.

1465
01:52:01,182 --> 01:52:04,218
<i>Or meet me at home. Mom
can make us pancakes.</i>

1466
01:52:09,690 --> 01:52:11,534
You know, I want it all to end.

1467
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:13,370
No, you don't.

1468
01:52:13,394 --> 01:52:15,138
No, you don't. You
don't mean that.

1469
01:52:15,162 --> 01:52:16,563
<i>I do.</i>

1470
01:52:18,065 --> 01:52:20,567
I'm fucking cursed. I wanna die.

1471
01:52:22,136 --> 01:52:25,272
How are you gonna
say that to me, huh?

1472
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:28,009
After everything?

1473
01:52:28,609 --> 01:52:29,977
It's in me now.

1474
01:52:31,512 --> 01:52:33,414
It's got a hold of me.

1475
01:52:40,487 --> 01:52:44,591
Kerry, just tell
me where you are,

1476
01:52:45,726 --> 01:52:47,361
and I'll come and get you.

1477
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:54,936
<i>Kerry?</i>

1478
01:53:13,754 --> 01:53:16,733
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Dad. Dad.

1479
01:53:16,757 --> 01:53:18,435
All right. Sorry
for the early call.

1480
01:53:18,459 --> 01:53:21,604
<i>It's okay. I'm heading
out to do some work.</i>

1481
01:53:21,628 --> 01:53:23,931
- Where's Mom?
<i>- Sleeping.</i>

1482
01:53:25,532 --> 01:53:29,603
Hey, I just talked to Kerry.
He's in a pretty bad state.

1483
01:53:30,905 --> 01:53:32,339
I'm worried about him.

1484
01:53:33,707 --> 01:53:35,418
I'm gonna come out there.

1485
01:53:35,442 --> 01:53:37,644
We need to figure out
how to help him, okay?

1486
01:53:41,782 --> 01:53:45,295
<i>You boys need to work it
out between yourselves.</i>

1487
01:53:45,319 --> 01:53:47,688
Just look out for
him, okay, Dad?

1488
01:53:48,422 --> 01:53:50,024
I'll be there as soon as I can.

1489
01:54:50,985 --> 01:54:52,695
No! No!

1490
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:55,332
Kerry, Kerry! Kerry!

1491
01:54:55,356 --> 01:54:58,335
Come on! Hey, Kerry! Kerry.

1492
01:55:11,005 --> 01:55:12,974
I told you to look out for him!

1493
01:55:14,908 --> 01:55:17,154
You didn't take care of him!

1494
01:55:17,178 --> 01:55:18,655
You didn't take
care of any of 'em!

1495
01:55:18,679 --> 01:55:21,124
He called you, and
you didn't help him!

1496
01:55:21,148 --> 01:55:22,316
You...

1497
01:56:40,261 --> 01:56:42,905
<i>I don't know what's
on the other side,</i>

1498
01:56:42,929 --> 01:56:44,698
<i>but I can't be here anymore.</i>

1499
01:56:46,133 --> 01:56:48,702
<i>Tonight, I walk
with my brothers.</i>

1500
01:58:13,487 --> 01:58:14,755
Hey!

1501
01:58:16,357 --> 01:58:17,558
Brother.

1502
01:58:18,525 --> 01:58:20,437
Hey, brothers!

1503
01:58:20,461 --> 01:58:21,928
There he is.

1504
01:58:32,873 --> 01:58:33,950
Hey, Mikey.

1505
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:43,150
Hi.

1506
01:58:49,590 --> 01:58:51,334
World champion of
the afterlife, huh?

1507
01:58:51,358 --> 01:58:52,902
Oh, finally.

1508
01:58:57,063 --> 01:58:58,465
Hey, where's Jack Jr.?

1509
01:59:09,876 --> 01:59:12,078
You must be my oldest
brother, Jackie.

1510
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:14,924
So nice to meet you.

1511
01:59:14,948 --> 01:59:16,350
Come here.

1512
01:59:35,336 --> 01:59:37,170
I love you, Kerry.

1513
01:59:50,517 --> 01:59:52,061
Thanks, Kevin.

1514
01:59:52,085 --> 01:59:54,588
No, I'd love for you to stay
on wrestling if you want.

1515
01:59:55,822 --> 01:59:58,392
I appreciate it. I could
use the extra work.

1516
02:00:00,694 --> 02:00:02,705
Just so you know,

1517
02:00:02,729 --> 02:00:04,674
your dad called me
out to his ranch.

1518
02:00:04,698 --> 02:00:06,976
Tried to intimidate me out
of buying this from you.

1519
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:11,905
Oh, he never stops.

1520
02:00:13,707 --> 02:00:17,311
- Well, glad it didn't work.
- Yeah.

1521
02:00:18,779 --> 02:00:19,946
Well...

1522
02:00:22,082 --> 02:00:23,684
I'll give you a minute.

1523
02:00:41,902 --> 02:00:43,036
Dottie?

1524
02:00:44,471 --> 02:00:46,106
In here.

1525
02:00:57,117 --> 02:00:58,485
What are you doing?

1526
02:01:00,487 --> 02:01:01,788
Painting.

1527
02:01:07,193 --> 02:01:08,562
What's for dinner?

1528
02:01:09,162 --> 02:01:10,764
I didn't make anything.

1529
02:01:13,199 --> 02:01:14,668
I'm not hungry.

1530
02:01:55,075 --> 02:01:56,486
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

1531
02:01:56,510 --> 02:01:59,279
- Whoa, okay! Careful, careful.
- Hey.

1532
02:02:00,747 --> 02:02:02,058
We want pancakes!

1533
02:02:02,082 --> 02:02:03,926
Mmm-hmm. How about
a good morning?

1534
02:02:03,950 --> 02:02:06,019
Good morning!

1535
02:02:23,437 --> 02:02:24,871
Marshall!

1536
02:02:30,377 --> 02:02:31,545
Oh.

1537
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:35,382
Marshall.

1538
02:02:47,027 --> 02:02:48,371
You okay, Dad?

1539
02:02:48,395 --> 02:02:50,831
Hey, I'm sorry. I...

1540
02:02:51,898 --> 02:02:54,034
I'm sorry, boys.

1541
02:02:55,135 --> 02:02:57,037
You shouldn't see me like this.

1542
02:02:57,638 --> 02:02:59,205
A man doesn't cry.

1543
02:03:01,007 --> 02:03:02,351
I'm sorry, boys.

1544
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:05,455
It's okay, Dad. You can
cry. Everyone cries.

1545
02:03:05,479 --> 02:03:06,989
Yeah. What are
you talking about?

1546
02:03:07,013 --> 02:03:08,882
We cry all the time.

1547
02:03:13,153 --> 02:03:15,164
Do you think you
know why you're sad?

1548
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:21,361
Well...

1549
02:03:22,362 --> 02:03:24,707
I guess it's because

1550
02:03:24,731 --> 02:03:26,633
I used to be a brother

1551
02:03:27,333 --> 02:03:28,802
and uh,

1552
02:03:29,903 --> 02:03:31,772
and now I'm not a
brother anymore.

1553
02:03:32,539 --> 02:03:34,316
Oh, well.

1554
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:36,052
We'll be your brothers, Dad.

1555
02:03:36,076 --> 02:03:38,579
Yeah, Dad. We'll
be your brothers.

1556
02:03:42,716 --> 02:03:45,061
Oh. Thank you, boys.

1557
02:03:45,085 --> 02:03:46,587
Thank you.

1558
02:03:48,889 --> 02:03:50,891
