1
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,088
Walter, honey.

2
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,924
Time to wake up.

3
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,300
Just 10 more minutes.

4
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,594
Oh, I'm sorry, sport.
You can sleep in tomorrow.

5
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,262
That's what
Saturdays are for.

6
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,313
Up against the wall.

7
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,941
Come, come, come.

8
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,442
All right.

9
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,653
Got it. Got it.
Look, look!

10
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,112
All right, sit down.

11
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,696
Your breakfast
is getting cold.

12
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,114
It's cereal.

13
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,616
It's supposed to be cold.

14
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,098
Sweetheart, we're here.

15
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:03,850
Okay.

16
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,030
Here's your books.

17
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,365
Go ahead.

18
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:07,204
Yes, ma'am. If you hold just a
moment, I'll get a supervisor for you.

19
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:10,081
Yes,
she's coming right now.

20
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:11,708
Just a second,
she'll be with you.

21
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:15,712
Just one second, please. You deal
with this one. I'm not going near it.

22
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:19,674
Hello, this is the supervisor.
How can I help you?

23
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:22,927
I can see you're
on a party line...

24
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:27,097
Unfortunately, some people do
listen in on party lines. We...

25
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:28,807
Well, what is he doing?

26
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:33,103
Oh, my...

27
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:34,522
Everything all right?

28
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:39,151
Yes, sir, it's fine. A lady was
having trouble with the connection.

29
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:40,945
Hey, sport.
Hey, Mom.

30
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:42,404
How was school?

31
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:43,739
Okay.
Yeah?

32
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:45,741
We learned
about dinosaurs.

33
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:48,118
And I got in a fight
with Billy Mankowski.

34
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:49,245
What happened?

35
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:50,454
He hit me.

36
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:52,039
Did you hit him back?

37
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:53,415
Good.

38
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:54,750
Rule number one,
remember?

39
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:57,545
Never start a fight,
always finish it.

40
00:04:58,212 --> 00:04:59,755
Why'd he hit you?

41
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,131
Because I hit him.

42
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,509
You hit him first?

43
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:05,052
Why?

44
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:09,682
He said my dad ran off
because he didn't like me.

45
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:12,101
Honey, your father
never met you,

46
00:05:12,184 --> 00:05:14,103
so how could he
not like you?

47
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:15,979
Then why did he leave?

48
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:21,025
Well, because the day
you were born,

49
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:23,486
something else
arrived in the mail.

50
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,488
And it was in a box a
little bit bigger than you.

51
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:27,198
You know what was in it?

52
00:05:27,282 --> 00:05:29,033
Something called
responsibility.

53
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:31,077
And to some people,

54
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:33,955
responsibility is the
scariest thing in the world.

55
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:39,377
So, he ran away because he was
scared of what was in that box?

56
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,461
Uh-huh.

57
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:41,880
That's just dumb.

58
00:05:41,963 --> 00:05:43,715
That is exactly
what I thought.

59
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:57,854
<i>Did I miss Amos 'N Andy?</i>

60
00:05:57,937 --> 00:05:59,814
I'm afraid so, sport.

61
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:01,774
Come now, time for bed.

62
00:06:07,238 --> 00:06:09,489
Are we still going
to the movies tomorrow?

63
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:12,826
Uh-huh. I hear there's a
new Charlie Chaplin picture

64
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,704
<i>and a new serial called
The Mysterious Airman.</i>

65
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:17,164
Who's that?

66
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:19,208
I don't know.
Nobody does.

67
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,460
That's what makes him
so mysterious.

68
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:22,503
Oh.

69
00:06:22,878 --> 00:06:25,005
Am I too heavy
for you to carry?

70
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:27,758
Oh, no,
not for years.

71
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:29,301
Not for years.

72
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:39,353
<i>Hello?
This is Margaret.</i>

73
00:06:39,436 --> 00:06:40,604
Hi, Margaret.

74
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:41,647
<i>So, how are you?</i>

75
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,981
Fine.

76
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:45,317
<i>Listen, Jean can't come in today
and now we're a little shorthanded.</i>

77
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,610
When did she call in sick?

78
00:06:46,693 --> 00:06:47,736
<i>About half hour ago.</i>

79
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,488
<i>I'm having a hard time
trying to find someone.</i>

80
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,281
Well, what about Myrna?

81
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:52,699
I know she could use
the extra hours and...

82
00:06:52,783 --> 00:06:54,868
<i>She's busy.
Can't you come?</i>

83
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,704
No. No, no, no.
I just...

84
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:03,417
I promised Walter that I'd take
him to the movies, is all, and...

85
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:04,877
<i>Well, it's just until 4:00.</i>

86
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:06,170
All right.

87
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:08,047
Just...
Just until 4:00.

88
00:07:08,756 --> 00:07:10,091
I'll see you then.

89
00:07:16,264 --> 00:07:18,266
There's a sandwich
and milk in the fridge,

90
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:19,851
and I've asked Mrs. Riley
and her daughter

91
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:21,727
to stop in
in a couple of hours.

92
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:23,938
I can take care of myself.

93
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:26,649
I know you can. They're
checking on the house, not you.

94
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:37,618
Tomorrow we will
go to the movies.

95
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:42,665
And then we'll ride Big Red to Santa
Monica and take a walk on the pier.

96
00:07:42,748 --> 00:07:44,959
How does that sound?
Does that sound good?

97
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:50,339
I'll be home
before it gets dark.

98
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:52,300
I'm not afraid
of the dark.

99
00:07:52,383 --> 00:07:54,177
I'm not afraid
of anything.

100
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:57,804
I know.
I know.

101
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,933
Be good.

102
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,685
I love you.

103
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:41,473
We've got lines jammed
from here to Ohio.

104
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:43,975
He says he needs to speak
to somebody in charge.

105
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:47,729
I need your signature here
for a supply requisition.

106
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:49,813
Number, please.
Number, please.

107
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,149
Go ahead, please.

108
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:56,237
All right, get me
the Omaha routing station.

109
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,697
See if we can put our calls
through their switchers.

110
00:08:58,781 --> 00:09:00,366
Let's get this
console running, now.

111
00:09:04,662 --> 00:09:07,998
Christine. Good, I was
hoping to catch you.

112
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,459
Look, I've been following
your work reports,

113
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:12,753
and I just want to let you
know that I am very impressed.

114
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:15,256
When I first suggested
hiring female supervisors,

115
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:16,882
my superiors weren't
big on the idea.

116
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:19,844
But you have held your own as well
as any of your male counterparts.

117
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:20,928
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

118
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:22,513
Oh, Ben, please.
Listen, I...

119
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,681
Listen, the point is,

120
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,559
we're looking to take on a manager
for our new Beverly Hills office.

121
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:29,645
And if you're interested in the
job, I could write a report, or...

122
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:31,522
That would be wonderful.
Thank you so much, sir.

123
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,858
Okay, good,
so maybe we could...

124
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,401
Could we speak about it
Monday? Yeah, absolutely.

125
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:37,987
Would that be all right? Thank
you so much, sir. Thank you.

126
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:47,370
Please!

127
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:51,249
Please.

128
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:24,365
Walter.

129
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:27,452
Honey?

130
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:30,788
Walter.

131
00:10:31,122 --> 00:10:32,373
Walter!

132
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,751
Honey?

133
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:51,308
Walter?

134
00:10:57,773 --> 00:10:58,941
Honey!

135
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:03,403
Walter!

136
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:07,032
Walter, it's time
to come in, honey.

137
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:12,788
Suzie?
Have you seen Walter?

138
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:15,749
No, Mrs. Collins.

139
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,042
Sorry.

140
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,845
Walter?

141
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:32,598
Walter.

142
00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:57,999
<i>Number, please.</i>

143
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,084
May I please have
the police station?

144
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:01,669
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

145
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:02,753
<i>Lincoln Heights
Division.</i>

146
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:04,630
Hello, my name is
Christine Collins.

147
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:07,216
I live at 210
North Avenue, 23.

148
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:10,178
And I'm calling
to report a missing child.

149
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:11,721
Missing child.

150
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:14,849
<i>What's your relation
to the child, ma'am?</i>

151
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:16,350
It's my son.

152
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:18,644
<i>How long has he been gone?</i>

153
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,105
I'm not sure.
I just got home from work.

154
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:24,608
It could be
since this morning

155
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:26,401
or it could be
just the last hour.

156
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:27,527
<i>Have you checked
around the neighborhood?</i>

157
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:29,362
Yes, of course I did.

158
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:31,490
<i>Well, maybe
he's lost track of time.</i>

159
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:32,824
No. No, no.

160
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:36,328
He always stays around the
house when it gets dark.

161
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:38,455
Would you please send
someone down here?

162
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:39,915
<i>I'm sorry,
but our policy is that</i>

163
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:43,960
<i>we don't dispatch units on
missing child cases for 24 hours.</i>

164
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:46,296
What?

165
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:49,841
<i>Look, 99 times out of 100,
the kid shows up by morning.</i>

166
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:53,803
<i>We don't have the resources to go chasing
every kid who runs off with his pals.</i>

167
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,971
No, no, no.

168
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:57,682
No, that's not Walter.
He doesn't do that.

169
00:12:57,724 --> 00:13:02,062
<i>With all due respect, ma'am, every
parent who calls says the same thing.</i>

170
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:05,190
Please, please.

171
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:06,900
<i>Look, there's
nothing I can do.</i>

172
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:08,443
<i>I'll take your name
and your information,</i>

173
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:11,154
<i>but that's all until the
morning, at the earliest.</i>

174
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:14,241
<i>I'm sure he'll show up
by then. They always do.</i>

175
00:13:42,726 --> 00:13:44,436
Are you Mrs. Collins?

176
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,706
<i>Our thoughts go out again
today to Mrs. Christine Collins</i>

177
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:05,207
<i>of Lincoln Heights,</i>

178
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,418
<i>whose young son,
Walter Collins,</i>

179
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:10,044
<i>disappeared
nearly two weeks ago.</i>

180
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:14,591
<i>Though she is not a
member of our congregation,</i>

181
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,386
<i>we pray for her today
as we have every day,</i>

182
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:21,681
<i>since we learned
of her plight.</i>

183
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:24,642
<i>On the radio and
in the newspapers</i>

184
00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:27,645
<i>we are told that the Los
Angeles Police Department</i>

185
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:32,275
<i>is doing its very best to
reunite mother and child,</i>

186
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,777
<i>and I'm sure
that that is true.</i>

187
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:40,950
<i>But given its status as
the most violent, corrupt</i>

188
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:42,994
<i>and incompetent
police department</i>

189
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:45,288
<i>this side
of the Rocky Mountains</i>

190
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,791
<i>I am not sure
it's saying a great deal.</i>

191
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:59,802
<i>Every day, new bodies
appear along Mulholland</i>

192
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:01,887
<i>and in the ditches
of our cities,</i>

193
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:08,352
<i>the work of Police Chief James
Davis and his aptly named Gun Squad.</i>

194
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:11,814
<i>Every day, the needs
of honest citizens</i>

195
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:16,109
<i>are put second to greed
and personal gain.</i>

196
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:22,658
<i>Every day, this city sinks
deeper into a cesspool</i>

197
00:15:22,741 --> 00:15:27,538
<i>of fear, intimidation
and corruption.</i>

198
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:30,040
<i>Once the City of Angels,</i>

199
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:35,170
<i>Los Angeles has become
a place where our protectors</i>

200
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:37,714
<i>have become
our brutalizers.</i>

201
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,761
<i>Where to be the law is
to be above the law.</i>

202
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,143
I understand.
Thank you.

203
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:34,020
I will call back
in a few weeks.

204
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,355
Thank you very much.

205
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:41,944
Las Vegas Missing
Persons Department?

206
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:44,238
Hello, this is
Christine Collins.

207
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,158
I'm calling to see if you've
found any missing or lost children

208
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:51,119
who meet the description
that matches Walter Collins.

209
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,999
Oh, all right. Well,
please do. Please do call.

210
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,626
And I'll call back
in a matter...

211
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,462
In a week, if that's all
right. Thank you very much.

212
00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:01,546
Thank you.

213
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:18,480
$2.

214
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:30,450
Hell, I think I left
my wallet at home.

215
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:32,410
Can I owe it to you?

216
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:34,913
No credit.

217
00:17:34,996 --> 00:17:36,665
Pay up or I
call the cops.

218
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:38,542
I'm sick of bums like you
coming around here.

219
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,043
I'm not trying to
stiff you, chief.

220
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,628
I just left my wallet
at home, that's all.

221
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,673
I'll go back and get it.
Five, 10 minutes, tops.

222
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,636
Got collateral?

223
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:52,471
You can't ask for
better collateral

224
00:17:52,513 --> 00:17:54,849
than a man's own flesh
and blood, right?

225
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,434
Now, you stay here, son.

226
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:59,019
I'll be right back.

227
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:01,647
But... Now, don't give me any trouble.

228
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,691
He's a good man to
trust us like this.

229
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:08,362
Now, you just stay here and
I'll go back and get my wallet.

230
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:14,034
Ten minutes,
then I call the cops.

231
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:25,713
Ah, hell.

232
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,303
<i>Number, please.
Hello, Myrtle?</i>

233
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:34,221
<i>Hello? Yeah, this is
Harve, down at the diner.</i>

234
00:18:34,305 --> 00:18:35,346
<i>Oh, hi, Harve.</i>

235
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,598
Would you get me
Sheriff Larsen?

236
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:37,557
<i>Sure thing.</i>

237
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:41,102
You have
a nice day, too.

238
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:46,608
Christine, I'm having trouble
with the connection here.

239
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:48,568
I can't seem
to get through.

240
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,029
I think so. Yeah, I think that's better.

241
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:57,410
You have a person to
person call, Fairfax 2231.

242
00:18:57,452 --> 00:18:59,954
Long distance.
Sorry, can you repeat?

243
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,789
I'll connect you
right away, ma'am.

244
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:03,249
Thanks.

245
00:19:16,804 --> 00:19:18,139
Mrs. Collins?

246
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:19,557
Yes.

247
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:23,311
I'm Captain J.J. Jones,
Lincoln Park Juvenile Division.

248
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,899
My office supervises all
runaway and missing child cases,

249
00:19:27,982 --> 00:19:29,858
including your son's,
and...

250
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:32,528
He's alive,
Mrs. Collins.

251
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:39,326
He was picked up two days ago by
local police in DeKalb, Illinois.

252
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:40,828
He's safe and unhurt.

253
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:46,333
He was in the company of some
drifter. We have an APB out for him,

254
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,417
but he's safe.

255
00:19:48,544 --> 00:19:51,463
Thank you so much.

256
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:53,715
Oh, Christine...

257
00:19:55,717 --> 00:19:57,010
That is so great.

258
00:20:04,977 --> 00:20:06,061
Thank you.

259
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,704
There's
so much press.

260
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:27,790
Yours is a story with a
happy ending, Mrs. Collins.

261
00:20:27,832 --> 00:20:30,042
People love happy endings.

262
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:33,504
We better get a move on,
the train's pulling in.

263
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:37,008
Back, boys. Back.

264
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,135
Thanks.
Thanks, boys, thanks!

265
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:40,678
I'll have a statement
for you in a few minutes,

266
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:41,804
but the important
thing right now

267
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:43,681
is to reunite this
little lady with her son,

268
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:45,099
so if you'll excuse us.

269
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:50,354
Stay right there.
Come on, don't rush.

270
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:52,523
Easy, easy.

271
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:56,986
Mrs. Collins, I'd like to
introduce you to James E. Davis,

272
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:58,279
Chief of Police.

273
00:20:58,362 --> 00:20:59,322
Very nice to meet you.

274
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:00,781
We don't get a lot
of positive attention

275
00:21:00,865 --> 00:21:02,325
from the boys in the
press these days,

276
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:04,911
so it's good to be here with a
positive story, don't you think?

277
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:06,037
Yes, sir.

278
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,500
I take it you've been treated
well by my boys in the department?

279
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,668
I couldn't file a report for 24 hours,

280
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,003
and I thought that
maybe that was a...

281
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:15,504
Technicalities aside.

282
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:18,673
It was wonderful.

283
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:19,883
Well, good.

284
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:23,845
Then you won't have any trouble
telling that to the press,

285
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:25,847
and the fact that the LAPD...

286
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,185
Women.

287
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:31,436
Hold on a second.

288
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,112
Back, boys, back.

289
00:21:43,114 --> 00:21:44,366
Keep them back.

290
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:06,847
Well, aren't you...
Aren't you gonna...

291
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,181
That's not my son.

292
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:12,601
What?

293
00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:15,187
What are you saying?

294
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:17,273
It's not my son.

295
00:22:17,314 --> 00:22:19,692
Well, I'm sure
you're mistaken.

296
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:20,860
I'm not mistaken.

297
00:22:20,943 --> 00:22:23,571
Well, he's been through
five terrible long months.

298
00:22:23,612 --> 00:22:25,739
He's lost weight,
he's changed.

299
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:27,533
I would know my own son.

300
00:22:27,616 --> 00:22:30,411
All I'm saying is you're
in shock and he's changed.

301
00:22:32,246 --> 00:22:33,914
What's your name? Can
you tell me your name?

302
00:22:33,998 --> 00:22:35,624
Walter Collins.

303
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:39,378
It's a common name.

304
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:41,589
Where do you live, Walter?
You know your home address?

305
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:44,925
I live at 210 Avenue 23,

306
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:47,261
Los Angeles, California.

307
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:49,221
And that's my mommy!

308
00:22:53,976 --> 00:22:57,354
Mrs. Collins, listen
to me. I understand.

309
00:22:57,438 --> 00:23:00,441
You're feeling a little uncertain
right now, and that's to be expected.

310
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:02,859
A boy this age,
he changes so fast.

311
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:05,862
We've compensated for that
in our investigation.

312
00:23:05,945 --> 00:23:08,907
And there's no question
that this is your son.

313
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,992
That is not Walter.

314
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:15,163
It's not Walter
as you remember him.

315
00:23:15,663 --> 00:23:19,876
And that's why it's important for
you to take him home on a trial basis.

316
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:22,837
A trial basis?

317
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:23,963
Yes, yes.

318
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:27,592
Once he's around his
familiar surroundings,

319
00:23:27,675 --> 00:23:31,596
and you've given yourself time to recover
from the shock of his changed condition,

320
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,432
you will see that
this is your Walter.

321
00:23:34,516 --> 00:23:37,060
Now, I promise you, I swear
to you, I give you my word.

322
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:38,770
This is your son.

323
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:42,398
Now, if you have any problems, any problems
at all, you come and you talk to me.

324
00:23:42,482 --> 00:23:43,817
I'll take care of it.

325
00:23:45,485 --> 00:23:47,821
I give you my word.
Trust me.

326
00:23:48,363 --> 00:23:51,866
Mrs. Collins, he has
nowhere else to go.

327
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:56,870
Please.

328
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,002
Maybe I'm not
thinking clearly.

329
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:05,879
And...

330
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:08,507
All right.

331
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:11,093
All right, you're not
thinking clearly, that's right.

332
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:12,594
Here we go!

333
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:14,429
Thank you.
Thank you.

334
00:24:14,513 --> 00:24:16,557
Here, just turn
around here.

335
00:24:17,015 --> 00:24:18,725
How does it feel to have
your son home, Mrs. Collins?

336
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,769
What'd you think when you
saw him for the first time?

337
00:24:20,853 --> 00:24:23,147
It's hard to explain.

338
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,065
She was
shocked at first.

339
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:28,068
She didn't recognize the boy,
which is perfectly natural.

340
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:29,528
He's been through
quite an ordeal.

341
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,071
How're you feeling, son?

342
00:24:31,113 --> 00:24:32,197
Bet it feels great
to be home.

343
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,574
Yeah. It's great.

344
00:24:33,615 --> 00:24:35,784
The Los Angeles Police
Department is thankful

345
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:39,079
for all the hard work done by the
DeKalb County Sheriff's Department

346
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:41,748
in making this joyful
reunion possible.

347
00:24:41,832 --> 00:24:44,543
The LAPD is dedicated to
serving the public at all times.

348
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:47,212
Can we get a photo with
mother and son, Captain?

349
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:49,505
Absolutely! Here we are.

350
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:51,340
Like that.
Like that.

351
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:53,968
Squeeze together.
There you go, boys.

352
00:24:54,844 --> 00:24:56,596
This way, Walter.
Big smile.

353
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,723
One more, please.
That's a good one.

354
00:24:59,891 --> 00:25:01,058
One more.

355
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:24,081
The sandwich all right?

356
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,085
Would you like
some more milk?

357
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,253
No.

358
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,923
No, thank you.

359
00:25:32,423 --> 00:25:33,633
No, thank you.

360
00:25:40,056 --> 00:25:44,100
You're covered in soot from the
train. You should take a bath.

361
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,948
Pajamas are on the
edge of the bed.

362
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,661
You okay?
You all right?

363
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:04,704
I fell. Stupid tub!

364
00:26:05,455 --> 00:26:07,207
That's all right.

365
00:26:09,876 --> 00:26:11,670
You're circumcised.

366
00:26:17,134 --> 00:26:18,468
Get out.

367
00:26:19,803 --> 00:26:20,971
Move.

368
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,984
Last time
I measured Walter,

369
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:36,360
last time
I measured my son,

370
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:38,487
he was inches taller
than you are now.

371
00:26:39,405 --> 00:26:40,865
Who are you?

372
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:44,076
What are you doing here?

373
00:26:45,202 --> 00:26:46,704
Who are you?

374
00:26:47,997 --> 00:26:49,165
Who are you?

375
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,846
He's not my son.

376
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:04,972
Mrs. Collins...

377
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:07,183
No, I don't know why
he's saying that he is,

378
00:27:07,224 --> 00:27:08,976
but he's not Walter
and there's been a mistake.

379
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,061
I thought we agreed to
give him time to adjust.

380
00:27:11,145 --> 00:27:12,813
He's three inches shorter.

381
00:27:13,189 --> 00:27:14,523
I measured him
on the chart.

382
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:15,983
Well, maybe your
measurements are off.

383
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:18,986
Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation for all of this.

384
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:20,404
He's circumcised.

385
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,364
And Walter isn't.

386
00:27:23,657 --> 00:27:24,909
Mrs. Collins.

387
00:27:28,745 --> 00:27:30,580
Your son was missing
for five months.

388
00:27:30,622 --> 00:27:35,210
For at least part of that time in the
company of an as yet unidentified drifter.

389
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:38,087
Who knows what such a disturbed
individual might have done?

390
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,966
He could have had him
circumcised. He could have...

391
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,510
Made him shorter?

392
00:27:48,431 --> 00:27:49,808
Why aren't you
listening to me?

393
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:52,894
I am listening, damn it, I am listening.

394
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:54,479
And I understand
your feelings.

395
00:27:54,562 --> 00:27:56,689
He's changed, no mistake, and that's...

396
00:27:56,773 --> 00:27:58,399
You've both been through
a terrible experience,

397
00:27:58,441 --> 00:28:01,361
and that's why he needs your
love and support to bounce back.

398
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:02,946
He's not my son!

399
00:28:04,113 --> 00:28:06,241
Why are you doing this,
Mrs. Collins?

400
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:07,408
Why are you doing this?

401
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,537
You seem perfectly capable
of taking care of the boy.

402
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,997
Your job pays you enough to
attend to his personal needs,

403
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:14,791
so I don't understand
why you're running away

404
00:28:14,874 --> 00:28:16,668
from your responsibilities
as a mother.

405
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:19,003
I am not running away
from anything!

406
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:20,547
Least of all
my responsibilities!

407
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,215
I am even taking care
of that boy right now,

408
00:28:23,298 --> 00:28:25,134
because I am all he has!

409
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:27,469
What worries me is that you
have stopped looking for my son!

410
00:28:27,553 --> 00:28:32,057
Why should we be looking for
someone we've already found?

411
00:28:32,474 --> 00:28:35,561
Because you have
not found him.

412
00:28:35,644 --> 00:28:38,063
His identity
has been confirmed

413
00:28:38,147 --> 00:28:41,608
by the best minds in the
field of child identification,

414
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:43,902
people who know
what they're doing.

415
00:28:43,986 --> 00:28:45,362
And I don't?

416
00:29:03,005 --> 00:29:05,841
I'm sorry.

417
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,802
I appreciate everything that
this department has done

418
00:29:08,886 --> 00:29:11,013
and I know
how hard you're working.

419
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:14,183
I really do, and I don't
want to cause any trouble.

420
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:17,018
I just... There has
been a terrible mistake,

421
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:19,270
and I need you to
help me correct it,

422
00:29:19,353 --> 00:29:24,192
so I can find my son
before it's too late.

423
00:29:26,444 --> 00:29:27,570
Please.

424
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:40,291
I won't take up any more of
your time. I'm sorry I got upset.

425
00:29:40,374 --> 00:29:42,293
I'm sorry, very sorry.

426
00:29:54,972 --> 00:29:55,973
<i>Yes, Captain?</i>

427
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:58,017
Sara, get Dr. Tarr
on the phone.

428
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,227
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

429
00:30:04,565 --> 00:30:05,566
Mrs. Collins?
Yes?

430
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,276
Dr. Earl W. Tarr.

431
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,361
Captain Jones sent me.

432
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:10,904
I consult with him from time
to time on juvenile cases.

433
00:30:10,946 --> 00:30:12,322
May I come in?

434
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:14,574
Yes, thank you for coming.

435
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:16,409
I was beginning to think
he didn't believe me.

436
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:19,871
Well, I'm here now, and
we'll put all that to rights.

437
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:22,707
Where's the boy?

438
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,462
Ah! There he is.

439
00:30:28,797 --> 00:30:30,465
A handsome young man.

440
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:33,009
He has your eyes,
doesn't he?

441
00:30:33,093 --> 00:30:35,303
And a little bit
of the nose.

442
00:30:35,595 --> 00:30:38,723
Very fit, in spite
of all his travails.

443
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:42,102
A very resilient boy you've
got here, Mrs. Collins.

444
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:44,729
I thought you were
here to help me.

445
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:46,273
Well, I am.

446
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:49,776
Captain Jones said that the boy had
been through some severe physical changes

447
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,403
and asked me
to drop in on him

448
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:54,072
to reassure you in your
time of motherly concern.

449
00:30:55,073 --> 00:30:59,536
My motherly concern is not for
him because he's not my son.

450
00:31:00,245 --> 00:31:04,748
Now, statements like that will
hardly help the boy's self-esteem,

451
00:31:04,832 --> 00:31:06,250
now will they?

452
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:10,254
Captain Jones said something
about a change in height?

453
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,173
Yes.

454
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:14,633
Come.

455
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,095
Against the wall.

456
00:31:21,974 --> 00:31:23,476
He's
three inches shorter.

457
00:31:24,268 --> 00:31:26,020
Ah, well...

458
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:30,608
Hardly a mystery,
Mrs. Collins.

459
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:34,987
We've known for some time that trauma
can affect the growth of children.

460
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,239
Given the stress
of the past five months,

461
00:31:37,656 --> 00:31:39,783
his spine may have
actually shrunk.

462
00:31:39,825 --> 00:31:42,828
It's uncommon, but it's within
the realm of possibility.

463
00:31:45,498 --> 00:31:46,832
And circumcision?

464
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:54,131
Very likely his abductor
thought it appropriate.

465
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:56,966
After all, circumcision
is hygienically sound.

466
00:31:58,343 --> 00:32:01,346
Must have been quite
traumatic at the time.

467
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,350
No wonder
he's submerged the memory.

468
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:08,812
I...

469
00:32:08,895 --> 00:32:13,233
You see, there's a perfectly sound
medical explanation for all of this.

470
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,694
But it's right for you
to raise the questions.

471
00:32:16,736 --> 00:32:19,781
You need to be apprised of all
changes the lad went through

472
00:32:19,864 --> 00:32:21,908
during his absence.

473
00:32:21,991 --> 00:32:25,245
Wouldn't I know whether
or not he's my son?

474
00:32:26,204 --> 00:32:27,705
I'm the mother.

475
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:30,750
Which means you're in no
position to be objective.

476
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:35,713
You are looking through the
prism of extreme emotion at a boy

477
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:38,383
who has changed
from what you remember.

478
00:32:38,466 --> 00:32:40,510
He isn't the same boy
that left here.

479
00:32:40,552 --> 00:32:42,679
Just as a boy that goes
off to war and then returns

480
00:32:42,762 --> 00:32:44,597
is not the same anymore.

481
00:32:44,681 --> 00:32:49,351
And a mother's heart, driven
by intuition and emotion,

482
00:32:49,393 --> 00:32:51,854
sees these changes
and rebels,

483
00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:54,898
insists that
this isn't your son.

484
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:58,277
Doesn't change the facts.

485
00:33:02,072 --> 00:33:06,368
I'm willing to put my theory to the
test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins.

486
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:08,579
Are you?

487
00:33:15,836 --> 00:33:17,963
<i>It is
absolutely outrageous!</i>

488
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:20,924
Calm yourself, calm yourself
and just listen to me.

489
00:33:21,008 --> 00:33:25,053
No, no, no.
No, you listen to me, please.

490
00:33:25,762 --> 00:33:29,600
This so called doctor paraded
me around my own neighborhood,

491
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:33,020
like some kind of a derelict mother
who didn't even know her own son.

492
00:33:33,103 --> 00:33:35,063
<i>And what
was his findings?</i>

493
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,441
He found what he
expected to find,

494
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:41,111
what you obviously
told him he would find.

495
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,612
<i>Mrs. Collins.
But that's not...</i>

496
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:44,363
That's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

497
00:33:44,447 --> 00:33:48,910
That I was embarrassed
is not the issue.

498
00:33:51,078 --> 00:33:54,040
The point is that
you are wasting time

499
00:33:54,123 --> 00:33:57,251
when you should be
looking for my son.

500
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,421
But the report is final,
Mrs. Collins.

501
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,592
Well, then I want to receive
the report, so I can refute it,

502
00:34:04,634 --> 00:34:06,594
before it goes
to anyone else.

503
00:34:06,636 --> 00:34:07,887
Fine.

504
00:34:08,805 --> 00:34:11,057
Yes. Good day.

505
00:34:19,482 --> 00:34:21,818
I'm finished. Could I
go to my room now?

506
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:24,946
Yes.

507
00:34:34,497 --> 00:34:36,123
Good night, Mommy.

508
00:34:37,582 --> 00:34:39,876
Stop saying that!

509
00:34:41,336 --> 00:34:43,421
Stop saying that!

510
00:34:43,672 --> 00:34:45,590
I'm not your mother!

511
00:34:48,635 --> 00:34:51,221
I want my son back.

512
00:34:51,304 --> 00:34:54,933
You're not him.
You're not my son!

513
00:34:57,894 --> 00:34:59,980
I want my son back.

514
00:35:00,897 --> 00:35:03,441
I want my son back!

515
00:35:03,984 --> 00:35:05,360
Damn you!

516
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:08,864
I want my son back!

517
00:35:42,062 --> 00:35:44,315
I was wrong
to yell at you.

518
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:49,028
You're just a child

519
00:35:50,571 --> 00:35:53,324
and I don't think you know
what you're doing,

520
00:35:53,407 --> 00:35:55,367
and the hurt
you're causing.

521
00:35:55,451 --> 00:36:00,915
But I need you to understand
that my son is my life.

522
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,169
He's all I have.

523
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:11,509
And no matter what the police think,
and no matter what the world thinks,

524
00:36:13,093 --> 00:36:14,929
you and I,

525
00:36:16,013 --> 00:36:19,016
we both know the truth,
don't we?

526
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:23,603
We both know that
you're not Walter.

527
00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:27,649
You just have to tell them
that you're not my son,

528
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:29,692
so they can find my son.

529
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:34,531
Please.

530
00:36:41,121 --> 00:36:43,998
We can talk tomorrow.

531
00:37:05,895 --> 00:37:06,980
Hello?

532
00:37:07,063 --> 00:37:09,107
<i>Is this
Mrs. Christine Collins?</i>

533
00:37:09,149 --> 00:37:10,733
Yes.

534
00:37:10,817 --> 00:37:12,402
My name is Gustav Briegleb.

535
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:15,821
I'm the pastor over at
St. Paul's Presbyterian.

536
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:19,158
Oh, yes, I've heard
your broadcasts.

537
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,742
I'm...

538
00:37:20,826 --> 00:37:22,703
Thank you.

539
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:25,330
<i>Have you read
the Times this morning?</i>

540
00:37:25,414 --> 00:37:26,540
No.

541
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,253
<i>Well, maybe you should give it a gander
and then come over here to the parish</i>

542
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:34,381
for breakfast, in, say, an
hour. I think we should meet.

543
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,218
Hello?

544
00:37:46,185 --> 00:37:48,228
"Mysterious case of...

545
00:37:48,312 --> 00:37:50,689
"Acting on the request of the
Los Angeles Police Department,

546
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:54,902
"Dr. Earl W. Tarr, child
specialist, examined Walter Collins

547
00:37:54,985 --> 00:37:56,779
"to determine the cause
of his loss of weight,

548
00:37:56,862 --> 00:37:59,490
"paleness, confusion,
and rundown condition

549
00:37:59,573 --> 00:38:00,783
"noticed since the
return of the boy

550
00:38:00,866 --> 00:38:03,327
"To his mother last Monday. "

551
00:38:04,912 --> 00:38:07,164
Lovely bit of phrasing,
isn't it?

552
00:38:07,206 --> 00:38:10,249
Noticed since the return
of the boy to his mother.

553
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:13,085
Now, not only does that clearly
state you're the boy's mother,

554
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:17,548
but one could infer from it that you're
somehow responsible for these changes.

555
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,884
And that the police
department is concerned

556
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:22,720
for the boy's welfare
while he's in your charge.

557
00:38:22,804 --> 00:38:25,306
You should try the eggs.
They're very nice.

558
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:29,560
"'I examined the boy quite
thoroughly,' Dr. Tarr said,

559
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:32,104
"'And it's clear that
he has something to tell.

560
00:38:32,188 --> 00:38:33,564
"'I'm sure that in time... "'

561
00:38:33,648 --> 00:38:37,777
...time he will give his boyish
story of the entire affair,

562
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,655
but not until he has
faith in his listener.

563
00:38:40,738 --> 00:38:44,700
And that is what is lacking here,
faith in the poor lad's story.

564
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:48,955
Course of my examination, I found
nothing to dispute the findings

565
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:50,832
of the LAPD.

566
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:54,252
Why would they do this?

567
00:38:54,335 --> 00:38:57,338
To avoid admitting
they made a mistake

568
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:59,048
when they brought
back the wrong boy.

569
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:01,801
Of course, anyone reading the
newspaper with half a brain

570
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:03,927
would see
through it instantly.

571
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:08,014
<i>Sadly, that would exclude about
half the readership of the Times.</i>

572
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:13,103
Mrs. Collins, I have made it my mission
in life to bring to light all the things

573
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:16,731
the LAPD wish none
of us ever knew about.

574
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:22,863
A department ruled by violence, abuse,
murder, corruption and intimidation.

575
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:27,409
When Chief Davis took over the
force two years ago, he said...

576
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:30,829
We will hold court against gunmen
in the streets of Los Angeles.

577
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:33,832
I want them brought
in dead, not alive,

578
00:39:33,915 --> 00:39:37,752
and I will reprimand any officer who
shows the least mercy to a criminal.

579
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:41,298
He picked 50 of the most
violent cops on the force,

580
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:44,926
gave them machine guns and permission
to shoot anyone who got in their way.

581
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,471
He called them
the Gun Squad.

582
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,851
<i>No lawyers, no trials, no questions,
no suspensions, no investigations.</i>

583
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:54,811
Just piles of bodies.

584
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:59,773
<i>Bodies in the morgues, bodies in the
hospitals, bodies by the side of the road.</i>

585
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:04,236
And not because the LAPD
wanted to wipe out crime. No.

586
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,865
The LAPD wanted to
wipe out the competition.

587
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:09,950
Mayor Cryer and half
the force are on the take.

588
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:13,162
<i>Gambling, prostitution,
bootlegging, you name it.</i>

589
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:16,499
<i>Because once you give people the
freedom to do whatever they want,</i>

590
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:21,378
as the Lord found in the Garden
of Eden, they will do exactly that.

591
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,299
This police department does not
tolerate dissent, or contradiction,

592
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:27,760
or even embarrassment.

593
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:32,598
And you are in a position to
embarrass them and they do not like it.

594
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:35,518
They will do anything in
their power to discredit you.

595
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:39,188
I've seen that happen too many
times to start going blind now.

596
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,315
That's why I wanted
to meet you,

597
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:44,235
to let you know what
you're getting yourself into

598
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:47,780
and to help you fight it,
if you choose to.

599
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:50,240
Reverend, I appreciate
everything that you're doing

600
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,701
and everything
that you said,

601
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,663
but I'm not on a mission.

602
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,790
I just want my son home.

603
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,044
Mrs. Collins, a lot
of mothers' sons

604
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:06,297
have been sacrificed
to expediency around here.

605
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,675
Your son, unfortunately,
would not be the first.

606
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,095
But if you do it right,
he may very well be the last.

607
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,397
He had two cavities
that needed filling.

608
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,150
He put up a fight,
but I took care of it.

609
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,484
And?

610
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:30,196
Your son's upper front teeth were
separated by a small tissue, a diastema.

611
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,782
It made them sit about
an eighth of an inch apart.

612
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:35,285
The boy in that room
has no such gap.

613
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,620
Can that change with age? Because
that's what they're gonna say.

614
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,122
In some cases,
yes, it's possible.

615
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,499
But the tissue between Walter's
teeth prevents that from happening.

616
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,919
See, they can never come together
without an operation to sever the tissue,

617
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,715
and I can tell you right now that
he has never had such an operation.

618
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,135
Would you be willing to put
that officially in writing?

619
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:55,971
Pardon my language,
but hell yes.

620
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,893
Sounds like the
anesthetic's wearing off.

621
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:04,313
On the other hand, maybe
I'll write that letter first.

622
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,441
Give the little fella
something to think about.

623
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:19,328
Well, if it is,
he's changed enormously.

624
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,288
Do you know who I am?

625
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:22,664
You're a teacher.

626
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:25,918
Yes, but even teachers
have names. What's mine?

627
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,629
I don't remember.

628
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,507
I know you, but I don't
remember your name.

629
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,135
Mrs. Fox.
Now, take your seat.

630
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:54,237
I didn't say take a seat. I said
take your seat, the one assigned you.

631
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,950
You must know where it is, you've
been sitting in it for over a year now.

632
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:10,753
Mrs. Collins, if that's your
son, I'll eat my yardstick.

633
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:14,215
Not only will I put it in writing, I
will testify to it in a court of law

634
00:43:14,298 --> 00:43:18,010
or to the President Calvin
Coolidge himself if I have to.

635
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,304
Thank you.

636
00:43:23,141 --> 00:43:25,226
I'll see you tonight
for the broadcast.

637
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:26,644
Good luck.

638
00:43:35,861 --> 00:43:37,112
Quick question, ma'am.

639
00:43:37,195 --> 00:43:38,363
Quick question!

640
00:43:38,447 --> 00:43:40,157
Mrs. Collins.

641
00:43:41,408 --> 00:43:43,493
Hello. My name is
Christine Collins.

642
00:43:43,577 --> 00:43:45,787
Good morning.
Good morning.

643
00:43:45,871 --> 00:43:50,417
On March 10th, my nine-year-old
son, Walter Collins, disappeared.

644
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,210
And a five-month investigation

645
00:43:52,294 --> 00:43:56,256
led to a boy being brought to
Los Angeles from DeKalb, Illinois.

646
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,719
They told me and all of you
that this boy was my son.

647
00:44:00,802 --> 00:44:02,637
He was not my son.

648
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:04,639
The LAPD made a mistake,

649
00:44:04,723 --> 00:44:08,393
and that is the reason for
the supposed transformation.

650
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:10,937
I have letters from his
teachers and his doctors

651
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:13,398
all confirming that
he is not my son.

652
00:44:13,482 --> 00:44:17,611
I'm having them reprinted now, and
I'll have them for you tomorrow.

653
00:44:17,694 --> 00:44:21,156
I have given the LAPD every
opportunity to admit their mistake

654
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:23,491
and renew the
search for my son.

655
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:25,451
Since they have
refused to do so,

656
00:44:25,534 --> 00:44:28,412
it has forced me
to bring my case public.

657
00:44:28,496 --> 00:44:32,208
And I hope that this now will persuade
them to finish what they started

658
00:44:32,249 --> 00:44:34,919
and bring my son home to me.

659
00:44:35,002 --> 00:44:36,504
Thank you very much.

660
00:44:49,642 --> 00:44:50,893
Morelli!

661
00:44:51,477 --> 00:44:53,854
I want you to find the
Collins woman and get her here.

662
00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:56,148
And, Bill, bring her
in the back way.

663
00:44:56,232 --> 00:44:57,274
Yes, sir.

664
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:09,787
This way, miss.

665
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:11,914
Why are we going
in the back?

666
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:14,750
Captain's orders. Front's
jammed with reporters.

667
00:45:19,671 --> 00:45:22,382
Please, sit down, miss. Captain
Jones'll be right with you.

668
00:45:22,465 --> 00:45:26,761
Hey! Anyone want to take a call
from the Canadian Mounties? Ybarra?

669
00:45:26,845 --> 00:45:28,096
What'd they do,
lose a moose?

670
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:31,433
They need a juvenile living here
illegally deported back to Canada.

671
00:45:31,474 --> 00:45:34,894
He's living with his cousin on some
ranch near Riverside, in Wineville.

672
00:45:34,978 --> 00:45:36,020
You want it?
I'll take it.

673
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:37,147
Got nothing better to do.

674
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,648
You're a prince.

675
00:45:41,151 --> 00:45:42,569
Mrs. Collins.

676
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:45,822
You can leave the boy.
She'll take care of him.

677
00:45:50,994 --> 00:45:52,245
Sit.

678
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:55,707
Oh, you've caused us quite a
bit of trouble, Mrs. Collins.

679
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:58,793
This situation has become an embarrassment
for the entire police department.

680
00:45:58,877 --> 00:46:00,420
It wasn't my intention
to embarrass anyone.

681
00:46:00,503 --> 00:46:01,963
Oh, no, of course not.

682
00:46:02,005 --> 00:46:05,717
You just told the papers we couldn't
tell one boy from another as a compliment

683
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,969
for the months we spent
working on your case.

684
00:46:08,052 --> 00:46:10,429
You trying to make fools out of
us? Is that it? You enjoy this?

685
00:46:10,512 --> 00:46:12,639
Of course not.

686
00:46:12,681 --> 00:46:13,932
I want you to find my son.

687
00:46:14,016 --> 00:46:15,768
You know what your
problem is, Mrs. Collins?

688
00:46:15,851 --> 00:46:17,770
You're trying to shirk your
responsibilities as a mother.

689
00:46:17,853 --> 00:46:18,979
What?

690
00:46:19,062 --> 00:46:21,148
You enjoyed being a
free woman, didn't you?

691
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,275
You enjoyed not having to
worry about a young son.

692
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:25,861
You could go where you
wanted, do whatever you wanted,

693
00:46:25,944 --> 00:46:27,738
see anyone you wanted.

694
00:46:27,821 --> 00:46:30,324
But then we found your son,
and we brought him back.

695
00:46:30,365 --> 00:46:32,618
And now he's an
inconvenience to you.

696
00:46:32,701 --> 00:46:35,496
And that's why you
cooked up this scheme,

697
00:46:35,537 --> 00:46:38,373
to throw him to the state and get
the state to raise him for you.

698
00:46:38,457 --> 00:46:40,209
Isn't that true?
That is not true!

699
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:42,628
No? Well, even the boy
says he's your son.

700
00:46:42,711 --> 00:46:44,004
Why would he say that?

701
00:46:44,046 --> 00:46:45,714
How would he know
to do that?

702
00:46:45,798 --> 00:46:47,758
I don't know.
I just know he's lying.

703
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:50,219
Oh, maybe so.
Maybe he is a liar.

704
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,554
But that's how he's
been trained, isn't it?

705
00:46:52,596 --> 00:46:54,473
Lying was born
in both of you.

706
00:46:54,556 --> 00:46:56,558
You're a liar and a
troublemaker and, if you ask me,

707
00:46:56,642 --> 00:46:58,644
you got no business walking
the streets of Los Angeles.

708
00:46:58,727 --> 00:46:59,770
Now wait a minute.

709
00:46:59,853 --> 00:47:01,730
Because either
you know you're lying,

710
00:47:01,772 --> 00:47:05,525
or you're not capable of knowing if
you're lying or telling the truth.

711
00:47:05,566 --> 00:47:07,110
So, which is it?

712
00:47:08,528 --> 00:47:11,072
You a derelict mother?
Or just plain nuts?

713
00:47:11,155 --> 00:47:13,366
'Cause from where I sit,
those are the only options.

714
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,742
I'm not gonna sit
here and take this.

715
00:47:14,826 --> 00:47:17,078
You want experts? You want
doctors? I have a few of my own.

716
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:18,371
Matron.

717
00:47:21,874 --> 00:47:26,254
Mrs. Collins, you still insist that
the boy out there is not your son?

718
00:47:26,295 --> 00:47:27,630
Yes, I do.

719
00:47:31,134 --> 00:47:32,426
Please, don't struggle.
What?

720
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:33,678
No!
You'll only hurt yourself.

721
00:47:33,761 --> 00:47:35,012
What are you doing?
Hold still.

722
00:47:35,096 --> 00:47:36,639
You can't just do this.
No, you can't.

723
00:47:36,722 --> 00:47:37,849
You are to
convey the prisoner

724
00:47:37,932 --> 00:47:40,017
to the Los Angeles County General
Hospital Psychopathic Ward.

725
00:47:40,101 --> 00:47:41,227
What?

726
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,521
You are to make
the following entry.

727
00:47:43,604 --> 00:47:46,190
Defendant states she's been
deceived by police and others,

728
00:47:46,274 --> 00:47:47,733
and that we have given
her a boy and tried

729
00:47:47,817 --> 00:47:50,611
to make her think it is her
son when she says it is not.

730
00:47:50,695 --> 00:47:53,781
Take her away.
No. No, no.

731
00:47:54,907 --> 00:47:56,116
Please. Please.

732
00:47:56,199 --> 00:47:57,367
Come on,
Mrs. Collins.

733
00:47:57,451 --> 00:47:59,327
No. No.

734
00:47:59,411 --> 00:48:00,579
This way.

735
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:08,795
<i>Mrs. Collins has been known to
us since about March 10th, 1928</i>

736
00:48:08,879 --> 00:48:11,673
<i>when she reported her
nine-year-old son, Walter, missing.</i>

737
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:14,426
<i>The boy was gone until
August 1928. Okay.</i>

738
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:18,388
<i>Since his return, she has
complained that he is still missing</i>

739
00:48:18,472 --> 00:48:21,099
<i>and has made repeated
requests that he be found.</i>

740
00:48:21,183 --> 00:48:26,271
<i>She suffers from paranoia, delusions of
persecution and dislocation from reality.</i>

741
00:48:27,314 --> 00:48:29,858
<i>She may be a threat
to herself or others.</i>

742
00:48:29,983 --> 00:48:33,612
<i>We recommend that she be
conveyed to the psychopathic ward</i>

743
00:48:33,695 --> 00:48:35,405
<i>until her senses
can be restored.</i>

744
00:48:35,489 --> 00:48:36,740
Got another code 12.

745
00:48:36,823 --> 00:48:37,908
Name?

746
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:39,034
Collins. Christine.

747
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:40,577
No, no, no, listen,
this is a mistake.

748
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:41,912
Certifying officer?

749
00:48:41,995 --> 00:48:44,456
Captain J.J. Jones,
Lincoln Heights Division.

750
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:46,541
No, no, please! Please! The
police are trying to punish me...

751
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:48,709
If you keep it up, I'm gonna
have to put you in a straitjacket.

752
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:50,044
Do you want that?

753
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,170
No, ma'am.

754
00:48:51,253 --> 00:48:53,672
Then behave yourself.
Code 12.

755
00:48:54,715 --> 00:48:56,342
I'm not mad!

756
00:48:56,425 --> 00:48:57,802
Please.

757
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,930
Oh, God.

758
00:49:01,013 --> 00:49:02,348
All right.

759
00:49:07,603 --> 00:49:08,854
No!

760
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,989
Stop!

761
00:49:25,204 --> 00:49:26,831
Spread your legs.

762
00:49:27,414 --> 00:49:28,499
What?

763
00:49:32,044 --> 00:49:33,546
Wider.

764
00:49:33,587 --> 00:49:35,214
Oh.

765
00:49:46,057 --> 00:49:48,893
I'm not sick!

766
00:49:55,442 --> 00:49:56,609
Touch me! Touch me!

767
00:49:58,611 --> 00:50:01,156
Inside. This is your room.

768
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:03,324
The doctor has left for the day.
He will see you in the morning.

769
00:50:03,408 --> 00:50:05,743
Can I... I need to speak
to somebody in authority.

770
00:50:05,827 --> 00:50:06,953
Sorry.

771
00:50:07,036 --> 00:50:11,708
My room! No. No, no,
no, this is my room.

772
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:13,126
Can I make
a phone call?

773
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:15,170
Phone privileges are
earned by good behavior.

774
00:50:15,253 --> 00:50:18,965
You're not allowed newspapers,
magazines, radio, books or sharp objects.

775
00:50:19,048 --> 00:50:20,467
This is for your own good.
Help me!

776
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,135
Listen to me.

777
00:50:22,218 --> 00:50:24,053
My room.

778
00:50:24,095 --> 00:50:26,806
No,
this is my room.

779
00:50:27,307 --> 00:50:29,142
Oh, God!

780
00:50:29,225 --> 00:50:30,518
My room.

781
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:35,190
No, no,
this is my room.

782
00:50:37,566 --> 00:50:39,401
My room.

783
00:50:40,903 --> 00:50:45,032
My room! My room!
My room!

784
00:50:45,324 --> 00:50:47,534
My room!

785
00:50:47,618 --> 00:50:50,496
They said it was my room!

786
00:51:02,591 --> 00:51:04,510
You have a problem?

787
00:51:04,593 --> 00:51:07,971
Overheated, that's all.
She'll be fine in a bit.

788
00:51:09,306 --> 00:51:10,808
Hey, listen, could
you give me a hand?

789
00:51:10,891 --> 00:51:14,686
I'm trying to find a place called
the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.

790
00:51:16,146 --> 00:51:17,981
Northcott Ranch, huh?

791
00:51:21,235 --> 00:51:24,530
Oh, yeah, yeah.

792
00:51:24,988 --> 00:51:27,699
You're almost there.

793
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:31,285
You just... You just
follow this road west,

794
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:33,996
about two, no, three miles.

795
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,624
And then you take
that next right.

796
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:40,128
And you stay on that and it
will bring you right to it.

797
00:51:42,672 --> 00:51:45,007
Is something going
on out there?

798
00:51:45,091 --> 00:51:46,217
No.

799
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,469
Just looking into
a juvenile matter.

800
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:50,847
Thanks for your help.

801
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,140
Sure.

802
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,187
Hello?

803
00:53:25,856 --> 00:53:27,942
Hey!

804
00:53:28,025 --> 00:53:30,444
Hey! Hey!

805
00:53:30,528 --> 00:53:33,572
Come here!
Come here!

806
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,830
This is the police!

807
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:44,083
I have a warrant for a
minor named Sanford Clark.

808
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:47,753
Open the door
or stand aside.

809
00:55:01,075 --> 00:55:02,493
Hey! Stop!

810
00:55:03,577 --> 00:55:06,830
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

811
00:55:06,914 --> 00:55:10,000
Stop it! Stop it or I'll push
your face through this floor!

812
00:55:10,042 --> 00:55:11,126
Stop it!

813
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:12,252
Fine!

814
00:55:12,795 --> 00:55:14,713
Give me your hands.

815
00:55:24,306 --> 00:55:25,974
Come on.
Sit down.

816
00:55:27,518 --> 00:55:28,769
Jesus!

817
00:55:30,395 --> 00:55:31,855
What the hell is
wrong with you, kid?

818
00:55:31,897 --> 00:55:33,357
Huh?

819
00:55:33,398 --> 00:55:35,275
Don't you know assaulting
a cop is against the law?

820
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,528
What difference
does it make?

821
00:55:39,154 --> 00:55:41,782
We're just sending you
back to Canada, son.

822
00:55:41,865 --> 00:55:44,034
It isn't the end
of the world.

823
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,869
What?

824
00:55:47,788 --> 00:55:51,500
Well, you can't stay in the
U.S. As long as you want, pal.

825
00:55:56,212 --> 00:55:57,797
No word from Mrs. Collins?

826
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,257
We haven't heard from her.

827
00:55:59,298 --> 00:56:01,509
Get on down to her house,
make sure she's all right.

828
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:03,052
And if she's not there,
check with her neighbors.

829
00:56:03,136 --> 00:56:04,220
Find out what they know.

830
00:56:04,262 --> 00:56:05,346
Absolutely.

831
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:08,474
<i>And now KGF welcomes the
Reverend Gustav Briegleb</i>

832
00:56:08,558 --> 00:56:10,726
<i>of St. Paul's Presbyterian.</i>

833
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:15,189
This is Pastor Gustav A. Briegleb
of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church,

834
00:56:15,273 --> 00:56:18,109
bringing you the Lord's
word on Radio KGF.

835
00:56:18,192 --> 00:56:19,861
Good evening.

836
00:56:19,944 --> 00:56:21,863
I had hoped to have
a guest with us tonight,

837
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:24,240
but apparently
she has been delayed.

838
00:56:24,282 --> 00:56:28,244
<i>And since she cannot be here to tell you
what she told the press this afternoon,</i>

839
00:56:28,327 --> 00:56:30,955
<i>I'll have to fill in
as best I can.</i>

840
00:56:31,038 --> 00:56:32,790
<i>I'm going to tell
you what happened</i>

841
00:56:32,874 --> 00:56:37,128
<i>and I'm going to keep on telling
you every night, right here,</i>

842
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:40,256
<i>until somebody does
something about it.</i>

843
00:56:44,051 --> 00:56:47,138
<i>The Desert Local,
train number 45,</i>

844
00:56:47,221 --> 00:56:50,515
<i>will be arriving on
track two in five minutes.</i>

845
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,226
Hello. I'd like a
ticket to Canada.

846
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,520
Alberta or Vancouver,
whatever's leaving tonight.

847
00:56:55,604 --> 00:56:57,564
I don't have anything
going that far tonight.

848
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,858
The best I can do is put
you on a train to Seattle.

849
00:56:59,941 --> 00:57:02,694
From there you can transfer to a
local or drive across the border.

850
00:57:02,778 --> 00:57:04,154
That would be fine.

851
00:57:04,237 --> 00:57:05,447
Roundtrip?

852
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:06,656
One way.

853
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,158
That'll be $15.

854
00:57:08,241 --> 00:57:09,284
Right.

855
00:57:12,913 --> 00:57:14,539
There you go.

856
00:57:14,623 --> 00:57:16,124
Thank you. There you
go. Enjoy your trip.

857
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:17,417
I will.

858
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:37,062
Breakfast is half an hour.

859
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:44,026
Please, miss, I need to
see a doctor in charge.

860
00:57:44,068 --> 00:57:45,528
The dining room
is down the hall.

861
00:57:45,611 --> 00:57:48,531
The doctor will call
for you when he's ready.

862
00:58:00,501 --> 00:58:02,670
Do you want
eggs or oatmeal?

863
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:06,173
Okay, that's everyone
that's here.

864
00:58:06,257 --> 00:58:07,633
All right.

865
00:58:07,716 --> 00:58:09,552
You can pull the oatmeal.

866
00:58:09,635 --> 00:58:11,011
Do you want
it for tomorrow?

867
00:58:11,053 --> 00:58:12,430
You know, just dump it. All right.

868
00:58:12,513 --> 00:58:14,014
You should eat.

869
00:58:15,015 --> 00:58:16,809
Eating is normal.

870
00:58:16,892 --> 00:58:19,687
You gotta do everything
you can to look normal.

871
00:58:19,728 --> 00:58:21,230
It's the only chance
you got.

872
00:58:21,272 --> 00:58:22,440
I'm not hungry.

873
00:58:22,523 --> 00:58:24,775
Barbara, you have to
eat now. I'm not hungry.

874
00:58:24,859 --> 00:58:27,361
My name's Carol Dexter.
What's yours?

875
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:29,989
Christine.
Christine Collins.

876
00:58:32,032 --> 00:58:34,201
Now, finish it all. I know
it's hard, but you gotta try.

877
00:58:34,285 --> 00:58:35,577
Oh, boy.

878
00:58:42,417 --> 00:58:44,210
I heard them talking.

879
00:58:44,294 --> 00:58:46,337
You're here on code 12?

880
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:48,047
Police action.

881
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:49,674
I mean, the doctors,
the staff, they figure

882
00:58:49,758 --> 00:58:51,092
that if the police
brought you here,

883
00:58:51,134 --> 00:58:53,178
there must be
a good reason for it.

884
00:58:53,261 --> 00:58:55,638
There isn't a good
reason for it.

885
00:58:56,139 --> 00:58:59,392
I'm perfectly sane and I
will explain that to them.

886
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:01,186
How?

887
00:59:02,312 --> 00:59:06,065
The more you try to act sane,
the crazier you start to look.

888
00:59:06,107 --> 00:59:09,944
If you smile too much, you're
delusional or you're stifling hysteria.

889
00:59:10,028 --> 00:59:12,781
And if you don't smile,
you're depressed.

890
00:59:12,864 --> 00:59:17,410
If you remain neutral, you're emotionally
withdrawn, potentially catatonic.

891
00:59:21,122 --> 00:59:22,957
You've given this
a lot of thought.

892
00:59:22,999 --> 00:59:25,668
Yeah, I have.
Don't you get it?

893
00:59:26,503 --> 00:59:28,921
You're a code 12,
so am I.

894
00:59:28,962 --> 00:59:31,173
We're here for the
exact same reasons.

895
00:59:31,256 --> 00:59:33,383
We both pissed
off the cops.

896
00:59:34,468 --> 00:59:37,387
Now, you see, you
see that lady there?

897
00:59:37,471 --> 00:59:39,890
She was married to a cop
who kept beating her up.

898
00:59:39,973 --> 00:59:42,976
When she tried to tell somebody
about it, he brought her here.

899
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,311
I want more juice.

900
00:59:44,394 --> 00:59:45,604
And that one?

901
00:59:45,646 --> 00:59:46,980
Put your tray
back where it belongs.

902
00:59:47,064 --> 00:59:51,276
The police beat the crap out of
her brother, broke both his arms.

903
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,821
When she tried to
tell the papers...

904
00:59:56,365 --> 00:59:57,616
And you?

905
00:59:58,826 --> 01:00:01,787
I work nights.

906
01:00:02,329 --> 01:00:03,831
Sure.

907
01:00:04,748 --> 01:00:08,043
I mean, I work nights.

908
01:00:09,837 --> 01:00:10,921
Oh.

909
01:00:11,004 --> 01:00:12,131
Yeah. In the clubs.
Downtown.

910
01:00:12,214 --> 01:00:13,298
I'm sorry.

911
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:17,177
Yeah, well, this one client just
kept hitting me and he wouldn't stop,

912
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:19,304
so I filed a complaint.

913
01:00:19,346 --> 01:00:21,849
And it turns out
he was a cop.

914
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:24,016
Next thing I know,
I'm here.

915
01:00:24,767 --> 01:00:26,811
But they can't do that.

916
01:00:26,853 --> 01:00:27,937
Are you kidding?

917
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,522
All right, one
more and then that's it.

918
01:00:29,605 --> 01:00:32,066
Everybody knows
women are fragile.

919
01:00:32,525 --> 01:00:35,403
I mean, they're all emotions, no logic,
there's nothing going on upstairs.

920
01:00:35,486 --> 01:00:37,071
Somebody! Help me!

921
01:00:37,155 --> 01:00:39,824
Every once in a while they say
something that's a little inconvenient,

922
01:00:39,866 --> 01:00:41,451
they just go fucking nuts.

923
01:00:41,534 --> 01:00:42,660
Pardon my French.

924
01:00:42,702 --> 01:00:44,454
You gotta get those dishes. You got it.

925
01:00:44,537 --> 01:00:48,249
If we're insane, nobody
has to listen to us.

926
01:00:49,459 --> 01:00:51,085
I mean, who are
you gonna believe,

927
01:00:51,169 --> 01:00:54,505
some crazy woman trying to
destroy the integrity of the force,

928
01:00:54,547 --> 01:00:56,340
or a police officer?

929
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:01,095
Then once they get us in here, we
either shut up and we learn to behave,

930
01:01:01,179 --> 01:01:02,847
or we don't go home.

931
01:01:02,889 --> 01:01:04,515
Are you all done?

932
01:01:05,808 --> 01:01:07,769
Or we go home like that.

933
01:01:44,471 --> 01:01:47,933
Stop. Stop it.

934
01:01:48,809 --> 01:01:51,061
Stop it!
Stop it.

935
01:01:51,186 --> 01:01:52,395
Please.

936
01:01:55,107 --> 01:01:56,233
Clark.

937
01:01:57,275 --> 01:01:58,777
Sanford Clark?

938
01:01:59,611 --> 01:02:00,737
Here.

939
01:02:01,738 --> 01:02:03,782
Paperwork's come through.

940
01:02:03,865 --> 01:02:06,284
You'll be deported back to
Canada day after tomorrow.

941
01:02:06,368 --> 01:02:08,620
Police there will decide
what to do with you next.

942
01:02:08,703 --> 01:02:11,997
I hope your stay here has convinced
you not to try crossing the border

943
01:02:12,081 --> 01:02:13,833
illegally in the future.

944
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:15,084
Wait!

945
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:20,423
I'd like to talk to the
officer who brought me in.

946
01:02:20,506 --> 01:02:22,299
I'm sure he has far
more important things...

947
01:02:22,383 --> 01:02:24,677
Please. It's important.

948
01:02:31,517 --> 01:02:33,185
Christine Collins.

949
01:02:33,269 --> 01:02:35,938
Thank you. Mrs. Collins.

950
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:40,443
Dr. Jonathan Steele.
Please, have a seat.

951
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:51,495
I hope your stay with us
has been comfortable so far.

952
01:02:52,455 --> 01:02:53,581
Yes.

953
01:02:54,081 --> 01:02:55,541
Really?

954
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:59,128
I'd think it'd
be quite difficult at first.

955
01:03:01,756 --> 01:03:02,964
Yes, it was.

956
01:03:03,006 --> 01:03:06,843
Of course it was very difficult,
but comfortable enough.

957
01:03:17,145 --> 01:03:20,523
I see that they have...
They've taken a blood test.

958
01:03:21,775 --> 01:03:23,526
The Wassermman Test.

959
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:27,739
They said it was to check for
syphilis, 'cause it affects the mind.

960
01:03:27,864 --> 01:03:31,659
The idea that someone thinks you
need to be checked for syphilis,

961
01:03:31,701 --> 01:03:33,578
does that upset you?

962
01:03:33,661 --> 01:03:35,997
No, they said it was standard
procedure, so it did not.

963
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:38,458
Yes, exactly.
Standard procedure.

964
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:40,376
We have to cover
all our bases.

965
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:41,878
I can imagine

966
01:03:44,214 --> 01:03:46,841
that for some people that
would be uncomfortable,

967
01:03:46,925 --> 01:03:49,094
but I understood.

968
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:12,950
According to your file you
believe that the police substituted

969
01:04:13,075 --> 01:04:15,160
a fake boy for your son.

970
01:04:15,244 --> 01:04:17,413
No, I didn't say
he was a fake boy.

971
01:04:17,496 --> 01:04:19,581
He's not my boy.

972
01:04:19,665 --> 01:04:21,083
They brought home
the wrong boy.

973
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:23,127
My son is still missing.

974
01:04:23,335 --> 01:04:28,215
Well, that's strange, because
I have here a newspaper article

975
01:04:28,674 --> 01:04:34,179
with a photo of you at the train
station, welcoming home your son.

976
01:04:37,057 --> 01:04:39,226
That is you in the
photo, isn't it?

977
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:40,853
Yes.

978
01:04:40,936 --> 01:04:42,020
Yeah.

979
01:04:42,729 --> 01:04:43,730
Yes.

980
01:04:43,814 --> 01:04:46,775
So, at first
he was your son,

981
01:04:48,277 --> 01:04:50,069
and now he's not your son.

982
01:04:52,029 --> 01:04:53,948
Has this been going
on for a long time?

983
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:57,618
People changing, becoming
something other than what they are?

984
01:04:57,702 --> 01:04:59,579
People don't change.

985
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:01,205
You don't think
people change?

986
01:05:01,289 --> 01:05:02,373
No, that's not...

987
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:08,254
The police, they're not
out to persecute you?

988
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:10,715
No, they're not.

989
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:13,885
The police are here
to protect you.

990
01:05:14,635 --> 01:05:15,928
Yes.

991
01:05:16,137 --> 01:05:17,597
Really?

992
01:05:17,638 --> 01:05:18,723
Yes.

993
01:05:19,807 --> 01:05:24,145
Well, that's odd because
when you were admitted,

994
01:05:25,146 --> 01:05:31,360
you told the head nurse that the police
were conspiring deliberately to punish you.

995
01:05:31,486 --> 01:05:35,907
So, either the head nurse and the
interns are also conspiring to punish you

996
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:38,201
or you're changing
your story.

997
01:05:44,498 --> 01:05:50,545
Do you often have trouble telling
reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?

998
01:05:53,006 --> 01:05:54,049
No.

999
01:06:05,936 --> 01:06:07,979
I'm sorry to bring you out
in this weather, Detective,

1000
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:10,023
but the boy has
been quite insistent.

1001
01:06:10,107 --> 01:06:11,483
It's all right.

1002
01:06:11,525 --> 01:06:14,486
I'll see what he has to say
so I can go home and get dry.

1003
01:06:14,528 --> 01:06:17,155
It's raining cats, dogs,
and Democrats out there,

1004
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,533
so this had better
be worth it.

1005
01:06:20,117 --> 01:06:21,660
You again, huh?

1006
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:29,501
We'll see.

1007
01:06:33,213 --> 01:06:34,339
Well?

1008
01:06:37,174 --> 01:06:38,384
This isn't easy, okay?

1009
01:06:38,467 --> 01:06:39,468
Yeah?

1010
01:06:39,552 --> 01:06:42,888
Driving my ass here in the
pouring rain wasn't easy either.

1011
01:06:44,557 --> 01:06:47,309
My cousin is
Gordon Northcott.

1012
01:06:47,393 --> 01:06:49,979
He owns the ranch
where you found me.

1013
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:54,984
He said I could live there in exchange
I watch the place when he's gone,

1014
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:58,028
doing chores
and stuff like that.

1015
01:06:59,572 --> 01:07:02,366
Said I could stay as
long as I wanted to.

1016
01:07:03,325 --> 01:07:06,036
I thought that meant I could
leave whenever I wanted.

1017
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,204
Mmm.

1018
01:07:07,246 --> 01:07:09,582
You saying that he
held you prisoner?

1019
01:07:09,623 --> 01:07:10,791
Bull.

1020
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:13,753
When I got there, you were
running around free as a jaybird.

1021
01:07:13,794 --> 01:07:15,755
Could've left any
time you wanted.

1022
01:07:15,796 --> 01:07:16,839
No.

1023
01:07:16,922 --> 01:07:18,674
So, what's this, huh?

1024
01:07:18,758 --> 01:07:20,801
Some kind of story to cover why
you're in the country illegally?

1025
01:07:20,885 --> 01:07:22,011
No, it's nothing like that.

1026
01:07:22,094 --> 01:07:23,137
'Cause I don't have
time for this, okay?

1027
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,388
Listen to me!
He said...

1028
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:25,723
What?

1029
01:07:25,765 --> 01:07:27,516
What did he say?

1030
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,894
He said that if I tried
to leave, he'd kill me.

1031
01:07:30,935 --> 01:07:33,980
Look, you don't understand
what he's like,

1032
01:07:34,063 --> 01:07:37,400
what he... What we did,
what he made me do.

1033
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,362
All right.

1034
01:07:41,446 --> 01:07:43,865
Let's start at
the beginning then.

1035
01:07:47,494 --> 01:07:49,579
What'd he make you do?

1036
01:07:54,959 --> 01:07:56,377
We killed some kids.

1037
01:07:56,461 --> 01:07:57,712
What?

1038
01:07:57,796 --> 01:08:01,382
Look, I didn't mean to, I
swear. He made me help him.

1039
01:08:01,466 --> 01:08:04,052
He said if I didn't,
he'd kill me, too.

1040
01:08:04,135 --> 01:08:06,805
Look, you gotta help me,
please. I'm so scared.

1041
01:08:06,888 --> 01:08:09,891
I don't want to go
to hell for killing kids.

1042
01:08:09,974 --> 01:08:11,309
Look.

1043
01:08:11,392 --> 01:08:14,229
What kids? What... What
are you talking about?

1044
01:08:14,312 --> 01:08:16,815
I don't know.
I never knew their names.

1045
01:08:16,898 --> 01:08:18,400
Names?

1046
01:08:18,483 --> 01:08:19,484
How many?

1047
01:08:19,567 --> 01:08:21,069
How many kids?

1048
01:08:21,152 --> 01:08:22,486
All together?

1049
01:08:26,907 --> 01:08:28,784
About 20, I guess.

1050
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,537
No, you're lying.

1051
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,997
No! It's true, I swear!

1052
01:08:34,039 --> 01:08:35,707
You're gonna tell me
you killed 20 kids?

1053
01:08:35,791 --> 01:08:39,253
Yeah! Thereabouts.

1054
01:08:41,588 --> 01:08:44,007
I stopped counting
after a while.

1055
01:08:47,845 --> 01:08:51,598
Gordon said maybe one
or two may have escaped.

1056
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:56,311
But...

1057
01:08:56,395 --> 01:08:57,438
No.

1058
01:08:57,521 --> 01:09:00,357
Nobody can just up
and kill 20 kids, okay?

1059
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:01,608
We did.

1060
01:09:04,027 --> 01:09:05,195
We did.

1061
01:09:08,115 --> 01:09:09,158
How?

1062
01:09:11,285 --> 01:09:13,662
Most times we'd just
have one or two.

1063
01:09:15,289 --> 01:09:17,206
Sometimes as many as three.

1064
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:23,004
<i>I always knew when we
were getting ready to leave.</i>

1065
01:09:25,465 --> 01:09:27,175
<i>Clean up the car.</i>

1066
01:09:28,217 --> 01:09:30,470
<i>Make sure the tires
were good.</i>

1067
01:09:31,387 --> 01:09:33,181
<i>Check the engine.</i>

1068
01:09:34,891 --> 01:09:38,352
<i>'Cause he was afraid that
the car would break down</i>

1069
01:09:40,063 --> 01:09:41,898
<i>and we'd get caught.</i>

1070
01:09:44,067 --> 01:09:45,818
<i>My loving baby</i>

1071
01:09:45,902 --> 01:09:48,988
We'd always go a different
direction every time.

1072
01:09:50,823 --> 01:09:53,242
Never hit the same
part of town twice.

1073
01:09:53,326 --> 01:09:56,746
<i>Sometimes we'd just
drive around for hours,</i>

1074
01:09:57,371 --> 01:09:58,831
<i>till we found somebody.</i>

1075
01:09:58,915 --> 01:10:00,416
Well, there you are!

1076
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,293
We've been looking
for you like mad.

1077
01:10:02,376 --> 01:10:03,628
You have?

1078
01:10:03,711 --> 01:10:05,088
Sure thing.

1079
01:10:05,129 --> 01:10:08,091
Listen, your folks,
they've been in an accident.

1080
01:10:08,882 --> 01:10:11,176
And they sent us to come find
you. Now, they're hurt real bad.

1081
01:10:11,259 --> 01:10:14,012
The police took them to the hospital, but
they didn't have time to come find you,

1082
01:10:14,096 --> 01:10:16,056
so we said that
we would do it.

1083
01:10:16,306 --> 01:10:17,766
Now, come on.

1084
01:10:17,808 --> 01:10:20,394
All right.
Get in here. Hurry.

1085
01:10:20,435 --> 01:10:23,772
Listen, we gotta get you to that
hospital so you can see your folks.

1086
01:10:23,855 --> 01:10:27,067
<i>See, a lot of kids won't get
in a car alone with a stranger,</i>

1087
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:28,485
<i>but when he's got
a kid there...</i>

1088
01:10:28,568 --> 01:10:30,195
There's a good boy.

1089
01:10:30,278 --> 01:10:31,655
Scoot over.
Scoot over, San.

1090
01:10:31,738 --> 01:10:33,281
<i>...that made it easier.</i>

1091
01:10:33,365 --> 01:10:34,825
I want you to hold on tight.

1092
01:10:34,908 --> 01:10:36,201
<i>They'd look
at me and say...</i>

1093
01:10:36,284 --> 01:10:37,536
We've got a long way to go.

1094
01:10:37,619 --> 01:10:38,745
<i>"Hey, if he's safe... "</i>

1095
01:10:38,829 --> 01:10:39,996
And we are gonna fly.

1096
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,332
<i>"... I guess
I will be, too. "</i>

1097
01:10:44,292 --> 01:10:46,795
Every time they got
in the truck,

1098
01:10:48,004 --> 01:10:49,589
I just wanted to die.

1099
01:10:51,174 --> 01:10:54,428
As soon as we got back to the
ranch, they went in the coop.

1100
01:10:55,971 --> 01:10:57,305
You boys hungry?

1101
01:10:57,347 --> 01:10:58,432
Huh?

1102
01:10:58,515 --> 01:11:00,350
Watch the door, Sanford!

1103
01:11:00,475 --> 01:11:02,435
Hey! Watch the door!

1104
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:04,770
What's the matter?

1105
01:11:04,812 --> 01:11:06,105
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1106
01:11:06,147 --> 01:11:07,648
Are you worried that
I'm gonna hurt you?

1107
01:11:07,732 --> 01:11:08,816
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1108
01:11:08,899 --> 01:11:10,359
Huh? Come here.

1109
01:11:10,443 --> 01:11:12,445
No! No! No! No! Please!
I would never hurt you.

1110
01:11:12,486 --> 01:11:15,156
Some days
he'd do them right off.

1111
01:11:16,657 --> 01:11:19,994
Other days he'd wait,

1112
01:11:21,412 --> 01:11:23,706
pick up a few more,

1113
01:11:23,789 --> 01:11:26,792
until he had about
four or five of them.

1114
01:11:27,376 --> 01:11:28,502
Yeah.

1115
01:11:28,586 --> 01:11:29,920
No! No! No!
No what?

1116
01:11:30,004 --> 01:11:31,088
No what, huh?

1117
01:11:32,423 --> 01:11:33,632
Come on. Come on. Come on!

1118
01:11:33,716 --> 01:11:35,676
Sanford, keep your
eye on that door!

1119
01:11:35,718 --> 01:11:38,471
No! Please, no! No! No!

1120
01:11:38,554 --> 01:11:41,932
No! No! No! No!
Please! No! No!

1121
01:11:43,809 --> 01:11:46,896
He'd... He'd
sometimes leave

1122
01:11:46,979 --> 01:11:51,317
just one or two of them
alive, barely, anyway.

1123
01:11:51,942 --> 01:11:53,611
He'd say,

1124
01:11:53,694 --> 01:11:55,487
"Finish them, San.

1125
01:11:55,528 --> 01:11:58,823
"Finish them or... Finish
them or I'll finish you. "

1126
01:12:01,618 --> 01:12:02,994
And I did.

1127
01:12:04,871 --> 01:12:06,498
And I killed them.

1128
01:12:06,581 --> 01:12:07,832
And I did.

1129
01:12:07,874 --> 01:12:09,459
I killed them.

1130
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:11,419
Oh, God, I killed them!

1131
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:14,923
Oh, God! Oh!

1132
01:12:16,174 --> 01:12:18,301
Hey.

1133
01:12:18,384 --> 01:12:19,469
What?

1134
01:12:19,552 --> 01:12:20,887
Look at me.

1135
01:12:22,472 --> 01:12:23,848
These kids.

1136
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:29,229
You think if you saw them again, you
think you might be able to recognize them?

1137
01:12:29,562 --> 01:12:31,689
I don't know.

1138
01:12:31,773 --> 01:12:32,941
Maybe.

1139
01:12:33,358 --> 01:12:36,820
Hey, I haven't updated
these in a while, but still.

1140
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,739
Just...

1141
01:12:40,281 --> 01:12:43,535
It should be. Just go
through these, okay?

1142
01:12:48,415 --> 01:12:52,751
If you see any you recognize, just
put them down on the table here.

1143
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:33,167
I'm sorry!

1144
01:13:39,339 --> 01:13:40,466
Oh, my God.

1145
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:43,092
I didn't mean to...
He made me.

1146
01:13:50,224 --> 01:13:51,517
Oh, shit.

1147
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,939
This one. Look at me.

1148
01:13:59,817 --> 01:14:01,027
You're sure?

1149
01:14:05,364 --> 01:14:06,616
I'm sure.

1150
01:14:10,536 --> 01:14:11,579
Jesus Christ.

1151
01:14:11,662 --> 01:14:15,875
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

1152
01:14:16,167 --> 01:14:17,627
Jesus Christ.

1153
01:14:19,045 --> 01:14:20,421
Son of a bitch.

1154
01:14:23,633 --> 01:14:24,884
Oh, God.

1155
01:14:26,969 --> 01:14:27,887
Well, he's lying.

1156
01:14:27,929 --> 01:14:29,972
Have you gone soft
in the head, Les?

1157
01:14:30,056 --> 01:14:31,099
Twenty kids, sir.

1158
01:14:31,182 --> 01:14:32,183
<i>He's playing you.</i>

1159
01:14:32,225 --> 01:14:34,977
He knows he's in trouble, so he's
come up with some cock and bull story

1160
01:14:35,061 --> 01:14:37,020
about how he was forced
to stay in the country.

1161
01:14:37,104 --> 01:14:40,065
With all due respect, sir, I
don't think so. You didn't see him.

1162
01:14:40,107 --> 01:14:42,109
This kid, he's scared
half out of his mind.

1163
01:14:42,192 --> 01:14:45,320
He picked the Collins kid.
We found him, remember?

1164
01:14:45,404 --> 01:14:46,696
Haven't you been
reading the papers?

1165
01:14:47,948 --> 01:14:49,616
Or maybe you have,
is that it?

1166
01:14:49,699 --> 01:14:50,784
<i>Sir, if you'd just
listen to me...</i>

1167
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:52,285
I'm sorry, Captain,
but he's here again.

1168
01:14:52,369 --> 01:14:54,162
Who?
That Reverend Briegleb.

1169
01:14:54,246 --> 01:14:56,081
He's asking about
Christine Collins.

1170
01:14:56,123 --> 01:14:57,165
Well, you tell that
son of a bitch

1171
01:14:57,249 --> 01:14:58,792
to get the hell off
of police property,

1172
01:14:58,875 --> 01:15:00,836
or I'll have him arrested
for disturbing the peace.

1173
01:15:00,919 --> 01:15:03,964
I tried. He said he won't
leave, him or his friends.

1174
01:15:04,047 --> 01:15:05,173
What?

1175
01:15:07,467 --> 01:15:09,094
Oh, what the hell!

1176
01:15:10,846 --> 01:15:12,389
Jesus!

1177
01:15:16,601 --> 01:15:18,186
Oh, Jesus jumped down.

1178
01:15:19,062 --> 01:15:20,355
<i>Captain?</i>

1179
01:15:20,897 --> 01:15:21,898
<i>Ybarra?
Yeah.</i>

1180
01:15:21,982 --> 01:15:24,568
Listen to me. You're to do
nothing except get back here.

1181
01:15:24,609 --> 01:15:26,570
<i>Sir, departmental
policy requires that</i>

1182
01:15:26,611 --> 01:15:29,238
all allegations of homicide
have to be investigated.

1183
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,406
These are kids,
for Christ sake.

1184
01:15:30,448 --> 01:15:32,074
Departmental policy
is what I say it is.

1185
01:15:32,116 --> 01:15:35,411
Now, I'm ordering you to get your ass
back here with that kid, you got that?

1186
01:15:35,453 --> 01:15:38,372
You don't talk to anybody and
you bring me that kid. You got it?

1187
01:15:38,456 --> 01:15:39,623
Nobody!

1188
01:15:53,137 --> 01:15:55,097
Captain Jones.
Boys.

1189
01:15:55,181 --> 01:15:57,641
What the hell have you done
with Christine Collins?

1190
01:15:57,683 --> 01:15:59,894
And don't try and lie
your way out of it,

1191
01:15:59,977 --> 01:16:04,440
because several of her neighbors saw
her being driven away in a police car.

1192
01:16:04,774 --> 01:16:07,151
Mrs. Collins has been placed
in protective custody

1193
01:16:07,193 --> 01:16:09,153
following a mental breakdown.

1194
01:16:10,654 --> 01:16:11,906
A what?

1195
01:16:12,323 --> 01:16:14,784
She's getting the best
treatment available.

1196
01:16:14,825 --> 01:16:16,660
And that will be all.

1197
01:16:20,122 --> 01:16:21,540
Next.

1198
01:16:21,624 --> 01:16:22,957
Go on. Move up.
For what?

1199
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:24,000
Medication.

1200
01:16:24,084 --> 01:16:26,127
Medication for what?
The kind that's good for you.

1201
01:16:26,211 --> 01:16:27,337
Help you relax.

1202
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:28,463
Well, I don't want to relax.
Come on.

1203
01:16:28,546 --> 01:16:29,923
I'm not gonna take something...
We can force-feed you

1204
01:16:30,006 --> 01:16:31,382
if that's what you want.
I don't know what it is!

1205
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:32,926
I don't know what it is.
Dr. Steele? Take it. Orderly.

1206
01:16:33,009 --> 01:16:33,968
Dr. Steele?

1207
01:16:34,052 --> 01:16:35,011
I understand. Come on.

1208
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:37,013
Ladies,
keep moving. Come on.

1209
01:16:37,097 --> 01:16:38,723
I don't wanna take anything
that I don't know what it is.

1210
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:41,017
There's nothing wrong with
me that I need medication.

1211
01:16:41,101 --> 01:16:43,520
There's nothing
wrong with you.

1212
01:16:45,313 --> 01:16:47,690
No, there's nothing wrong.
No.

1213
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,901
You're fine.
Yes, I am.

1214
01:16:50,026 --> 01:16:55,407
Well, then you shouldn't
have any trouble signing this.

1215
01:16:57,033 --> 01:16:59,494
By signing it, you certify
that you were wrong

1216
01:16:59,619 --> 01:17:02,455
when you stated the boy returned to
you by the police was not your son.

1217
01:17:02,539 --> 01:17:04,958
It further stipulates
that the police were right

1218
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:06,960
in sending you here for
observation and it absolves them

1219
01:17:07,043 --> 01:17:09,379
of all responsibility.
Sign it.

1220
01:17:09,462 --> 01:17:11,214
I won't sign that.

1221
01:17:12,215 --> 01:17:13,425
I won't sign that.

1222
01:17:13,508 --> 01:17:16,385
Well, then your condition
is not improved.

1223
01:17:16,427 --> 01:17:20,347
Sign it, and you can be out of
here first thing tomorrow morning.

1224
01:17:21,974 --> 01:17:23,684
But I wasn't wrong.

1225
01:17:23,726 --> 01:17:25,686
He's not my son.
My son is still missing.

1226
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:28,439
Mrs. Collins,
you're becoming agitated.

1227
01:17:28,522 --> 01:17:32,568
Yes, I'm, yes... I'm not signing
that, because he's not my son!

1228
01:17:32,651 --> 01:17:33,694
Orderly!

1229
01:17:33,736 --> 01:17:35,154
He's not my son!
Orderly!

1230
01:17:35,237 --> 01:17:36,613
My son is missing!

1231
01:17:36,697 --> 01:17:39,199
The patient is becoming
hysterical! No! My son is missing!

1232
01:17:39,241 --> 01:17:40,534
See to it she is
sedated properly.

1233
01:17:40,576 --> 01:17:42,578
Get her out of here.
No! No! No!

1234
01:17:42,661 --> 01:17:44,079
Next!
No!

1235
01:17:44,413 --> 01:17:46,582
No, no!
Orderly, hold on.

1236
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:51,295
Stop it!

1237
01:17:51,378 --> 01:17:53,964
No! Open your mouth.
Open, open your mouth.

1238
01:17:54,089 --> 01:17:55,632
Easy!
You got her?

1239
01:17:55,716 --> 01:17:57,259
God!
Swallow it.

1240
01:17:57,342 --> 01:17:58,802
Stop it!

1241
01:18:00,429 --> 01:18:01,555
Move back.

1242
01:18:01,597 --> 01:18:03,057
You!
Get her out of here!

1243
01:18:03,098 --> 01:18:04,391
Come on, you got her?

1244
01:18:04,433 --> 01:18:06,852
Stay out of this! This is none of
your business! This is police business!

1245
01:18:06,935 --> 01:18:09,479
All of you! You'll stay out of it
if you know what's good for you!

1246
01:18:09,604 --> 01:18:11,814
You'd think you were in enough
trouble with the law already,

1247
01:18:11,898 --> 01:18:13,274
being a whore,
wouldn't you?

1248
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:18,780
Attacking a staff member.
Room 18.

1249
01:18:18,821 --> 01:18:22,366
No, no! Stop it! No!

1250
01:18:22,658 --> 01:18:24,619
No! No!

1251
01:18:25,953 --> 01:18:27,538
No! Stop it!

1252
01:19:40,193 --> 01:19:41,820
Come on, kid.

1253
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:05,384
I don't know. I'm not sure. I
think so. He was pretty close.

1254
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:06,719
Excuse me.

1255
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:09,388
It's all right, I can take
it from here. But I got...

1256
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:10,514
We need him
for questioning.

1257
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:11,640
Like I said,
it was dark.

1258
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:12,975
Thanks. Come on.

1259
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,144
Brady, Ross.

1260
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:17,313
You've just been requisitioned for
backup. I'll explain on the way.

1261
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:18,898
Yes, sir.

1262
01:20:26,197 --> 01:20:30,117
I'm not sure. She said she'd had the
croup before. This could be pneumonia.

1263
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:35,247
I keep telling her that,
and she doesn't want to.

1264
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,749
You have to insist.

1265
01:20:36,791 --> 01:20:38,250
You shouldn't
have done that.

1266
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,710
Please, let me out!
Get in there!

1267
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,087
Wanted to.

1268
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:43,047
Felt good.

1269
01:20:43,214 --> 01:20:44,799
Let me out! No! Please! No! You got her?

1270
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:50,720
I lost two babies
to back alley doctors.

1271
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:53,098
No choice.

1272
01:20:56,476 --> 01:20:59,270
Never had the chance
to fight for them.

1273
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:01,898
You do.

1274
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,775
Don't stop.

1275
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:06,611
I won't.

1276
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:14,953
Fuck them and the horse
they rode in on.

1277
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:20,208
That's not exactly
language for a lady.

1278
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:22,335
Hell.

1279
01:21:23,294 --> 01:21:27,132
There are times that's exactly
the right language to use.

1280
01:21:28,508 --> 01:21:29,592
Yeah?

1281
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:33,722
When you've got
nothing left to lose.

1282
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,641
You're not supposed
to be here!

1283
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,393
Mmm. Mmm.

1284
01:22:00,748 --> 01:22:04,293
Stay there. Check the
house. Check the barn.

1285
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:15,763
It's all clear.

1286
01:22:15,846 --> 01:22:17,681
Clear here.

1287
01:22:17,765 --> 01:22:19,683
Bring me that shovel.

1288
01:22:23,437 --> 01:22:25,773
All right. Let's go.

1289
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:32,321
Come on.

1290
01:22:35,491 --> 01:22:37,700
You're gonna show me.

1291
01:22:43,498 --> 01:22:45,208
Come on. Show me.

1292
01:23:06,312 --> 01:23:07,563
This it?

1293
01:23:09,065 --> 01:23:10,400
You sure?

1294
01:23:10,441 --> 01:23:11,526
Yeah.

1295
01:23:14,487 --> 01:23:15,530
Dig.

1296
01:23:18,408 --> 01:23:22,328
You put them in the ground, you
can take them out of the ground.

1297
01:23:23,246 --> 01:23:25,081
Go on. Dig.

1298
01:23:25,957 --> 01:23:28,126
You heard me. Dig.

1299
01:24:13,378 --> 01:24:14,713
My God.

1300
01:24:16,923 --> 01:24:18,383
Oh, my God.

1301
01:24:31,937 --> 01:24:33,314
Call it in.

1302
01:24:33,814 --> 01:24:34,940
Get the coroner
and every officer

1303
01:24:34,982 --> 01:24:37,193
in a 20-mile radius here
inside the hour.

1304
01:24:37,276 --> 01:24:40,571
Then put out an APB on
Gordon Stewart Northcott.

1305
01:24:41,697 --> 01:24:44,241
The information's
in my car. Go on.

1306
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:51,499
You can stop, son.

1307
01:24:56,462 --> 01:24:58,339
You can stop now.
It's over.

1308
01:24:58,381 --> 01:24:59,673
Hey.

1309
01:24:59,715 --> 01:25:03,969
We'll take it, we can take it
from here. We can take it from...

1310
01:25:09,308 --> 01:25:12,770
We can take it from
here, okay? It's over.

1311
01:25:18,483 --> 01:25:20,151
It's okay.

1312
01:25:22,737 --> 01:25:24,447
It's okay. It's okay.

1313
01:25:25,031 --> 01:25:26,366
It's all over.

1314
01:25:26,783 --> 01:25:27,867
Okay?

1315
01:25:29,994 --> 01:25:31,121
File.

1316
01:25:36,543 --> 01:25:38,044
Privacy, please.

1317
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:47,262
I see that you've been refusing
medication, requiring force feeding.

1318
01:25:47,595 --> 01:25:49,556
All right, Michael.
Lunchtime?

1319
01:25:49,639 --> 01:25:52,726
Six days, Mrs. Collins,
and no progress.

1320
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:57,063
We may have to move on to
more strenuous therapies.

1321
01:25:58,189 --> 01:26:01,818
Unless you're willing to
prove that you're doing better

1322
01:26:03,236 --> 01:26:04,988
by signing this.

1323
01:26:08,074 --> 01:26:10,909
Fuck you and the horse
you rode in on.

1324
01:26:15,289 --> 01:26:16,832
Room 18.

1325
01:26:25,174 --> 01:26:28,302
I want to talk to somebody
in charge, right now!

1326
01:26:28,385 --> 01:26:29,636
Please.

1327
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,722
Who is in charge here?

1328
01:26:33,932 --> 01:26:35,100
Open.

1329
01:26:35,684 --> 01:26:36,977
I'm the head doctor on duty.

1330
01:26:37,061 --> 01:26:39,313
You're the doctor who
locked up Christine Collins?

1331
01:26:39,396 --> 01:26:40,522
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

1332
01:26:40,606 --> 01:26:42,107
We don't discuss cases with
anyone other than family.

1333
01:26:42,191 --> 01:26:44,777
Oh, you'll damn well
discuss this one. Read it.

1334
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:45,903
Sir.

1335
01:26:45,944 --> 01:26:47,196
Read it.

1336
01:26:53,035 --> 01:26:54,078
Stop.

1337
01:27:02,627 --> 01:27:03,961
Mrs. Collins,
one last time.

1338
01:27:04,045 --> 01:27:07,590
Are you or are you not
prepared to sign that letter?

1339
01:27:07,632 --> 01:27:08,883
No.

1340
01:27:13,096 --> 01:27:14,639
You're free to leave.

1341
01:27:18,059 --> 01:27:19,143
What?

1342
01:27:19,519 --> 01:27:23,022
Your clothes are in the next
room. You can change there.

1343
01:27:23,773 --> 01:27:24,774
In the next room?

1344
01:27:24,857 --> 01:27:26,484
Yes. That's right.

1345
01:27:27,527 --> 01:27:28,820
See to it.

1346
01:27:33,866 --> 01:27:35,034
Christ.

1347
01:27:35,535 --> 01:27:36,577
Long as
it's not the original.

1348
01:27:36,661 --> 01:27:37,704
No, it's not.

1349
01:27:37,787 --> 01:27:39,163
Here it is.

1350
01:27:39,247 --> 01:27:41,082
And who is that? Is that
Baker's file or Larson?

1351
01:27:41,165 --> 01:27:42,375
That's Baker.

1352
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:44,335
He said he wanted...

1353
01:27:44,377 --> 01:27:45,795
Nurse, I wanna see

1354
01:27:45,837 --> 01:27:48,965
every piece of paper you have on
the case of Mrs. Christine Collins,

1355
01:27:49,048 --> 01:27:51,050
and I want to see it right
now, do you understand me?

1356
01:27:51,134 --> 01:27:53,761
Every piece. When
will she be coming out?

1357
01:27:54,804 --> 01:27:55,804
Oh, it's just up ahead.

1358
01:27:55,887 --> 01:27:57,180
Oh, all right.
Let's...

1359
01:27:57,264 --> 01:27:59,516
Hurricane hits
West Palm Beach!

1360
01:27:59,558 --> 01:28:02,018
Babe Ruth hits
53rd home run!

1361
01:28:03,019 --> 01:28:04,980
Kids found murdered in
Riverside! There it is.

1362
01:28:05,063 --> 01:28:07,941
Biggest crime
in Los Angeles history!

1363
01:28:08,024 --> 01:28:10,068
Collins boy assumed dead!

1364
01:28:11,278 --> 01:28:13,780
Read it here!
Read it here!

1365
01:28:19,077 --> 01:28:21,163
Mrs. Collins,
I'm so sorry.

1366
01:28:25,625 --> 01:28:27,878
Captain, your handling of
the Christine Collins case

1367
01:28:27,961 --> 01:28:31,006
has exposed this department
to public ridicule.

1368
01:28:31,631 --> 01:28:35,427
There is even the possibility
of civil and criminal liability.

1369
01:28:35,886 --> 01:28:38,764
Sir, nobody could've known what
was happening up at that ranch.

1370
01:28:38,847 --> 01:28:41,892
Not us, the sheriff's department,
or the marshal's office.

1371
01:28:41,975 --> 01:28:44,061
And as for the
Collins woman,

1372
01:28:44,144 --> 01:28:46,897
I'm still not convinced that her boy
is among the victims up in Wineville.

1373
01:28:47,064 --> 01:28:48,148
No?

1374
01:28:48,231 --> 01:28:49,190
No.

1375
01:28:49,231 --> 01:28:52,735
There were four other photos of
missing boys that looked a lot like him.

1376
01:28:52,818 --> 01:28:54,737
The Clark kid
could've been mistaken.

1377
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:56,155
Maybe he was.

1378
01:28:56,238 --> 01:28:59,450
Which begs the obvious
question. Who cares?

1379
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:01,952
Sir?

1380
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:04,372
The mayor wants
this to go away.

1381
01:29:04,455 --> 01:29:06,540
I want this to go away.

1382
01:29:06,624 --> 01:29:10,127
The way you do that is to stop
insisting that Walter Collins

1383
01:29:10,211 --> 01:29:12,713
is not among those boys killed
up at that goddamn ranch.

1384
01:29:12,797 --> 01:29:15,383
Because if the boy you brought
back is not Walter Collins,

1385
01:29:15,424 --> 01:29:18,427
and he's not dead up at that
ranch, then where the hell is he?

1386
01:29:18,511 --> 01:29:20,221
People are gonna want to
know why we haven't found him.

1387
01:29:20,262 --> 01:29:22,556
Why we're not
doing our job.

1388
01:29:23,265 --> 01:29:25,351
But if, on the other hand,

1389
01:29:25,434 --> 01:29:29,688
he is, or could be, among those
poor boys killed up in Wineville,

1390
01:29:30,147 --> 01:29:32,483
then the inquiries stop.

1391
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:35,778
It's a momentary
embarrassment

1392
01:29:35,861 --> 01:29:37,988
you're just gonna
have to live with.

1393
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:39,532
Better a short
inconvenience

1394
01:29:39,615 --> 01:29:42,742
than a lingering problem,
wouldn't you say, Captain?

1395
01:29:42,826 --> 01:29:43,993
Yes, sir.

1396
01:29:44,077 --> 01:29:45,954
The boy's been gone
nearly a year.

1397
01:29:45,995 --> 01:29:49,165
If he was going to be found,
it would've happened by now.

1398
01:29:49,249 --> 01:29:50,625
Whether he was up
at that ranch or not,

1399
01:29:50,667 --> 01:29:52,877
the truth is he probably
is dead somewhere.

1400
01:29:52,961 --> 01:29:57,006
Better his mother accept that
now than later, don't you think?

1401
01:29:57,090 --> 01:29:59,092
Yes, sir.
Good.

1402
01:29:59,134 --> 01:30:00,760
That'll be all, Captain.

1403
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:06,141
That's how you want it,
then I guess we're done here.

1404
01:30:06,349 --> 01:30:08,017
Tell county jail we're
remanding him for trial.

1405
01:30:08,101 --> 01:30:11,980
Wait. I didn't do anything. I
wasn't even here when it happened.

1406
01:30:13,148 --> 01:30:14,482
By pretending to
be Walter Collins,

1407
01:30:14,566 --> 01:30:18,069
you're interfering in a police
investigation of a kidnapping and murder.

1408
01:30:18,153 --> 01:30:21,114
We can try you as accomplice
to that murder after the fact.

1409
01:30:21,197 --> 01:30:22,657
That's too bad.

1410
01:30:22,699 --> 01:30:26,453
County jail is a lot worse than
a juvenile hall or a foster home.

1411
01:30:26,494 --> 01:30:27,912
It's a lot worse.

1412
01:30:29,914 --> 01:30:32,417
You can't do that.
I'm just a kid.

1413
01:30:34,919 --> 01:30:36,962
Sanford Clark's a kid, too.

1414
01:30:37,004 --> 01:30:39,506
Fifteen.
He's going to jail.

1415
01:30:39,548 --> 01:30:43,761
All murderers and their accomplices
go to jail. Everybody knows that.

1416
01:30:45,929 --> 01:30:48,682
Get him out of here.
It's out of my hands now.

1417
01:30:48,724 --> 01:30:51,268
Wait. I don't
want to go to jail.

1418
01:31:01,528 --> 01:31:02,780
Prove it.

1419
01:31:04,448 --> 01:31:05,741
I...

1420
01:31:05,866 --> 01:31:09,411
I knew Los Angeles is where
they make the Tom Mix movies.

1421
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:11,997
I figured
if I could meet Tom Mix

1422
01:31:12,039 --> 01:31:14,750
maybe he would let me
ride on his horse.

1423
01:31:16,293 --> 01:31:18,837
His horse is named Tony.
Did you know that?

1424
01:31:23,175 --> 01:31:24,551
How are you feeling?

1425
01:31:24,635 --> 01:31:26,011
All right.

1426
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,472
The police still
have a car outside.

1427
01:31:28,555 --> 01:31:32,392
I guess they're waiting to see
what your next move is going to be.

1428
01:31:33,559 --> 01:31:35,561
I'm going home.
And then?

1429
01:31:36,062 --> 01:31:37,980
Then, I've been giving it
a lot of thought.

1430
01:31:38,064 --> 01:31:42,527
And what they did to those women,
and what they did about Walter.

1431
01:31:43,403 --> 01:31:47,073
I used to always tell him, "You never
start a fight, but you always finish it. "

1432
01:31:47,156 --> 01:31:50,576
And I didn't start this
fight, but I'm gonna finish it.

1433
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:55,373
Mrs. Collins, right now you're a
sufficiently high profile that I think

1434
01:31:55,415 --> 01:31:59,252
even the police would hesitate
to go after you out in the open,

1435
01:31:59,752 --> 01:32:02,130
but I have to warn you that
could change very quickly

1436
01:32:02,213 --> 01:32:04,882
if they feel their
position threatened.

1437
01:32:04,966 --> 01:32:06,759
Very quickly indeed.

1438
01:32:08,136 --> 01:32:10,471
What are they gonna
do to me now?

1439
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:14,016
They got nothing.

1440
01:32:17,019 --> 01:32:18,563
I'm going home.

1441
01:32:42,294 --> 01:32:43,670
Hi, sis.

1442
01:32:44,421 --> 01:32:45,756
Gordon.

1443
01:32:45,797 --> 01:32:48,300
I didn't know
you were back in town.

1444
01:32:48,967 --> 01:32:51,136
Yeah, I got in
a couple of days ago,

1445
01:32:51,219 --> 01:32:54,097
figured I'd surprise you.
Is that... Is that okay?

1446
01:32:54,139 --> 01:32:57,184
Yes. Yes, of course.
Of course, come on in.

1447
01:33:00,103 --> 01:33:02,397
Where's that
little niece of mine?

1448
01:33:02,481 --> 01:33:04,608
She went into town.

1449
01:33:04,649 --> 01:33:06,151
Should be back this evening.

1450
01:33:06,234 --> 01:33:07,444
Uh, Bob's here.

1451
01:33:07,486 --> 01:33:08,570
Oh, good.

1452
01:33:08,653 --> 01:33:10,989
Uh, I was gonna ask if I
could stay on a couple days.

1453
01:33:11,031 --> 01:33:12,407
Staying?

1454
01:33:12,824 --> 01:33:13,950
Yeah.

1455
01:33:13,992 --> 01:33:16,285
Listen, can I use
your bathroom?

1456
01:33:16,327 --> 01:33:18,329
It's been a long ride and
I could really use a shower.

1457
01:33:18,412 --> 01:33:20,331
Of course.
Okay.

1458
01:33:21,123 --> 01:33:22,500
Thank you.

1459
01:33:36,847 --> 01:33:38,099
Is that...

1460
01:33:38,307 --> 01:33:41,685
All right, go next door.
I'll call the police. Hurry.

1461
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:48,150
<i>Operator.
How may I connect you?</i>

1462
01:33:48,693 --> 01:33:49,777
He's upstairs, sir.

1463
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:52,613
Go around the other side!
Cut him off!

1464
01:33:52,697 --> 01:33:53,739
Come with me!
Yes, sir.

1465
01:33:53,823 --> 01:33:55,116
Let's go!

1466
01:33:59,286 --> 01:34:03,165
Mrs. Collins, I'd like you
to meet my friend, Mr. Hahn.

1467
01:34:03,207 --> 01:34:06,836
Mrs. Collins, my deepest
condolences on your loss.

1468
01:34:07,545 --> 01:34:09,087
May we come in?

1469
01:34:13,216 --> 01:34:15,093
I appreciate the sentiment,

1470
01:34:15,176 --> 01:34:17,387
but they've yet to find...

1471
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:20,014
To identify the
remains as my son.

1472
01:34:22,183 --> 01:34:24,686
I'm afraid it never
gets any easier.

1473
01:34:25,228 --> 01:34:27,397
I lost a daughter
to polio five years ago.

1474
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:29,691
There's not a day goes by
when I don't think,

1475
01:34:29,733 --> 01:34:32,277
"I should mention
this to Claudine. "

1476
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,738
Then I remember
she's not here.

1477
01:34:37,574 --> 01:34:38,908
Please, sit.

1478
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:45,749
I've been on the phone
all morning

1479
01:34:45,832 --> 01:34:49,044
with the appointment secretary
of the police commission.

1480
01:34:49,085 --> 01:34:51,087
They said that they won't let me testify

1481
01:34:51,129 --> 01:34:54,424
at the hearing or call witnesses.
That it won't be necessary.

1482
01:34:54,466 --> 01:34:57,052
I know. My sources say
the police commission

1483
01:34:57,135 --> 01:35:01,222
is going to say that Jones and the
LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong,

1484
01:35:01,347 --> 01:35:04,391
and that the real blame lies
with the kid and with you

1485
01:35:04,475 --> 01:35:09,438
for being difficult and forcing them
to put you away for your own safety.

1486
01:35:12,775 --> 01:35:16,945
Then I guess I would have to
hire a lawyer, file a civil suit.

1487
01:35:17,738 --> 01:35:19,656
I went to the best
attorney in town,

1488
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:22,576
a man who's sued this
city four times and won.

1489
01:35:22,618 --> 01:35:25,621
Unfortunately, we can't
afford to really hire him.

1490
01:35:25,662 --> 01:35:26,914
I see.

1491
01:35:26,955 --> 01:35:29,458
Which is why
I'm doing this pro bono.

1492
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,337
It would be my honor to defend
your honor, Mrs. Collins.

1493
01:35:33,545 --> 01:35:34,922
In my 15 years as a lawyer,

1494
01:35:34,963 --> 01:35:38,801
I have never seen anyone fight
as long or as hard as you have,

1495
01:35:39,009 --> 01:35:42,179
in what is so clearly
in the cause of justice.

1496
01:35:42,971 --> 01:35:44,306
Thank you.

1497
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:46,266
Let me see
what's on the shelf.

1498
01:35:46,308 --> 01:35:47,643
I'll look.

1499
01:35:49,728 --> 01:35:50,813
Yes? May I...

1500
01:35:50,896 --> 01:35:52,231
My name is S.S. Hahn,

1501
01:35:52,314 --> 01:35:55,150
and I have a court order for the immediate
release of all women being detained

1502
01:35:55,192 --> 01:35:58,152
in this institution under
the designation code 12

1503
01:35:58,194 --> 01:36:01,447
pending a formal inquiry into
the reasons for their detainment.

1504
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:03,658
I'm sorry, the doctor
in charge is not here

1505
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:05,284
until the morning.
Madam, let me be clearer.

1506
01:36:05,326 --> 01:36:08,121
Either you will produce the
people named in that court order,

1507
01:36:08,162 --> 01:36:11,749
or you will find yourself behind
bars, and I mean without a key.

1508
01:36:11,833 --> 01:36:14,961
I can't authorize you...
Madam, stand aside.

1509
01:36:24,929 --> 01:36:25,972
Can I see her now?

1510
01:36:26,055 --> 01:36:28,099
Sure. Absolutely.
How does she look?

1511
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:55,709
All right, fellas, step
back. Let's give him room.

1512
01:36:55,751 --> 01:36:56,793
Here he is.

1513
01:36:56,877 --> 01:36:58,837
Mr. Northcott,
any comment on your arrest?

1514
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:00,088
Mr. Northcott,
how are you feeling?

1515
01:37:00,172 --> 01:37:01,840
Oh, I'm feeling fine.

1516
01:37:01,882 --> 01:37:04,426
I've been on a little
vacation, as some of you know.

1517
01:37:04,509 --> 01:37:07,179
It was
a really pleasant vacation.

1518
01:37:07,262 --> 01:37:10,515
The police have certainly provided
me with a lot of amusement.

1519
01:37:10,557 --> 01:37:12,017
How long
you been in hiding?

1520
01:37:12,059 --> 01:37:13,351
How did you
avoid capture?

1521
01:37:13,393 --> 01:37:14,686
Easy, easy.
That's far enough.

1522
01:37:14,728 --> 01:37:16,438
Well, I didn't, did I?

1523
01:37:16,521 --> 01:37:17,606
One more shot!

1524
01:37:17,689 --> 01:37:19,649
Have you seen
your picture in the paper?

1525
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:22,944
Didn't know anybody wanted
me until just recently.

1526
01:37:23,028 --> 01:37:24,613
Didn't even try.

1527
01:37:25,238 --> 01:37:28,283
My luggage still has
my initials on it, fellas.

1528
01:37:28,367 --> 01:37:30,494
Did you know why
the police were after you?

1529
01:37:30,577 --> 01:37:33,455
No, but I figured it'd be a good
idea if I were to just stay out of it.

1530
01:37:33,538 --> 01:37:34,539
Any remorse, sir?

1531
01:37:34,623 --> 01:37:39,336
Do you have anything to say to the
parents of the children you murdered?

1532
01:37:39,419 --> 01:37:41,088
No comment.

1533
01:37:41,171 --> 01:37:42,255
One more shot,
this way!

1534
01:37:43,881 --> 01:37:46,550
Mayor Cryer.
This is unexpected.

1535
01:37:47,426 --> 01:37:48,928
So was this.

1536
01:37:49,011 --> 01:37:52,431
Subpoenas, requests for
depositions, interrogatories.

1537
01:37:52,515 --> 01:37:56,102
All courtesy of Mr. Hahn and his
new client, Christine Collins.

1538
01:37:57,061 --> 01:37:58,604
You don't have to look them
over too closely, Chief.

1539
01:37:58,688 --> 01:38:01,440
Your own copies should
be coming any time now.

1540
01:38:01,524 --> 01:38:03,943
The city council has also
agreed to look into this,

1541
01:38:04,026 --> 01:38:05,069
starting immediately.

1542
01:38:05,152 --> 01:38:06,237
God damn it!

1543
01:38:06,278 --> 01:38:09,031
I thought this was
supposed to go away.

1544
01:38:09,657 --> 01:38:10,908
This is an election year.

1545
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:12,451
I can't afford
this kind of press.

1546
01:38:12,535 --> 01:38:15,788
It is going away, sir. I've instructed
Captain Jones to deal with it.

1547
01:38:15,830 --> 01:38:17,415
I'm afraid,
falling on his sword

1548
01:38:17,456 --> 01:38:21,377
and saying he made a mistake isn't
going to be good enough, Chief.

1549
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:24,922
If we take him out of
the picture for a while,

1550
01:38:24,964 --> 01:38:28,801
just might help calm things down
until the hearing's finished.

1551
01:38:46,443 --> 01:38:48,737
What is happening?
Didn't you hear?

1552
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:50,572
It's the biggest protest
I've ever seen.

1553
01:38:50,655 --> 01:38:51,906
Protest?
Yeah.

1554
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:55,160
Over the Collins broad,
if you can believe that.

1555
01:39:04,753 --> 01:39:07,922
We want justice!
We want justice!

1556
01:39:10,341 --> 01:39:11,926
Oh, my!

1557
01:39:18,391 --> 01:39:20,352
Mr. Harris.

1558
01:39:20,435 --> 01:39:23,730
The Lord works in mysterious
ways, Mrs. Collins.

1559
01:39:24,981 --> 01:39:26,858
Boy, does he ever.

1560
01:39:44,124 --> 01:39:46,710
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, can I
have your attention, please?</i>

1561
01:39:46,794 --> 01:39:51,340
There are more people gathered in this chamber
than have ever been in this room before.

1562
01:39:51,423 --> 01:39:55,135
Therefore, I ask you to refrain
from demonstrations of any kind.

1563
01:39:55,219 --> 01:39:56,678
Tell the truth!
Tell the truth!

1564
01:39:56,762 --> 01:40:00,683
We are all here because we want to
know the real facts in this case.

1565
01:40:00,724 --> 01:40:04,853
And everybody is going to be heard
if we have to sit here for a week.

1566
01:40:04,937 --> 01:40:07,856
Mr. Thorpe, I don't see any
members of the police commission.

1567
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:14,530
Are there any members of the
police department in the room?

1568
01:40:14,571 --> 01:40:16,448
Is Chief Davis here?

1569
01:40:17,866 --> 01:40:19,451
Is Captain Jones here?

1570
01:40:21,245 --> 01:40:22,620
Is there anybody here
representing the police?

1571
01:40:22,704 --> 01:40:26,874
Mrs. Collins, could you come across
the street with me for just a moment?

1572
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:29,168
There's something
I think you should see.

1573
01:40:29,252 --> 01:40:31,254
Well, I hate to call a recess
before we've even started,

1574
01:40:31,337 --> 01:40:32,880
but I think a few
phone calls are in order.

1575
01:40:37,093 --> 01:40:40,012
The police decided it'd be best
to keep this off the main docket

1576
01:40:40,096 --> 01:40:44,350
in order to avoid exactly the sort
of chaos we have across the street.

1577
01:40:56,988 --> 01:40:59,949
Mrs. Collins.
I'm Leanne Clay.

1578
01:41:00,783 --> 01:41:03,036
This is my husband, John.
Hi.

1579
01:41:03,953 --> 01:41:06,956
I just wanted to pass
along my sympathies.

1580
01:41:07,248 --> 01:41:09,375
What we went through
waiting to hear anything

1581
01:41:09,459 --> 01:41:13,588
about our son David
was bad enough, now this.

1582
01:41:14,505 --> 01:41:18,467
But what the police did to
you, there was no call for that.

1583
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:20,093
No call at all.

1584
01:41:23,138 --> 01:41:24,681
All rise.

1585
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,442
Please, be seated.
Bailiff.

1586
01:41:48,705 --> 01:41:49,915
Oh, hey.

1587
01:41:52,125 --> 01:41:54,252
I saw you in the papers.

1588
01:41:54,336 --> 01:41:58,173
You got a lot of moxie, standing
up to the police like that.

1589
01:42:03,387 --> 01:42:05,347
The defendant
will please rise.

1590
01:42:10,976 --> 01:42:13,062
Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1591
01:42:13,145 --> 01:42:17,316
you've been charged with three
counts of murder in the first degree,

1592
01:42:17,358 --> 01:42:22,071
with an additional 17 counts under
review by the district attorney's office.

1593
01:42:22,154 --> 01:42:23,781
How do you plea?

1594
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:27,326
Oh, not guilty, Your Honor.

1595
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:33,249
You may sit, Mr. Northcott.

1596
01:42:37,837 --> 01:42:42,758
In light of the defendant's penchant for
international travel, no bail will be set.

1597
01:42:42,842 --> 01:42:45,428
This court will hear preliminary
motions by tomorrow morning.

1598
01:42:45,511 --> 01:42:47,972
The boy,
Walter Collins,

1599
01:42:48,055 --> 01:42:50,808
was reported as missing,
March 10, 1928.

1600
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,228
We then instituted
a nationwide search.

1601
01:42:54,311 --> 01:42:58,232
On August 18th, we received
a cable indicating that a boy

1602
01:42:58,315 --> 01:43:01,736
matching his description was
found in DeKalb, Illinois.

1603
01:43:01,819 --> 01:43:05,864
Upon questioning, he admitted
to being Walter Collins.

1604
01:43:05,905 --> 01:43:10,869
We then made arrangements for him
to be transported back to California.

1605
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:13,580
Where Mrs. Collins told you
the boy was not her son.

1606
01:43:13,663 --> 01:43:15,415
Yes. She denied
his identity

1607
01:43:15,498 --> 01:43:18,501
in spite of all of the evidence
pointing to the contrary.

1608
01:43:18,585 --> 01:43:21,671
But, as subsequent
events have demonstrated,

1609
01:43:21,755 --> 01:43:23,423
she was correct.

1610
01:43:24,674 --> 01:43:26,551
So, what prompted
you to send her

1611
01:43:26,593 --> 01:43:28,219
for psychological
evaluation?

1612
01:43:28,303 --> 01:43:30,055
Whether or not this was
in fact the correct boy

1613
01:43:30,096 --> 01:43:32,640
was not relevant
to my decision.

1614
01:43:32,724 --> 01:43:34,893
Throughout this period,
she acted strangely.

1615
01:43:34,934 --> 01:43:38,480
She was often cool
and aloof and unemotional,

1616
01:43:38,563 --> 01:43:42,233
especially when confronted
with the boy we found in DeKalb

1617
01:43:42,275 --> 01:43:44,361
and in our
subsequent conversation.

1618
01:43:44,444 --> 01:43:46,279
It was because of her

1619
01:43:47,113 --> 01:43:51,785
disturbing behavior that I
submitted her for observation

1620
01:43:51,868 --> 01:43:54,662
to the psychopathic ward of Los
Angeles County General Hospital.

1621
01:43:54,746 --> 01:43:56,038
Just like that.

1622
01:43:56,121 --> 01:43:58,290
You snap your fingers
and an innocent woman

1623
01:43:58,374 --> 01:44:00,084
is thrown
into the psycho ward!

1624
01:44:00,125 --> 01:44:03,462
She wasn't thrown. Every family
in this state is in grave danger

1625
01:44:03,545 --> 01:44:06,673
when a police captain can
take a woman into his office

1626
01:44:06,799 --> 01:44:08,092
and five minutes later

1627
01:44:08,133 --> 01:44:10,886
have her thrown into the psychopathic
ward on his own authority!

1628
01:44:10,969 --> 01:44:12,346
She wasn't thrown.

1629
01:44:12,429 --> 01:44:15,766
She wasn't thrown!
She wasn't thrown!

1630
01:44:16,433 --> 01:44:18,310
What was that, Captain?

1631
01:44:18,936 --> 01:44:21,105
She wasn't thrown.
She was escorted.

1632
01:44:24,858 --> 01:44:28,404
Escorted, thrown, the verb
doesn't matter, Captain.

1633
01:44:28,487 --> 01:44:32,700
What does matter is that her incarceration
was ordered without a warrant.

1634
01:44:32,783 --> 01:44:34,702
I am holding a carbon copy

1635
01:44:34,785 --> 01:44:37,913
of the affidavit of insanity
that was issued in the case

1636
01:44:37,996 --> 01:44:41,417
<i>of the State of California
v. Christine Collins.</i>

1637
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:42,960
Who signed the affidavit?

1638
01:44:43,001 --> 01:44:44,128
I did.

1639
01:44:44,169 --> 01:44:46,797
Well, now, let me see
if I have this correct,

1640
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:50,466
a woman was thrown into the
psychopathic ward without a warrant,

1641
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:52,719
because no warrant existed.

1642
01:44:52,802 --> 01:44:55,346
And when it was finally
written several days later,

1643
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:57,807
there was no need to sign it
or to go to a judge

1644
01:44:57,849 --> 01:45:00,643
because she was already
in the asylum!

1645
01:45:02,311 --> 01:45:03,396
Is this correct, Captain?

1646
01:45:03,479 --> 01:45:04,731
Technically, yes.

1647
01:45:04,814 --> 01:45:07,817
Extraordinary steps were necessary
because we were dealing...

1648
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:09,736
We were dealing with
an extraordinary situation.

1649
01:45:09,819 --> 01:45:12,488
Now, is it our fault
that we were being deceived

1650
01:45:12,572 --> 01:45:15,366
by a boy who claimed to
be Walter Collins? No.

1651
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:19,162
In light of his claims
and her disturbing behavior,

1652
01:45:19,203 --> 01:45:21,831
who wouldn't begin to think that there
was something the matter with her?

1653
01:45:21,873 --> 01:45:22,915
Because she questioned you?

1654
01:45:22,999 --> 01:45:25,168
No, because
she wouldn't listen!

1655
01:45:25,251 --> 01:45:27,045
Because she insisted
on being obstinate!

1656
01:45:27,128 --> 01:45:30,339
Because she tried to take
matters into her own hand,

1657
01:45:30,423 --> 01:45:32,216
best left to
qualified officers!

1658
01:45:32,258 --> 01:45:33,968
Because once
civil disobedience starts...

1659
01:45:34,052 --> 01:45:36,095
Because she was fighting
for the life of her son!

1660
01:45:36,179 --> 01:45:38,181
A boy who may have
still been alive

1661
01:45:38,222 --> 01:45:42,893
while you were wasting valuable time
denying you had done anything wrong!

1662
01:45:45,645 --> 01:45:47,189
And in the end

1663
01:45:48,732 --> 01:45:51,443
that's what
happened, isn't it?

1664
01:45:51,568 --> 01:45:55,030
At some point, while
all this was going on,

1665
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:59,868
Walter Collins
was brutally murdered,

1666
01:46:00,827 --> 01:46:03,246
along with as many
as 19 other boys

1667
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,709
at the Northcott Ranch
in Wineville.

1668
01:46:09,503 --> 01:46:11,671
Is that correct, Captain?

1669
01:46:13,298 --> 01:46:14,800
Yes, it is.

1670
01:46:15,550 --> 01:46:17,177
It's a travesty.

1671
01:46:22,849 --> 01:46:24,685
No further questions.

1672
01:46:42,076 --> 01:46:44,078
<i>Train number 14,
now boarding on track...</i>

1673
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:47,998
So, after much effort, we
were able to identify this boy,

1674
01:46:48,082 --> 01:46:50,626
who's been responsible
for so much trouble lately,

1675
01:46:50,710 --> 01:46:53,587
as Arthur Hutchins
of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

1676
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:57,633
Between this, and the arrest of
the man suspected of murdering

1677
01:46:57,717 --> 01:46:59,427
the real Walter Collins,

1678
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:02,805
we've cleared up two of the biggest
mysteries in the history of Los Angeles.

1679
01:47:02,847 --> 01:47:05,057
I hope you gentlemen
of the press will give

1680
01:47:05,141 --> 01:47:07,184
as much space to the
good things we do

1681
01:47:07,268 --> 01:47:09,812
as the mistakes that are
made on rare occasions.

1682
01:47:09,895 --> 01:47:11,731
Gentlemen, allow me
to introduce you

1683
01:47:11,814 --> 01:47:14,859
to the boy's real mother,
Mrs. Janet Hutchins.

1684
01:47:16,318 --> 01:47:17,778
Arthur.

1685
01:47:17,862 --> 01:47:19,363
I hope he wasn't too
much trouble for you.

1686
01:47:19,447 --> 01:47:21,240
Oh, no, not at all.

1687
01:47:21,323 --> 01:47:23,492
How about
a photograph, fellas?

1688
01:47:26,579 --> 01:47:27,997
One more.

1689
01:47:28,539 --> 01:47:29,998
Mrs. Hutchins,

1690
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:33,376
Mrs. Collins, the woman he was
staying with, wanted him to have these.

1691
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:34,961
They're the clothes
she let him wear.

1692
01:47:35,003 --> 01:47:36,838
Well, thank you.

1693
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,673
Isn't that nice, Arthur?

1694
01:47:38,715 --> 01:47:41,092
Tell the nice officer,
"Thank you. "

1695
01:47:41,176 --> 01:47:44,137
I don't want them.
Give them to somebody else.

1696
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:45,847
Precocious
little fellow, isn't he?

1697
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:48,224
It's not my fault.
It's the police.

1698
01:47:48,308 --> 01:47:51,936
They said I was Walter Collins,
not me! It wasn't my idea!

1699
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:53,480
Not my idea!
Get...

1700
01:47:53,521 --> 01:47:55,982
Yeah. Go blame the police
for your own mistakes.

1701
01:47:56,024 --> 01:47:58,193
We've seen a lot of
that lately, haven't we?

1702
01:47:58,276 --> 01:48:01,196
Take care now, Arthur!
Safe travels.

1703
01:48:02,364 --> 01:48:04,616
All right, fellas,
that's it for today.

1704
01:48:04,699 --> 01:48:06,409
Sir, sir! What did the boy mean by that?

1705
01:48:06,701 --> 01:48:10,205
It was March 10th, and
I came home from work,

1706
01:48:10,288 --> 01:48:13,166
and my nine-year-old
son, Walter, was gone.

1707
01:48:13,208 --> 01:48:16,961
Captain Jones was acting on
information he believed to be correct.

1708
01:48:17,045 --> 01:48:20,674
Walter Collins had a diastema,
also known as a diastema.

1709
01:48:20,715 --> 01:48:22,258
That child was never
in my classroom.

1710
01:48:22,384 --> 01:48:23,884
I can certainly
attest to that.

1711
01:48:23,967 --> 01:48:27,346
We rely on our good friends
in the police department

1712
01:48:27,388 --> 01:48:30,474
to point to us those
people who exhibit behavior

1713
01:48:30,557 --> 01:48:33,268
which is socially
unacceptable.

1714
01:48:33,352 --> 01:48:38,190
About four inches shorter
than the last mark of Walter.

1715
01:48:39,066 --> 01:48:41,568
Well, some of
these pictures show

1716
01:48:41,652 --> 01:48:44,321
what Sanford Clark
told me,

1717
01:48:44,405 --> 01:48:47,991
that he did in fact help in
the murder of these children.

1718
01:48:48,075 --> 01:48:49,743
Thank you, Detective.

1719
01:48:49,827 --> 01:48:51,036
Gentlemen of the jury,

1720
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:53,914
I ask you to take a good
look at these images.

1721
01:48:53,956 --> 01:48:56,542
They establish beyond
any reasonable doubt

1722
01:48:56,583 --> 01:49:00,379
the circumstances and the
nature of these heinous crimes.

1723
01:49:11,598 --> 01:49:13,475
I'm in here,
Reverend.

1724
01:49:21,607 --> 01:49:23,735
When Walter was here, I
used to walk by his room

1725
01:49:23,776 --> 01:49:25,945
when he was sleeping.

1726
01:49:26,029 --> 01:49:30,033
And even though I couldn't
see him or hear him,

1727
01:49:30,116 --> 01:49:31,826
I could feel him.

1728
01:49:34,078 --> 01:49:36,789
That's why I don't
think Walter's dead.

1729
01:49:38,124 --> 01:49:39,959
I can still feel him.

1730
01:49:42,587 --> 01:49:44,547
Mrs. Collins...
No.

1731
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:46,799
I know what
the police said.

1732
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:49,886
But that place
and the remains,

1733
01:49:51,763 --> 01:49:54,265
they couldn't be
properly identified.

1734
01:49:55,308 --> 01:49:59,645
And maybe that kid made a mistake
when he picked Walter's picture.

1735
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:03,900
I understand you don't
want to accept this.

1736
01:50:03,983 --> 01:50:05,610
What mother would?

1737
01:50:08,946 --> 01:50:12,449
But I think it's time
for you to move on

1738
01:50:12,532 --> 01:50:14,910
and start over
for yourself.

1739
01:50:16,161 --> 01:50:18,580
Your son would
want you to move on.

1740
01:50:20,749 --> 01:50:23,001
Maybe.

1741
01:50:23,043 --> 01:50:26,338
Maybe he'd want me
to keep looking for him.

1742
01:50:26,421 --> 01:50:28,965
Maybe he's somewhere
waiting for me.

1743
01:50:30,842 --> 01:50:33,053
I believe he is
waiting, ma'am.

1744
01:50:34,554 --> 01:50:36,348
He's waiting in
that place where

1745
01:50:36,431 --> 01:50:40,477
we'll all go someday to be
reunited with our loved ones.

1746
01:50:40,519 --> 01:50:45,649
And on that day, he'll know
from front to back, end to end,

1747
01:50:45,691 --> 01:50:49,236
heart to soul, that you did
everything you could, Mrs. Collins.

1748
01:50:50,612 --> 01:50:51,988
Everything.

1749
01:50:55,867 --> 01:50:57,577
We should go, ma'am.

1750
01:50:57,661 --> 01:50:59,037
One minute.

1751
01:51:25,896 --> 01:51:28,399
This meeting will
now come to order.

1752
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:32,445
This committee has now
heard all of the testimony,

1753
01:51:32,528 --> 01:51:35,489
and, in light of
the facts presented,

1754
01:51:35,573 --> 01:51:38,409
we recommend that the
suspension of Captain Jones

1755
01:51:38,492 --> 01:51:39,952
be made permanent.

1756
01:51:44,790 --> 01:51:47,877
Order! Please. Please.

1757
01:51:49,003 --> 01:51:51,005
Mr. Foreman,

1758
01:51:51,088 --> 01:51:53,549
has the jury
reached a verdict?

1759
01:51:53,632 --> 01:51:55,384
We have, Your Honor.

1760
01:51:56,676 --> 01:51:58,928
Will the defendant
please rise?

1761
01:52:01,514 --> 01:52:05,310
Second, that steps be taken
to investigate a change

1762
01:52:05,435 --> 01:52:08,521
in the prevailing laws and
procedures by which a citizen

1763
01:52:08,605 --> 01:52:12,067
of this city can be
subjected to incarceration

1764
01:52:12,108 --> 01:52:14,194
in the county's
mental facilities.

1765
01:52:21,368 --> 01:52:23,370
You may read the verdict.

1766
01:52:24,079 --> 01:52:26,956
"We the jury find the defendant,
Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1767
01:52:26,998 --> 01:52:29,584
"guilty on all counts of
murder in the first degree. "

1768
01:52:34,339 --> 01:52:38,635
Finally, restoration of public
confidence in the police department

1769
01:52:38,677 --> 01:52:40,804
can only be achieved

1770
01:52:40,929 --> 01:52:44,140
by the removal of
its chief of police,

1771
01:52:44,265 --> 01:52:46,267
and this committee
so recommends.

1772
01:52:46,351 --> 01:52:47,602
This hearing
is concluded.

1773
01:53:08,414 --> 01:53:12,710
Does the defendant wish to make a
statement before judgment is passed?

1774
01:53:13,836 --> 01:53:16,630
I want to make
it real clear

1775
01:53:16,672 --> 01:53:20,134
that I never once got
a fair shake from you,

1776
01:53:20,175 --> 01:53:21,969
Your Honor,

1777
01:53:22,886 --> 01:53:25,347
or from this court.

1778
01:53:29,768 --> 01:53:32,938
The only one in here worth
a good goddamn is her.

1779
01:53:35,357 --> 01:53:38,402
'Cause she's the only one who
never badmouthed me to the press.

1780
01:53:38,485 --> 01:53:39,903
She's the only one
who understands

1781
01:53:39,987 --> 01:53:41,488
what it is to be framed by the police

1782
01:53:41,572 --> 01:53:43,865
for something you didn't
do. All right, that's enough.

1783
01:53:43,948 --> 01:53:46,534
And then to just be
thrown in the hole,

1784
01:53:46,617 --> 01:53:49,620
to just rot and to fester
and to be forgotten

1785
01:53:49,704 --> 01:53:51,414
and fade away, isn't that right? Gordon!

1786
01:53:51,497 --> 01:53:52,623
Counsel!
Isn't it?

1787
01:53:52,707 --> 01:53:55,084
I never killed your boy,
Mrs. Collins.

1788
01:53:55,168 --> 01:53:56,919
Counsel, that's enough!
I would never do that.

1789
01:53:57,003 --> 01:53:58,046
I would never
hurt Walter.

1790
01:53:58,129 --> 01:53:59,172
Counsel, get control
of your client

1791
01:53:59,213 --> 01:54:00,298
or I'll have him
bound and gagged!

1792
01:54:00,381 --> 01:54:01,841
He's an angel.

1793
01:54:01,924 --> 01:54:04,677
Come on, Gordon.
Get off of me!

1794
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:06,220
Now get down.

1795
01:54:08,973 --> 01:54:11,059
Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1796
01:54:12,727 --> 01:54:15,021
it is the judgment
of this court

1797
01:54:15,063 --> 01:54:17,398
that you be conveyed
to San Quentin Prison,

1798
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:20,735
where you'll be held in solitary
confinement for a period of two years,

1799
01:54:20,818 --> 01:54:24,405
until October 2, 1930.

1800
01:54:25,490 --> 01:54:29,827
On that date, you will be
hanged by the neck until dead.

1801
01:54:32,705 --> 01:54:34,749
May God have
mercy on your soul.

1802
01:55:48,821 --> 01:55:50,322
Is it all right if I
have a 10-minute break?

1803
01:55:50,406 --> 01:55:51,699
Of course.

1804
01:55:54,285 --> 01:55:55,661
You know,

1805
01:55:56,746 --> 01:55:58,664
one of these days you might
actually consider taking

1806
01:55:58,748 --> 01:56:00,291
one of these
10-minute breaks.

1807
01:56:00,333 --> 01:56:02,126
It might be
good for you.

1808
01:56:02,168 --> 01:56:03,502
We'll see.

1809
01:56:06,339 --> 01:56:08,382
This is
Christine Collins.

1810
01:56:08,466 --> 01:56:10,384
I called yesterday.

1811
01:56:10,468 --> 01:56:13,054
I was wondering if you had a
chance to look through the files

1812
01:56:13,137 --> 01:56:16,807
and see if there was a match
to my son, Walter Collins.

1813
01:56:17,808 --> 01:56:19,393
I see.

1814
01:56:19,477 --> 01:56:20,728
Well, if it's all
right with you,

1815
01:56:20,811 --> 01:56:23,563
I'll call back in a
month. Thank you very much.

1816
01:56:23,646 --> 01:56:25,815
Mrs. Collins.
I was just...

1817
01:56:25,899 --> 01:56:27,317
Yes, I know.

1818
01:56:28,443 --> 01:56:31,321
In fact, that's why
I wanted to see you.

1819
01:56:31,363 --> 01:56:33,198
It's about Walter.
We had a...

1820
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:36,993
Well, we received
a very strange telegram.

1821
01:56:37,911 --> 01:56:39,162
From who?

1822
01:56:39,245 --> 01:56:41,206
Gordon Northcott.

1823
01:56:41,289 --> 01:56:43,208
He's asked to see you.

1824
01:56:43,708 --> 01:56:44,793
Why?

1825
01:56:45,877 --> 01:56:47,796
He said he knows you're
still looking for your son,

1826
01:56:47,879 --> 01:56:49,756
and before he dies...

1827
01:56:53,218 --> 01:56:56,638
He says he lied when he testified
that he didn't kill Walter.

1828
01:56:56,721 --> 01:57:00,308
Christine, he's willing to
finally admit that he did it.

1829
01:57:01,142 --> 01:57:03,603
He says if you come up
to see him in person,

1830
01:57:03,687 --> 01:57:06,189
then he'll tell you
the truth, to your face

1831
01:57:06,272 --> 01:57:08,817
so that you can get
on with your life

1832
01:57:09,901 --> 01:57:11,403
and have some peace.

1833
01:57:12,153 --> 01:57:13,697
<i>As you know, he's
set to be executed</i>

1834
01:57:13,738 --> 01:57:16,031
<i>the day after tomorrow
at San Quentin,</i>

1835
01:57:16,073 --> 01:57:19,243
<i>so you don't have
a lot of time.</i>

1836
01:57:20,244 --> 01:57:24,039
<i>It took me most of the morning
to make all the arrangements.</i>

1837
01:57:24,331 --> 01:57:26,166
<i>Turns out, you're the
first woman in 30 years</i>

1838
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:29,169
<i>the state has allowed
to visit a serial killer</i>

1839
01:57:29,253 --> 01:57:31,338
<i>on the eve of
his execution.</i>

1840
01:57:52,026 --> 01:57:53,235
You'll be all
right, ma'am?

1841
01:57:53,318 --> 01:57:55,779
Yes. We're right at the door.

1842
01:57:58,866 --> 01:58:00,284
Twenty minutes.

1843
01:58:05,622 --> 01:58:07,958
Don't suppose you
got a cigarette?

1844
01:58:10,501 --> 01:58:13,421
Mr. Northcott, you
asked me to come here.

1845
01:58:13,629 --> 01:58:15,298
You said that
if I did,

1846
01:58:15,381 --> 01:58:18,092
you would tell me
the truth about my son.

1847
01:58:19,385 --> 01:58:20,803
Yeah.

1848
01:58:22,305 --> 01:58:24,932
You're right.
I did say that.

1849
01:58:25,016 --> 01:58:28,561
But see, the thing is,

1850
01:58:28,644 --> 01:58:32,065
I didn't really think
that you would come.

1851
01:58:32,148 --> 01:58:33,483
And now.

1852
01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:36,778
And now...
And now what?

1853
01:58:36,986 --> 01:58:39,322
I just didn't
expect that you'd...

1854
01:58:41,324 --> 01:58:43,284
I don't wanna see you.

1855
01:58:43,743 --> 01:58:45,787
You don't wanna see me?

1856
01:58:45,870 --> 01:58:48,331
No. See, I can't do this.

1857
01:58:48,414 --> 01:58:50,416
I don't wanna talk to you. I
can't talk to you right now,

1858
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:52,460
not with what they're gonna
be doing to me tomorrow.

1859
01:58:52,543 --> 01:58:55,880
It's one thing, Mrs.
Collins, to send a telegram,

1860
01:58:55,963 --> 01:58:57,423
that is really easy.

1861
01:58:57,507 --> 01:59:01,969
But when it's here, right
now, in person, you know,

1862
01:59:02,053 --> 01:59:03,470
I just, I can't...

1863
01:59:03,512 --> 01:59:05,555
I can't tell you what you
want to hear, Mrs. Collins.

1864
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:06,682
And why not?

1865
01:59:06,765 --> 01:59:10,394
Because I don't want to go
to hell with a lie on my lips.

1866
01:59:10,477 --> 01:59:12,562
See, I did my penance,

1867
01:59:12,646 --> 01:59:15,941
and I asked God to forgive me
and he did, so far as I know.

1868
01:59:16,024 --> 01:59:18,652
And I have been
really good ever since.

1869
01:59:18,694 --> 01:59:23,490
But if I lie now, if I
commit any sins right now,

1870
01:59:23,532 --> 01:59:25,450
I'm out of time here,

1871
01:59:25,534 --> 01:59:26,910
and I won't be
forgiven again.

1872
01:59:26,994 --> 01:59:29,371
And I'll tell you one thing,
I am not going to hell.

1873
01:59:31,748 --> 01:59:33,667
I'm not...

1874
01:59:40,549 --> 01:59:43,343
Mr. Northcott, you
asked me to come here.

1875
01:59:53,645 --> 01:59:54,980
Mr. Northcott,
please look at me.

1876
01:59:56,897 --> 01:59:59,233
Mr. Northcott,
please look at me.

1877
02:00:06,115 --> 02:00:07,867
Did you kill my son?

1878
02:00:12,747 --> 02:00:14,498
Did you kill my son?

1879
02:00:15,333 --> 02:00:16,792
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1880
02:00:16,876 --> 02:00:18,544
Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Hmm.

1881
02:00:18,586 --> 02:00:19,754
Did you kill my son?

1882
02:00:21,672 --> 02:00:24,592
I told you, I don't wanna
talk to you right now.

1883
02:00:25,134 --> 02:00:29,221
Did you kill my son?

1884
02:00:29,305 --> 02:00:30,389
Did you kill my son?
Hmm.

1885
02:00:30,431 --> 02:00:31,807
Did you kill my son?
I don't know.

1886
02:00:31,891 --> 02:00:33,059
You don't know?
You don't remember?

1887
02:00:33,142 --> 02:00:34,518
Did you kill my son?
Oh, no.

1888
02:00:34,602 --> 02:00:37,313
Answer me! You answer me! You answer me!

1889
02:00:37,396 --> 02:00:39,398
I don't know their names.
Did you kill my son? Yes...

1890
02:00:39,482 --> 02:00:40,733
You better get off of me.

1891
02:00:40,775 --> 02:00:42,151
Or what?
Hmm.

1892
02:00:42,234 --> 02:00:43,611
Did you kill my son?
I don't know.

1893
02:00:43,694 --> 02:00:44,904
Did you kill...

1894
02:00:44,945 --> 02:00:46,280
Did you kill my son?

1895
02:00:46,322 --> 02:00:47,573
You know his name!
Oh, I don't. No.

1896
02:00:47,657 --> 02:00:49,407
You know his name!
You called him an angel!

1897
02:00:49,449 --> 02:00:51,493
No.
You know his name!

1898
02:00:51,576 --> 02:00:52,994
No, I don't know his
name. Did you kill my son?

1899
02:00:53,078 --> 02:00:55,038
They cried for their parents to
come and get them and then I...

1900
02:00:55,121 --> 02:00:57,248
Did you kill my son?
Did you kill my son?

1901
02:00:57,290 --> 02:00:58,458
Answer me!
Or what?

1902
02:00:58,541 --> 02:00:59,876
Answer me!

1903
02:00:59,959 --> 02:01:01,795
What are you gonna do?
You gonna hurt me?

1904
02:01:01,878 --> 02:01:05,840
I hope you go to hell.

1905
02:01:05,924 --> 02:01:07,592
Did you kill my son?
Guard! Hey, guard!

1906
02:01:07,634 --> 02:01:09,594
Did you kill my son?

1907
02:01:09,636 --> 02:01:11,471
Did you kill my son?
Ma'am, please.

1908
02:01:11,554 --> 02:01:13,640
Come on.
I hope you go to hell!

1909
02:01:13,723 --> 02:01:17,936
I hope you go to hell!
I hope you go to hell!

1910
02:01:18,978 --> 02:01:20,563
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1911
02:01:22,649 --> 02:01:25,443
Did you kill my son?

1912
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:27,087
"Gordon Stewart Northcott,

1913
02:02:27,171 --> 02:02:30,049
"you have been
convicted of murder,

1914
02:02:30,132 --> 02:02:32,926
"the penalty for which
is death by hanging.

1915
02:02:34,261 --> 02:02:37,013
"There have been
no stays or reprieves,

1916
02:02:37,055 --> 02:02:39,098
"therefore the execution
will go forward

1917
02:02:39,182 --> 02:02:42,685
"as stipulated under the laws
of the State of California. "

1918
02:02:44,729 --> 02:02:47,231
Do you have
any last words?

1919
02:02:47,315 --> 02:02:48,608
No.

1920
02:02:51,694 --> 02:02:52,904
Nothing.

1921
02:02:57,075 --> 02:03:00,578
I kept clean after
I confessed, Reverend,

1922
02:03:00,662 --> 02:03:02,580
just like I said I would.

1923
02:03:05,958 --> 02:03:08,252
Will it...

1924
02:03:08,294 --> 02:03:09,754
Will it hurt?

1925
02:03:17,011 --> 02:03:19,514
Please,
please, not so fast.

1926
02:03:21,265 --> 02:03:23,685
Please, don't make
me walk so fast!

1927
02:03:25,144 --> 02:03:28,022
Please,
don't make me!

1928
02:03:28,106 --> 02:03:30,399
No, I don't wanna.

1929
02:03:41,368 --> 02:03:44,204
No! Thirteen steps.

1930
02:03:45,789 --> 02:03:47,874
Thirteen steps.

1931
02:03:47,958 --> 02:03:50,794
But I didn't touch
them all, you bastards.

1932
02:03:50,877 --> 02:03:54,423
I didn't touch them all.
I didn't touch them all.

1933
02:03:55,465 --> 02:03:57,175
Please!

1934
02:04:02,681 --> 02:04:05,851
A prayer! Please!

1935
02:04:06,810 --> 02:04:08,520
God!

1936
02:04:09,563 --> 02:04:13,608
Please! Somebody
here, please,

1937
02:04:13,692 --> 02:04:16,862
say a prayer for me!

1938
02:04:16,945 --> 02:04:20,115
No, God. No!

1939
02:04:22,617 --> 02:04:24,618
No! No!

1940
02:04:35,338 --> 02:04:39,592
<i>Silent night</i>

1941
02:04:42,678 --> 02:04:46,766
<i>Holy night</i>

1942
02:04:48,309 --> 02:04:51,812
<i>All is calm</i>

1943
02:04:53,147 --> 02:04:57,068
<i>All is bright</i>

1944
02:04:58,069 --> 02:05:02,657
<i>Round yon Virgin</i>

1945
02:05:03,324 --> 02:05:06,202
<i>Mother and child</i>

1946
02:05:58,086 --> 02:05:59,546
We're having
a party tonight

1947
02:05:59,587 --> 02:06:01,631
at my place for
the Academy show.

1948
02:06:01,715 --> 02:06:03,633
You want to come? No, I
have a million things to do.

1949
02:06:03,717 --> 02:06:05,260
Oh, come on,
please. Please!

1950
02:06:05,343 --> 02:06:08,054
You girls blew the phone lines
out from here to Baltimore.

1951
02:06:08,138 --> 02:06:09,388
Someone's gotta fix them.

1952
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:11,056
Go, have a good night.
I have the radio.

1953
02:06:11,098 --> 02:06:12,683
Okay.

1954
02:06:13,767 --> 02:06:14,768
You sure?

1955
02:06:14,852 --> 02:06:15,894
I'm sure. I'm sure.
Have a good night.

1956
02:06:15,936 --> 02:06:17,730
Good night.
Good night.

1957
02:06:22,318 --> 02:06:24,278
Listen, I really...

1958
02:06:26,363 --> 02:06:27,740
Hello, Ben.

1959
02:06:29,616 --> 02:06:33,579
I'm meeting some friends at
Musso and Frank's for dinner.

1960
02:06:34,121 --> 02:06:37,875
They're gonna pipe in the movie
ceremonies into the restaurant.

1961
02:06:37,958 --> 02:06:40,085
Should be quite a night.

1962
02:06:40,127 --> 02:06:42,212
I'd love it if you'd come.

1963
02:06:43,630 --> 02:06:46,425
I just have so much
work I should be doing.

1964
02:06:48,469 --> 02:06:49,803
Good night.

1965
02:06:52,681 --> 02:06:53,849
Ben?

1966
02:06:55,684 --> 02:06:56,935
I...

1967
02:06:56,977 --> 02:06:58,854
<i>I put $2 down on
It Happened One Night</i>

1968
02:06:58,937 --> 02:07:00,397
to win Best Picture.

1969
02:07:00,481 --> 02:07:02,107
Seems I am the only
person that thinks

1970
02:07:02,149 --> 02:07:04,025
<i>it has a chance
against Cleopatra.</i>

1971
02:07:04,108 --> 02:07:06,152
But, if it wins, do you wanna
celebrate tomorrow night at dinner?

1972
02:07:07,695 --> 02:07:10,281
It's a deal, Christine.
See you.

1973
02:07:10,365 --> 02:07:12,992
If your movie wins,
I'll call you.

1974
02:07:13,076 --> 02:07:14,535
I'll be here.

1975
02:07:18,665 --> 02:07:19,791
Hi.
Hi.

1976
02:07:21,918 --> 02:07:25,129
<i>...The Thin Man, Cleopatra...</i>

1977
02:07:25,213 --> 02:07:26,839
Overrated.

1978
02:07:26,923 --> 02:07:28,966
<i>...and It Happened One Night.</i>

1979
02:07:29,050 --> 02:07:31,010
Clark Gable,
Claudette Colbert.

1980
02:07:31,052 --> 02:07:32,470
I rest my case.

1981
02:07:32,512 --> 02:07:34,973
<i>May I have the
envelope, please?</i>

1982
02:07:36,599 --> 02:07:40,311
<i>And the winner is
It Happened One Night.</i>

1983
02:07:42,188 --> 02:07:44,399
I knew it! I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it!

1984
02:07:46,484 --> 02:07:48,111
Dinner is on me.

1985
02:07:48,194 --> 02:07:50,029
<i>Is this
Christine Collins?</i>

1986
02:07:50,113 --> 02:07:52,281
Yes, it is.

1987
02:07:52,365 --> 02:07:54,951
<i>This is Mrs. Clay.
Do you remember me?</i>

1988
02:07:55,576 --> 02:07:57,869
Mrs. Clay,
of course I remember you.

1989
02:07:57,953 --> 02:07:59,997
<i>I just had to
call you right off.</i>

1990
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:02,332
<i>What is it?
The police just called.</i>

1991
02:08:02,416 --> 02:08:04,626
<i>They found a boy,
Christine.</i>

1992
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:08,547
<i>Where?
Lincoln Heights Precinct.</i>

1993
02:08:08,630 --> 02:08:10,090
<i>We're leaving right now.</i>

1994
02:08:10,173 --> 02:08:11,675
I'll be right down.

1995
02:08:34,364 --> 02:08:35,657
Oh, here.

1996
02:08:36,325 --> 02:08:37,701
I wanted to go
to him right off,

1997
02:08:37,743 --> 02:08:40,871
but they said it was important
to talk to him alone first.

1998
02:08:40,954 --> 02:08:43,081
Are they sure?
They're sure.

1999
02:08:43,165 --> 02:08:46,335
But, more important,
I'm sure.

2000
02:08:46,418 --> 02:08:47,502
It's my boy, all right.

2001
02:08:47,586 --> 02:08:49,420
It's David.

2002
02:08:49,462 --> 02:08:51,589
He's alive, Christine.

2003
02:08:51,672 --> 02:08:53,090
They found him
up in Hesperia.

2004
02:08:53,132 --> 02:08:56,135
<i>You were walking
home from school,</i>

2005
02:08:56,218 --> 02:08:58,387
<i>and they told you they
needed help finding a dog.</i>

2006
02:08:58,471 --> 02:08:59,722
<i>Yeah.</i>

2007
02:08:59,805 --> 02:09:02,892
<i>So, after you got in the
truck, what happened next?</i>

2008
02:09:02,933 --> 02:09:05,269
<i>They drove me around
for a long time,</i>

2009
02:09:05,311 --> 02:09:06,896
then we ended up
at this ranch.

2010
02:09:07,021 --> 02:09:10,441
Come on.
Come on, Davy.

2011
02:09:10,483 --> 02:09:11,859
Davy! Come on.
Get off me.

2012
02:09:11,942 --> 02:09:13,110
Don't fight
this much. Hey!

2013
02:09:13,194 --> 02:09:15,279
Were there other
boys there?

2014
02:09:15,988 --> 02:09:18,449
<i>Yeah. Five, I think.</i>

2015
02:09:20,034 --> 02:09:21,952
It was a long
time ago, though.

2016
02:09:22,036 --> 02:09:24,330
Hello, boys.
This is Davy.

2017
02:09:24,413 --> 02:09:25,790
I know you'll make
him feel... Hey!

2018
02:09:26,957 --> 02:09:30,294
No. No! Hey!
Shut up!

2019
02:09:30,336 --> 02:09:32,254
Did you speak to them?

2020
02:09:33,005 --> 02:09:35,591
Yeah? You remember
any of their names?

2021
02:09:36,467 --> 02:09:38,469
Yeah.

2022
02:09:38,511 --> 02:09:39,971
Two of them
were brothers.

2023
02:09:40,012 --> 02:09:42,847
I think their last
name was Winslow.

2024
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:46,267
<i>The oldest one
was Jeffrey.</i>

2025
02:09:50,230 --> 02:09:51,731
And Walter.

2026
02:09:54,150 --> 02:09:55,652
<i>Walter?</i>

2027
02:09:56,444 --> 02:09:59,322
Yeah. Do you remember
Walter's last name?

2028
02:10:04,786 --> 02:10:06,037
Collins.

2029
02:10:07,706 --> 02:10:09,290
<i>Walter Collins.</i>

2030
02:10:10,333 --> 02:10:13,545
Tell me something if you only
remember some of the boys' names,

2031
02:10:13,628 --> 02:10:16,297
how come you remember his full name?

2032
02:10:17,007 --> 02:10:19,134
Because of
what happened.

2033
02:10:19,217 --> 02:10:21,261
<i>Walter and Jeffrey
were talking.</i>

2034
02:10:21,344 --> 02:10:23,263
<i>Pull it. They kept checking around</i>

2035
02:10:23,346 --> 02:10:25,932
and they found a part of the coop
where the wire was all messed up.

2036
02:10:26,016 --> 02:10:27,600
Be careful!

2037
02:10:27,684 --> 02:10:29,352
Hurry!

2038
02:10:29,436 --> 02:10:31,813
Maybe make enough room to
get out of there and run.

2039
02:10:31,855 --> 02:10:33,565
When we get
out, we split up,

2040
02:10:33,648 --> 02:10:35,400
go in different
directions. Okay?

2041
02:10:35,483 --> 02:10:37,568
They can't catch all of us.

2042
02:10:37,651 --> 02:10:39,611
It'd make an awful
lot of noise.

2043
02:10:39,695 --> 02:10:42,406
Be quiet. You got it?

2044
02:10:42,489 --> 02:10:45,367
And if it wasn't wide
enough, then we'd be stuck.

2045
02:10:48,746 --> 02:10:51,957
Wait. Help! Help!
Come on, hurry!

2046
02:10:52,875 --> 02:10:56,170
My foot's stuck! Hurry,
help! Help me, please!

2047
02:10:58,714 --> 02:11:01,592
He's coming!
He's...

2048
02:11:01,675 --> 02:11:03,344
My foot!

2049
02:11:04,261 --> 02:11:05,804
He's coming.

2050
02:11:05,888 --> 02:11:07,640
Hurry, run, run, run!

2051
02:11:12,728 --> 02:11:15,230
Hey! What
the hell are you boys...

2052
02:11:17,107 --> 02:11:21,737
Oh! Mary, Mother of
God! Hey! Hey! Hey!

2053
02:11:22,488 --> 02:11:25,532
You get back here!
Hey! Hold it! Hey!

2054
02:11:28,035 --> 02:11:29,119
Hey!

2055
02:11:30,286 --> 02:11:31,371
Hey!

2056
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:34,207
Stop!

2057
02:11:36,542 --> 02:11:37,919
Check on the others!

2058
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:39,379
Stop! Damn it!

2059
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:41,714
Boys,
I'm coming after you!

2060
02:11:41,756 --> 02:11:44,884
Damn it! Damn it!

2061
02:11:45,176 --> 02:11:48,096
Boys, I'll find you no
matter where you are!

2062
02:11:48,179 --> 02:11:50,556
They're not in there!
Come on! Get in the car!

2063
02:11:50,598 --> 02:11:54,727
I'm gonna find you! Damn
it! Damn it! Come on.

2064
02:11:54,811 --> 02:11:57,230
Shit! Get in
the car, Sanford!

2065
02:12:04,696 --> 02:12:07,323
That was the last
I saw of any of them.

2066
02:12:07,907 --> 02:12:10,910
So, you don't know if either
of the other two were captured?

2067
02:12:10,994 --> 02:12:12,078
No.

2068
02:12:13,371 --> 02:12:15,289
All I know is,

2069
02:12:15,331 --> 02:12:18,209
if Walter hadn't
come back for me

2070
02:12:19,085 --> 02:12:21,796
<i>I don't think I ever
would've gotten out of there.</i>

2071
02:12:22,714 --> 02:12:24,089
Okay.

2072
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:27,509
So, what happened
after that?

2073
02:12:27,592 --> 02:12:29,261
I kept off
the main roads,

2074
02:12:29,344 --> 02:12:34,308
until I saw a train stopped
at a crossing and I jumped in.

2075
02:12:34,725 --> 02:12:37,769
Why didn't you tell
anyone what had happened?

2076
02:12:37,853 --> 02:12:39,313
I was afraid.

2077
02:12:39,813 --> 02:12:42,816
I thought they'd come
after me, or my folks.

2078
02:12:44,609 --> 02:12:47,029
<i>So, I just didn't
tell anybody.</i>

2079
02:12:48,905 --> 02:12:53,118
I was on my own until I got a free
meal from this lady, Miss Lansing.

2080
02:12:53,160 --> 02:12:55,662
Told her I was an
orphan, on my own.

2081
02:12:57,664 --> 02:12:59,624
She said I could stay on.

2082
02:13:01,084 --> 02:13:02,419
And I did.

2083
02:13:03,670 --> 02:13:05,005
<i>Every night,</i>

2084
02:13:05,088 --> 02:13:08,508
I'd wake up thinking they
were right outside my window.

2085
02:13:09,051 --> 02:13:11,511
And then I heard the
police talking on the radio

2086
02:13:11,595 --> 02:13:14,348
about what happened
at the ranch.

2087
02:13:14,473 --> 02:13:16,849
And I thought, "For sure
I can't go back now. "

2088
02:13:16,891 --> 02:13:18,351
Why?

2089
02:13:18,893 --> 02:13:19,977
Why not?

2090
02:13:20,019 --> 02:13:22,813
Since I didn't tell
anybody what happened.

2091
02:13:24,190 --> 02:13:26,984
I was afraid they'd blame
me for those kids being dead.

2092
02:13:28,861 --> 02:13:30,738
So I just stayed away.

2093
02:13:32,490 --> 02:13:35,493
What made you come forward
now, after all this time?

2094
02:13:35,534 --> 02:13:38,120
Hmm? Why come
forward now?

2095
02:13:41,707 --> 02:13:43,459
I really miss my mom.

2096
02:13:45,878 --> 02:13:47,755
I really miss my dad.

2097
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:52,760
I just wanna go home.

2098
02:13:56,180 --> 02:13:57,974
<i>I just wanna go home.</i>

2099
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:05,731
Are you all right?

2100
02:14:06,399 --> 02:14:08,609
I love you.

2101
02:14:41,099 --> 02:14:42,892
I still can't believe it.

2102
02:14:42,934 --> 02:14:46,855
Five years, case closed, everyone
thinks he's dead, and there he is.

2103
02:14:48,356 --> 02:14:51,109
Wouldn't be, if it
wasn't for Walter.

2104
02:14:52,777 --> 02:14:55,363
Your son did a brave
thing, Mrs. Collins.

2105
02:14:55,447 --> 02:14:57,615
You should be
very proud of him.

2106
02:14:57,699 --> 02:14:59,034
I am.

2107
02:15:01,369 --> 02:15:02,911
You still think
he's out there?

2108
02:15:02,995 --> 02:15:04,246
Why not?

2109
02:15:05,456 --> 02:15:07,458
Three boys made a run for
it that night, Detective.

2110
02:15:07,499 --> 02:15:09,043
And if one got out,

2111
02:15:09,126 --> 02:15:12,212
then maybe either or both
of the others did, too.

2112
02:15:12,296 --> 02:15:15,841
Maybe Walter's out there, having
the same fears that he did.

2113
02:15:15,966 --> 02:15:17,801
Afraid to come home
and identify himself,

2114
02:15:17,885 --> 02:15:20,304
or afraid he'll get
into trouble.

2115
02:15:21,722 --> 02:15:23,807
But either way,

2116
02:15:23,891 --> 02:15:27,019
it gives me something I
didn't have before tonight.

2117
02:15:27,144 --> 02:15:28,520
What's that?

2118
02:15:29,480 --> 02:15:30,689
Hope.
