1
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,580
- Okay, now are you ready?
- Yeah.

2
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,140
Okay. We're gonna go...
you gotta hold on tight.

3
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,800
Squeeze, squeeze. You ready?

4
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,780
You're the one who should be
in front of the camera.

5
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,689
What are you doing, hiding back there?

6
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,380
There she is, ladies and gentlemen,
the most beautiful woman in the world.

7
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,420
Just like out of a fairytale.

8
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,740
Wave to Daddy.

9
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,700
Wave to Daddy.

10
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,882
- Hi, Daddy.
- Throw Daddy a kiss.

11
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,300
Get off me.

12
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,500
Get the fuck off me, Dad.
I just wanna sleep.

13
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,940
Shut up! Get up!

14
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,610
Help! Somebody help!

15
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,980
Hi.

16
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,940
- Pick up the phone!
- I can't find it.

17
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,122
I got some news you're gonna want to hear.

18
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,571
Oh, yeah? What?

19
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,180
Penguin loved the proposal.

20
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,980
- Shut the fuck up!
- We've got a deal.

21
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,540
Are you serious?

22
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,460
- That's awesome!
- Yeah. They're wiring the money today,

23
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,500
and I got you twice what you asked me for.

24
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,090
What? You're the best!

25
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,540
Yeah, I'm a miracle worker.

26
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,300
Holy shit! That's great.

27
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,620
So wha... What now?

28
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,940
So now you write it.

29
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,380
All they need is a 20-page
excerpt every month

30
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,620
and other than that, you're a free man...

31
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,166
Oh, and they wanna have
a party in a few weeks...

32
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,740
black tie, canapes, et cetera, et cetera.

33
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,300
Whoa! What?

34
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,765
Go buy yourself a nice suit.

35
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,860
- All right!
- Okay, hon. Talk later.

36
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,020
Wait for it, wait for it.

37
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,700
- First bucket, baby! First bucket!
- Here we go.

38
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,100
That's one, that's one, that's one!

39
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,340
Bam! Yeah! Yes, motherfucker!

40
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,780
I will ruin you! Your kids
will weep at your funeral!

41
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,900
Break that streak! Pound it!

42
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,460
No, no, no! No!

43
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,420
- No, no, no! Come on, man!
- That's what I'm talking about!

44
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,921
That's my money. Give me that money!

45
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,740
You pay up, bitch. Gimme that money!

46
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,620
You are such a bitch.

47
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,100
Really? What is this, down payment?

48
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,620
Hey, you missed everything.

49
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,180
I know, I know.
I had to go to the courthouse.

50
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,340
Yo, come on. What are you doing?

51
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,249
- It's over, right?
- No, we're watching the recap.

52
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,020
- I gotta watch this real quick.
- I wanna see...

53
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,248
No body, no weapon.

54
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,820
Next week, Hans Reiser goes on trial
for the murder of his wife.

55
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,780
Big questions arise... did he kill her,

56
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,660
or did she simply leave her family
to escape a bad marriage?

57
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,250
It's a haunting story,

58
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,740
as the investigation of Nina Reiser
continues.

59
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,980
The direct physical evidence
against Hans is limited,

60
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,420
but police have built a detailed
circumstantial case.

61
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,460
Police have confirmed they believed
Hans Reiser acted alone.

62
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,380
- According to some, Nina...
- What is this?

63
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,380
It's Hans. He made
the Linux operating system...

64
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,060
big nerd celebrity.

65
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,900
I'm profiling the case for Wired.

66
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,650
Hans says he lives for his kids.

67
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,020
In divorce court, a critical ruling...

68
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,820
Hans lost legal custody
of his precious children.

69
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,700
His life was falling apart.

70
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,620
I don't know where Nina is.

71
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,500
All I know is that the woman
that I love is gone

72
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,980
and her children keep asking me
when she's coming back

73
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,206
and I don't know what to tell them.

74
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,540
I'm just a husband and a father.

75
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,051
I'm a victim in all this.

76
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,324
No one took Nina, no one hurt her.

77
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,140
She just left.

78
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,140
Nina left her family.

79
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,500
And with that, the last man known to have
seen Nina alive heads back to his cell.

80
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,580
- Hey, can you get me in?
- To the trial?

81
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,740
- Yeah.
- Why?

82
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,940
...the question: Where is Nina?

83
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,810
Sure.

84
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,300
Hey, Stephen, it's Jen.

85
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,500
I know you know those pages
are due at Penguin next week.

86
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,126
I hope it's going well. Give me a call.

87
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,980
Hey, man, it's Josh.
I got you the Reiser interview.

88
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,526
You're welcome. Call me.

89
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:53,556
Who are you?

90
00:09:53,656 --> 00:09:56,060
I'm Stephen Elliott.

91
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,380
Uh, look, I'm not talking to reporters.

92
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,860
I'm not a reporter.

93
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,803
I just want to write a book.

94
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,100
Well, it's... it's kind of hard
to trust your kind of people.

95
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,020
Writers, they have a way
of spinning things

96
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,485
the way they want to.

97
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,490
Yeah, I know.
I have a lot of ex-girlfriends

98
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,060
that have accused me of the same thing.

99
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,660
Well, what do you want to know?

100
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,331
Anything. I just...

101
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,420
I just want to hear your story, that's it.

102
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,931
I'm not interested.

103
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,526
There's something there.
He's sitting on something,

104
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,887
just waiting for a big reveal.

105
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,740
Like maybe he killed his wife.

106
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,162
Yeah, maybe, but why is the question.

107
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,780
Hey, is anybody dead out there?

108
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,740
I want to pitch a book to Jen.
A true crime thing.

109
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,260
- Yeah.
- My In Cold Blood.

110
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,966
Yeah. Better. But probably better.

111
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,040
What the hell is that?

112
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,291
Flip it.

113
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,700
That's my team, from down below.

114
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,780
- Sniff it.
- You gave me your team?

115
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,820
- Yeah.
- Yum.

116
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,526
- You got any blueberry sauce?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

117
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,045
Put it where it goes, though.

118
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,841
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,740
The key is to put a little bit of butter
in the balls like so.

120
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,561
Then you put a nice sloppy
helping on there,

121
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,724
and then let the blood flow
right to the other part.

122
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,404
A little wet, and look at that.

123
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,180
Looks like shit.

124
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,100
All right! Hot cakes are ready!

125
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,980
Get your asses in here for some cakes!

126
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,700
- Hey!
- We cut my hair.

127
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,740
Whoa! Check out this haircut.

128
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,126
God damn it!

129
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,820
Oh-oh! Wow!

130
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,740
He's got it! That is just...

131
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,604
What do you... What do you think of it?

132
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,100
- You like it?
- I think it's awesome.

133
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,180
- I think it's pretty awesome.
- I think it's awesome

134
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,100
that you feel awesome
for the last day of school,

135
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,726
but I gotta tell you, man,
that looks terrible.

136
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,980
Hey, you know what, though?
Maybe you should put a shirt on.

137
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,882
Looking like a deranged
little ragamuffin with no shirt on.

138
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,691
This is not the kind of parent
who disappears without warning.

139
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,369
This is not a mother
who abandons her children.

140
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,160
Nina Reiser was president of her
school's Parent-Teacher Association.

141
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,811
She chaperoned field trips.
She did the class laundry.

142
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,201
Nina's children were her entire world.

143
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,840
She would have never,
ever left them willingly.

144
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,980
And she most certainly wouldn't have
left them with her estranged husband

145
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,890
of whom she was afraid.

146
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,820
The police were called to the Reiser house

147
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,860
three times during the months
leading up to the separation.

148
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,850
Hans appeared twice in Family Court

149
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,847
for refusing to pay for
his children's medical expenses.

150
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,340
The last time he appeared in court,

151
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,420
his request to have the children
for Labor Day weekend was denied.

152
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,970
12 hours later, Nina Reiser disappeared
from the face of the Earth.

153
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,860
When he was arrested,
he was carrying $9,000 in cash,

154
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,860
two books about unsolved homicides

155
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,531
and a three-page letter.

156
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,900
The letter begins:

157
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,721
"I've been telling you about Nina
and nobody listens.

158
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,820
I may be a danger
to the worldview of some,

159
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,447
but I am no danger to my children."

160
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,600
Hey!

161
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,006
You forgot your notebook.

162
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,246
- This is where you say thank you.
- Thank you.

163
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,810
How much did you read?

164
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,100
Nah, just a little.

165
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,500
I had to find your name.

166
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,420
I want to see if I should be embarrassed.

167
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,660
I wrote, "Hans Reiser trial.
Get transcript of letter thing."

168
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,500
With search terms like that,
should be a breeze.

169
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,996
Let me see what you wrote.

170
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,580
Whoa!

171
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,284
This is thorough.

172
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,340
I feel really inadequate,

173
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,761
Miss Lana Edmond.

174
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,922
I write for the Times.
Are you covering the trial?

175
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,280
Not sure yet.

176
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,768
Do you want to get a drink?

177
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,247
- Like right now or in general?
- Right now.

178
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,940
I have to take a raincheck.

179
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,849
I have to do something for work.

180
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,220
All right. I totally understand.
It's a really big decision.

181
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,810
You have to think about it a lot.

182
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,620
So you'll have plenty of time
to do that on our way there.

183
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,660
No fucking way! Is this your bike?

184
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,740
Yeah.

185
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,080
I'm driving.

186
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,365
That's Hans' mother's house.

187
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,380
They're right, you know.
The body is buried here.

188
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,980
There's no way
he buried the body that close.

189
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,020
Oh, yeah? Where would you dump a body?

190
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,540
Hudson Canyon.

191
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,260
Okay. It's weird you had
an answer for that, but...

192
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,380
It's in New Jersey, off the coast.

193
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,420
It's this underwater canyon.

194
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,180
It's starts in the basin and goes out
in the ocean, like 400 miles.

195
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,460
It's as big as the Grand Canyon,
but nobody knows about it,

196
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,360
so people just abandon
things there all the time.

197
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,803
I once dropped
an engagement ring in there.

198
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,980
Sorry.

199
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,220
I don't know why I just said that.

200
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,448
Jesus Christ!

201
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,740
Um, so what are you doing tonight?

202
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,844
I don't know. What do you have in mind?

203
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,881
"I never went back.

204
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,220
I couldn't stand to see her that way.

205
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,322
Three months later, she was dead.

206
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,580
My father told me in the front seat
of his convertible

207
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,380
after finding me in a park.

208
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,780
He was already living with his new wife
and her children,

209
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,020
somewhere in the suburbs.
He wouldn't tell me which one.

210
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,620
I lived on the streets
until an overdose put me in the hospital

211
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,927
and I became a ward of the state.

212
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,140
The day my father was found
guilty of abuse and neglect,

213
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,969
I sat beside him in court.

214
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,420
Right before my statement,
he pulled me close,

215
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,020
so it would look like he was hugging me,

216
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,220
and then he whispered in my ear,

217
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,926
'You know it's all your fault, right?

218
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,050
You killed your mother.'

219
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,060
That's what I could never explain
to the lawyers and caseworkers.

220
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,260
It wasn't about the handcuffs
or the beatings

221
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,420
or his shaving my head. That was nothing.

222
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,540
It was the constant suggestion
that I was doing something wrong,

223
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,060
that I was inherently poisonous

224
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,340
and to blame for the series of abuses
and abandonment

225
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,660
that marked my adolescence.

226
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,580
He made that suggestion
in countless, subtle

227
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,365
and more obvious ways
all the years he was alive."

228
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,720
This is bullshit.

229
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,967
"In the end, his passing
brought me no satisfaction, no closure.

230
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,420
The day he died..."

231
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,205
Jesus Christ, how can
you people listen to this crap?

232
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,140
Oh my God, it's a ghost!

233
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,890
Boo!

234
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,140
My son, ladies and gentlemen.

235
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,006
The poor, abused orphan. The underdog.

236
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,820
How convenient for you to have
a dead monster for a father!

237
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,002
How utterly pitiable!

238
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,527
I should be getting royalties
for this shit.

239
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,484
My son, the storyteller...
what a fucking joke!

240
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,100
You deserve to be played,
falling for this nonsense.

241
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,780
My son was never homeless.
He was never in group homes.

242
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,245
He was a drug addict fuck-up

243
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,169
who wants to seem interesting and dramatic

244
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,860
and take your money, is what he wants.

245
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,900
- All right, Neil, you gotta go.
- Oh, Roger, how are you doing?

246
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,048
- You gotta go.
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

247
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,531
- You gotta go. Now.
- I gotta go?

248
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,761
You're a fucking coward. Always have been.

249
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,900
You people are all fools...
listening to this bullshit.

250
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,200
Um...

251
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,420
You know, I haven't seen him
in seven years.

252
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,260
The one thing we can agree on, though,

253
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,089
is that we're just dead to each other.

254
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,730
You don't have to explain to me.

255
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,449
Well, unfortunately, I don't think
everyone else will feel that way.

256
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,531
But thank you.

257
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,246
I tried to kill my stepfather once...

258
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,131
...when I was 16.

259
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,780
I worked in a pharmacy,
and I did the research.

260
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,580
I figured out what kind of pill
I would need

261
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,260
and how much it would take
to kill a man, the whole thing, right?

262
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,380
I put a few pills in my pocket
every day before I left work,

263
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,820
saved up enough, ground them up

264
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,740
and put them in his fancy bottle of scotch

265
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,968
that he wouldn't let anyone else touch.

266
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,820
So you killed him.

267
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,604
Nope.

268
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,820
Not even close.

269
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,340
Nothing happened.

270
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,780
It just went right through his system.

271
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,291
He was that fat.

272
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,290
I guess I shouldn't laugh, it's not funny.

273
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,321
You'll get to funny one day.

274
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,049
It just takes time.

275
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,140
So what were you like in high school?

276
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,300
Me? I was a bad ass.

277
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,660
- A bad ass?
- Oh, yeah.

278
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,140
I had a punk band and everything.

279
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,460
What were you called?

280
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,900
We were called the Lys Dexics.

281
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,140
- What?
- Think about it.

282
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,980
Oh, like dyslexic.

283
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,527
I played bass, which is ridiculous

284
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,620
because I can't even hear
bass notes. But whatever.

285
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,860
There's only like four of them, so.

286
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,203
And then we had this whole bit where I
sprayed hairspray into Mattie's lighter.

287
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,780
It was very cool.

288
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,820
I wish I could have seen you then.

289
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,606
A little delinquent, yeah?

290
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,971
So why'd you break up?

291
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,242
- The band?
- Mm-hmm.

292
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,900
I guess I ultimately figured out

293
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,820
it was less fun to have bad sex
in the back of a van sober.

294
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,740
What kind of sober?

295
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,047
Not wanting to be my stepfather kind.

296
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,802
Do you mind if I ask what he did to you?

297
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,380
It's in the past.

298
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,660
I'm not looking over my shoulder.

299
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,420
I know, but what happens
to us makes us who we are.

300
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,740
No. Fuck that!

301
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,940
That has nothing to do with who I am.

302
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,540
He has nothing to do with who I became.

303
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,324
That doesn't mean you need to bury it.

304
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,169
I'm not burying anything.

305
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,248
I've just got some souvenirs.

306
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,325
I think you're perfect.

307
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,100
I wouldn't want you any other way.

308
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,080
Hey!

309
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,820
Jesus! Where the hell have you been?

310
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,780
Oh... Uh, I just...

311
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,884
I needed a little time,
that's all. Come in.

312
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,940
What are you doing?

313
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,260
Oh, it's this thing Roger turned me on to.

314
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,820
You heat it up to 209 degrees.

315
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,129
No, I mean, what in the actual
fuck are we gonna do?

316
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,180
I don't know.

317
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:27,162
Uh, I never really had a plan
for when life shits the bed like this.

318
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,643
Do you have any sense
of how many phone calls

319
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,889
and hysterical emails I've gotten?

320
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,930
As a matter of fact, I do.
I changed my number.

321
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,810
Thanks for letting me know.

322
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,100
So here's where we are.

323
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,220
Random House is backing out
of the short story collection.

324
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,740
Columbia wants to buy you out
of your teaching contract.

325
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,860
- Fuck them.
- Essentially,

326
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,203
everyone is on the verge of suing us.

327
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,447
The Penguin thing... that's over, too?

328
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,740
Not yet.

329
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,620
I have managed to talk them down,

330
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,340
but you have gotta work with me here.

331
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,340
Okay. All right. Just tell me how.

332
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,966
Okay. First of all,
you gotta tell me the truth.

333
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,660
- Fine. Easy.
- Everything.

334
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,580
Look, yeah, my dad isn't dead, obviously.

335
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,340
But that's it.

336
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,660
So why does Neil say that
you never lived in a group home?

337
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,100
Why does he say you were never homeless?

338
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,980
Why? Because... I don't...

339
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,082
My dad's crazy, that's why!

340
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,180
I don't know! I've been trying
to figure it out my whole life.

341
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,089
He just... He doesn't want me to be happy.

342
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,486
Do you have proof?

343
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,330
- What kind of proof?
- I don't know. Records.

344
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,940
- I mean, not on me.
- Find some.

345
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,220
Quick. I believe you,
but you've gotta cover your ass.

346
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,540
Okay.

347
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,201
Next, you've got to write a...

348
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,321
press release statement like, now.

349
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,410
Next, Penguin has got to
have some pages ASAP.

350
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,485
Unless you start producing,
this all goes away.

351
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,402
Kill yourself, you fucking asshole!

352
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,100
- Whad'ya got?
- I already paid for that.

353
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,440
Don't be stupid.

354
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,042
Say what do you want from me.

355
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,020
I don't know.

356
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,771
I know exactly what you like, don't I?

357
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,820
Hi, Cori.

358
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,340
Cori, do you remember
drawing that picture?

359
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,940
Yes.

360
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,380
Why did you draw it?

361
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,820
I drew it to show what happened.

362
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,460
Hans went away for a long time,

363
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,643
and when he came back,
he had this very big bag.

364
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,020
Inside the bag there were
so many rolls of tape, like a ball,

365
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,180
and Hans took it to his car.

366
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,540
Now, in your picture,

367
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,220
the bag is zipped up.

368
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,500
Could you actually see what was in the bag

369
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,604
or were you just kind of imagining
what might be in there?

370
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,380
Imagining.

371
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,300
And who asked you to draw it?

372
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,860
The psychologist.

373
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,940
Now, did you remember the part about
your Dad carrying the bag

374
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,805
before the psychologist talked to you?

375
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,860
I'm not sure.

376
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,691
Do you have trouble with keeping things
straight sometimes, Cori?

377
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,460
Do you get a little, you know,
confused, sometimes?

378
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,020
I don't want to do this anymore.
Can I stop now?

379
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,009
Okay. Thank you, pal.

380
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,940
Did Cori always call his parents
by their first names?

381
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,460
No, I don't think so, actually.

382
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,460
It seemed at the earlier custody trial
statements he would say "my mom,"

383
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,882
but I don't know when he started
calling Hans "Hans."

384
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,140
Do you think we could get
the Family Court documents?

385
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,460
Some of them. Anything public record.

386
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,971
Can I see it?

387
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,780
All right. So this is the first one,
where Cori is calling his mother "Nina,"

388
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,300
and Hans was already called "Hans."

389
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,620
Hmmm.

390
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,380
This was three months
before she disappeared.

391
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,580
Mm-hmm.

392
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,860
Hey, can you get documents
from other states,

393
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,689
not just New York?

394
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,580
Uh, yeah. Wha... what are you thinking?

395
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,900
Illinois.

396
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,100
Yeah, sure. Why?

397
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,420
'Cause I grew up in Chicago.

398
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,885
What are you looking for?

399
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,340
How about the hearing where my father
was convicted of neglect and abuse

400
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,681
and I was made a ward of the state?

401
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,340
What are you gonna do with it?

402
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,204
I don't know. All my book
deals went to shit,

403
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,060
and my editor says
they're gonna stay that way

404
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,340
until I come up with some proof
that all that stuff actually happened.

405
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,649
And I have to publish it
in an important publication.

406
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,060
Like say The Times?

407
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,220
I wouldn't ask you to do that.

408
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,767
Yeah, kind of just did, but that's okay.

409
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,331
I'd love to help.

410
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,129
Does this look like
what you're looking for?

411
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,060
Yeah.

412
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,540
Now the only problem is I can't write it.

413
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,260
Of course you can.
Write whatever you want.

414
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,362
No, I just can't write. I mean...

415
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,481
It just happens.
Last time it lasted six months.

416
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,980
And then what?

417
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,730
Then I started taking Adderall.

418
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,806
Okay. It's printing.

419
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,540
What if we published this as is?

420
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,900
Mm? Print it full page,

421
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,527
complete with your
handwritten annotations.

422
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,020
That's something people would notice

423
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,980
and you wouldn't have to write anything.

424
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,220
I think that you're brilliant.

425
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,900
I know.

426
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,561
There's a term for what you are right now.

427
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,570
- Cunt-struck.
- Fuck you.

428
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,780
- Cunt-struck.
- That's not a word.

429
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,484
Yeah, it is.

430
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,140
It's an old word, old-timey word.

431
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,526
It's like cuntwinked.

432
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,980
Or the more politically
correct version, hoodwinked.

433
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,300
- Come on, you don't know this? Huh?
- No.

434
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,500
What's the male version?

435
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,887
- Cock hobbled.
- Shut the fuck up!

436
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,128
Come on. You gonna match
with me and you don't know that?

437
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,770
Hey. I put this on so I'd remember
to give it to you.

438
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,370
Remember this?

439
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,445
Yeah.

440
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,340
Yeah. I was going through this old box

441
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,886
and thought I'd give it back to you.

442
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,929
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

443
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,771
You sure you're ready
to part ways with that?

444
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,500
- Thought it'd make you happy.
- Yeah, it did.

445
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,045
You could give it to Jax.

446
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,300
It belonged to my grandmother.

447
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,528
Yeah, I remember.

448
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,260
You gave it to me
the night after I overdosed.

449
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,180
Remember you said it would protect me?

450
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,520
I sure don't.

451
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,620
It meant a lot to me at the time.

452
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,722
Yeah? That's interesting.

453
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,060
'Cause I didn't give it to you, Stephen.

454
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,420
- What?
- It got stolen

455
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,460
from my jacket at a party.

456
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,580
What are you talking about?
I was in the hospital at Northwestern.

457
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,920
You snuck in to visit me.

458
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,924
Ha, doesn't matter. Forget it.

459
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,020
It matters to me.

460
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,340
Look, you were pissed off at me
'cause I made that shitty joke

461
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,220
about your mom in the wheelchair
peeing herself, yeah?

462
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,580
- Yeah, I remember.
- Yeah, and the chain broke,

463
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,420
and I had it in my jacket pocket
and then it went missing at the party.

464
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,921
This is not how I remember it.

465
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,420
I believe that's not how you remember,

466
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,966
because you have a convenient way
of remembering things.

467
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,649
- What? We're done?
- Yeah, we're done.

468
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,220
Roger!

469
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,722
Why don't you just tell me
what you're looking for, what you like?

470
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,400
Because I don't want to scare you away.

471
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,300
Do I seem easily scared to you?

472
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,640
No.

473
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,005
You're the last person
I want to show my flaws to.

474
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,420
You're showing them to somebody.

475
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,860
I know you're not getting
these marks on your own.

476
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:08,940
No, I'm not.

477
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,442
I just don't want to wonder
who else you're with.

478
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,522
Give me a chance.

479
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,731
Tie this wrist.

480
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,289
Now tie it to the bed.

481
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,666
Now tie this one.

482
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,003
Tie it really tight.

483
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,361
Like that?

484
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,840
Yeah.

485
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,491
Take one nail.

486
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,406
Run it down.

487
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,611
Slower.

488
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,840
Slow.

489
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,760
Harder.

490
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,924
Harder.

491
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,725
- Like that?
- Yeah.

492
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,685
Kiss me.

493
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,090
Well, fine, but I like the Hans idea.

494
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,740
Look, I think they have
the right to voice a concern.

495
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,180
This doesn't even resemble the book
they're paying you to write.

496
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,780
Okay, no? Fine.
I get that, but it's a better idea.

497
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,500
Yeah, I'm not really sure
that I can sell this, Steve.

498
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,980
Look, Norman Mailer, Truman Capote.

499
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,300
They were both at the top of their games

500
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,420
and then they got
massive writer's block, right?

501
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,020
- And then?
- Yes, and they fell into addiction.

502
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,761
Exactly. And what happens? A murder trial.

503
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,260
Truman Capote writes his masterpiece,
changes American literature.

504
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,700
Norman Mailer wins
the freaking Pulitzer Prize.

505
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,900
Oh, so Hans Reiser
is gonna win you a Pulitzer now?

506
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,220
No, I'm just... He's interesting,
that's all. It's what I want to write.

507
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,980
Alright. Fine, fine, fine. As long as
you're actually writing something.

508
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,162
I don't know. I guess we'll figure it out.

509
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,980
You're gonna have to get me some pages
if you want me to pitch this change,

510
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,220
- actual pages.
- Um, cool. You got it.

511
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,820
Yes, I promise. I promise. I promise.

512
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,300
- I promise.
- Okay.

513
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,890
Okay. Bye.

514
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,500
I made breakfast.

515
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,331
- I see that.
- Eggs Benedict.

516
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,402
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

517
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,450
It's just, um...
This was taped to my front door.

518
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,770
Motherfucker!

519
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,540
You stay away from her.

520
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,660
If you ever hurt them, I swear to God
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

521
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,889
Oh, come on. You're so dramatic!

522
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,620
- Come on.
- No.

523
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,340
Oh! I see how it is, Tough Guy.

524
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,480
All right, you handsome motherfucker.
At least come on in.

525
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,166
Come on!

526
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,860
You want a 7-Up?

527
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,020
Hey, let's get a steak, huh? My treat.

528
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,420
- Where's Cynthia?
- She's in Florida.

529
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,980
You know how much I can't stand
the fucking silverbacks.

530
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,980
So you're just spending her money alone?

531
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,340
Yeah, she sends her love to you, too.

532
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,700
Cynthia, you know,
she had me clean out the attic.

533
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,020
I was visiting your stepsister.

534
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,380
She's going to Yale now,
did you know that?

535
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,611
And I thought I might stop by here
and see if you wanted any of this.

536
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,100
You came all this way to give me a box?

537
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,804
I came to see my son.

538
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,565
Why? You obviously hate me.

539
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,580
Oh, hey, now, come on! Don't say that.

540
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,580
- Why do you say that?
- 'Cause you humiliated me!

541
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,140
Congratulations, I hope you're happy.

542
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,820
I'm not happy.

543
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,500
That didn't make me happy.

544
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,940
Then why would you do that?

545
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,420
You told everyone I was dead.

546
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,740
So did you!

547
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,289
Yeah, well, I mean,
there's storytellers in this family.

548
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,220
I... I've read everything
you've ever written.

549
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,290
I've come all the way across the country
to this fancy party

550
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,286
where they're celebrating my son,
the big-shot literary genius,

551
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,660
because I'm proud of you

552
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,020
and I'm sitting there,
listening to these stories,

553
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,380
and every time, the monster father dies
a horrible death

554
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,740
and those assholes in their party clothes,
they're all happy about it.

555
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,140
How do you think that makes me feel?

556
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,820
You know what? You're not doing this.

557
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,700
You're not turning it around
to make it about you.

558
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,060
I'm not going to feel guilty
for not keeping your secrets.

559
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,740
My secrets? What about yours?

560
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,820
All right, look, here you go.

561
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,900
- What do you got?
- Here's the court hearing

562
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,740
where you were convicted
of seven counts of neglect and abuse.

563
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,460
Here's the police report
for when I was homeless,

564
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,961
'cause you were hiding with
your fucking replacement family!

565
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,660
Hiding? I looked everywhere for you.

566
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,660
You were a strung-out drug addict.

567
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,660
I roamed the streets
trying to save your life.

568
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,140
- Oh, you were gonna save me?
- Yes, save you. I had to restrain you.

569
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,322
You were trying to kill yourself.

570
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,484
You fucking beat the shit out of me,
and I was too little to fight back!

571
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,620
I was grieving. I was doing my best!

572
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,660
You were grieving? As if I wasn't!

573
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,445
- As if I wasn't fucking grieving!
- You pick at the details,

574
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,580
you're missing
the entire context of this thing.

575
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,060
- The context?
- Yeah.

576
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,940
The context is you were
a fucking nightmare!

577
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,460
You were a nightmare!

578
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,460
You made my life a living hell!
You terrorized my family!

579
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,860
I'm your family!

580
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,860
I was your fucking family
and you fucking abandoned me!

581
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,564
That's not true!

582
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,660
You're not going anywhere. Stay there.

583
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,060
Get off of me!

584
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,800
Fucker!

585
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,726
You son of a bitch!

586
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,887
Roger! Get the fuck off me!

587
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,700
I didn't abandon you.

588
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,041
You left home, for God's sake!

589
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,100
You know what? You're right.

590
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,740
You have another family to take care of.

591
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,700
My father is dead. I'm a fucking orphan.

592
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,450
- You don't mean that!
- Yes, I do!

593
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,060
You don't know what
you're saying right now.

594
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,060
You're a pathetic old man and you're
gonna die miserable and alone,

595
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,400
and you fucking deserve it!

596
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,620
Stephen! Stephen!

597
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,420
Stephen, come back here!

598
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,340
All at once or slow?

599
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,124
- Mm?
- Slow.

600
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,900
Fuck!

601
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,240
What did you mean

602
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,490
when you told Dr. Shapiro that Nina
wanted Cori to be sick?

603
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,340
She was... inventing illnesses for Cori,

604
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,420
to make him go through all these
unnecessary medical procedures,

605
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,740
giving him medications
that were making him sick.

606
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,700
She was poisoning my son.

607
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,300
She didn't like him
on some deep, conflicted level.

608
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,528
I know people don't want to hear that.

609
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,680
I mean, they can't believe that a parent
would actually hurt a child.

610
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,980
It happens all the time.

611
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,620
The court system, I mean,

612
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,202
it just makes things
so much worse for the children.

613
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,660
We're taught to believe that the system

614
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,740
will actually help the child,

615
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,940
that it'll do the right thing,

616
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,169
but it doesn't always.

617
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,330
Sometimes it does the opposite.

618
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,566
I was betrayed and abandoned

619
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,300
by the people that I was
supposed to trust blindly.

620
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,041
When I fought back, they called me a liar.

621
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,290
No one tells you what
you're supposed to do then.

622
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,563
When you're all alone,

623
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,260
you have to take matters
into your own hands.

624
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,180
If you understand that,
you understand everything.

625
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,568
I always tried to do the right thing...

626
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,320
Even if it was an impossible decision.

627
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,730
Hey.

628
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,740
You okay?

629
00:45:46,668 --> 00:45:48,139
Yeah.

630
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,900
What is that?

631
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,527
It's Adderall, Klonopin, Vicodin.

632
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,970
Can I have one?

633
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,091
I hate feeling trapped.

634
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,367
I'd never want to trap you.

635
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,571
You can tell me whatever you want.

636
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,643
You know that, right?

637
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,484
I know.

638
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,646
Choke me.

639
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,968
Now?

640
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,205
Yeah.

641
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,528
I don't... I just...

642
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,283
I don't really feel like that now.

643
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,720
Hey.

644
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,605
I don't want you to do anything
that you don't want to do.

645
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,321
Come here. Come back.

646
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,820
I just feel at home with you, so...

647
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,940
I just don't wanna have to pretend, or...

648
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,568
And I don't want you
to have to pretend anything.

649
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,300
- Just like that?
- Yeah, squeeze.

650
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,980
Here?

651
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,004
Harder. Harder.

652
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,180
You can't go harder?

653
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,260
I'm trying.

654
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,242
I mean, look. Come here.

655
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,691
Put your hands there.

656
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,300
- Yeah?
- All right.

657
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,020
- Like that?
- Yeah.

658
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:54,940
Okay. Now I want you
to press as hard as you can.

659
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,220
It's okay. Just let it out.

660
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,721
Everything he did to you,
I want you to take it out.

661
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,260
Just take it out on me, right now. Do it.

662
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,600
Do it harder.

663
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,980
Harder. Harder.

664
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,457
Harder.

665
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,810
Stephen! Stephen!

666
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,060
Stephen, wake up!

667
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,380
Stephen!

668
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,846
Stephen, please, wake up!

669
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,680
Stephen!

670
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,611
Oh, my God.

671
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,890
- Oh, my God!
- Are you okay?

672
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,491
I love you.

673
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,364
- What'd you say?
- I love you.

674
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,780
What?

675
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,884
- I can't do this.
- It's okay.

676
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,140
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

677
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,820
- Stephen, I can't do this!
- It's okay.

678
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,700
Steven.

679
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,860
Please, you have to stop calling me.

680
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,140
I don't wanna talk to you.

681
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,164
I mean it. Bye.

682
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,700
Steve, I just had a meeting
with your publisher,

683
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,100
maybe you remember them.

684
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,180
We waited three hours... for you.

685
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,820
Um, the bottom line is,

686
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,940
Penguin does not want this true crime
bullshit, like I told you,

687
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,380
and they're pulling out
of the original project, too.

688
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,180
- Oh, fuck!
- You have seven days

689
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,660
to return the advance, and there's
nothing else I can do.

690
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,220
- Fuck!
- And you need a new editor

691
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,300
because you no longer have one.

692
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,300
I really hope you're able
to get your shit together.

693
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,845
Fuck you!

694
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,091
Hey, it's Josh, where are you?

695
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,260
I'm trying to save your seat,
but these people are crazy. Call me.

696
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,328
Shit!

697
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,620
Have you reached a verdict?

698
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,245
We have, Your Honor.

699
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,846
The defendant will rise.

700
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,860
Proceed.

701
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,500
We the jury find the defendant

702
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,126
guilty of murder in the first degree.

703
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,620
We, the jury, find the defendant

704
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,460
guilty of murder in the first degree.

705
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,260
On or about December 1st...

706
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,842
- Hey, can I watch this?
- Yeah, sure.

707
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:15,860
Bailiff, remove Mr. Reiser
from the courtroom, please. Thank you.

708
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,371
Wait, take your hands off me. Wait!

709
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:21,340
I just wanted to say that I was
the best father that I knew how to be.

710
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,620
I only tried to protect my children!

711
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,220
Take your hands off me!

712
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,540
I wanted to be the best father
that I could be!

713
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,483
Thanks.

714
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,300
Oh, wow! Remember this?

715
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,620
Oh!

716
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,060
- Remember that Mustang?
- Yep.

717
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,970
- Shit, that was an awesome car!
- Yeah.

718
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,900
"Neil Elliott graduated
from the University of Natal.

719
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,780
Served as an airborne meteorologist
with the South African Air Force,

720
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,740
worked as a geologist for two years

721
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,569
before immigrating to the United States."

722
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,287
What the fuck is this?

723
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,660
Guess he wrote a few books
before I was born.

724
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,340
You know what Hans said after the verdict?

725
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,204
After the verdict?

726
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,860
"I tried to be the best father
I knew how to be."

727
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,340
That's exactly what my dad fucking said.

728
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,568
I mean, can you fucking believe that?

729
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,207
I meant to tell you, I saw your dad
the other day at the hospital,

730
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,780
when I was making my rounds.

731
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,740
Why was he at the hospital?

732
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,604
I don't know, but he was.

733
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,100
My dad and Hans are fucking delusional.

734
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,860
"The best father I knew how to be"...

735
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,328
What the fuck, like it was
all my fault? All this?

736
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,620
- What?
- I thought the whole point

737
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,820
of the Hans thing, of the trial,
of all that

738
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,860
was so that you could write
about something different.

739
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,580
So what? Back to me.

740
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,980
You know what he fucking said?

741
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,380
I didn't have the right context.

742
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,960
The right fucking context?

743
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,620
He said I terrorized his new family.

744
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,803
- Terrorized!
- Terrorized is a bad word.

745
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,300
It's not a good word.

746
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,528
Oh, you think there's a better
word that describes it?

747
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,300
No. I'm saying I've been...
I've, I've thought about it.

748
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,980
I don't have a good feeling about it.

749
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,020
I feel like maybe we fucked his kids up.

750
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,740
Are you serious? How?

751
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,660
Because they saw us
so out of control all the time.

752
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,540
- We weren't out of control.
- Yeah, we were.

753
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,928
No, we weren't. Name one time.

754
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,524
Want me to name one time?

755
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,860
How about that... one time?

756
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,660
When you totaled his Mustang
in front of the kids.

757
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,060
Now that had to be terrifying for them.

758
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,140
Are you seriously trying to
make me feel bad about that?

759
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,460
No. All right?

760
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,769
You get the award for the
shittiest father ever, right?

761
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,660
But now you can see him from a whole
new perspective, if you want to,

762
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,340
from an adult perspective,
like a real adult.

763
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,860
A real adult, like Roger?
That would be better?

764
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,291
I didn't say it would be better.

765
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,620
- Oh.
- I didn't say that.

766
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:00,700
What did you say?
That we both started in the same place

767
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,180
and I ended up here and you ended up...

768
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,140
what, getting everything good?
A wife, kids, all that?

769
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,660
Yeah, hell yeah.

770
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,620
Yeah, I like being a father. I like it.

771
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,580
Well, your dick works. That's great.

772
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,780
Congratulations, man.
You're living the fucking dream.

773
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,660
How about fuck you, Stephen?
How about that?

774
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,660
'Cause every time
you get in some shitty little way,

775
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,286
you just grab me and try to drag me
right through it, so fuck you.

776
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,284
Oh, man. You know what?
You wanted to be a rock star

777
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,331
and now you fucking buy Happy Meals.

778
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,283
I mean, they're gonna name
mountains after you...

779
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,020
fucking Mount I-Played-It-Fucking-Safe.

780
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,380
Look at you.
You're exactly like your fucking father.

781
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,620
Exactly like him! You're sitting here,
you're pouting and whining.

782
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,180
You're fucking spinning out,
and you're destroying your own life,

783
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,009
and it's everybody else's fucking fault.

784
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,460
So fuck you, man, and don't come around
my family anymore either.

785
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,780
I don't want you
coming around them no more.

786
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,480
Oh, seriously?
I don't wanna be around your...

787
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,684
...fucking family.

788
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:52,767
The charge is knocked down to
Murder II, with chance of parole.

789
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,360
If you produce a body, you have a deal.

790
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:00,241
Murder II, no chance of parole.

791
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:06,700
I didn't want to kill Nina, but I did.

792
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,060
She was leaving me for another man.

793
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,209
I was devastated, lost control.

794
00:59:18,161 --> 00:59:20,442
She said...

795
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,642
she had never loved me.

796
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:31,408
That she only married me to escape Russia.

797
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,724
I took her neck in my hands...

798
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,086
...and I crushed it until
I felt her throat collapse.

799
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,900
That was it.

800
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,180
All the anger, all the hatred.

801
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,806
There was just silence.

802
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,060
Lana, can I talk to you?

803
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,020
Hey.

804
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,600
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Don't touch me!

805
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,964
Can I please just... Please?

806
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,340
Talk to Roger
if you need someone to talk to.

807
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,620
Well, he's not answering my calls either.

808
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,140
Please? I feel like I'm about
to go underwater, okay?

809
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,130
Can I just... please talk to you...

810
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,402
Please?

811
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,340
You're the only person that's made me
feel okay about myself

812
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,808
in my entire adult life
and I feel like I know you.

813
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,646
From the first second
I met you, I felt that.

814
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,020
I know it feels that way,

815
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,260
- but maybe that's not a good thing.
- Why?

816
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,931
Because you're gonna
take me down with you.

817
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,860
It's just who you are.

818
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,486
Look, I'm fucked up, okay?

819
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,820
- Come on!
- You knew that!

820
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,580
Is that gonna be your excuse
for the rest of your life?

821
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,580
That you're too broken not
to be completely selfish?

822
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,966
Grow some fucking balls!

823
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,060
At least I'm not pretending
nothing's wrong with me.

824
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,700
Oh, you're pretending plenty.

825
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,370
You just don't see it.

826
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,820
Here's those papers you wanted.

827
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,002
They're pretty enlightening.

828
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,886
Fuck.

829
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,260
There we go. Okay, you ready for a ride?

830
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,600
Hop on my back.

831
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,610
Come on, man.
See if you can stay on. You ready?

832
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,740
You gotta hold on.
Put your legs around me.

833
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,700
- Hold tight. Ready?
- Yeah!

834
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,664
Yeah?

835
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,900
You're the one who should be
in front of the camera.

836
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,764
What are you doing, hiding back there?

837
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,162
There she is, ladies and gentlemen,

838
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,340
the most beautiful woman in the world.

839
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,046
- Just like out of a fairytale.
- Aw, stop.

840
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,525
Do you remember her like that?

841
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,765
Not much.

842
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,380
She really was the most
beautiful woman I ever saw.

843
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,720
Wave to Daddy.

844
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:06,640
I was your age then,
right before we went to Chicago,

845
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,060
and when she died...

846
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,689
Man, I was so confused,
I couldn't stop screaming.

847
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,165
Yeah, I remember.

848
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,580
You want coffee?

849
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,500
- What?
- Coffee.

850
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,841
No! Wh... what the fuck are you doing?

851
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,860
- Just waiting.
- No.

852
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,180
Dad, you broke into my house.

853
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,930
What the fuck?

854
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:40,500
Well, I wanted to give you something.

855
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,490
Jesus. I can't... I can't deal
with this right now.

856
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,201
I'm trying to apologize to you...

857
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,300
...before it's too late.

858
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,140
What does that mean?

859
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,780
I had a bunch of tests done.

860
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,060
I'm dying.

861
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,685
Don't fucking lie to me!

862
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,320
Will you just fucking listen to me?

863
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,283
I'm a sick man.

864
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,100
I wanted to come see you,
make amends with my son.

865
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,620
- Amends?
- Yeah.

866
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,131
What amends are you making?

867
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:15,010
You're such a martyr.
God, you always have been.

868
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:18,060
What kid is like that?
Think the world owes you something.

869
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,060
- Look, Dad, I'm exhausted.
- You're exhausted?

870
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,020
A lot of people look at your life
and think it would be pretty good.

871
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,260
You know? The New York Times
reviews, pretty girls,

872
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,340
everybody kissing your ass
to be around a hot shit writer.

873
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,460
Well, I can kiss all that good-bye
'cause everything good in my life

874
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,940
just disappeared as soon as you showed up!

875
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,520
You wanna blame me? That's easy.

876
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,900
And what are all the good things
in your life that fell apart?

877
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,220
What do they all have in common?

878
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,820
- Here we go!
- Yeah, you!

879
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,860
I mean, you're a fucking curse.

880
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,180
You're poison.

881
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,487
You know, everything you touch,
you fuck up.

882
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,601
Just get out of my house!

883
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,410
All right.

884
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,220
- Look, I made this for you.
- Get out!

885
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,846
- Just promise me that you'll look at it.
- Get out!

886
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,900
- You just need to see for yourself.
- Get out of my house!

887
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,420
I will get out of your house, but you
just see for yourself, all right?

888
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,330
- You have to hear me out.
- I don't fucking have to look at it!

889
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,570
You fucking hit your father.

890
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,020
- What, you wanna fight me, boy?
- I won't fucking fight an old man!

891
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,361
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to? I'll ruin you!

892
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,763
Come on. Huh? Come on! Fucking pussy.

893
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,700
Huh? You fucking faggot!

894
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,930
Huh? You waste of a life! Come on, hit me!

895
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,620
You wanna kill me so bad,
hit me! Come on! Hit me!

896
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,420
I deserve it! Come on! Hit me, hit me!

897
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,651
Hit me! Hit me! Come on! Hit me!

898
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,926
Oh, fuck!

899
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,620
- Fuck you!
- Call 911.

900
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:50,180
Oh, fuck you! I'm not fucking buying it!

901
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,124
Ah, Stephen!

902
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,900
All right, all right,
all right, all right....

903
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,801
I'm a terrible father.
I'm a terrible father...

904
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,621
Okay...

905
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,620
Hi, Stephen.

906
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,100
I... I don't know
if I'm ever gonna, you know,

907
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:01,180
get a chance to see you again,
and even if I do,

908
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,700
we were never so good
at communicating, so...

909
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,020
Well, there are some things
I wanna tell you, so...

910
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:10,140
that's why I'm doing this.

911
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,620
You know, that story you tell

912
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:16,580
about the time I shaved your head
and I restrained you,

913
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,923
was actually two different times.

914
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:25,300
The first time,
you were squatting at the house.

915
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,660
It had been empty for a year,

916
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:32,970
and I needed that money so badly.

917
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,900
I finally found a buyer,

918
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,060
and I had to show the house once more
before the deal closed.

919
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:44,420
I got there, and you trashed the place.

920
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,444
Thousands of dollars in damage,

921
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:52,660
and I was so angry that
I hit you and I cut your hair.

922
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:57,460
You know, afterwards you were
crying in the bathtub.

923
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,403
It was really horrible.

924
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,282
The second time...

925
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,380
...I did it to try to stop you
from killing yourself.

926
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,900
You were living on the street

927
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,300
and I came upon you
sitting outside the arcade,

928
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,900
and I asked you what was up, you know,
what your plans were,

929
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,401
and you said, "Well, I guess,
I'll just commit suicide."

930
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,740
I had to go to work,

931
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,220
and I didn't know what the hell to do.

932
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,449
I took you back to the empty house
and then you really got out of control.

933
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,340
You know, you were trying
to cut your wrists open,

934
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,660
so I... I handcuffed you
to this radiator pipe

935
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,660
while I tried to, you know,
reach my own decision

936
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:49,448
whether to call the cops
or if that would put you in jail.

937
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,500
30 minutes later, I came back to check
on you and you were hanging there,

938
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:00,340
passed out in a puddle of blood
at your feet,

939
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,780
and I thought you were dead.

940
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,930
It was like a bolt of lightning
hit my heart.

941
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:13,807
I just couldn't bear the thought
of living knowing what I'd done to you.

942
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:23,042
Part of me... I don't think
ever came back from that moment.

943
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,940
I took the handcuffs off you and I said,

944
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,407
"You do whatever you wanna do, son."

945
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,926
You didn't want anything to do with me.

946
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,530
I can't blame you for that.

947
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:42,131
I keep trying to apologize to you,

948
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,641
but it all goes wrong.

949
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,766
Maybe there just isn't a way to make
amends for something like this.

950
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,980
And not that it matters,
but honestly, I...

951
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,447
I only ever tried to do right by you.

952
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,121
I'm a broken man,

953
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,620
and I just...

954
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,722
I hope you won't be like me.

955
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,854
Fuck.

956
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,780
Could you ask me some questions?

957
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,963
I'm not good at making speeches.

958
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:53,164
Did you think you had
a chance at a better verdict?

959
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:56,380
Look, I knew I wasn't
gonna get away with it.

960
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,540
I mean, I looked guilty,

961
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,940
I am guilty,

962
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:07,843
but a father does what he has to do
in order to protect his children.

963
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,820
Okay. Um...

964
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,940
If you knew that you weren't
going for innocence,

965
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:17,580
then why didn't you just plead guilty
in the beginning and get a deal?

966
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:20,500
I mean, I heard DuBois
made a deal for seven years

967
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,170
because the DA didn't wanna go to court.

968
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,740
But who would've cared?

969
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,340
I had the most publicized trial in years.

970
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:30,460
Would you be interested in following the
story of a murderer who took a plea bargain?

971
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,211
But I thought you said
you did it for your children.

972
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,820
I did. Everything I've ever done
was for them.

973
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,891
But you insured that
you would never see them again.

974
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,968
I mean, they're not gonna have a father.
I don't...

975
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,248
I don't know.
I don't know what to tell you.

976
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,820
Validation is a hell of a drug.

977
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,363
What? What's funny?

978
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,401
Just the truth's a motherfucker.

979
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,610
Thanks. I'll see you.

980
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,500
So you wrote all that in two days?

981
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,331
Yeah, I mean, I put it
down on paper in two days, but...

982
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,500
I mean, this is the book that I've...
I've been wanting to write.

983
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,286
I just didn't know that until...
until now.

984
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,900
So let's find you a publisher.

985
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,288
It's not going to be Penguin, but...

986
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:36,370
I've got a friend at Grey Wolf
I think would be into this idea.

987
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:41,811
It won't be a big advance,
but something to get us back on track.

988
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,371
Us?

989
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,609
Us.

990
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,926
Hey.

991
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,611
Brought you some coffee.

992
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,288
I'm in no mood, Elliott.

993
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,180
That was your decaf.

994
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,760
You can have my coffee, if you want.

995
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,260
I also brought you some blueberries.

996
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,887
So many gifts and so few actual apologies.

997
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,286
I don't know where to start.

998
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,725
Start with the hydrangeas.

999
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,260
And for the record... no.

1000
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:49,091
It's not my life's plan
to be watering these things...

1001
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:54,323
feed them bone meal so they stay blue.

1002
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,851
She loves it, so...

1003
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,900
I'd be doing this if I had the chance.

1004
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,729
I'd be doing all of this.

1005
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,685
Sorry, Roger.

1006
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,180
I'm a pretty shitty person.

1007
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,884
No, you're not.

1008
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,200
But you're my family.

1009
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:24,220
You... you knew me when I was
the messiest kid out of all of us.

1010
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:27,860
You never gave me any grief
about that, not once.

1011
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,884
You kept showing up for me, so...

1012
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:36,887
I'm not gonna walk away
from this over a few words.

1013
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,490
You wanna go for a ride?

1014
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,331
You're all wet.

1015
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,521
Yeah. We can even that up.

1016
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,380
- Bitch. Bitch.
- Sorry, it just slipped.

1017
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,900
- Oh, that slipped?
- Yeah.

1018
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,764
Motherfucker! What are you doing, dude?

1019
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,564
Don't, don't, don't, don't!

1020
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,460
Nina's mother Christina says

1021
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,220
she is relieved the children may come
to some sense of closure...

1022
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:10,220
- What time is it?
- ...and move forward with their lives.

1023
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,180
We have about an hour.
Your flight's at 6:00.

1024
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,500
We should pull the rental car around.

1025
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,860
I already did.

1026
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,700
- You know you're not driving.
- Oh, great!

1027
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,460
You can kill us both.

1028
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,260
You remember when you taught me to drive?

1029
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,100
I was 14.

1030
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,761
You let me drive out to Warren Park
in the '69 Mustang.

1031
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,980
I loved that car.

1032
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,020
You used to take me out, let me drive.

1033
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:45,860
I remember feeling so happy and free,

1034
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,180
full of hope and potential.

1035
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:53,420
I don't know why you always told people
I taught you to drive in the Mustang.

1036
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:58,780
It was a red 1968
Oldsmobile Delmont convertible,

1037
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,020
in Warren Park, in the parking lot.

1038
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:06,420
You were belligerent
and you were a terrible driver.

1039
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,931
So we only did it once.

1040
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,420
Wanna go for a drive?
I don't wanna sit here for an hour.

1041
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,260
Nah, we'd just argue.

1042
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,860
Fine. Then we'll just go.

1043
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,780
We'll agree not to talk.
It doesn't matter.

1044
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,220
None of it matters.

1045
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:24,420
All right. You gotta help me up here.

1046
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,363
Help your old dad get up.
