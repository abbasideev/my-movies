00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,759
<i>Hello, Mr. Hindle,</i>

2
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:39,395
<i>or as they called you
around the hospital, Zepp.</i>

3
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:46,908
Game over!

4
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:44,896
Check it, man.

5
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,509
What the fuck is this?

6
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,050
What the fuck are you doing here?

7
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:17,959
What the fuck are you doing here?

8
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:20,293
I'm fucking stuck.

9
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,217
Yeah, me too.

10
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:24,693
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God.

11
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,099
Somebody, help us.

12
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,370
- Hello.
- Come on, help us!

13
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:33,212
Oh, my God!

14
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,816
Dina.

15
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,067
Brad.

16
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,012
- Ryan?
- Baby, are you okay?

17
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,285
- Get me out of here!
- Baby.

18
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,859
Help us. Somebody help us!

19
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:50,719
Hey! Call the police!

20
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,422
Hey, break the glass with your case.

21
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,693
Break the fucking glass! Do it.

22
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,324
Stay back!

23
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,039
Do it!

24
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,366
- Get me out of here.
- Break it!

25
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:08,396
<i>Hello, Brad.</i>

26
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,609
<i>Hello, Ryan. I'd like to play a game.</i>

27
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,777
<i>The same woman
has played each of you for a fool,</i>

28
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,019
<i>manipulating your love for her,
and causing nothing but pain.</i>

29
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:27,191
<i>Her fun and games pushed you both to
break the law to fulfill her material needs.</i>

30
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:28,883
<i>She is toxic,</i>

31
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:33,932
<i>and today all of your transgressions
will be made public.</i>

32
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,564
He's fucking lying, Brad.

33
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:39,668
<i>Now you must choose who
will drop out of this triangle,</i>

34
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,078
<i>for within 60 seconds one of you must die.</i>

35
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,650
<i>If you wish to save her,
then the saws must be pushed</i>

36
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:50,551
<i>all the way to one side or the other,</i>

37
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:55,457
<i>sparing her while proving for good
who is indeed the alpha male.</i>

38
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,155
What are you fucking staring at,
you motherfuckers?

39
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,459
- Do something!
- <i>Are you both strong enough</i>

40
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,296
<i>to walk away from what is destroying you,</i>

41
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:07,168
<i>or will you fight one more time
for the heart that binds?</i>

42
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,135
<i>You have 60 seconds to decide.</i>

43
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,976
<i>Live or die. Make your choice.</i>

44
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:17,198
Oh, fuck!

45
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,282
One of you save me!

46
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,667
What the fuck are you doing?

47
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,464
It's me or you asshole,
and it sure as shit isn't gonna be me.

48
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,801
Brad. Brad.

49
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,013
Brad, I love you.

50
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,450
I love you too, baby.

51
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:59,654
Do it. You gotta do it.

52
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,590
- What?
- You gotta kill him, Brad.

53
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:03,789
- Do it!
- Stupid bitch!

54
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,330
Do it. Do it! Do it!

55
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,227
Aw, Fuck!

56
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:23,364
You love him?

57
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,810
No, no.

58
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,350
You love him more than me?

59
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,653
No, I had to say that.

60
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,716
I've always loved you.

61
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,355
You got to do it for me, please.

62
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,284
You got to kill him. Kill Brad! Do it!

63
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,827
You lying slut!

64
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,330
What the fuck are you doing?

65
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,584
You don't love anybody!

66
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,968
You're a cheat and a liar. Fuck you!

67
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,300
Fuck you!

68
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,237
Brad! Brad, look at me!

69
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,703
Is the chick that fucked me in your bed
two days ago worth one of our lives?

70
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,279
She's not worth it, man. She's not worth it.

71
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,085
Right?

72
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,337
Yeah!

73
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:04,722
What are you doing, you fucking asshole?

74
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,049
I think we're breaking up with you, Dina.

75
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,059
No! No, stop!

76
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:21,105
- Stand aside!
- Move it!

77
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,974
People, get out of the way.

78
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,433
Somebody help her.

79
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,697
Game over.

80
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,198
No! No, you fucking bitch!

81
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,017
No!

82
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,072
<i>Tonight, a house of horrors
has been discovered</i>

83
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:10,505
<i>at what used to be known
as the Rowan Zoological Institute.</i>

84
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:14,943
<i>The body of Umbrella Health CEO
William Easton has been identified</i>

85
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,483
<i>as one of the several victims
of this grizzly crime scene.</i>

86
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,882
<i>However, we have also been
informed that there may be</i>

87
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:24,285
<i>as many as seven survivors
from this deadly event.</i>

88
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,551
<i>Hopefully the many questions
of the local police,</i>

89
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,958
<i>the FBI, and the victims'
family members may be answered</i>

90
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,189
<i>by those seven civilians lucky enough</i>

91
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,562
<i>to walk away from
this unprecedented display</i>

92
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,692
<i>of carnage with their lives.</i>

93
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:41,239
<i>We now go live to Tony Gabrielson
who is reporting from the scene. Tony.</i>

94
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,171
- Hey, man.
- Hey, what's up?

95
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,151
- What have we got here?
- That's Jill Tuck, Jigsaw's widow.

96
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,403
What does she want?

97
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:57,352
All she said was that
she didn't trust the FBI,

98
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,354
- and she didn't trust homicide.
- Good.

99
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,219
And she just wants to talk to you.

100
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,292
- Why me?
- I don't know. Only you, though.

101
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,561
Jeez, she looks
crazier than a sack full of cats.

102
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,109
All right, let's get this over with.

103
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,574
Hey. I put cream and sugar in it.

104
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,419
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

105
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,955
I'm Matt Gibson, internal affairs.

106
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,458
My colleague said that you
wanted to speak with me.

107
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,710
Yes.

108
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:38,988
But I need complete immunity.

109
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,059
Why do you want immunity, Miss Tuck?

110
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,702
Because of what I know.

111
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,840
Which is what?

112
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,005
Do we have a deal?

113
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:56,813
You've got to give before you can receive
in this house, Jill.

114
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,710
My husband John, he had an accomplice.

115
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,420
A person who assisted him
with almost every murder.

116
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,924
Look, don't get me wrong.

117
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:12,088
I'm all ears if you've got something legit
that you want to put on the table.

118
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,596
This person will go on killing
until he's stopped.

119
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:20,794
- You know him and he definitely knows you.
- Is that right?

120
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,601
He's detective Mark Hoffman.

121
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,376
Are you willing to sign a sworn affidavit?

122
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,297
Yes.

123
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:30,977
You swear to be totally open?

124
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,847
You tell me everything,
no matter how personal or private?

125
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:35,102
Yes.

126
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,182
I'll give you evidence, whatever you want,

127
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:43,025
as long as I have your protection,
and complete immunity.

128
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,420
Do we have a deal?

129
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,897
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we have a deal.

130
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,228
<i>Welcome back!</i>

131
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,399
We're live with Bobby Dagen
whose national tour

132
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,307
<i>S.U.R.V.I.V.E.
My Story of Overcoming Jigsaw</i>

133
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,505
rolls into town this weekend.

134
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,879
Well, you're quite the national phenomenon
these days, aren't you?

135
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,383
Well, thank you, ma'am.

136
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,320
It's quite flattering how many people
have responded to my story.

137
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:49,451
And if I can help a few people
along the way, then I'm pleased.

138
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:53,930
Now, you survived a trap created
by the infamous Jigsaw killer, correct?

139
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,300
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,892
Well, everyone must ask you this question.
What was that like?

141
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,865
Life changing.

142
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,136
It was something I never anticipated

143
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,838
and, quite honestly, something
that should have killed me.

144
00:14:07,946 --> 00:14:11,575
Tell me more.
Tell me about the actual experience.

145
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:14,618
I actually have no recollection
of how I got there.

146
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,313
I just remember the feeling

147
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:19,720
of waking up trapped.

148
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,620
And I had to insert two hooks
into my pectoral muscles

149
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,220
and hoist myself up to a platform.

150
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:27,628
You put the hooks in yourself?

151
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,417
I did.

152
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,637
I pretty much realized
that I couldn't hold on much longer,

153
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,439
and I had to accept the fact
that I was going to die.

154
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,739
And then I saw something,

155
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,336
and what I saw was my life.

156
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,713
It was a tragedy. I achieved nothing.

157
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,248
And right then,
something inside me started to grow,

158
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,893
something from the bottom of my soul.

159
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,930
And I just... I decided to live.

160
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,900
I found a strength that I thought
had long since expired.

161
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,732
And I just yanked, and I yanked!

162
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:10,035
And when I got to the top,
I just ripped the hooks out of my chest.

163
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:13,908
There was blood everywhere,
and I just screamed.

164
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:17,573
I just sat there and screamed.

165
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,413
Because I hadn't just survived,

166
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,248
I was reborn.

167
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:24,312
This was my life.

168
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,597
Wow. Bobby Dagen, everyone.

169
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:35,766
Bobby's life-changing
experience comes to the...

170
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:37,494
This is the moment.

171
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:40,131
- Where's the big kiss?
- I don't know.

172
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,706
Tickets are still available.

173
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,698
And we're out, folks.

174
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:46,405
- That's not the way it's supposed to be.
- You need to relax.

175
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:47,944
No, we rehearsed it differently.

176
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,283
It's okay. Nice work, Bobby.

177
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,277
Ladies, can you excuse us for a minute?

178
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,156
Where was the big finish, Bobby?

179
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,782
You tell your story,
you thank your pretty wife,

180
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:02,154
you bring her out for a big hug and kiss.

181
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,819
I just didn't want to push it, all right?

182
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,692
Okay, but that's the heart of the story.

183
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,158
She was there for your whole recovery.

184
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,929
And without the acknowledgment,
without the kiss,

185
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,334
the audience isn't gonna have any kind
of emotional connection.

186
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:14,405
I disagree.

187
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,303
Too much emotion,
and it's gonna feel like pandering.

188
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,467
Okay, why don't you let me
do the public relations,

189
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,703
and you do the legal paperwork, okay?

190
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:22,575
Okay, I get it, Suzanne, all right?
It's my fault.

191
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,047
It wasn't your fault, Bobby.

192
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,640
You were fine.

193
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,515
- Just remember your bullet points next time.
- I will.

194
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,917
These interviews are important.

195
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,785
Nina, relax.

196
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,040
Don't worry about them.

197
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,656
You were great.

198
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,988
Yeah?

199
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:38,062
Your story's real and people feel that.

200
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:43,959
I know that you get overwhelmed at times,
but we have to keep moving forward, Bobby.

201
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,206
You were meant to do this.

202
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,578
I know. I know, baby.

203
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,644
- Bobby.
- Yeah?

204
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:59,444
We got the Jigsaw survivor group tomorrow.

205
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,348
Thirty minutes of face time
with other survivors.

206
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,444
Yeah, sounds good.

207
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:07,252
- Nothing more exciting than that.
- No, not much. Let's go.

208
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,453
Oh, God!

209
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,103
You want to know the only thing wrong
with killing you, Jill?

210
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,373
I can only do it once.

211
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,569
Oh, my God!

212
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:20,948
No!

213
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:50,184
Help me! Help me!

214
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,759
Help! Fuck!

215
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:57,429
<i>Hello, Evan.
I want to play a game.</i>

216
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:01,165
<i>The situation you find yourself in
is of your own doing.</i>

217
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:05,676
<i>You, your girlfriend,
and your friends are all racists.</i>

218
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,146
Evan, you fuck. You get me out of here!

219
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:13,449
<i>You have intimidated others
based on their physical differences.</i>

220
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,817
<i>But today it is you who will run scared.</i>

221
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:21,018
<i>Your pathetic friends
follow your every word, Evan.</i>

222
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:27,326
<i>Therefore you will be the only one capable
of saving them and yourself.</i>

223
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,495
<i>In 30 seconds,
the jacks holding up this car will fall,</i>

224
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,140
<i>setting off a deadly chain of events.</i>

225
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,370
<i>In order to stop this from happening,</i>

226
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:45,815
<i>you must tear yourself away
from the seat to which you are glued.</i>

227
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:51,253
<i>Then you must pull the red lever before you.
But no act comes without a sacrifice.</i>

228
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,591
<i>You've judged others
by the color of their skin,</i>

229
00:19:54,693 --> 00:20:01,064
<i>and today, Evan, you will learn that
we are all the same color on the inside.</i>

230
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,469
<i>Live or die, Evan, the choice is yours.</i>

231
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,134
No!

232
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:18,808
- Evan, help!
- I can't.

233
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,613
- Do it. Fuck!
- Fucking do it!

234
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,212
Just fucking do it!

235
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:27,188
Do it! Do it, man!

236
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,442
Here I go!

237
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,331
Evan!

238
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:38,299
Baby, get me out of here!

239
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,600
Shit! Fuck! Here I go!

240
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:43,333
Here I go! Come on!

241
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:44,669
Fuck me!

242
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:50,776
Please!

243
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,455
- God!
- Do it! Fucking do it!

244
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,427
- God!
- Do it!

245
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:09,026
- Evan!
- You got us into this.

246
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,692
Get us the fuck out!

247
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,936
Do it!

248
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,071
You fucking pussy!

249
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:32,156
Shit.

250
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:03,038
Every night.

251
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:08,219
I keep thinking that things will get better

252
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:12,153
the next morning when I wake up.

253
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:13,696
But it isn't.

254
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,396
Everything I do,

255
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,572
everything I see, I'm surrounded by these

256
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:24,670
tiny triggers.

257
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,508
They're everywhere,

258
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,942
and they remind me of what I went through,

259
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,376
what Jigsaw did to me.

260
00:22:33,284 --> 00:22:36,310
Sidney, go on, please. You're...

261
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,981
You're in a safe place now.

262
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,523
Tell me what happened next.

263
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,493
Alex! Stop, please! Stop it!

264
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,810
Sidney, look at me.

265
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,777
You made a decision.

266
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,282
How did that make you feel?

267
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,838
Free.

268
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:14,486
He was abusive.

269
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,756
I tried to stop it before,

270
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,390
but it wasn't until that moment

271
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:22,793
that I really did something.

272
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,762
It was him or me, and I chose to live.

273
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:28,839
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

274
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:33,610
That's a bunch of bullshit.

275
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,145
He had to die for you to leave him?

276
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:42,646
You want to know
the best thing that happened to me

277
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,984
after having to cut off my own arm?

278
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,627
It's handicapped parking at the damn mall!

279
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,128
What the hell is a camera here for anyway?

280
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,739
I am simply here to illustrate the fact
that a traumatic experience,

281
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:09,302
such as the kind that each one of us
has been forced to endure,

282
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:12,144
can have a positive outcome. That's all.

283
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,115
Yeah? Like what?

284
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,012
A new perspective on life. Wait, wait, wait.

285
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:25,023
I know. I understand
that you're not at that place yet.

286
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:28,293
I understand that and I respect that.

287
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:29,991
But if you look around at all these people

288
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,367
taking their lives for granted,

289
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:37,508
eventually they all found something positive
from their experience.

290
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,043
We should never be ashamed
of what we've gone through,

291
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,875
because we are good and we are strong!

292
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:46,948
You know what?

293
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:50,646
I'd like everybody to have
a look at something right here.

294
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,050
These are my scars.

295
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,628
Because our minds will heal,

296
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:01,888
but these scars will never go away.

297
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:06,093
These scars should not be
a symbol of shame.

298
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,104
They should be worn as a badge of courage.

299
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:11,870
You know, earlier,

300
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:17,039
I spoke of valuing your loved ones.

301
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,815
But to be perfectly honest,

302
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,853
it's something that I never did
prior to my ordeal.

303
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,444
But since then,

304
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:29,489
I have found someone
who has truly become my rock.

305
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,880
Joyce, if you could...

306
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,383
Please.

307
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,330
It's my lovely wife Joyce.

308
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,541
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

309
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,185
Bravo.

310
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:02,249
To be able to sustain
such a traumatic experience,

311
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,626
and yet find the positive
in that grizzly act,

312
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:09,763
it's a remarkable feat indeed.

313
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,301
Remarkable,

314
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,634
if not a little perverse.

315
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,970
I'm sure I speak for everyone
here when I say

316
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,572
how grateful we are

317
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:31,188
to be part of your promotional DVD.

318
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:40,991
I appreciate it. Thank you. It's...

319
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,474
- I can take that, sir.
- Thank you very much.

320
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,304
Joyce, can I borrow him for a second?

321
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,707
Sure. I'll be in the car, okay?

322
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:54,971
Two minutes behind you.

323
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,307
- Great.
- You'll see her to the car, please, sir?

324
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,211
- Of course.
- Thank you.

325
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,710
What's up?

326
00:27:00,818 --> 00:27:03,309
So what's with the creepy guy with the
cane? Someone I should know about?

327
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,412
No, no, no. He's been at these meetings
longer than I have.

328
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:06,683
He's fine.

329
00:27:07,992 --> 00:27:09,142
All right.

330
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,761
Listen, get back to the hotel,
and get some rest, all right?

331
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,854
Yeah. Everything's fine.

332
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,649
Great work tonight, Bobby.

333
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,395
- Thank you.
- You're the man.

334
00:27:31,532 --> 00:27:33,034
Joyce?

335
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,387
What happened to him?

336
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,161
They always tell you not to smoke
at the gas station.

337
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:48,061
- This should wrap up the week for you.
- Great.

338
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:54,955
What's up, man?

339
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:57,574
I'm at a junkyard on 58th.

340
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:58,867
Why?

341
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,501
<i>Call came in about a car crash.</i>

342
00:28:00,611 --> 00:28:02,704
<i>Car crash? Why are you there?</i>

343
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,608
It's not just a car crash.

344
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:05,978
It's a trap.

345
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,642
How many bodies?

346
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:09,909
<i>Enough pieces to make four.</i>

347
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:13,013
Okay, get everyone away
from that crime scene till I get there.

348
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,921
- <i>Even Homicide, you got it?</i>
- Yeah.

349
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,493
All right, I'm on the way.

350
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,783
<i>Hello, Evan.
I want to play a game.</i>

351
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,758
<i>The situation you find yourself in...</i>

352
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,599
<i>You, your girlfriend...</i>

353
00:28:31,642 --> 00:28:37,171
<i>You have intimidated others
based on their physical differences.</i>

354
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,597
So, what do you think?

355
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,418
Why?

356
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:00,597
Why this display?

357
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,198
Why them? Why now?

358
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:05,801
You know he likes to put on a show.

359
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,810
Well, there's gotta be something else.

360
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:19,688
Bag the other bodies. Get them back
to the coroner's office right away.

361
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,021
We'll need them checked
for anything resembling a clue.

362
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:25,186
Tattoos, piercings, skin cuttings.

363
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:28,459
If that man has a cavity in his tooth,
I want to know about it.

364
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,794
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

365
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,095
Gibson.

366
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,002
Yeah?

367
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,031
Hoffman was expecting you.

368
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,694
God damn.

369
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,930
Would you look at that?

370
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,683
Please get forensics in here.

371
00:29:47,151 --> 00:29:48,812
Tell them to haul ass.

372
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,180
This needs to be dusted for prints.

373
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,488
- All right.
- Okay.

374
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,209
Help!

375
00:30:47,678 --> 00:30:48,828
<i>Hello, Bobby.</i>

376
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,710
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

377
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:56,312
<i>You have amassed wealth, fame,
and notoriety,</i>

378
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,218
<i>based upon your story of survival.</i>

379
00:30:59,323 --> 00:31:04,124
<i>Many have aided in your cause,
but few know the truth.</i>

380
00:31:04,228 --> 00:31:06,287
<i>You are a liar.</i>

381
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,195
<i>You and I both know
you have never been in a trap,</i>

382
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,666
<i>nor have you ever been tested.</i>

383
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:17,436
<i>Today these lies will come full circle
and you will learn</i>

384
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:22,470
<i>if you truly have what it takes
to call yourself a survivor.</i>

385
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,311
<i>The cage you find yourself in</i>

386
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,475
<i>will symbolize your rebirth.</i>

387
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,652
Joyce? No!

388
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:35,919
Joyce! No!

389
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,358
Please, no.

390
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,824
<i>Within the next 60 minutes,</i>

391
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,957
<i>you must stay upon the path of learning</i>

392
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,535
<i>and traverse a series of obstacles</i>

393
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:47,763
<i>to obtain access to your wife,</i>

394
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,806
<i>who you have also deceived.</i>

395
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,976
<i>If you fail to reach her
before the clock runs out,</i>

396
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,809
- <i>she will die.</i>
- No.

397
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,477
<i>Live or die, Bobby?</i>

398
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,946
<i>Make your choice.</i>

399
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:12,672
Bobby!

400
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,822
Help!

401
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,926
Help!

402
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,262
Let me out!

403
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,525
Bobby.

404
00:33:32,576 --> 00:33:36,808
Bobby! What's going on? What's going on?

405
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:40,175
<i>Another Jigsaw survivor has come forward.</i>

406
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,813
<i>As the city stays crippled in fear
from the Jigsaw killings,</i>

407
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,552
<i>chilling new words from
the latest survivor provide a reminder</i>

408
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:51,185
<i>of the physical and mental toll
these deadly games can take.</i>

409
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:55,892
<i>This horrible event was happening to me,</i>

410
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,167
<i>and in that moment,</i>

411
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:02,364
<i>that moment that this thing</i>

412
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,439
<i>threatened to take everything away,</i>

413
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:07,601
<i>even the pain,</i>

414
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,974
<i>I realized what I still had left to give.</i>

415
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:16,042
<i>And I didn't want to let that go.</i>

416
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:19,747
<i>It gave me light.</i>

417
00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:25,655
<i>That pure moment
of absolute horror gave me light.</i>

418
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:28,095
<i>And as wrong as this may seem,</i>

419
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:31,424
<i>I'm better for enduring it.</i>

420
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,231
<i>I'm stronger.</i>

421
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,499
<i>And, I must admit, I'm grateful for it.</i>

422
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:40,737
<i>I'm grateful it happened to me,</i>

423
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:44,178
<i>and I wish the same for everyone like me.</i>

424
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,448
<i>Joan is but one of a growing
number of citizens...</i>

425
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,612
If something like that doesn't get you
to change your perspective on life,

426
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,017
I don't know what will.

427
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,509
Yeah.

428
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:01,053
And if those people weren't so fucked up
after their games,

429
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,759
they'd make a mint selling their stories.

430
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,563
That's a real clever design.

431
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,034
Yours or your husband's?

432
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:17,905
- Everything was him.
- Right.

433
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:19,236
Well, here's my problem,

434
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,870
that was left for me,
and your fingerprints were all over it.

435
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:25,908
When you told me Hoffman had it in for you,

436
00:36:26,016 --> 00:36:28,814
you didn't mention that
it was because you tried to kill him.

437
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,722
There's a new game going on.

438
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,418
Does that surprise you?

439
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,190
- No.
- No? No?

440
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:42,627
You're crazy, you know that?

441
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,698
I knew you were crazy
the minute I laid eyes on you.

442
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:46,953
Crazy.

443
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:52,074
Okay, this is what we're gonna do, crazy.

444
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:55,807
Till I catch Mark Hoffman,
this is your new home.

445
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:57,764
Get comfy.

446
00:36:58,582 --> 00:37:00,311
What makes you think he can't find me here?

447
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:02,476
Jill, it's a safe house.

448
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:05,078
Safe house. Safe. House.

449
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,985
You get it?

450
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:14,323
Gibson, this was sent
here addressed to Jill.

451
00:37:14,324 --> 00:37:15,649
Hoffman knows our location.

452
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,152
God damn it. God damn it!

453
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:20,219
What?

454
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,635
We just had a small explosion here in a car
at the crime scene.

455
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,891
<i>Okay, is anyone hurt?</i>

456
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,273
Holy shit!

457
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:35,819
Rogers?

458
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,217
<i>Rogers, you okay?</i>

459
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,288
Yeah.

460
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,289
Get out of there.
You get the bomb squad to sweep the yard.

461
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,621
<i>Don't touch anything else until it's clean.</i>

462
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,151
- Got it.
- <i>All right.</i>

463
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,780
Play it.

464
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,188
<i>Hello, Gibson.</i>

465
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,437
<i>Been a long time.</i>

466
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,499
<i>What I want is simple,</i>

467
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,009
<i>give me Jill Tuck.</i>

468
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,341
<i>You're protecting her despite the fact</i>

469
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,005
<i>that she had direct knowledge throughout,</i>

470
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,017
<i>which makes her complicit in every death.</i>

471
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,579
<i>I'll make you a deal.</i>

472
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,156
<i>Give her to me,</i>

473
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,188
<i>the game stops, and no one else dies.</i>

474
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:20,853
<i>If not, everyone dies
and you'll be to blame.</i>

475
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:23,932
<i>Make your choice.</i>

476
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:25,524
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

477
00:38:28,505 --> 00:38:30,473
Let's get her down to the holding cell
at the station.

478
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,443
Lock it down.
No one gets in without my authority.

479
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:34,704
Got it.

480
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:54,447
Oh, my God.

481
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,022
Oh, God!

482
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,431
No! Please!

483
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,333
No! Please, help! Please!

484
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,005
Please, no!

485
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,405
God damn it!

486
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:08,468
Bobby. Bobby, help me!

487
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,513
You've got to get me out of here.

488
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,446
I can't move, Bobby.

489
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,079
Please, help me!

490
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:17,050
Okay, okay, okay. Just relax.

491
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,106
Ow.

492
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:22,341
Ow!

493
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,824
Help me! Do something!

494
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,396
Don't leave me.

495
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,496
<i>Hello, Bobby.</i>

496
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,730
<i>Before you
is one of your trusted colleagues.</i>

497
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:39,571
<i>She has been your publicist for years,
knowing your lies</i>

498
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,077
<i>but choosing to speak no evil.</i>

499
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:45,171
<i>She has been richly rewarded for her words,</i>

500
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:49,241
<i>but today she will be rewarded
for her silence.</i>

501
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:52,219
<i>In the X-ray, you will see a key,</i>

502
00:39:52,322 --> 00:39:57,123
<i>the key to Nina's survival,
which will shut off her device.</i>

503
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,689
<i>But there's a catch.</i>

504
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:01,822
<i>You have one minute
to pull the fish hook from her stomach,</i>

505
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,456
<i>and unlock her device</i>

506
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,004
<i>or else the four spikes
will penetrate her throat,</i>

507
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,767
- <i>silencing Nina forever.</i>
- Fuck!

508
00:40:10,874 --> 00:40:13,104
<i>Remember, the spikes will also advance</i>

509
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:18,170
<i>each time the decibel level in this room
rises above a whisper,</i>

510
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,113
<i>killing her even sooner.</i>

511
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:24,315
<i>Will Nina live or die, Bobby?
The choice is yours.</i>

512
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,384
- Help me. Help!
- No! No!

513
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,657
Just shut up.

514
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,757
Stay with me, okay?

515
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,924
Do it.

516
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,341
No. No. No.

517
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,646
Okay, stay with me. Stay with me.

518
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,313
It's gonna be okay. Look at me.

519
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,573
Look at me.

520
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,805
No! Nina, quiet. Nina.

521
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,430
Please. Please, for me.

522
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,168
Just shut the fuck up.

523
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,403
I'm gonna get this out.

524
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,916
No! No!

525
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,923
Just do it, Bobby. Just fucking do it.

526
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:09,675
Bobby!

527
00:42:27,644 --> 00:42:28,941
No!

528
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,612
Why wouldn't
you just shut the fuck up?

529
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:37,486
You just needed to shut up!

530
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,126
No! Oh, my God!

531
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,626
No! Help!

532
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:53,867
Help! Help!

533
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,204
Here you are, ma'am. Take care.

534
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,499
Ma'am, your name?

535
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:34,338
Sara, without an "H".

536
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,508
I just want to say I love your book so much.

537
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,847
I just felt like I could feel everything
that you went through.

538
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:44,113
I feel like it changed my life.

539
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,048
I appreciate that, ma'am.

540
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,657
I really do. Thank you.

541
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,689
Thank you.

542
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:01,935
Your name, sir?

543
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,189
John.

544
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,138
With an "H," without an "H,"
it doesn't matter.

545
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:09,678
We'll go with John with an "H" this time.

546
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,374
You got quite an army working for you here,
don't you?

547
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,944
Must be spreading a pretty good word.

548
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:18,351
Well, we try to reach as many
people as possible, you know?

549
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,616
You don't see anything wrong with that?

550
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:23,322
No.
No, sir, I don't.

551
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,458
You know,

552
00:44:29,866 --> 00:44:31,527
history is a passion for me.

553
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,799
And in ancient Egypt
if you were speaking under oath,

554
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,304
you were required to say,

555
00:44:36,406 --> 00:44:41,309
"If I'm lying, take me to the quarries."

556
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,648
That mean anything to you?

557
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,149
No, sir. No, sir, it doesn't.

558
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,617
Well, I'll tell you what it means.

559
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:54,248
It means if you knowingly lied
on the public record

560
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,694
that you were subject
to a period of enslavement.

561
00:44:57,794 --> 00:44:59,591
What are you implying here, sir?

562
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,254
I'm not implying anything.

563
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,060
Move along, buddy. He signed your book.

564
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:07,531
Thanks for the signature.

565
00:45:08,538 --> 00:45:11,029
Nice picture, but I don't need it.

566
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:13,406
We've met.

567
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,817
Adam, Gibson says he wants
you on these right away.

568
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:30,085
They're from the junkyard.

569
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,297
<i>Make your choice.</i>

570
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,201
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

571
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,987
See that?

572
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,389
Yeah.

573
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,271
I know that from somewhere.

574
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,906
Hey, I've got
something over here.

575
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:54,582
We might know who's in the game.
This was just sent to us.

576
00:45:54,684 --> 00:45:57,653
It was taken
from a security camera downtown.

577
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,415
The guy's name is Bobby Dagen.

578
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,673
- Familiar?
- No.

579
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:04,090
He's a Jigsaw survivor
who's milking it on talk shows.

580
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,155
His wife and handlers are also missing.

581
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:36,919
Joyce?

582
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:40,122
Who is it? Who's there?

583
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:42,195
- Suzanne.
- Who is that?

584
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,164
For fuck's sake, Bobby. Bobby.

585
00:46:44,734 --> 00:46:45,962
Bobby, get me out of here.

586
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,297
Bobby, help me.

587
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:49,463
- Is Cale here?
- Who the fuck knows?

588
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:52,667
Get this off of me, Bobby!
Get this off of me!

589
00:46:58,281 --> 00:46:59,339
<i>Hello, Bobby.</i>

590
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:03,476
<i>That feeling running
through your body is fear,</i>

591
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:07,546
<i>the fear of not knowing
if you have what it takes to survive.</i>

592
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:09,522
<i>Before you is your lawyer</i>

593
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,150
<i>who swore an oath of ethics,</i>

594
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:16,198
<i>but chose to see no evil
in order to benefit herself.</i>

595
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:18,324
<i>Once her device begins to rotate,</i>

596
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,733
<i>it will pierce her eyes and mouth</i>

597
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:24,705
<i>if you don't delay its movement
for at least 30 seconds.</i>

598
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:25,832
<i>To do this,</i>

599
00:47:25,942 --> 00:47:30,879
<i>you must step into the other machine
and lift the bars to the highest position</i>

600
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:35,543
<i>long enough to close the circuit,
slowing down her device.</i>

601
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:38,712
<i>If you do nothing,
she will wind to her death</i>

602
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,289
<i>before the clock runs out.</i>

603
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,920
<i>Do you have what it takes to help her?</i>

604
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:44,443
<i>Make your choice.</i>

605
00:47:44,961 --> 00:47:46,223
Bobby, please!

606
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:48,092
Bobby, please get me out!

607
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:49,615
Get me the fuck...

608
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,284
Oh, God!

609
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,562
No, no! Bobby, please!

610
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:58,505
Please, help me!

611
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:03,068
Oh, God! Oh, God!

612
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,307
Please, hurry! Hurry!

613
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:09,113
Come on, Bobby, please! Hurry!

614
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,346
Come on! Bobby, come on!

615
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:15,250
Hurry! Please! Please, hurry!

616
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:23,426
Bobby, please, hurry!

617
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:24,683
Hurry!

618
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:33,165
Yes! Yes, Bobby! Yes!

619
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,005
Come on!

620
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,377
Bobby, no.

621
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,487
No! God, no!

622
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,390
No! Bobby!

623
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:54,361
Please, no! Bobby, no!

624
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,760
Come on, Bobby. Please!
Get me out of here!

625
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,418
Come on!

626
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:02,002
Bobby, please!

627
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:03,355
No!

628
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,623
Oh, God.

629
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:07,208
Oh, my God. Bobby, stay there.

630
00:49:11,781 --> 00:49:13,681
Bobby, please, no!

631
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:15,645
No! No!

632
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,608
No!

633
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:26,490
Please, please!

634
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:27,797
No!

635
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:29,159
Oh, God!

636
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,645
Oh, my God.

637
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,180
No. No.

638
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:22,568
Help!

639
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,326
Do you know this guy?

640
00:50:42,505 --> 00:50:44,061
I've seen him on TV, but I don't know him.

641
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,693
Did your husband?

642
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,072
I don't know.

643
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,906
You sure you don't know him?

644
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,279
Yeah, I'm sure.

645
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,651
All right then.

646
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,890
Lock it up.

647
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:07,629
Hoffman just sent an e-mail
with an MPEG attachment.

648
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,995
I'm just searching the IP address.

649
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,624
Can you find out where it came from?

650
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:15,398
It depends on how many proxy servers
he filtered it through,

651
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:18,099
but it was time-delayed,
so it'll leave fingerprints.

652
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,358
Play it.

653
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,038
<i>Hello, Gibson.</i>

654
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:25,073
<i>Once again, we're at a moral crossroad.</i>

655
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,381
<i>I don't blame you
for not giving me Jill Tuck,</i>

656
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:31,015
<i>but you shouldn't let an old grudge
cloud your judgment.</i>

657
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,486
<i>Look to where you're being led.</i>

658
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,150
<i>Look beyond the crossroad
to the clear dawn.</i>

659
00:51:39,195 --> 00:51:40,492
<i>Do you see it?</i>

660
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:46,161
I get it. Let's go.

661
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,138
Joyce?

662
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:25,808
Cale?

663
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:27,308
Bobby? Bobby?

664
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:30,144
Listen to me. Cale.
Cale, I can see you, okay?

665
00:52:30,513 --> 00:52:32,743
- Cale, don't move.
- Bobby, where the hell are you?

666
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,949
- You got to help me, Bobby.
- Do you know where Joyce is?

667
00:52:35,084 --> 00:52:36,483
What the fuck? I can't see, man.

668
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:37,746
How the fuck would I know where Joyce is?

669
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:39,004
I'm about to lose my shit!

670
00:52:39,088 --> 00:52:40,919
Do I know where Joyce is?
I'm fucking blind, man.

671
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:43,049
Okay, Cale. Cale, do not move.

672
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,551
I got this thing around my fucking neck.
I can't fucking breathe.

673
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,892
Don't fucking move.
We're not on the ground floor.

674
00:52:47,997 --> 00:52:49,225
A lot of this floor is missing.

675
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,266
Just don't move, okay?

676
00:52:51,634 --> 00:52:53,329
Fuck. You gotta help me.

677
00:52:53,903 --> 00:52:57,771
Get me fucking down, Bobby! Fuck!
Fuck me!

678
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,102
Cale, there's a tape.

679
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:01,769
- What fucking tape?
- There's a tape.

680
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,436
Shut up. I'm gonna play the tape.

681
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:11,712
<i>Hello, Bobby.
Across from you is your closest friend.</i>

682
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:17,487
<i>He knows all your sins,
yet he acts as though he hears no evil.</i>

683
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,687
<i>Today, what he hears</i>

684
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:23,197
<i>will be the difference
between life and death.</i>

685
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:26,530
<i>Bobby, you must help
Cale walk over the planks,</i>

686
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,831
<i>and get as close to you as possible.</i>

687
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:32,806
<i>Find your own way across
the beams to the key.</i>

688
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:37,038
<i>You must get it to him over
the last span between you.</i>

689
00:53:37,146 --> 00:53:41,708
<i>If the noose around Cale's neck
is not removed within 60 seconds,</i>

690
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:46,255
<i>a winch will be engaged,
and your secret will be left hanging.</i>

691
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:50,253
<i>Does Cale live or die, Bobby?
The choice is yours.</i>

692
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,622
Bobby!

693
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,878
Oh, God.

694
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,788
Cale. Cale, listen to me.

695
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:57,249
Listen to me.

696
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,359
Shut the fuck up
and you listen to me for once.

697
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:02,404
Listen, I'm gonna walk you through this,
okay, buddy?

698
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:04,029
I'm blind. You fucking come to me.

699
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,131
I'm gonna try to get as close to you
as I can, buddy.

700
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:08,391
I'm fucking listening to you.
Talk me fucking through this.

701
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,810
I want you to shuffle to your right.

702
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,982
Just shuffle exactly to your right.

703
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:16,149
You're gonna feel a plank at your foot.
Yes, yes.

704
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:19,187
Yes, yes, perfect.
I need you to head out on that plank.

705
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:20,439
- Oh, fuck.
- Yes.

706
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,355
Okay, I got it. I got it. I got it!

707
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:26,927
Fuck this.

708
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,924
Okay, Cale, I'm on the way.

709
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,829
Fuck. Fuck. Okay, all right.

710
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,127
Now there's gonna be a plank
in front of you.

711
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,870
- Okay.
- You're gonna have to go

712
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:37,462
about 10 degrees to your right.

713
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,040
I got it. I got it.

714
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,406
- Come on, keep fucking talking to me.
- Okay. Okay, Cale.

715
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:44,042
- Feel where the plank...
- I got it.

716
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,764
Okay.

717
00:54:46,115 --> 00:54:48,675
Oh, God! What the fuck was that, man?

718
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,310
It's okay, Cale. It was a bottle.
It was a bottle.

719
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:54,083
- What the fuck was that?
- It's okay. It was a bottle.

720
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,681
- You're gonna be fine.
- Okay.

721
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:59,318
Fuck. Okay.

722
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:00,589
You got it, buddy.

723
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:03,794
You got it.
Now you're gonna feel a second plank.

724
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,994
- You'll feel it with your foot.
- I got it.

725
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,420
Feel it with your foot.

726
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:13,023
Get me out of this fucking thing, Bobby.

727
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,576
Step up onto the plank.

728
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:18,878
Oh, fuck. Oh, God.

729
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:20,976
Relax. You're okay.

730
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:26,382
No! No!

731
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,557
Cale, hang on. Cale.

732
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:33,223
Fuck. Fuck.

733
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:39,192
Fuck. Fuck.

734
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,378
Bobby. Bobby.

735
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,789
I got the key but... Cale!

736
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:09,965
I'm gonna throw you the key.

737
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:12,227
Cup your hands closer to your chest!

738
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:14,303
I'm gonna throw it on three, all right?

739
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,306
One,

740
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:20,108
two,

741
00:56:20,209 --> 00:56:21,359
three.

742
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:28,867
No.

743
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,719
Oh, fuck me.

744
00:56:37,326 --> 00:56:39,294
No! God damn it, no!

745
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:43,281
Cale!

746
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,037
No. Cale.

747
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:07,639
There's nothing here.

748
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,123
Yes, there is.

749
00:57:09,892 --> 00:57:11,257
Right there.

750
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,394
Why would he want us to come here?

751
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,662
For me to remember.

752
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,204
This is where he saved my life.

753
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:28,069
When I was in uniform
I responded to a distress call here.

754
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:32,479
<i>Back when this place was a flophouse
for junkies and homeless people.</i>

755
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:52,628
Freeze! Don't you fucking move.

756
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:56,204
Drop the gun.

757
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:07,265
<i>He didn't know what hit him.</i>

758
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:13,354
Yeah, he assaulted me,
but it shouldn't have been a death sentence.

759
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:22,762
Next time, you shoot first.

760
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:28,369
<i>I had no choice
but to report Hoffman for brutality.</i>

761
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:29,621
You owe me.

762
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:35,727
<i>What happened?</i>

763
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:42,279
He got a promotion is what happened.
And I got put on an island.

764
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:45,881
A year later, I transferred to IA,
busted three of his guys.

765
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:49,583
He swore he'd get me back, and here we are.

766
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:54,753
This place was called
Crossroads Manufacturing before it closed.

767
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,827
"Look beyond the crossroads

768
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,398
"to the clear dawn."

769
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:04,662
I don't follow you.

770
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:08,403
The man he killed was released from
Clear Dawn Psychiatric Hospital

771
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,308
when the state shut it down.

772
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,099
That building's been abandoned for years.

773
00:59:13,382 --> 00:59:15,213
That's where the game is being played.

774
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:18,048
All right, you get back,
you stay with Jill Tuck.

775
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:20,418
Don't let her out of your sight.

776
00:59:38,941 --> 00:59:40,091
<i>Bobby!</i>

777
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:44,544
- Joyce?
- <i>Bobby. Bobby!</i>

778
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,082
<i>Bobby, I'm here.</i>

779
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,984
- Joyce.
- <i>Bobby, can you hear me?</i>

780
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,883
Joyce, I can hear you. I can see you.

781
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,615
<i>Bobby, I can see you, too.</i>

782
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:55,881
Yes, baby.

783
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,119
- Get me out of here.
- <i>Baby, I'm on my way.</i>

784
00:59:59,695 --> 01:00:01,424
Who's doing this? Why?

785
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:04,192
- <i>Why is this happening?</i>
- Please, baby, I'm on the way.

786
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:07,698
- <i>Just hang on, okay?</i>
- Hurry. Please hurry.

787
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,504
There's got to be a tape.

788
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:12,724
<i>Hello, Bobby.</i>

789
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:16,409
<i>Before you is the door
that leads to your wife.</i>

790
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:19,845
<i>However, you must first make a choice.</i>

791
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:24,477
<i>As you may have guessed, your decision
will be as difficult as pulling teeth.</i>

792
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:30,489
<i>The lock before you requires
a four-digit combination to open.</i>

793
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:33,619
<i>However, if it is access you seek</i>

794
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:37,227
<i>then a true sacrifice will have to be made.</i>

795
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:40,529
<i>Watch and learn, Bobby.</i>

796
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:49,343
<i>The necessary numbers have been etched
onto two of your teeth.</i>

797
01:00:51,113 --> 01:00:54,571
<i>Look to the chart as a reference
for which teeth to pull</i>

798
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:57,585
<i>and in which order to enter the digits.</i>

799
01:00:59,121 --> 01:01:00,952
<i>Time is ticking down.</i>

800
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:02,982
<i>You must make your decision quickly.</i>

801
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,180
<i>Bobby!</i>

802
01:01:10,399 --> 01:01:13,493
I don't want you to see this, baby, okay?

803
01:01:13,602 --> 01:01:14,967
Oh, my God.

804
01:01:17,873 --> 01:01:19,101
<i>No.</i>

805
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:22,760
<i>No!</i>

806
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,244
Left side clear.

807
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:27,699
Clear.

808
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:30,268
- Clear.
- Clear.

809
01:01:30,686 --> 01:01:31,836
Change your position.

810
01:01:33,622 --> 01:01:34,987
The game's still on.

811
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,268
- Let's go.
- Move to the second level.

812
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:56,274
- Clear.
- Clear.

813
01:01:57,646 --> 01:01:58,738
Clear.

814
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,948
Go.

815
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,817
- Clear up.
- All clear.

816
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:19,284
Move, move.

817
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:23,298
- Moving in.
- Moving in.

818
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:25,368
- Clear.
- We're clear.

819
01:02:33,315 --> 01:02:34,942
Block it off.

820
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,311
- <i>What?</i>
- I found where that MPEG came from.

821
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,582
- <i>Where?</i>
- A business called Pete's Auto Body

822
01:02:40,689 --> 01:02:41,951
on 58th Street.

823
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:44,583
- <i>The junkyard.</i>
- The location of the car trap?

824
01:02:44,693 --> 01:02:46,126
Yeah, that's correct.

825
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,128
Okay, you guys keep moving.

826
01:02:50,232 --> 01:02:51,563
Where are you going?

827
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,068
To get Hoffman.

828
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:55,034
Okay, let's move it.

829
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:03,004
Rogers.

830
01:03:07,716 --> 01:03:08,866
Yeah.

831
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,885
What? What happened?

832
01:03:13,155 --> 01:03:14,850
Gibson's got Hoffman's location.

833
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:18,249
The game isn't over.

834
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:33,974
Another body.

835
01:03:36,745 --> 01:03:37,895
Hold.

836
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:43,001
We got a live one.

837
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:02,166
Can't cross here. Let's go.

838
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,316
Hey. Go get your shotguns.
You come follow me.

839
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:09,454
Give me your gun.

840
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,554
Hoffman, freeze.

841
01:05:33,662 --> 01:05:36,187
I want you to slowly put your hands
in the air.

842
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:46,235
Joyce.

843
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:47,492
Bobby.

844
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:50,036
Bobby, I knew you'd make it.

845
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:52,864
I knew you'd find me.

846
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:54,143
I am so sorry.

847
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,808
I knew you could do it.

848
01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:57,849
I knew you'd come.

849
01:05:58,187 --> 01:05:59,337
Get me out.

850
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,520
Bobby. Oh, my God.

851
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:06,862
There's gotta be another way.

852
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:15,033
<i>Hello, Bobby.
You have almost completed your rebirth.</i>

853
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:19,506
<i>However, your final task
will be your most difficult.</i>

854
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:23,009
<i>The woman before you
symbolizes your success.</i>

855
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:24,545
<i>She is your trophy.</i>

856
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,309
<i>And she has seen the good
in your message,</i>

857
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,543
<i>despite its dishonest beginnings.</i>

858
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,051
What's he talking about?

859
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:35,249
<i>Today, we will see
if you can truly earn her love.</i>

860
01:06:36,992 --> 01:06:39,426
<i>To prove your status as a survivor,</i>

861
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:43,862
<i>you must overcome a game
that should be all too familiar.</i>

862
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:47,435
- No.
- <i>You supposedly survived it once already,</i>

863
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:51,438
<i>so it should be easy to survive once again.</i>

864
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,642
<i>Pierce the hooks
through your chest muscles,</i>

865
01:06:54,743 --> 01:06:56,233
<i>and the game will begin.</i>

866
01:06:56,345 --> 01:07:01,339
<i>In order to free yourself and your wife,
you must hoist yourself with these chains,</i>

867
01:07:02,217 --> 01:07:07,314
<i>and connect the extension cords above you
before the clock expires.</i>

868
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,461
<i>Both hands will be needed
to complete this task.</i>

869
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:15,427
<i>But that should be simple.</i>

870
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:18,295
<i>For, as you claim to understand,</i>

871
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,966
<i>the pectoral muscles
can easily support your weight.</i>

872
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:23,800
<i>So I ask you, Bobby,</i>

873
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:27,137
<i>when you embrace every day
as if it is your last,</i>

874
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:29,734
<i>will it be with your wife?</i>

875
01:07:30,779 --> 01:07:32,371
<i>Make your choice.</i>

876
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:35,315
What's he talking about?

877
01:07:35,884 --> 01:07:37,146
Baby, I'm so sorry.

878
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:40,872
I lied.

879
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:44,686
I was never in a trap.

880
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:52,083
Clear.

881
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:18,449
How could you let me believe that?

882
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:20,791
I'm gonna make this right.

883
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:23,724
You don't deserve to be there.

884
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:27,901
I'm your wife.

885
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:30,468
How could you lie to me?

886
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:41,210
I know that from somewhere.

887
01:08:42,584 --> 01:08:44,677
Make your choice. Clock's ticking.

888
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:58,256
Bag the other bodies. Get them back
to the coroner's office right away.

889
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:01,586
What is this, sir?

890
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:05,300
Hoffman tapped
into the station's security system.

891
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,204
He's been watching us the whole time.

892
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:38,397
Oh, my God.

893
01:09:44,913 --> 01:09:46,073
- This is Palmer.
- <i>Listen.</i>

894
01:09:46,181 --> 01:09:48,240
You get every available officer
back to the station.

895
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,317
I'm sorry, sir?

896
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:50,749
Right now.

897
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,270
Sir.

898
01:10:10,305 --> 01:10:13,297
Gibson, are you
still there? Gibson.

899
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:07,752
- Door's locked!
- We're locked in!

900
01:11:11,266 --> 01:11:12,416
Gas! Gas!

901
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:13,851
Look for an exit.

902
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:36,657
I love you, Joyce.

903
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:40,524
I never lied about that.

904
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:43,489
I love you. I love you.

905
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:45,350
Bobby, I love you.

906
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:52,369
No! Oh, my God.

907
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:55,593
No.

908
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:01,944
No.

909
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:09,016
Gibson.

910
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:24,469
You can do it.
You can do it.

911
01:12:29,811 --> 01:12:30,961
Oh, my God.

912
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:38,644
Bobby, I love you.

913
01:12:54,936 --> 01:12:56,233
You can do it.

914
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:02,270
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

915
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:06,112
Pull. Pull, Bobby. I know you can do it.

916
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:07,932
Pull.

917
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,415
Oh, my God. Keep going.

918
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,387
Bobby, you can do it. Oh, my God.

919
01:13:14,489 --> 01:13:15,639
Bobby!

920
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:17,942
Pull!

921
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:43,467
What was that?

922
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:45,950
That's it, pull. Pull!

923
01:13:47,989 --> 01:13:49,139
Pull.

924
01:13:51,526 --> 01:13:52,676
Hurry!

925
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,180
Pull. You're almost there.

926
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:02,368
Fight, Bobby. You can do it.

927
01:14:04,272 --> 01:14:05,422
Someone's out there.

928
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:15,307
Oh, my God. No!

929
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:17,780
Help me! Help me!

930
01:14:19,454 --> 01:14:21,422
Help me! No!

931
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:32,059
I've been looking for you.

932
01:14:54,856 --> 01:14:56,006
How do I look?

933
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:04,782
Bitch.

934
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:08,727
Help me!

935
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,032
Bobby, please, reach.

936
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:16,760
Go.

937
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:19,244
Bobby, reach.

938
01:15:20,515 --> 01:15:21,665
Hurry.

939
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,645
Reach. Reach!

940
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:25,242
You can do it, Bobby.

941
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:40,328
Bobby, reach. Reach.

942
01:15:42,103 --> 01:15:45,266
One more. Reach. You can do it. Bobby!

943
01:15:45,373 --> 01:15:46,840
Bobby, you can do it.

944
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:55,499
Bobby!

945
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:00,998
No!

946
01:17:03,084 --> 01:17:04,346
Bobby!

947
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,815
No. Bobby!

948
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:13,610
Joyce!

949
01:17:17,198 --> 01:17:18,348
Bobby!

950
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:20,757
Joyce!

951
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:22,268
Bobby! Bobby!

952
01:17:26,858 --> 01:17:29,394
Joyce! Joyce!

953
01:17:32,847 --> 01:17:33,997
Bobby!

954
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:50,461
You fucking cunt.

955
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:58,105
No! Bobby!

956
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:06,163
Joyce!

957
01:18:08,249 --> 01:18:09,399
No!

958
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:22,446
Bobby!

959
01:18:33,575 --> 01:18:34,803
Joyce!

960
01:19:58,526 --> 01:19:59,823
Game over.

961
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:18,976
<i>Over the last two hours,</i>

962
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,243
<i>it seems our entire city
has been shaken to its core.</i>

963
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:25,114
<i>In addition to the nine police
employees killed tonight,</i>

964
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:28,712
<i>Jill Tuck, the wife of serial killer
John Kramer, has been found dead.</i>

965
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:32,184
<i>Citizens are being
advised to report any activity,</i>

966
01:20:32,293 --> 01:20:34,659
<i>even remotely suspicious, at this time,</i>

967
01:20:34,762 --> 01:20:37,492
<i>as blockades are being set up
at major intersections</i>

968
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:39,191
<i>within a 30-mile radius,</i>

969
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:42,565
<i>surrounding what will be considered
the largest attack</i>

970
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:45,400
<i>on this city's police department
in our history.</i>

971
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:49,603
<i>Any citizens with information
leading to the apprehension...</i>

972
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,678
What the fuck?

973
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:44,527
<i>Hello, Dr. Gordon.</i>

974
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:48,427
<i>You are perhaps my greatest asset.</i>

975
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:06,120
Congratulations, Dr. Gordon.
You survived.

976
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:26,401
<i>Without you, my work over the last
few years would not have been possible.</i>

977
01:22:34,782 --> 01:22:36,010
Jeff's wife.

978
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:38,082
Dr. Lynn Denlon.

979
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:43,940
She'll be perfect.

980
01:22:51,065 --> 01:22:52,828
My eyes! I can't see!

981
01:23:09,183 --> 01:23:11,242
<i>That having been said,
I have a request.</i>

982
01:23:11,352 --> 01:23:12,785
<i>Watch over Jill.</i>

983
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:19,750
<i>And should anything happen to her,
I want you to act immediately on my behalf.</i>

984
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:25,027
<i>In return for that,
I will keep no more secrets from you.</i>

985
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,436
<i>I've shown you a lot of places.</i>

986
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:35,598
<i>But there is one that will be, perhaps,
the most meaningful to you.</i>

987
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:17,244
I don't think so.

988
01:24:28,996 --> 01:24:30,146
What do you think you're doing?

989
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,459
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

990
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:45,996
No!

991
01:24:47,181 --> 01:24:48,614
You can't fucking do this to me.

992
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:51,485
Fuck you. No!

993
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:52,644
Game over.

994
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:53,948
No!
