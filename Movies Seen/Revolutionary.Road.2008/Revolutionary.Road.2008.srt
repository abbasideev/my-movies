1
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:46,032
So, what do you do?
- I'm studying to be an actress. You?

2
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:49,988
I'm a longshoreman.
- No, I mean, really.

3
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,999
I mean really, too.

4
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:53,158
Although, starting next Monday,

5
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:54,919
I'm doing something
a little more glamorous.

6
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:56,084
What's that?

7
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:59,423
Night cashier at a cafeteria.

8
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:04,338
I don't mean how you make money.
I mean, what are you interested in?

9
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,887
Honey, if I had the answer to that one,

10
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,096
I bet I'd bore us both to death
in half an hour.

11
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:53,905
Thank God
that's over.

12
00:02:54,857 --> 00:02:58,107
So much for the debut
of the Laurel Players.

13
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:01,442
And she was very disappointing.

14
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,993
Frank! Very nice, Frank!
- Thanks so much, Mrs Givings.

15
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:16,667
I can't tell you how much we enjoyed it.
You have a very talented wife.

16
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:18,961
I'll pass it along.

17
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:33,688
Frank!
- Hi!

18
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:37,357
She's in there.
I'm about ready for that drink.

19
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:39,317
Couple of minutes.

20
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:51,153
April? Sweetheart?

21
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,585
Hi.
- Hi.

22
00:03:56,712 --> 00:03:58,420
You about ready to leave?
- Yeah. Yeah.

23
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:01,382
I've just got to get this makeup off.

24
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:11,890
Well, I guess it wasn't a triumph
or anything, was it?

25
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:20,352
I guess not. I'll be ready in a minute.
- Take your time.

26
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:25,279
Listen, will you do me a favour?

27
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:28,279
Milly and Shep wanted us
to go out with them after.

28
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:31,863
Will you say we can't? Say it's because
of the babysitter or something.

29
00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:33,907
Well, the thing is,
I already said that we could.

30
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:35,999
I mean, I just saw them
and I said that we would.

31
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:38,203
Then would you mind going out again
and saying you were mistaken?

32
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:39,417
That should be simple enough.

33
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,291
Don't you think
that's a little bit rude, April?

34
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:44,211
Then I'll tell them myself.
- Okay. Okay. Take it easy.

35
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:46,383
All right? I'll tell them.

36
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:31,346
I mean it, baby.
You were the only person in that play.

37
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:32,886
Thank you.

38
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,433
We shouldn't have let you get
mixed up in the damned thing, is all.

39
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:39,941
All right.

40
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:44,311
What a bunch of amateurs. I mean,
you've studied, for Christ's sake.

41
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:45,775
Could we stop talking about it now?

42
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:46,902
Sure.

43
00:05:48,951 --> 00:05:51,407
I just don't want you
feeling bad about it, that's all.

44
00:05:51,537 --> 00:05:53,577
Because it's not worth it, you know.

45
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:57,241
It's bad enough having to live out
here amongst these people...

46
00:05:57,376 --> 00:05:59,535
What'd you say?
- I said yes. All right, Frank.

47
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,665
Could you just stop talking about it now
before you drive me crazy, please?

48
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:10,631
What are you doing?

49
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:22,934
April, sweetheart,
let's talk about this, okay?

50
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:25,773
No, Frank, please don't do that.
- Come on, now.

51
00:06:25,905 --> 00:06:27,778
Don't touch me.
- April...

52
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:30,398
Just leave me alone.

53
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,874
Okay. Okay.

54
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,048
It strikes me that there's a considerable
amount of bullshit going on here.

55
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:47,258
And there's just a few things
that I'd like to clear up. All right?

56
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:51,964
Number one, it's not my fault
that the play was lousy. Okay?

57
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:54,305
Number two,
it sure as hell isn't my fault

58
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:56,759
that you didn't turn out to be an actress,

59
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:59,184
and the sooner you get over
that little piece of soap opera,

60
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:00,477
the better off we're both going to be.

61
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,312
Number three,
I don't happen to fit the role

62
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:06,314
of dumb, insensitive suburban husband.

63
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:09,447
You've been trying to lay that crap
on me ever since we moved out here.

64
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:10,819
And I'm damned if I'll wear it.

65
00:07:10,951 --> 00:07:15,862
Number four... April? April!

66
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,156
April.

67
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,786
What the hell are you doing?
Get back in the car.

68
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,585
No. I will in a minute.
Just let me stand here for a second.

69
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:27,293
God damn it!

70
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:34,469
April, can you please just get back
in the car and talk about this

71
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,010
instead of running all over Route 12?

72
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:38,716
Haven't I made it clear I don't
particularly want to talk about it?

73
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:40,645
Okay. I mean, Jesus,
I'm trying to be nice

74
00:07:40,772 --> 00:07:42,681
about this thing here, for God's sake.

75
00:07:42,816 --> 00:07:45,853
How kind of you.
How terribly, terribly kind of you.

76
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:47,446
Wait a minute. I don't deserve this.

77
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:49,149
You're always so wonderfully definite

78
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:50,942
on the subject of what you do
and don't deserve.

79
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:55,571
Wait a minute! Wait a goddamn... April!
Now you listen to me.

80
00:07:55,705 --> 00:07:57,662
This is one time
you're not going to get away

81
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,783
with twisting everything that I say, April.

82
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:02,040
This just happens to be
one goddamn time

83
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,830
I know I'm not in the wrong here.

84
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:05,422
Christ, I wish
you'd stayed home tonight.

85
00:08:05,548 --> 00:08:06,793
You know what you are
when you're like this, April?

86
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:08,300
You're sick. I really mean that.

87
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:10,751
You're sick! What?
- And do you know what you are?

88
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:12,167
You're disgusting.
- Oh, yeah?

89
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:13,550
You don't fool me, Frank.

90
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:15,721
Just because you've got me safely
in this little trap,

91
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,306
you think you can bully me into feeling
whatever you want me to feel!

92
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:20,927
You in a trap? You in a trap?
- Yes! Yes! Me, Frank!

93
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:23,934
Jesus Christ, don't make me laugh!
- Me!

94
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:27,518
You pathetic, self-deluded little boy.
Look at you!

95
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:31,188
Look at you and tell me, how by any
stretch of the imagination

96
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:33,447
you can call yourself a man?

97
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:37,318
Damn it!

98
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:39,700
Jesus Christ!

99
00:08:55,516 --> 00:09:00,474
Don't look at me like that, April.
- Could we please go home now?

100
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,607
Fifteenth floor.

101
00:11:19,704 --> 00:11:24,033
I'm going to need your help
this morning, Old Scout.

102
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:28,579
For the next few hours, you're to warn
me of Bandy's every approach

103
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:30,872
and you may need to shield me
from public view

104
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:34,589
in the likely event I void my stomach.

105
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:36,177
It's that bad.

106
00:11:36,303 --> 00:11:38,261
Good morning, Jack.

107
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,672
Nothing good about it, I assure you.

108
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:04,704
<i>Of course, I knew the moment
you stepped off the train</i>

109
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:05,863
<i>what you were looking for.</i>

110
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,830
A small remodelled barn,
or a carriage house.

111
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,790
And I just hate to be
the one to tell you that sort of thing

112
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:14,414
just isn't available any more.

113
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:17,042
But I don't want you to despair.

114
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:20,713
There is one place up here
I want to show you.

115
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,883
Now, of course, it isn't very desirable
at this end.

116
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,555
As you can see, Crawford Road
is mostly these little cinder-blocky,

117
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,608
pick-up trucky places,
plumbers, carpenters,

118
00:12:31,777 --> 00:12:33,853
little local people of that sort.

119
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,446
But eventually...

120
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:39,901
Eventually it leads up to Revolutionary
Road, which is much nicer.

121
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:42,243
Now, the place I want to show you

122
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:45,822
is a sweet little house
and a sweet little setting.

123
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:50,745
Simple, clean lines, good lawns,
marvellous for children.

124
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:53,251
It's just around this next curve.

125
00:12:53,965 --> 00:13:00,335
Now, you'll see it. There.
See the little white one? Sweet, isn't it?

126
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:06,305
The perky way it sits there on
its little slope? Charming, isn't it?

127
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,018
Oh, yes.

128
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,619
You wanted to see me?

129
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:25,995
Came for you from Toledo this morning.
This is the third one this month.

130
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:27,832
Sorry. I thought I'd taken care of...

131
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,868
I'm not prepared to have this
conversation again, Frank.

132
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:32,001
You understand?
- I was literally just getting into...

133
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:35,505
These folks in the provinces look up
to us. We need to be efficient.

134
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:38,302
We can't have this
kind of back and forth, and so forth.

135
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:43,173
It's just not efficient. Am I right?
- Yes.

136
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:47,507
What was that about?
- Toledo.

137
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:50,055
Branch manager wants
a revised brochure

138
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:53,018
for the conference on the Knox 500.

139
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:56,270
"It's just not efficient. Am I right?
Am I right? Am I right?"

140
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:58,613
Sounds like a goodie.

141
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,109
For God's sake. I don't even know what
the Knox 500 does. Do you?

142
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:03,903
Don't insult me.

143
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,388
If you'll look in the inactive file
under SP 1109,

144
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:26,765
you'll find copies of all the stuff we sent
to the agency,

145
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:32,232
that way we can trace the thing back
to its original sources.

146
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:38,772
Listen, I hope you weren't planning
on having an early lunch.

147
00:14:38,947 --> 00:14:42,447
No. I'm not really hungry.

148
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:44,865
Good. I'll check on you later then.
All right?

149
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:46,406
Okay.
- Okay.

150
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:56,750
You know something, Maureen?
You're lucky you met me.

151
00:14:58,133 --> 00:14:59,592
How's that?

152
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:04,092
I think I can show you the ropes,
you know.

153
00:15:04,264 --> 00:15:09,935
There's a certain art to survival at Knox.
Really. Let me show you what I mean.

154
00:15:10,646 --> 00:15:15,604
Waiter. Bring me the telephone,
would you? And two more martinis.

155
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:17,648
Wow.

156
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:28,034
Klondike 5-55-66, please.

157
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:33,292
Hello, Mrs Jorgensen?
Frank Wheeler here. Yes.

158
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,456
I just wanted to let you know
that I've had to send Maureen Grube

159
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:38,790
down to Visual Aids for me.

160
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:42,424
I'll probably need her
the rest of the afternoon. Yes.

161
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:45,803
You, too. Take care now.

162
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:57,103
I never even heard of Visual Aids.
- That's because it doesn't exist.

163
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:21,003
Hi, Helen. Come on in.

164
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:22,961
I can't stay a minute.

165
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:25,929
I just wanted to bring
these sedum plantings

166
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:29,092
for that messy patch
down by the foot of the drive.

167
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:30,969
It's like the European houseleek,

168
00:16:31,102 --> 00:16:34,686
only these have the most marvellous
little yellow blossoms.

169
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,893
Now, all it wants for the first few days

170
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:40,644
is just a tiny dollop of water,
and then you'll find it absolutely thrives.

171
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,697
Well, thank you, Helen.
That's so kind of you.

172
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:46,651
Would you like some coffee?

173
00:16:58,172 --> 00:17:00,663
Is there something
I can do for you, Helen?

174
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,125
I almost forgot.

175
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,843
There is one small favour
I would like to ask.

176
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:13,889
It's about... It's about my son, John.
He's been in the hospital.

177
00:17:14,438 --> 00:17:16,347
I'm sorry. Is everything all right?

178
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:22,401
Well, actually, just for the time being,
he's in Pleasant Brook. Psychiatric.

179
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,818
Oh, I see.
- Well, it's nothing serious.

180
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:35,501
He just got a little run down. Things can
just get the better of us sometimes.

181
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:39,540
Don't you agree?
- Yes. Of course.

182
00:17:40,214 --> 00:17:41,923
It's a marvellous facility

183
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,885
and the treatments
seem to be doing wonders for him.

184
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:47,585
Anyway, they said getting him out
for an afternoon

185
00:17:47,723 --> 00:17:50,178
might do him a little bit of good.

186
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:54,223
I think he finds my friends
a little conventional, quite frankly.

187
00:17:54,354 --> 00:17:59,561
I mean, he's travelled.
He has a Ph.D. In mathematics.

188
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,526
I suppose you could say
he's an intellectual.

189
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:08,442
It would do him a world of good
to meet a young couple like you.

190
00:18:08,577 --> 00:18:10,653
Well, we'd love to meet him.

191
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:15,620
Really?
- Yes.

192
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:17,787
We'd love to.

193
00:18:19,671 --> 00:18:21,213
Thank you, dear.

194
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,087
Thank you.

195
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:30,631
Well, I must be off.

196
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:44,652
I remember the first day
you came off the train.

197
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,233
You weren't like my other clients.
You were different.

198
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,660
You just seemed special.

199
00:18:58,044 --> 00:18:59,419
Of course, you still are.

200
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:04,796
Remember, just a dollop. I must scoot.
Toodle-oo.

201
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:12,053
Bye.

202
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:31,656
I think you got me a little drunk.

203
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:41,494
You know what today is?

204
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:42,827
Monday?

205
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:50,044
It's my birthday. I'm 30 years old today.

206
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:53,174
Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

207
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:04,688
What was the name of that department
you made up again?

208
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:12,907
Visual Aids.

209
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:16,080
What a joke.

210
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,913
What a joke. Oh, my.

211
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,675
You want to hear a real joke?
- Yes.

212
00:20:31,555 --> 00:20:34,342
My old man worked at Knox.
- Yeah?

213
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,176
He was a salesman in Yonkers.

214
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:45,734
Once a year he used to take me
into the city for lunch.

215
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:49,645
It was supposed to be a very special,
life-advice sort of occasion.

216
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:52,736
Nice.
- No. Not really.

217
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,195
I used to sit there and think,

218
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:02,496
"I hope to Christ I don't end up like you."

219
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:10,842
Now, here I am,
a 30-year-old Knox man.

220
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,097
Can you beat that?

221
00:21:17,268 --> 00:21:19,427
I think I kind of lost you...

222
00:21:22,774 --> 00:21:24,897
Your father worked for Knox?

223
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:31,396
I'm sorry, everything's just kind of
going out of focus.

224
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:42,457
Why don't we get some air,
you and me?

225
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:23,161
<i>Is this you?</i>

226
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,542
Yeah.

227
00:22:26,672 --> 00:22:30,504
You been to Paris?
- I've never really been anywhere.

228
00:22:30,926 --> 00:22:33,678
Maybe I'll take you with me then.

229
00:22:33,804 --> 00:22:36,639
I'm going back the first chance I get,
I tell you.

230
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:39,339
People are alive there. Not like here.

231
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:51,814
All I know, April, is I want to feel things.

232
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:56,985
Really feel them, you know.

233
00:22:59,163 --> 00:23:01,203
<i>How's that for an ambition?</i>

234
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:09,839
Frank Wheeler? I think you're the most
interesting person I've ever met.

235
00:23:17,224 --> 00:23:21,850
I guess this wasn't what you had in mind
when you went to work this morning?

236
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:24,096
No. It certainly wasn't.

237
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:45,658
Do you have a cigarette, Frank?

238
00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:48,707
Yeah, sure.

239
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,139
There you go.

240
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,931
Can I get you a drink or anything?

241
00:24:03,437 --> 00:24:05,809
No thanks, Maureen. Actually, it's...

242
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:09,889
It's getting kind of late.
I guess I'd better be cutting out.

243
00:24:10,777 --> 00:24:16,116
Gee, that's right.
Did you miss your train?

244
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:18,947
That's all right, I'll catch the next one.

245
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:23,081
Listen, you were swell.

246
00:24:30,548 --> 00:24:32,090
Take care now.

247
00:25:06,334 --> 00:25:09,501
Frank.
- Why are you all dressed up?

248
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:13,997
First of all, I missed you all day
and I want to say I'm sorry.

249
00:25:14,717 --> 00:25:17,754
I'm sorry for the way I've been
since the play.

250
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,513
I'm sorry for everything, and I love you.

251
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:25,638
The rest can wait.

252
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:31,525
Now, you just wait here
till I call you. Okay?

253
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:33,100
Okay.

254
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:45,409
All right, Frank. You can come in now.

255
00:25:59,763 --> 00:26:02,966
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

256
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,350
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

257
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:10,808
<i>Happy birthday, dear Daddy</i>

258
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:14,773
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

259
00:26:17,197 --> 00:26:19,154
Happy birthday, darling.

260
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,237
I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too.

261
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,085
Frank.

262
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:50,971
Frank. I have had
the most wonderful idea.

263
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:55,977
I've been thinking about it all day.
- Baby, what's all this about?

264
00:26:56,112 --> 00:26:58,105
Do you know how much money
we have saved?

265
00:26:58,239 --> 00:27:01,406
Enough to live on for six months
without you earning another dime.

266
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:04,660
And with the money we could get from
the house and the car, longer than that.

267
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:06,614
"What we could get for the house"?

268
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,159
Sweetheart, what are you talking about?
Where are we going to live?

269
00:27:11,544 --> 00:27:12,659
Paris.

270
00:27:13,838 --> 00:27:14,834
What?

271
00:27:14,964 --> 00:27:17,087
You always said it was the only place
you'd ever been

272
00:27:17,217 --> 00:27:20,835
that you wanted to go back to,
the only place that was worth living.

273
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,513
So why don't we go there?

274
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:26,850
You're serious?
- Yes. What's stopping us?

275
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:30,887
What's stopping us? Well, I can think
of a number of different things.

276
00:27:31,022 --> 00:27:34,723
For example, what kind of a job
could I possibly get?

277
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:39,273
You won't be getting any
kind of a job, because I will.

278
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:41,193
Oh, right, right.

279
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:43,650
Don't laugh at me. Listen a minute.

280
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:46,574
Do you know what they pay
for secretarial positions

281
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:48,745
in government agencies in Europe?
- No, I don't.

282
00:27:48,874 --> 00:27:51,911
Listen, Frank, I'm serious about this.
Do you think I'm kidding or something?

283
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:54,500
Okay, okay.
I just have a couple of questions, is all.

284
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,335
For one thing, what exactly
am I supposed to be doing

285
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:59,708
while you're out earning all this money?

286
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:03,676
Don't you see? That's the whole idea.

287
00:28:04,014 --> 00:28:07,430
You'll be doing what you should've
been allowed to do seven years ago.

288
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,220
You'll have time.

289
00:28:09,478 --> 00:28:11,554
For the first time in your life
you'll have time to find out

290
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,895
what it is that you actually want to do.

291
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:15,353
And when you figure it out,

292
00:28:15,484 --> 00:28:18,900
you'll have the time and the freedom
to start doing it.

293
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:25,366
Sweetheart, it's just
not very realistic, is all.

294
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:33,657
No, Frank. This is what's unrealistic.

295
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:38,288
It's unrealistic for a man
with a fine mind to go on working

296
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,087
year after year at a job he can't stand,

297
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:42,963
coming home to a place he can't stand,

298
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:47,094
to a wife who's equally unable to stand
the same things.

299
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,515
Do you want to know the worst part?

300
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,973
Our whole existence here
is based on this great premise

301
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:59,272
that we're special and superior
to the whole thing.

302
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,197
But we're not.

303
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,863
We're just like everyone else.

304
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,860
Look at us. We've bought into
the same ridiculous delusion.

305
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,156
This idea that
you have to resign from life

306
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,161
and settle down the moment
you have children.

307
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,124
And we've been
punishing each other for it.

308
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,209
Listen, we decided to move out here.

309
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,293
No one forced me
to take the job at Knox.

310
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,132
I mean, whoever said I was meant
to be a big deal, anyway?

311
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,391
When I first met you, there was nothing
in the world you couldn't do or be.

312
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,309
When you first met me
I was a little wise guy

313
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,432
with a big mouth, that's all.

314
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,563
You were not.
How can you even say that?

315
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,727
Okay. Okay, so I'll have time.

316
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,404
And God knows that's appealing.
It's very appealing.

317
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,817
And everything you're saying
makes sense

318
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,990
if I had a definite talent,
if I were a writer or an artist.

319
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:53,662
No. But, Frank, listen. Listen to me.

320
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:56,582
It's what you are that's being stifled.

321
00:29:56,713 --> 00:30:01,090
It's what you are that's being denied
and denied in this kind of life.

322
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,254
And what's that?

323
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,683
Don't you know?

324
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:15,893
You're the most beautiful
and wonderful thing in the world.

325
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,528
You're a man.

326
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:46,177
This is our chance, Frank.
This is our one chance.

327
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,139
Okay.

328
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:58,270
Okay?

329
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:04,063
Why not? Why the hell not?

330
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,343
Good morning, all.
- Morning, Frank.

331
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:32,632
Franklin. Good to see your shining face.

332
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:37,644
What's the news?
- Fellas, I'm moving to Paris.

333
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:42,266
Indeed. And I'm moving to Tangiers.

334
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,585
Intra-company letter to Toledo.

335
00:32:02,716 --> 00:32:07,377
Attention B.F. Chalmers,
Branch Manager.

336
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:12,180
With regard to recent and repeated
correspondence,

337
00:32:12,308 --> 00:32:14,930
this is to advise
that the matter has been

338
00:32:15,061 --> 00:32:18,228
very satisfactorily taken in hand, period.

339
00:32:18,356 --> 00:32:23,563
Paragraph. We wholly agree that
the existing brochure is unsuitable.

340
00:32:24,487 --> 00:32:27,192
To this end, we have developed, quote,

341
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,866
"Speaking of Production Control."

342
00:32:45,258 --> 00:32:49,920
Here you go, Mrs Wheeler. These are
the traveller's cheques you requested.

343
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:52,504
Yes.
- Your steamer reservations.

344
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:56,555
These I'll pass on
to the embassy for you.

345
00:32:56,686 --> 00:32:58,478
Good luck.
- Thank you.

346
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:05,689
September. October at the outside.

347
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:09,364
I just happen to think
people are better off

348
00:33:09,492 --> 00:33:11,947
doing some kind of work
they actually like.

349
00:33:12,078 --> 00:33:15,078
Right. Right, yes.
- Absolutely, absolutely.

350
00:33:15,206 --> 00:33:20,627
But, I mean, assuming there is
this true vocation waiting for you,

351
00:33:21,003 --> 00:33:24,835
wouldn't you be just as likely
to discover it here as there?

352
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:29,214
I don't think it's possible
to discover anything

353
00:33:29,345 --> 00:33:32,630
on the 15th floor of the Knox building,

354
00:33:32,765 --> 00:33:35,386
and I don't think any of you do either.

355
00:34:34,828 --> 00:34:36,571
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

356
00:34:38,707 --> 00:34:40,996
Michael.
- Daddy, will you read us...

357
00:34:41,585 --> 00:34:46,626
...all the way to here.

358
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:50,715
We have to take a big boat ride
across the sea to get there.

359
00:34:50,844 --> 00:34:55,221
But I won't know anybody there.
- I know. I know. Neither will I.

360
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:58,258
But remember how you felt
when you started school?

361
00:34:58,393 --> 00:35:01,015
And now look
how many friends you have.

362
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:04,729
You'll never guess
what they eat in Paris.

363
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,106
You'll never guess.
- What?

364
00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:10,275
Slimy snails.
- Snails?

365
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:13,406
Slimy snails and icky frog's legs.

366
00:35:25,963 --> 00:35:28,715
Milly, where are you, doll?

367
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:32,593
You better get changed,
they'll be here soon.

368
00:35:33,638 --> 00:35:36,758
Is that what you're wearing?
- Don't you like it?

369
00:35:37,392 --> 00:35:40,642
Yeah, yeah. You look great, doll.

370
00:35:42,188 --> 00:35:44,097
Guess I better haul ass.

371
00:36:00,832 --> 00:36:02,160
Hiya, gang.

372
00:36:07,547 --> 00:36:09,171
What you watching?

373
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:49,835
Shep?

374
00:36:52,217 --> 00:36:54,673
I was calling you and calling you.

375
00:36:57,723 --> 00:36:58,719
Hi.

376
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:08,480
Here we go. Just a little something.

377
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:15,858
Those look great. I'm starving.
- April, I can't get over it,

378
00:37:16,617 --> 00:37:19,534
you look like the cat that ate the canary.

379
00:37:19,745 --> 00:37:24,039
Do you have something to tell us?
Just a little bit of news?

380
00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:28,329
Well, actually, Milly, we... Well, we do
have some important news, yes.

381
00:37:28,504 --> 00:37:29,784
I knew it.

382
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:33,252
Honey, why don't you tell them?
Go ahead.

383
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:38,553
We're going to Europe. To Paris.

384
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:44,676
To live.

385
00:37:48,525 --> 00:37:50,648
What?
- When?

386
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:54,235
In September.
- But what for?

387
00:37:55,824 --> 00:38:00,320
What for?
Well, because we've always wanted to.

388
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:03,330
Because the kids are young enough.
Because it's beautiful.

389
00:38:03,456 --> 00:38:06,706
I mean, really.
Shep, you've been there, you tell her.

390
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:09,076
Yeah, it's a great city.
- Yeah.

391
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:18,794
When did you make this decision?

392
00:38:20,557 --> 00:38:23,048
About a week ago?
It's hard to remember.

393
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:25,177
We just suddenly decided to go,
that's all.

394
00:38:25,311 --> 00:38:29,440
About a week ago, you tell us now.
- We had to get used to the idea.

395
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:32,520
So, what's the deal, Frank?
You get a job over there, or what?

396
00:38:32,652 --> 00:38:36,697
No, no. Not exactly.
- What do you mean, "Not exactly"?

397
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:42,783
Frank won't be getting
any kind of a job, because I will.

398
00:38:46,584 --> 00:38:48,327
So what are you going to do, Frank?

399
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:51,664
I'm going to study.
And I'm going to read.

400
00:38:52,423 --> 00:38:56,670
I suppose I'm going to finally figure out
what I want to do with my life, Shep.

401
00:38:56,844 --> 00:38:58,671
While she supports you?

402
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,053
Yes. While she supports me.

403
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,975
In the beginning.

404
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:08,021
You wouldn't believe what they pay
for secretarial work

405
00:39:08,189 --> 00:39:10,015
in those government agencies
over there.

406
00:39:10,149 --> 00:39:12,818
NATO and ECA and those places.

407
00:39:13,944 --> 00:39:15,604
And the cost of living
is dirt cheap, right?

408
00:39:15,738 --> 00:39:17,197
It's so cheap.

409
00:39:19,283 --> 00:39:22,070
The truth is we just need
something different.

410
00:39:22,244 --> 00:39:25,863
We're not getting any younger and
we don't want life to just pass us by.

411
00:39:25,998 --> 00:39:27,457
That's right.

412
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,201
Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids.

413
00:39:31,921 --> 00:39:35,337
I mean it. It really sounds wonderful.

414
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:37,542
Thank you, Milly.
- Oh, Milly.

415
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,214
We'll certainly miss you both.
Won't we, sweetie? Golly.

416
00:39:41,347 --> 00:39:43,007
Sure.
- We'll miss you, too.

417
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,136
Of course.
- True.

418
00:39:44,267 --> 00:39:46,307
We should have a toast or something.
To Paris.

419
00:39:46,436 --> 00:39:47,634
To Paris.
- To Paris.

420
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:48,934
To Paris.

421
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:52,106
Cheers.
- Cheers.

422
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,454
You know what I think?

423
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,323
What?

424
00:40:09,793 --> 00:40:12,960
I think this whole plan
sounds a little immature.

425
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:15,745
Oh, God, I am so relieved.

426
00:40:18,135 --> 00:40:20,756
Me, too.
I was thinking that the whole time.

427
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:22,423
I mean, what kind of man
is going to sit around

428
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:24,264
in his bathrobe all day picking his nose

429
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:26,840
while his wife goes out and works?
- I don't know, Shep.

430
00:40:26,977 --> 00:40:28,601
I just don't know.

431
00:40:35,277 --> 00:40:36,937
Why are you crying?

432
00:40:39,322 --> 00:40:40,982
What's the matter?

433
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:48,822
It's nothing. I'm just so relieved.

434
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:51,998
Shep.

435
00:40:52,128 --> 00:40:58,462
Don't cry. Please. It's all right.
Everything's going to be all right.

436
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:05,970
My God, their faces! Oh, God.

437
00:41:07,518 --> 00:41:08,633
Oh, God!

438
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,355
You know what this is like,
April, honestly?

439
00:41:13,357 --> 00:41:14,437
Just talking like this?

440
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:18,232
The whole idea of going off
to Europe this way?

441
00:41:18,446 --> 00:41:22,396
This is the way I felt going up to the line
the first time, in the war.

442
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:25,320
I mean, I was probably
just as scared as everyone else,

443
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:28,828
but inside I never felt better.

444
00:41:28,998 --> 00:41:32,912
I felt alive. I felt full of blood. I felt...

445
00:41:34,212 --> 00:41:36,500
Everything just...
Everything seemed more real.

446
00:41:36,631 --> 00:41:38,291
The guys in their uniforms.

447
00:41:38,424 --> 00:41:43,051
The snow on the fields, the trees.
And all of us just walking.

448
00:41:44,138 --> 00:41:46,843
I mean, I was scared, of course.

449
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:51,886
But I just kept thinking,
"This is it, you know. This is the truth."

450
00:41:56,067 --> 00:41:58,025
I felt that way once, too.

451
00:41:59,488 --> 00:42:00,603
When?

452
00:42:08,914 --> 00:42:11,405
The first time you made love to me.

453
00:42:15,337 --> 00:42:16,452
April.

454
00:42:55,294 --> 00:42:56,408
Frank.

455
00:43:23,406 --> 00:43:25,862
What's up?
- Bart Pollock's here.

456
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:28,033
He's in Bandy's office.

457
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,574
Big deal, huh?

458
00:43:37,003 --> 00:43:39,459
Looks like he wants to talk to you.

459
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:44,968
Hey, keep my name out of it.

460
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:55,218
Frank. Good to see you.
You know Bart Pollock?

461
00:43:55,355 --> 00:43:59,435
Well, we've never met, but of course...
- Good to know you, Frank.

462
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:02,141
"Speaking of Production Control"?

463
00:44:05,323 --> 00:44:10,152
Frank, this is a crackerjack.

464
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:15,076
They are tickled to death in Toledo.

465
00:44:23,175 --> 00:44:23,839
Really?

466
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:30,013
So, this guy Pollock was perfect
presidential material in the worst sense.

467
00:44:30,182 --> 00:44:34,512
A million dollar smile and about three
pounds of muscle between the ears.

468
00:44:34,645 --> 00:44:36,721
April, you should have heard this guy.

469
00:44:36,856 --> 00:44:41,352
"Frank, this is a crackerjack."
What a horse's ass.

470
00:44:41,652 --> 00:44:45,187
Wish I'd seen his face
when you told him you were leaving.

471
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,355
Yeah.

472
00:44:54,248 --> 00:44:55,707
Here they come.

473
00:44:58,919 --> 00:45:01,126
Sorry to be late.
- You're not late.

474
00:45:01,255 --> 00:45:03,828
The traffic was terrible.
- Thank you. You didn't have to do that.

475
00:45:03,966 --> 00:45:06,208
Good to see you.
- Wasn't it terrible, Howard?

476
00:45:06,343 --> 00:45:07,375
Well, Route 12.

477
00:45:07,511 --> 00:45:09,338
By the time they finish
that stretch of road,

478
00:45:09,472 --> 00:45:12,389
they'll have to start all over again, right?

479
00:45:13,225 --> 00:45:16,891
And you must be John?
- Say hello, John.

480
00:45:17,856 --> 00:45:20,525
Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.

481
00:45:22,402 --> 00:45:25,237
Where are your darling children?
- They're at a birthday party.

482
00:45:25,405 --> 00:45:27,564
Sorry they couldn't be here.
- Don't worry.

483
00:45:27,741 --> 00:45:30,030
If I had a certified lunatic
coming around my house,

484
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,616
I'd probably get the kids
out of the way, too.

485
00:45:32,746 --> 00:45:37,040
Look at all this food. You didn't
have to go to any trouble for us.

486
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,578
It's just some sandwiches.

487
00:45:38,752 --> 00:45:41,077
John, would you like a sandwich?

488
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:44,999
Helen's been talking it up
about you people for months.

489
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:47,838
The nice young Wheelers
on Revolutionary Road,

490
00:45:47,969 --> 00:45:51,552
the nice young Revolutionaries
on Wheeler Road.

491
00:45:52,682 --> 00:45:56,265
Would anyone like some sherry?
- Please don't bother, Frank.

492
00:45:56,395 --> 00:45:57,593
I'd like some sherry.

493
00:45:57,729 --> 00:46:01,312
And I'll drink Helen's, too,
if she doesn't beat me to it.

494
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:05,777
But, hey, you got a high-ball glass?

495
00:46:05,904 --> 00:46:09,902
Put a couple-three ice cubes in it,
pour it up to the brim.

496
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:13,950
That's the way I like it.
- I think I can handle that.

497
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:23,376
This egg salad is delicious, April.
You must tell me how you fix it.

498
00:46:23,506 --> 00:46:26,507
You a lawyer, Frank?
- No. No, I'm not.

499
00:46:26,634 --> 00:46:27,915
I could use a lawyer.

500
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:30,721
John, let's not get started again
about the lawyer.

501
00:46:30,847 --> 00:46:31,842
Pop, couldn't you just sit there

502
00:46:31,973 --> 00:46:35,342
and eat your wonderful egg salad
and quit horning in?

503
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:38,765
See, I've got a good
many questions to ask

504
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,972
and I'm willing to pay for the answers.

505
00:46:41,107 --> 00:46:44,310
Now, I don't need to be told that a man
who goes after his mother

506
00:46:44,444 --> 00:46:49,271
with a coffee table is putting himself in
a weak position legally, that's obvious.

507
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:52,028
John, come and have a look
out this fabulous picture window.

508
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,532
If he hits her with it and kills her,
that's a criminal case.

509
00:46:54,662 --> 00:46:57,829
Oh, look, the sun's coming out!
- If all he does is break the coffee table

510
00:46:57,957 --> 00:46:59,784
and give her
a certain amount of aggravation

511
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,871
and she decides to
go to court over it, that's a civil case.

512
00:47:03,004 --> 00:47:05,495
Maybe we'll have a rainbow.
John, come have a look.

513
00:47:05,631 --> 00:47:08,668
Ma, how about doing everybody
a favour? How about shutting up!

514
00:47:09,177 --> 00:47:10,885
Settle down, now.

515
00:47:11,846 --> 00:47:15,713
Maybe I can look into it, recommend
someone. What do you say?

516
00:47:23,399 --> 00:47:26,436
So, what do you do, Frank?

517
00:47:27,654 --> 00:47:30,774
I work at Knox Business Machines,
actually.

518
00:47:30,908 --> 00:47:32,568
You design the machines?

519
00:47:32,701 --> 00:47:35,821
Nope.
- Make them, sell them, repair them?

520
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:38,872
All these questions.
- I help sell them, I guess.

521
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:43,877
I work in the office. Actually, it's...

522
00:47:44,004 --> 00:47:45,498
Well, it's sort of a stupid job, really.

523
00:47:45,631 --> 00:47:48,501
There's nothing interesting
about it at all.

524
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,132
What do you do it for then?

525
00:47:52,262 --> 00:47:54,054
Maybe Frank doesn't like
being questioned.

526
00:47:54,181 --> 00:47:57,217
Okay, okay, okay.
I know it's none of my business.

527
00:47:57,351 --> 00:47:59,640
And besides, I know the answer.

528
00:48:00,521 --> 00:48:02,893
You want to play house,
you got to have a job.

529
00:48:03,023 --> 00:48:06,522
You want to play very nice house,
very sweet house,

530
00:48:06,652 --> 00:48:08,977
then you've got to have
a job you don't like.

531
00:48:09,113 --> 00:48:11,401
Anyone comes along and says,
"What do you do it for?"

532
00:48:11,532 --> 00:48:16,490
He's probably on a four-hour pass
from the state funny farm.

533
00:48:17,871 --> 00:48:21,406
All agreed? Ma?
- Sorry, Frank.

534
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:26,832
Don't be. Don't be. Actually, John,
I agree with everything you just said.

535
00:48:27,047 --> 00:48:31,626
We both do. That's why I'm quitting
the job in the fall. We're taking off.

536
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,553
We're moving to Paris.

537
00:48:36,933 --> 00:48:39,341
Did you know about this, Ma?

538
00:48:41,104 --> 00:48:45,682
How do you feel about that, Ma?
The nice young Wheelers...

539
00:48:49,237 --> 00:48:54,362
The nice young Wheelers are taking off.

540
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:03,831
John, please.
- Steady down, Son.

541
00:49:08,882 --> 00:49:13,259
John. John. How about some fresh air?
What do you say?

542
00:49:13,386 --> 00:49:15,130
If that's all right with you?

543
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:18,798
I don't know if it's such a good idea...
- If John wants to, I don't see the harm.

544
00:49:18,975 --> 00:49:21,300
Good.
- After you.

545
00:49:25,607 --> 00:49:31,479
I hear you're a mathematician.
- You hear wrong. It's all gone now.

546
00:49:32,405 --> 00:49:33,520
All gone?

547
00:49:33,656 --> 00:49:36,527
You know what
electrical shock treatments are?

548
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:38,319
Yes. Yes, I do.

549
00:49:38,453 --> 00:49:40,032
I've had 37.

550
00:49:43,793 --> 00:49:46,663
Supposed to jolt out
the emotional problems.

551
00:49:46,796 --> 00:49:51,208
Just jolted out the mathematics.
- How awful.

552
00:49:52,051 --> 00:49:57,009
"How awful"? Why,
because mathematics is so interesting?

553
00:49:57,848 --> 00:50:00,766
No. Because the shocks
must be awful and,

554
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:05,223
well, because it's awful not to be able
to do what it is that you want to do.

555
00:50:05,356 --> 00:50:07,847
I think mathematics must be dull.

556
00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:11,519
I like your girl, Frank.

557
00:50:11,737 --> 00:50:12,900
Me, too.

558
00:50:13,406 --> 00:50:16,572
So, what do a couple of people like you
have to run away from?

559
00:50:16,742 --> 00:50:19,114
We're not running.
- So what's in Paris?

560
00:50:19,245 --> 00:50:22,281
A different way of life.
- Maybe we are running.

561
00:50:23,082 --> 00:50:27,210
We're running from the hopeless
emptiness of the whole life here, right?

562
00:50:27,336 --> 00:50:29,210
The hopeless emptiness?

563
00:50:33,426 --> 00:50:37,755
Now you've said it. Plenty of people
are on to the emptiness,

564
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:42,885
but it takes real guts
to see the hopelessness.

565
00:50:48,316 --> 00:50:49,312
Wow.

566
00:51:03,957 --> 00:51:06,530
You know, he's the first person

567
00:51:06,668 --> 00:51:09,539
who seemed to know
what we were talking about.

568
00:51:09,671 --> 00:51:15,507
Yeah. That's true, isn't it?
Maybe we are just as crazy as he is.

569
00:51:17,554 --> 00:51:21,089
If being crazy means
living life as if it matters,

570
00:51:21,224 --> 00:51:24,178
then I don't care
if we are completely insane.

571
00:51:26,938 --> 00:51:28,101
Do you?

572
00:51:31,151 --> 00:51:32,147
No.

573
00:51:34,529 --> 00:51:36,273
I love you so much.

574
00:51:47,626 --> 00:51:50,911
Tell you something, Frank.
That Ted Bandy, nice guy.

575
00:51:51,171 --> 00:51:52,500
Real sport.

576
00:51:52,632 --> 00:51:54,292
Good enough department head and all.

577
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:56,501
But I'm a little sore at him
for the way he's kept you

578
00:51:56,636 --> 00:51:58,628
under a bushel all these years.

579
00:51:58,763 --> 00:52:02,298
This place okay for you?
- It's just fine, sir. Just fine.

580
00:52:03,184 --> 00:52:05,757
One thing interests me, Frank,
and one thing only.

581
00:52:05,895 --> 00:52:09,560
Selling the electronic computer
to the American businessman.

582
00:52:10,149 --> 00:52:14,272
That's why I'm assembling a team.
Men like you.

583
00:52:14,904 --> 00:52:16,647
Not your average salesmen.

584
00:52:16,781 --> 00:52:17,979
It'll mean more money,

585
00:52:18,116 --> 00:52:21,698
and, I got to be honest,
maybe more of a time commitment.

586
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:25,285
But you'll be a part of
something exciting, Wheeler.

587
00:52:25,415 --> 00:52:26,660
Computers.

588
00:52:29,919 --> 00:52:33,086
Well, sir, it sounds exciting.

589
00:52:33,214 --> 00:52:34,957
Bart.
- Bart.

590
00:52:40,054 --> 00:52:42,426
Bart, let me ask you a question.

591
00:52:43,182 --> 00:52:46,800
Do you happen to remember
an Earl Wheeler? Out of Yonkers?

592
00:52:48,146 --> 00:52:52,439
Can't say that I do. Relation of yours?
- My father.

593
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:55,983
He worked as a salesman for Knox
for almost 20 years.

594
00:52:57,613 --> 00:52:59,322
Earl Wheeler.

595
00:53:00,492 --> 00:53:02,034
Earl Wheeler.

596
00:53:04,455 --> 00:53:07,028
There's no reason you'd remember him.

597
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:10,914
Well, I'm sure he was a good man.

598
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,098
Listen, Bart, there's something
I should have mentioned earlier.

599
00:53:25,225 --> 00:53:28,096
I'm going to be leaving the firm
in the fall.

600
00:53:29,938 --> 00:53:33,058
Another outfit?
- No, no, it's not another outfit.

601
00:53:33,192 --> 00:53:35,979
Now, look, Frank.
Is it a question of money?

602
00:53:36,695 --> 00:53:38,106
Because if it is, there's no reason

603
00:53:38,238 --> 00:53:39,270
we can't get together on a satisfactory...

604
00:53:39,406 --> 00:53:42,573
Well, I sure appreciate that,
but no, it's not the money.

605
00:53:42,701 --> 00:53:47,696
It's... Well, it's more of a personal thing.

606
00:53:48,207 --> 00:53:50,033
I hope you understand.

607
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:52,000
A personal thing?

608
00:53:52,961 --> 00:53:54,076
I see.

609
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,631
Frank, let me tell you something
my father told me.

610
00:53:58,967 --> 00:54:01,921
A man only gets
a couple of chances in life.

611
00:54:02,262 --> 00:54:04,302
If he doesn't grab them by the balls,

612
00:54:04,432 --> 00:54:06,176
it won't be long before
he's sitting around wondering

613
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:08,598
how he got to be second rate.

614
00:54:14,609 --> 00:54:16,068
I guess so.

615
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:19,858
So, do me a favour. Sleep on it.

616
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:23,692
Discuss it with your wife.

617
00:54:25,036 --> 00:54:26,661
Because let's be honest,
where the hell would any of us be

618
00:54:26,788 --> 00:54:28,781
without our wives, anyway?

619
00:54:32,252 --> 00:54:35,952
And, Frank, in all sincerity,
if you do decide to join us,

620
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:39,209
I believe it'll be a thing
you'll never regret.

621
00:54:40,301 --> 00:54:42,839
And I believe something else, too.

622
00:54:43,221 --> 00:54:46,305
I believe it'd be a fine memorial
to your dad.

623
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:51,811
Think about it, Frank.
Really think about it.

624
00:54:58,737 --> 00:55:01,109
Knowing what you've got, comma,

625
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,904
knowing what you need, comma,

626
00:55:07,662 --> 00:55:11,495
knowing what you can do without, dash.

627
00:55:13,419 --> 00:55:15,458
That's inventory control.

628
00:55:33,606 --> 00:55:36,061
<i>Knowing what you've got, comma,</i>

629
00:55:37,985 --> 00:55:40,523
<i>knowing what you need, comma,</i>

630
00:55:42,531 --> 00:55:46,232
<i>knowing what you can do without, dash.</i>

631
00:55:48,204 --> 00:55:50,113
<i>That's inventory control.</i>

632
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:53,411
Hi, Frank.

633
00:55:55,377 --> 00:55:56,788
Working late?

634
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:01,129
Yeah. I got to dig myself out here.

635
00:56:03,385 --> 00:56:05,877
I heard you were getting promoted.

636
00:56:07,264 --> 00:56:08,545
Big shot.

637
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:15,389
I guess your dad would have been
real proud, huh?

638
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:25,364
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

639
00:56:34,918 --> 00:56:38,252
So maybe I should take you
for a drink or something?

640
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:42,294
You know, celebrate.

641
00:56:47,013 --> 00:56:48,424
Yeah, maybe.

642
00:56:53,019 --> 00:56:54,977
I'll just get my things.

643
00:57:02,738 --> 00:57:04,611
I'm going to bring my doll carriage

644
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,610
and my three Easter rabbits
and my giraffe

645
00:57:07,743 --> 00:57:10,743
and all my dolls and my doll house
and my crayons...

646
00:57:10,871 --> 00:57:12,579
I thought maybe
we'd give the doll house to Madeline.

647
00:57:12,706 --> 00:57:14,698
I don't want to give the doll house
to Madeline.

648
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:16,031
But I already explained to you,

649
00:57:16,168 --> 00:57:17,710
the big things
are going to be hard to pack.

650
00:57:17,836 --> 00:57:19,211
But she can have my bear,

651
00:57:19,337 --> 00:57:22,753
and my three Easter rabbits.
- No! Just the big things.

652
00:57:22,883 --> 00:57:24,923
Look. Wouldn't you rather go outside
and play with Michael?

653
00:57:25,052 --> 00:57:27,544
I don't feel like it.
- You've been inside all day.

654
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,843
I don't feel like it.

655
00:57:28,973 --> 00:57:32,057
Well, I don't feel like
explaining everything 15 times

656
00:57:32,185 --> 00:57:35,269
to somebody who's too bored and silly
to listen!

657
00:57:42,153 --> 00:57:44,905
All right, April. What's the matter?
- Nothing.

658
00:57:45,031 --> 00:57:47,700
I don't believe you.
Did something happen this morning?

659
00:57:47,825 --> 00:57:51,241
Nothing happened today that I haven't
known about for days and days.

660
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:52,402
What?

661
00:57:53,122 --> 00:57:55,957
Oh, God, Frank,
please don't look so dense.

662
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:57,785
You mean you haven't guessed
or anything?

663
00:57:57,919 --> 00:58:00,291
April, what are you talking about?

664
00:58:03,508 --> 00:58:05,547
I'm pregnant, that's all.

665
00:58:08,387 --> 00:58:09,419
What?

666
00:58:09,555 --> 00:58:11,797
Frank, I meant to wait
till the kids were in bed to tell you,

667
00:58:11,933 --> 00:58:14,850
but I just...
Well, I've been pretty sure all week

668
00:58:14,977 --> 00:58:16,258
and today I went to the doctor,

669
00:58:16,395 --> 00:58:19,147
and now I can't even pretend
it's not true.

670
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:22,642
How long?
- Ten weeks.

671
00:58:25,113 --> 00:58:29,526
Ten weeks. Ten weeks?
And you wait until now to tell me?

672
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:35,449
I thought... I don't know what I thought.
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm so sorry.

673
00:58:35,707 --> 00:58:38,329
I know. I know you are. All right?

674
00:58:39,503 --> 00:58:41,626
There are things we can do.

675
00:58:41,755 --> 00:58:44,709
We don't have to let this stop us
from going, do we?

676
00:58:44,842 --> 00:58:47,048
Remember that girl at school
I told you about?

677
00:58:47,177 --> 00:58:50,760
As long as we take care of it
before 12 weeks, it's fine.

678
00:58:51,974 --> 00:58:54,679
We've got to be together in this, Frank.

679
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:01,682
Well, we'll figure it out. All right?

680
00:59:04,194 --> 00:59:05,475
Come here.

681
00:59:08,365 --> 00:59:11,781
Twelve weeks.
So we have time to decide, right?

682
00:59:12,286 --> 00:59:13,448
Right.

683
00:59:15,831 --> 00:59:17,206
I love you.

684
00:59:19,668 --> 00:59:21,293
I love you, too.

685
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:11,298
So, Frank, how's work?
They gonna survive without you?

686
01:00:13,515 --> 01:00:16,599
Actually, something kind of funny
happened the other day.

687
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:21,262
I did some dumb little piece of work
to get myself off the hook with Bandy,

688
01:00:21,397 --> 01:00:24,185
and suddenly,
I'm the bright young man.

689
01:00:25,401 --> 01:00:27,939
That's always the way, ain't it?
- It's incredible.

690
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:30,028
I mean, I knocked this thing off
in a couple of minutes

691
01:00:30,156 --> 01:00:34,024
and now they want me to join
their team of "specialist" salesmen.

692
01:00:34,452 --> 01:00:35,697
Morons.

693
01:00:37,831 --> 01:00:39,704
Well, it would be funny
if they weren't offering

694
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:41,542
so much damn money.

695
01:00:46,215 --> 01:00:47,958
So, are you tempted?

696
01:00:48,634 --> 01:00:51,718
Well, it's just kind of ironic,
don't you think?

697
01:01:15,494 --> 01:01:17,902
I thought you turned the job down.

698
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:20,452
Not yet.

699
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:23,956
It's just an option, that's all.

700
01:01:25,045 --> 01:01:28,082
With the kind of money they're talking,
things could be different for us here.

701
01:01:28,215 --> 01:01:30,789
We could get a better place. Travel.

702
01:01:31,761 --> 01:01:35,046
The point is, we could be happy here,
at least for a little while.

703
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:37,339
It is possible that Parisians
aren't the only ones

704
01:01:37,475 --> 01:01:40,345
capable of leading
interesting lives, April.

705
01:01:40,478 --> 01:01:42,435
So you've made up your mind?

706
01:01:42,563 --> 01:01:46,513
No. No. Like I said, it's just an option.
That's all.

707
01:01:50,405 --> 01:01:52,528
And supposing you're right.

708
01:01:52,783 --> 01:01:56,697
You make all this money
and we have this interesting life here.

709
01:01:57,204 --> 01:02:01,949
Won't you still be wasting your life
toiling away at a job you find ridiculous?

710
01:02:02,918 --> 01:02:05,124
Maybe we let that be my business,
all right?

711
01:02:05,253 --> 01:02:06,629
Your business?

712
01:02:06,755 --> 01:02:10,587
You know what? It's too hot for this.
I'm going to go get wet.

713
01:02:22,687 --> 01:02:26,056
You don't want to go, do you?
- Come on, April. Of course, I do.

714
01:02:26,191 --> 01:02:29,108
No, you don't.
Because you've never tried at anything.

715
01:02:29,236 --> 01:02:32,023
And if you don't try at anything,
you can't fail.

716
01:02:32,155 --> 01:02:34,397
What the hell do you mean I don't try?

717
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:36,988
I support you, don't I?
I pay for this house.

718
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,575
I work 10 hours a day
at a job I can't stand.

719
01:02:39,704 --> 01:02:41,911
You don't have to.
- Bullshit!

720
01:02:42,207 --> 01:02:43,370
Look, I'm not happy about it.

721
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,417
But I have the backbone not to run away
from my responsibilities.

722
01:02:46,545 --> 01:02:49,748
It takes backbone
to lead the life you want, Frank.

723
01:02:54,387 --> 01:02:55,418
Where are you going?

724
01:02:55,555 --> 01:02:59,849
If it's all right with you, April,
I'm gonna go use the bathroom. Okay?

725
01:03:28,087 --> 01:03:30,958
What the hell are you going to do
with this?

726
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:32,549
And what do you think
you're going to do?

727
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,300
You're going to stop me?
- You're damn right I am!

728
01:03:34,427 --> 01:03:35,542
Go ahead and try.

729
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:39,343
Listen to me. You do this, April,
you do this and I swear to God I'll...

730
01:03:39,474 --> 01:03:41,762
You'll what? You'll leave me?
Is that a threat or a promise?

731
01:03:41,893 --> 01:03:42,972
When did you buy this, April?

732
01:03:43,102 --> 01:03:44,561
How long have you had this?
I want to know!

733
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:45,718
Jesus Christ.

734
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:48,772
You really are being melodramatic
about this whole thing.

735
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:52,482
As long as it's done
in the first 12 weeks, it's perfectly safe.

736
01:03:52,612 --> 01:03:55,696
That's now, April! Don't I get a say?
- Of course you do!

737
01:03:55,823 --> 01:03:58,030
It would be for you, Frank.
Don't you see?

738
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:00,117
So you can have time,
just like we talked about.

739
01:04:00,245 --> 01:04:01,574
How can it be for me
when the thought of it

740
01:04:01,705 --> 01:04:03,614
makes my stomach turn over,
for God's sake?

741
01:04:03,749 --> 01:04:05,124
Then it's for me.

742
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,077
Tell me we can have the baby
in Paris, Frank.

743
01:04:07,211 --> 01:04:11,422
Tell me we can have a different life.
But don't make me stay here. Please.

744
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:14,752
We can't have the baby in Paris.
- Why not?

745
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:17,886
I don't need everything we have here.
I don't care where we live.

746
01:04:18,013 --> 01:04:20,587
I mean, who made these rules, anyway?

747
01:04:21,642 --> 01:04:26,636
Look, the only reason we moved
out here was because I got pregnant.

748
01:04:26,772 --> 01:04:29,263
Then we had another child to prove
the first one wasn't a mistake.

749
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:31,688
I mean, how long does it go on?

750
01:04:33,028 --> 01:04:36,611
Frank.
Do you actually want another child?

751
01:04:38,617 --> 01:04:42,068
Well, do you? Come on, tell me.

752
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,997
Tell me the truth, Frank.
Remember that?

753
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:48,452
We used to live by it.

754
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:50,911
And you know what's so good
about the truth?

755
01:04:51,046 --> 01:04:54,960
Everyone knows what it is,
however long they've lived without it.

756
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:59,137
No one forgets the truth, Frank.
They just get better at lying.

757
01:05:00,973 --> 01:05:05,884
So tell me,
do you really want another child?

758
01:05:07,772 --> 01:05:09,895
All I know is what I feel.

759
01:05:12,444 --> 01:05:16,737
And anyone else in their right mind
would feel the same way, April.

760
01:05:16,865 --> 01:05:21,076
But I've had two children.
Doesn't that count in my favour?

761
01:05:21,286 --> 01:05:24,156
Christ, April!
The fact that you even put it that way!

762
01:05:24,289 --> 01:05:28,238
You make it seem as if having children
is some sort of a goddamn punishment.

763
01:05:28,376 --> 01:05:30,416
I love my children, Frank.

764
01:05:32,464 --> 01:05:34,752
And you're sure about that, huh?

765
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,423
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

766
01:05:37,552 --> 01:05:41,170
April, you just said our daughter
was a mistake.

767
01:05:41,723 --> 01:05:43,597
How do I know you didn't try
to get rid of her,

768
01:05:43,725 --> 01:05:45,302
or Michael for that matter?
- No.

769
01:05:45,477 --> 01:05:48,264
How do I know you didn't try to flush
our entire fucking family

770
01:05:48,396 --> 01:05:51,397
down the toilet?
- No, that's not true. Of course I didn't.

771
01:05:51,524 --> 01:05:53,433
But how do I know, April?

772
01:05:53,651 --> 01:05:56,652
Stop. Please just stop, Frank.

773
01:05:57,197 --> 01:06:01,574
April, a normal woman,
a normal sane mother

774
01:06:01,701 --> 01:06:04,951
doesn't buy a piece of rubber tubing
to give herself an abortion

775
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:08,330
so she can live out
some kind of a goddamn fantasy.

776
01:06:18,928 --> 01:06:24,005
Look, all I'm saying is you don't seem
entirely rational about this thing.

777
01:06:25,726 --> 01:06:27,683
And I think it's about time
we found somebody

778
01:06:27,812 --> 01:06:30,100
to help make some sense of your life.

779
01:06:31,357 --> 01:06:34,311
And the new job's going to
pay for that, too?

780
01:06:36,612 --> 01:06:41,321
April, if you need a shrink,
it will be paid for.

781
01:06:42,451 --> 01:06:43,827
Obviously.

782
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:52,334
Okay. I guess there isn't much more
to say then, is there?

783
01:07:01,887 --> 01:07:05,007
So I guess Paris
was a pretty childish idea, huh?

784
01:07:11,063 --> 01:07:12,855
I guess maybe it was.

785
01:07:26,204 --> 01:07:30,202
April, we can be happy here.

786
01:07:31,585 --> 01:07:33,542
I can make you happy here.

787
01:07:34,337 --> 01:07:38,038
We've had a great couple of months.
It doesn't need to end.

788
01:07:40,677 --> 01:07:44,722
We're going to be okay. I promise.

789
01:07:48,977 --> 01:07:50,602
I hope so, Frank.

790
01:07:52,439 --> 01:07:54,063
I really hope so.

791
01:08:34,816 --> 01:08:37,982
Thank you for waiting.
Mr Pollock will see you now.

792
01:08:39,987 --> 01:08:41,565
Thanks so much.

793
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:54,658
Foiled by faulty contraception.

794
01:08:56,587 --> 01:08:58,082
I can't say that I'm sorry.

795
01:08:58,214 --> 01:09:01,879
You'd have been sorely missed
in the old cubicle, I can tell you that.

796
01:09:02,009 --> 01:09:04,714
Wouldn't have been the same
without you.

797
01:09:04,846 --> 01:09:07,882
Besides... Well...

798
01:09:10,643 --> 01:09:11,639
What?

799
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:18,062
The plan always seemed
a touch unrealistic, don't you think?

800
01:09:22,864 --> 01:09:24,144
I suppose
it's none of my business, really.

801
01:09:24,282 --> 01:09:27,567
No. No. I suppose it isn't.

802
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:32,404
Well...

803
01:09:35,419 --> 01:09:38,835
They'll be celebrating
in the secretarial pool.

804
01:10:08,118 --> 01:10:11,072
Hey! Remember the first time
you brought us here?

805
01:10:11,205 --> 01:10:12,319
Absolutely.

806
01:10:12,456 --> 01:10:16,536
You said it takes a special kind of taste
to enjoy Vito's Log Cabin.

807
01:10:16,752 --> 01:10:19,421
It's so awful, it's kind of nice.

808
01:10:23,092 --> 01:10:29,130
Look at me. I'm just so happy.
Our little gang's back together again.

809
01:10:42,278 --> 01:10:45,612
Hey, Europe's not going anywhere.
- That's right.

810
01:11:08,471 --> 01:11:11,141
April, honey, how about a dance?

811
01:11:13,643 --> 01:11:16,181
Not right now. Maybe later.

812
01:11:16,312 --> 01:11:18,850
I'll dance.
- Okay.

813
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:36,831
Guess she's still pretty blue
about Paris, huh?

814
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:38,782
Think she'll be okay?

815
01:11:38,918 --> 01:11:42,667
Sure. Give us girls a couple of days
and we can get over anything.

816
01:11:42,839 --> 01:11:43,955
Right.

817
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:46,922
Frank.

818
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:51,212
Frank.

819
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:54,632
Frank.

820
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:56,643
Frank.

821
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:59,558
Are you okay? Are you okay? Milly?

822
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:01,733
I'm so sorry.

823
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,188
Excuse me.

824
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,824
That's just great.

825
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:14,494
How the hell
are we supposed to get out now?

826
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:16,159
Oh, boy.

827
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,537
Don't worry about it, Shep.
We can wait. Really.

828
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,247
What about the sitter?

829
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:25,380
Listen, why don't you drive Milly home,
then go home yourself.

830
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:28,420
That takes care of both sitters.
Then Shep can take me home later.

831
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:31,174
Yeah, it's fine by me.
- Okay, then.

832
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:36,091
You... You'll be all right?
- Sure.

833
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,015
Okay.

834
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,514
Good night.
- Good night.

835
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:43,525
Feel better.

836
01:13:03,505 --> 01:13:06,210
I'm sorry you're not
going away any more.

837
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:09,751
I know it was important to you.

838
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:15,425
Don't take this wrong,
but I've been there.

839
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:19,145
They don't have so much
we don't have here.

840
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:21,936
It didn't have to be Paris.

841
01:13:23,358 --> 01:13:26,976
You just wanted out, huh?

842
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:28,988
I wanted in.

843
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:36,110
I just wanted us to live again.

844
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:44,789
For years,
I thought we shared this secret.

845
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:50,629
That we would be
wonderful in the world.

846
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,839
I didn't exactly know how, but just...

847
01:13:58,519 --> 01:14:00,975
Just the possibility kept me hoping.

848
01:14:08,196 --> 01:14:10,022
How pathetic is that?

849
01:14:12,033 --> 01:14:13,444
So stupid.

850
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:20,947
To put all your hopes in a promise
that was never made?

851
01:14:25,004 --> 01:14:27,875
See, Frank knows.
He knows what he wants.

852
01:14:28,216 --> 01:14:30,837
He's found his place. He's just fine.

853
01:14:32,261 --> 01:14:33,969
Married, two kids.

854
01:14:39,102 --> 01:14:40,845
It should be enough.

855
01:14:46,234 --> 01:14:47,692
It is for him.

856
01:14:52,448 --> 01:14:53,942
And he's right.

857
01:14:56,577 --> 01:15:00,196
We were never special or destined
or anything at all.

858
01:15:00,748 --> 01:15:02,409
Yes, you are.

859
01:15:03,961 --> 01:15:05,241
You're...

860
01:15:06,964 --> 01:15:08,707
You're the Wheelers.

861
01:15:08,924 --> 01:15:11,842
You're a terrific couple.
Everybody says so.

862
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:15,378
I saw a whole other future.

863
01:15:18,976 --> 01:15:20,885
I can't stop seeing it.

864
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:27,525
Can't leave,

865
01:15:29,778 --> 01:15:31,189
can't stay.

866
01:15:33,574 --> 01:15:35,400
No damn use to anyone.

867
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,745
Come on.

868
01:15:46,336 --> 01:15:47,712
Let's do it.

869
01:16:57,492 --> 01:16:58,655
Let me take you somewhere.

870
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:02,118
No. Just do it here. Now.

871
01:17:49,086 --> 01:17:50,201
April.

872
01:17:52,965 --> 01:17:55,254
This is what I've always wanted.

873
01:17:56,761 --> 01:17:58,041
I love you.

874
01:17:59,096 --> 01:18:00,638
Don't say that.

875
01:18:02,266 --> 01:18:05,849
No. I mean it, I love you.

876
01:18:05,978 --> 01:18:09,810
Please, just be quiet for a minute.

877
01:18:14,278 --> 01:18:16,401
Then you can take me home.

878
01:19:07,374 --> 01:19:09,082
It's beautiful out.

879
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,746
Yes, it is.

880
01:19:16,716 --> 01:19:18,626
You know what today is?

881
01:19:19,177 --> 01:19:21,633
It's 12 weeks.
- That's right.

882
01:19:25,684 --> 01:19:29,136
Look, this has been
kind of a crazy summer.

883
01:19:29,313 --> 01:19:31,306
We've both been under a strain.

884
01:19:31,441 --> 01:19:34,145
I mean, I understand why you're upset.

885
01:19:34,861 --> 01:19:38,645
You know I'm not sleeping with you,
and you want to know why.

886
01:19:40,074 --> 01:19:44,866
Well, I'm sorry, Frank,
but I really don't feel like talking about it.

887
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:48,581
All right.
Then what should we talk about, April?

888
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:52,077
Would it be all right
if we didn't talk about anything?

889
01:19:52,211 --> 01:19:55,794
I mean, can't we just take each day
as it comes, and do the best we can,

890
01:19:55,923 --> 01:19:59,506
and not feel like we have to talk
about everything all the time?

891
01:19:59,635 --> 01:20:02,969
I don't think I'm suggesting that
we talk about everything all the time.

892
01:20:03,097 --> 01:20:07,261
Look, my point is we've both been
under a strain

893
01:20:07,393 --> 01:20:11,557
and we ought to be helping each other
out as much as we can right now.

894
01:20:11,731 --> 01:20:15,645
I mean, God knows my own behaviour
has been pretty weird lately.

895
01:20:18,279 --> 01:20:22,359
As a matter of fact, there is something
I'd like to tell you about.

896
01:20:24,243 --> 01:20:27,659
I've been with a girl a few times,
in the city.

897
01:20:29,499 --> 01:20:31,705
A girl I hardly even know.

898
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:34,874
It was nothing to me,

899
01:20:35,005 --> 01:20:38,955
but it's over now, really over.

900
01:20:39,802 --> 01:20:43,550
And if I weren't sure of that, I guess
I could never have told you about it.

901
01:20:48,936 --> 01:20:50,394
Why did you?

902
01:20:51,188 --> 01:20:52,931
Baby, I don't know.

903
01:20:53,565 --> 01:20:56,056
I think it's a simple case
of wanting to be a man again

904
01:20:56,193 --> 01:20:57,853
after all that abortion business.

905
01:20:57,986 --> 01:21:01,605
Some kind of neurotic,
irrational need to prove something.

906
01:21:01,782 --> 01:21:05,032
No. I don't mean
why did you have the girl.

907
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,912
I mean, why did you tell me about it?

908
01:21:10,415 --> 01:21:13,452
What do you mean?
- I mean, what's the point?

909
01:21:15,671 --> 01:21:18,921
Is it supposed to make me jealous
or something?

910
01:21:19,049 --> 01:21:20,841
Is it supposed to make me
fall in love with you,

911
01:21:20,968 --> 01:21:23,719
or back into bed with you, or what?

912
01:21:23,846 --> 01:21:27,464
I mean,
what would you like me to say, Frank?

913
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:31,806
Why don't you say what you feel, April?

914
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:34,807
I don't feel anything.

915
01:21:35,524 --> 01:21:39,605
In other words, you don't care what I do
or who I fuck or anything?

916
01:21:43,324 --> 01:21:46,575
No, I guess that's right. I don't.

917
01:21:49,038 --> 01:21:50,663
Fuck who you like.

918
01:21:51,082 --> 01:21:54,249
April, don't you understand
that I want you to care?

919
01:21:54,377 --> 01:21:56,500
I know. I know you do.

920
01:21:57,714 --> 01:21:59,920
And I suppose I would if I loved you.

921
01:22:00,049 --> 01:22:03,169
But I don't think I do any more.
And I only just figured that out.

922
01:22:03,303 --> 01:22:06,672
And that's why I'd just as soon
not do any talking right now.

923
01:22:06,806 --> 01:22:09,178
Don't give me that shit, April.
Don't give me that.

924
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:11,924
You know goddamn well you love me.
- You think so?

925
01:22:12,061 --> 01:22:13,853
You know goddamn well!

926
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:17,399
Anyone home?

927
01:22:21,905 --> 01:22:24,941
I'm sorry dinner's late.
Would anyone like another drink?

928
01:22:25,074 --> 01:22:28,775
Don't worry.
It's nice to just sit a bit and socialise.

929
01:22:29,078 --> 01:22:30,703
You shouldn't have gone to
all this trouble.

930
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:32,490
With all your packing and whatnot.

931
01:22:32,624 --> 01:22:36,372
I imagine you have a lot on your plate.
No pun intended.

932
01:22:37,879 --> 01:22:40,037
Actually, there's been
a change of plans.

933
01:22:41,049 --> 01:22:43,338
I thought maybe it was obvious.

934
01:22:43,468 --> 01:22:44,713
April here is pregnant.

935
01:22:44,844 --> 01:22:47,882
Congratulations.
- Oh, April!

936
01:22:48,057 --> 01:22:51,177
I can't tell you how pleased I am!

937
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:53,883
But I expect you'll be needing
a bigger house now, won't you?

938
01:22:54,021 --> 01:22:56,808
Hold it a second, Ma.
Hold on a second, Ma.

939
01:22:56,941 --> 01:23:00,855
I don't get this.
I mean, what's so obvious about it?

940
01:23:00,986 --> 01:23:05,732
I mean, okay, she's pregnant, so what?
Don't people have babies in Europe?

941
01:23:05,908 --> 01:23:07,533
John...
- Suppose we just say

942
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:10,530
that people anywhere
aren't very well advised to have babies

943
01:23:10,663 --> 01:23:12,739
unless they can afford them.

944
01:23:13,457 --> 01:23:18,084
Okay. Okay, it's a question of money.
Money's a good reason.

945
01:23:18,212 --> 01:23:22,541
But it's hardly ever the real reason.

946
01:23:22,675 --> 01:23:27,835
What's the real reason?
Wife talk you out of it or what?

947
01:23:28,431 --> 01:23:32,345
Little woman decide she isn't
quite ready to quit playing house?

948
01:23:33,477 --> 01:23:35,802
No, no, that's not it. I can tell.

949
01:23:35,938 --> 01:23:39,022
She looks too tough
and adequate as hell.

950
01:23:40,985 --> 01:23:45,611
Okay, then. It must've been you.
What happened?

951
01:23:45,739 --> 01:23:50,283
John, please. You're being very rude.
- No, no. What happened, Frank?

952
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,031
You get cold feet?

953
01:23:57,169 --> 01:24:00,372
You decide
you're better off here after all?

954
01:24:01,173 --> 01:24:05,301
You figure it's more comfy

955
01:24:05,427 --> 01:24:09,888
here in the old hopeless emptiness
after all, huh?

956
01:24:11,016 --> 01:24:14,800
Oh, wow, that did it. Look at his face.

957
01:24:14,936 --> 01:24:17,143
What's the matter, Wheeler?
Am I getting warm?

958
01:24:17,314 --> 01:24:20,647
All right, Son. I think we'd better be...
- You know something?

959
01:24:20,817 --> 01:24:23,652
I wouldn't be surprised
if he knocked her up on purpose

960
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:27,438
just so he could spend the rest of his
life hiding behind a maternity dress.

961
01:24:27,574 --> 01:24:30,777
That way he'd never have to find out
what he's really made of.

962
01:24:30,911 --> 01:24:34,493
Now look, I think that's just about
enough out of you.

963
01:24:35,165 --> 01:24:37,407
I mean, who the hell
do you think you are?

964
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:38,918
You come in here and say

965
01:24:39,044 --> 01:24:41,998
whatever crazy goddamn thing
comes into your head,

966
01:24:42,172 --> 01:24:45,422
and I think it's about time somebody told
you to keep your goddamn mouth shut.

967
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:48,504
He's not well, Frank.
- Not well, my ass!

968
01:24:48,804 --> 01:24:52,504
I don't give a damn
if he's sick or well or dead or alive,

969
01:24:52,641 --> 01:24:54,265
he should keep his fucking opinions

970
01:24:54,392 --> 01:24:57,845
in the fucking insane asylum
where they belong!

971
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:03,272
Let's go, Son.
- Come on, John.

972
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:10,445
Big man you got there, April.

973
01:25:11,077 --> 01:25:13,034
Big family man.

974
01:25:16,749 --> 01:25:18,706
I feel sorry for you.

975
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:24,872
Still, maybe you deserve each other.

976
01:25:25,007 --> 01:25:29,634
I mean, the way you look right now,
I'm beginning to feel sorry for him, too.

977
01:25:31,222 --> 01:25:33,547
You must give him a pretty bad time

978
01:25:33,683 --> 01:25:37,550
if making babies is the only way
he can prove he's got a pair of balls.

979
01:25:37,854 --> 01:25:42,397
You fucking...
- No! He's not well, Frank!

980
01:25:54,245 --> 01:25:57,696
All right, John.
Let's get on out to the car now.

981
01:26:03,547 --> 01:26:06,418
April, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

982
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:11,170
Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry! Sorry!

983
01:26:11,305 --> 01:26:14,222
Ma, have I said
"I'm sorry" enough times?

984
01:26:14,349 --> 01:26:16,591
Damn! I am sorry, too.

985
01:26:16,727 --> 01:26:19,597
I bet I'm just about
the sorriest bastard I know.

986
01:26:19,772 --> 01:26:23,852
But get right down to it, I don't have
a whole hell of a lot to be glad about.

987
01:26:23,984 --> 01:26:25,063
Do I?

988
01:26:27,821 --> 01:26:29,730
But, hey, you know what?

989
01:26:31,116 --> 01:26:33,109
I am glad about one thing.

990
01:26:33,786 --> 01:26:36,027
You want to know what I'm glad about?

991
01:26:38,499 --> 01:26:41,072
I'm glad I'm not gonna be that kid.

992
01:26:58,685 --> 01:27:02,137
Okay, okay, don't tell me.

993
01:27:02,773 --> 01:27:04,812
Don't tell me, let me guess.

994
01:27:05,484 --> 01:27:08,983
I made a disgusting spectacle
of myself, right?

995
01:27:10,782 --> 01:27:11,813
Right.

996
01:27:11,950 --> 01:27:13,492
And everything that man said
is true, right?

997
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:15,403
Is that what you're going to say?

998
01:27:15,537 --> 01:27:17,613
Apparently I don't have to.

999
01:27:17,747 --> 01:27:20,665
You're saying it for me.
- Well, you're wrong, April.

1000
01:27:20,834 --> 01:27:24,499
Really? Why am I wrong?
- Because the man is insane.

1001
01:27:24,629 --> 01:27:27,832
He's fucking insane! Do you know what
the definition of insanity is?

1002
01:27:27,966 --> 01:27:29,080
No. Do you?

1003
01:27:29,217 --> 01:27:32,668
Yes, it's the inability
to relate to another human being.

1004
01:27:32,804 --> 01:27:34,843
It's the inability to love.

1005
01:27:39,894 --> 01:27:42,516
April. April.

1006
01:27:43,189 --> 01:27:45,859
April! April!

1007
01:27:46,025 --> 01:27:50,189
The inability... The inability to love.

1008
01:27:52,073 --> 01:27:55,027
Frank. You really are a wonderful talker.

1009
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:58,445
If black could be made into white
by talking,

1010
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:00,537
you'd be the man for the job.

1011
01:28:00,707 --> 01:28:03,162
So now I'm crazy
because I don't love you. Right?

1012
01:28:03,293 --> 01:28:05,332
Is that the point?
- No. Wrong.

1013
01:28:05,462 --> 01:28:09,376
You're not crazy and you do love me.
That's the point, April.

1014
01:28:09,883 --> 01:28:13,049
But I don't. I hate you.

1015
01:28:13,678 --> 01:28:16,384
You were just some boy
who made me laugh at a party once

1016
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:19,013
and now I loathe the sight of you.

1017
01:28:19,602 --> 01:28:23,136
In fact, if you come any closer,
if you touch me or anything,

1018
01:28:23,272 --> 01:28:25,063
I think I'll scream.

1019
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,393
Come on. Stop this, April.

1020
01:28:33,949 --> 01:28:35,907
Fuck you, April!

1021
01:28:36,035 --> 01:28:39,404
Fuck you and all your hateful,
snotty little...

1022
01:28:39,538 --> 01:28:42,208
What're you going to do now?
Are you going to hit me?

1023
01:28:42,333 --> 01:28:45,334
To show me how much you love me?
- Don't worry, I can't be bothered!

1024
01:28:45,544 --> 01:28:48,166
You're not worth the trouble
it would take to hit you.

1025
01:28:48,297 --> 01:28:50,918
You're not worth the powder
it would take to blow you up.

1026
01:28:51,091 --> 01:28:55,338
You're an empty, empty,
hollow shell of a woman!

1027
01:28:56,472 --> 01:29:00,422
What the hell are you doing in my house
if you hate me so much?

1028
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:03,266
Why the hell are you married to me?

1029
01:29:03,395 --> 01:29:06,231
What the hell are you doing
carrying my child?

1030
01:29:06,357 --> 01:29:09,026
I mean, why didn't you just get
rid of it when you had the chance?

1031
01:29:09,151 --> 01:29:12,105
Because listen to me.
Listen to me, I got news for you.

1032
01:29:12,279 --> 01:29:14,402
I wish to God that you had.

1033
01:29:48,525 --> 01:29:49,723
April!

1034
01:29:52,404 --> 01:29:53,566
April!

1035
01:29:58,285 --> 01:29:59,447
April!

1036
01:30:04,875 --> 01:30:05,989
April!

1037
01:30:11,298 --> 01:30:12,460
April!

1038
01:30:14,384 --> 01:30:15,499
April!

1039
01:30:23,727 --> 01:30:25,601
April!
- Stay away from me.

1040
01:30:25,771 --> 01:30:27,763
April, listen.
- Stay away from me.

1041
01:30:27,898 --> 01:30:29,772
Can't I even get away from you
in the fucking woods?

1042
01:30:29,901 --> 01:30:31,858
April, listen, I didn't mean that.

1043
01:30:31,986 --> 01:30:34,311
Honestly, I didn't mean what I said.
- Are you still talking?

1044
01:30:34,447 --> 01:30:37,199
Isn't there any way to stop your talking?

1045
01:30:37,909 --> 01:30:41,443
I need to think. Can't you see that?
I need to think.

1046
01:30:43,915 --> 01:30:45,658
Please come back to the house.
What're you doing out here, April?

1047
01:30:45,792 --> 01:30:47,334
Do you want me to scream again,
Frank?

1048
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,618
Because I will! I mean it!

1049
01:30:58,346 --> 01:31:00,753
Okay. Okay.

1050
01:34:34,064 --> 01:34:35,523
Good morning.

1051
01:34:37,651 --> 01:34:39,110
Good morning.

1052
01:34:40,905 --> 01:34:43,526
Would you like
scrambled eggs or fried?

1053
01:34:48,496 --> 01:34:50,038
I don't know.

1054
01:34:50,831 --> 01:34:55,874
It doesn't really matter.
Scrambled, I guess, if it's easy.

1055
01:34:56,671 --> 01:34:59,625
Fine. I'll have scrambled, too.

1056
01:35:57,607 --> 01:36:01,938
It's kind of nice having breakfast
without the kids for a change, huh?

1057
01:36:02,071 --> 01:36:03,186
Yes.

1058
01:36:04,157 --> 01:36:07,027
I thought you'd probably want
a good breakfast today.

1059
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:10,363
I mean, it's kind of an important day
for you, isn't it?

1060
01:36:11,247 --> 01:36:14,746
Isn't this the day you have
your conference with Pollock?

1061
01:36:16,919 --> 01:36:19,161
Yes. Yes, that's right.

1062
01:36:21,257 --> 01:36:25,124
Big deal.
- I imagine it is a pretty big deal.

1063
01:36:25,845 --> 01:36:27,553
For them, anyway.

1064
01:36:28,848 --> 01:36:32,466
What exactly do you think
you'll be doing in your new job?

1065
01:36:32,894 --> 01:36:35,645
You haven't really
told me much about it.

1066
01:36:36,522 --> 01:36:37,898
Haven't I?

1067
01:36:40,109 --> 01:36:42,268
Well, I think this whole thing
is about Knox getting ready

1068
01:36:42,403 --> 01:36:45,653
to buy up one of those
really big computers,

1069
01:36:45,782 --> 01:36:47,858
even bigger than the 500.

1070
01:36:48,910 --> 01:36:52,243
Didn't I tell you about that?
- No.

1071
01:36:52,955 --> 01:36:54,948
Why don't you tell me now?

1072
01:36:59,295 --> 01:37:00,326
Well,

1073
01:37:01,756 --> 01:37:06,170
you know, basically it's just a big,
fast adding machine.

1074
01:37:07,888 --> 01:37:11,553
Only, instead of mechanical parts,
you see,

1075
01:37:12,309 --> 01:37:17,600
you've got thousands
of individual vacuum tubes.

1076
01:37:28,492 --> 01:37:29,690
I see.

1077
01:37:37,584 --> 01:37:39,577
At least I think I see.

1078
01:37:43,465 --> 01:37:46,466
Yes, it's really kind of interesting,
isn't it?

1079
01:37:49,138 --> 01:37:50,929
Well, I don't know.

1080
01:37:53,016 --> 01:37:56,136
Yeah, I guess it is kind of interesting,
in a way.

1081
01:38:00,983 --> 01:38:03,521
You should value what you do, Frank.

1082
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:06,943
You're obviously good at it.

1083
01:38:22,422 --> 01:38:25,589
Well, I guess
I'd better be getting started, huh?

1084
01:38:32,515 --> 01:38:34,804
Listen, though, April, the...

1085
01:38:36,936 --> 01:38:38,680
This was really nice.

1086
01:38:40,356 --> 01:38:43,393
I mean, it was a swell breakfast.
Really, I...

1087
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:47,604
I don't know when I've ever had
a nicer breakfast.

1088
01:38:49,908 --> 01:38:53,775
Thank you. I enjoyed it, too.

1089
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:19,681
Then you don't...
You don't hate me or anything?

1090
01:39:22,358 --> 01:39:26,023
No. No, of course I don't.

1091
01:39:36,831 --> 01:39:38,408
Have a good day.

1092
01:39:45,214 --> 01:39:48,915
Okay, then. So long.

1093
01:41:31,197 --> 01:41:35,693
Hello. Milly? Everything all right?

1094
01:41:38,037 --> 01:41:42,616
Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not feeling
any better. That's really why I called.

1095
01:41:44,210 --> 01:41:48,255
If it's not an inconvenience for you,
this evening would be great.

1096
01:41:49,298 --> 01:41:50,294
What?

1097
01:41:53,052 --> 01:41:58,010
Oh, no. No.
Not if they're outdoors playing.

1098
01:41:59,267 --> 01:42:00,262
No.

1099
01:42:02,353 --> 01:42:04,393
Don't call them in.

1100
01:42:04,522 --> 01:42:08,851
Just give them each a kiss for me,

1101
01:42:10,486 --> 01:42:12,360
and tell them I...

1102
01:42:14,073 --> 01:42:15,532
Tell them...

1103
01:42:16,868 --> 01:42:22,704
You know. All right. All right.
Thank you, Milly. Bye.

1104
01:45:54,588 --> 01:45:57,294
I think I need help.

1105
01:45:58,844 --> 01:46:02,758
115 Revolutionary Road.

1106
01:46:29,666 --> 01:46:32,418
Frank. They tell you what happened?
- Jesus Christ.

1107
01:46:32,544 --> 01:46:35,035
Shep, I didn't understand
half the things he told me.

1108
01:46:35,172 --> 01:46:37,923
He said the foetus was out
before they got her here.

1109
01:46:38,049 --> 01:46:42,711
And they had to operate to take out
the, what do you call it, the placenta?

1110
01:46:42,846 --> 01:46:45,135
And now she's still bleeding.

1111
01:46:45,265 --> 01:46:47,934
He said that she'd lost a lot of blood
before the ambulance came,

1112
01:46:48,059 --> 01:46:50,432
and now they're trying to stop it.

1113
01:46:50,687 --> 01:46:55,016
He said a whole lot of things
I didn't understand about capillaries...

1114
01:46:55,775 --> 01:47:00,105
He said that she's unconscious. Jesus.

1115
01:47:00,238 --> 01:47:02,066
Okay, Frank,
why don't you just take a seat?

1116
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:04,525
What the hell do I want to sit down for,
for God's sake?

1117
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:08,788
Okay, Frank. Just take it easy.
Take it easy.

1118
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:14,666
Frank, have a cigarette.
- She did it to herself, Shep.

1119
01:47:16,672 --> 01:47:18,582
She did it to herself.

1120
01:47:26,224 --> 01:47:28,430
I'm gonna get you some coffee.

1121
01:48:38,797 --> 01:48:42,877
They were such wonderful people.
Weren't they, Shep?

1122
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:48,422
It's just devastating. Poor April.

1123
01:48:48,557 --> 01:48:49,837
Thank you.

1124
01:48:51,101 --> 01:48:54,517
Frank lives in the city now.
Where is it that he works?

1125
01:48:55,606 --> 01:48:58,061
Bart Pollock Associates.
- Computers?

1126
01:48:59,401 --> 01:49:01,275
Interesting firm.

1127
01:49:01,403 --> 01:49:04,653
Have you seen him since?
- No. Not back here.

1128
01:49:04,782 --> 01:49:09,028
There are too many memories, I think.
Shep has seen him in the city.

1129
01:49:09,161 --> 01:49:11,035
Haven't you, sweetie?

1130
01:49:11,622 --> 01:49:14,707
Frank is just devoted to those kids.

1131
01:49:15,627 --> 01:49:18,663
Every spare moment he has,
he spends with them.

1132
01:49:33,895 --> 01:49:35,175
Excuse me.

1133
01:49:46,491 --> 01:49:47,985
You all right?

1134
01:49:53,414 --> 01:49:56,618
I don't want to talk
about the Wheelers any more.

1135
01:49:58,211 --> 01:49:59,242
Okay.

1136
01:50:01,589 --> 01:50:03,297
We don't have to.

1137
01:50:05,218 --> 01:50:06,926
We don't have to.

1138
01:50:49,096 --> 01:50:51,801
Daddy, Daddy, watch. Watch, Daddy.

1139
01:50:57,855 --> 01:50:59,515
<i>I can't tell you how pleased I am</i>

1140
01:50:59,648 --> 01:51:02,815
<i>about the little Revolutionary Road
place, Howard.</i>

1141
01:51:03,277 --> 01:51:06,194
And now whenever I drive past,
it gives me such a lift

1142
01:51:06,322 --> 01:51:09,904
to see it all perked up
and spanking clean again.

1143
01:51:10,534 --> 01:51:12,906
All the lights in all the windows.

1144
01:51:14,038 --> 01:51:18,201
And do you know? I was just thinking,
I've loved that little house for years.

1145
01:51:18,334 --> 01:51:22,794
And the Braces are the only really
suitable people I've ever found for it.

1146
01:51:23,422 --> 01:51:26,210
Really nice, congenial people, I mean.

1147
01:51:26,343 --> 01:51:29,012
Well, except for the Wheelers,
you mean.

1148
01:51:31,056 --> 01:51:33,428
I was very fond of the Wheelers.

1149
01:51:34,309 --> 01:51:37,725
They were a bit whimsical for my taste.
A bit neurotic.

1150
01:51:38,897 --> 01:51:40,177
I never stressed it, but they were often

1151
01:51:40,315 --> 01:51:43,435
very trying people
to deal with, in many ways.

1152
01:51:44,778 --> 01:51:49,523
And actually, the main reason
that the little house was so hard to sell

1153
01:51:49,699 --> 01:51:52,784
was because they let it depreciate
so dreadfully.

1154
01:51:52,911 --> 01:51:58,534
Warped window frames, wet cellar,
crayon marks all over the walls,

1155
01:51:58,667 --> 01:52:01,621
filthy smudges around the door knobs
and the fixtures...
