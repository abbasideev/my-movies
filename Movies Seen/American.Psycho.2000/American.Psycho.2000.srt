1
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:12,747
rare roasted partridge breast
in raspberry coulis
with a sorrel timbale.

2
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:16,083
...and grilled
free-range rabbit
with herbed french fries.

3
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:20,003
Our pasta tonight is
a squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth.

4
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:28,720
God, I hate this place.
It's a chick's restaurant.
Why aren't we at Dorsia?

5
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:30,805
Because Bateman won't give
the maitre d' head.

6
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:35,893
Is that Reed Robinson
over there?

7
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:38,979
- Are you freebasing or what?
That's not Robinson.
- Well, who is it then?

8
00:02:39,146 --> 00:02:41,982
- It's Paul Allen.
- That's not Paul Allen.

9
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,442
Paul Allen's
on the other side
of the room over there.

10
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:46,486
Who's he with?
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

11
00:02:46,694 --> 00:02:48,446
They don't have a good bathroom
to do coke in.

12
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:51,407
Are you sure
that's Paul Allen over there?
Yes, McDufus, I am.

13
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:54,035
- He's handling
the Fisher account.
- Lucky bastard.

14
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:58,539
- Lucky Jew bastard.
- Jesus, McDermott, what does
that have to do with anything?

15
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:00,540
I've seen that bastard
sitting in his office...

16
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:02,709
talking on the phone
to the C.E.O.s,
spinnin' a fuckin' menorah.

17
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:05,295
Not a menorah.
You spin a dreidel.

18
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,297
Oh, my God, Bateman.

19
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:10,341
Do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes?
Some latkes?

20
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:14,095
No, just... cool it with
the anti-Semitic remarks.

21
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:18,307
Oh, I forgot.
Bateman's dating someone
from the A.C.L.U.

22
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:21,268
He's the voice of reason.
The boy next door.

23
00:03:21,476 --> 00:03:24,854
Speaking of reasonable...
Only $570.

24
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:27,899
That's not bad.

25
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,026
A little something
for the purse.

26
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:32,028
Give her the 50.

27
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:12,982
Stoli on the rocks.

28
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,443
These aren't good anymore.
It's a cash bar.

29
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:18,779
That'll be $25.

30
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,034
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

31
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:26,703
I wanna stab you to death...

32
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:29,372
and play around
with your blood.

33
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:42,217
What can I get
for you two?

34
00:05:07,157 --> 00:05:09,117
I live in the
American Gardens building...

35
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:11,702
on West 81st Street
on the 11th floor.

36
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:14,914
My name is Patrick Bateman.

37
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:16,915
I'm 27 years old.

38
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:20,252
I believe in
taking care of myself,

39
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,256
in a balanced diet,
in a rigorous exercise routine.

40
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:27,759
In the morning,
if my face is a little puffy,

41
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:30,928
I'll put on an ice pack
while doing my stomach crunches.

42
00:05:31,137 --> 00:05:32,930
I can do a thousand now.

43
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:54,408
After I remove the ice pack,
I use a deep pore
cleanser lotion.

44
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:57,786
In the shower, I use
a water-activated gel cleanser.

45
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:02,457
Then
a honey-almond body scrub.

46
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:06,252
And on the face,
an exfoliating gel scrub.

47
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:18,305
Then I apply
an herb mint facial masque,

48
00:06:18,514 --> 00:06:22,434
which I leave on for ten minutes
while I prepare the rest
of my routine.

49
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:28,982
I always use
an aftershave lotion
with little or no alcohol,

50
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,860
because alcohol
dries your face out
and makes you look older.

51
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:34,862
Then moisturizer,

52
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:36,947
then an anti-aging eye balm,

53
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:40,492
followed by a final
moisturizing protective lotion.

54
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:45,163
There is an idea
of a Patrick Bateman.

55
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:49,375
Some kind of abstraction,
but there is no real me.

56
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,336
Only an entity...
something illusory.

57
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,005
And though I can hide
my cold gaze...

58
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:58,258
and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh
gripping yours...

59
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:03,138
and maybe you can even sense
our lifestyles
are probably comparable,

60
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:06,516
I simply am not there.

61
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:31,414
Good morning.

62
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:34,708
Good morning, Hamilton.
Nice tan.

63
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:43,383
Late.
Aerobics class. Sorry.
Any messages?

64
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:46,970
Ricky Harrison has to cancel.
He didn't say what
he was cancelling or why.

65
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:50,556
I occasionally box with Ricky
at the Harvard Club.
Anyone else?

66
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:53,809
Spencer wants to meet
for drinks at Fluties, Pier 17.
When?

67
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:56,979
After 6:00.
And what should I say?
Negative. Cancel it.

68
00:07:57,146 --> 00:08:00,899
Just say "no."
Just say "no"?

69
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:02,692
Okay, Jean.

70
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:05,320
I need reservations for three
at Camols at 12:30,

71
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:07,280
and if not there
try Crayons.

72
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,907
All right?
Yes, sir.

73
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:15,329
Oh, wait. And I need
reservations for two at Arcadia
at 8:00 on Thursday.

74
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,289
Something romantic?

75
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,500
No.

76
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,087
Silly. Forget it.
I'll make them.

77
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,089
No, I'll do it.
No, no.

78
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:30,385
Be a doll and just get me
a mineral water, okay?
You look nice today.

79
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,054
Don't wear that outfit again.

80
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,097
What? I didn't hear you.

81
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,766
I said, do not wear
that outfit again.

82
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:40,894
Wear a dress, a skirt
or something.
You don't like this, I take it.

83
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,189
Come on.
You're prettier than that.

84
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:47,650
- Thanks, Patrick.
-
- I'm not here.

85
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:52,488
And high heels.
I like high heels.

86
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:01,330
Feathered friends for 600.

87
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:03,707
During courtship,
the male frigate bird...

88
00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:06,251
inflates to enormous size
the red pouch found here.

89
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:23,475
And I want
hundreds of thousands of roses.

90
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:25,852
And lots of
chocolate truffles,

91
00:09:26,102 --> 00:09:28,396
Godiva, and oysters
in the half shell.

92
00:09:28,563 --> 00:09:31,357
I'm trying to listen to
the new Robert Palmer tape,

93
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:35,861
but Evelyn,
my supposed fianc?,
keeps buzzing in my ear.

94
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:39,323
Annie Leibovitz.
We'll get Annie Leibovitz.

95
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:41,742
And we'll have to get
someone to videotape.

96
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,036
Patrick,
we should do it.

97
00:09:45,203 --> 00:09:48,498
Do what?
Get married.
Have a wedding.

98
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:50,792
No. I can't take
the time off work.

99
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,336
Your father practically owns
the company. You can do
anything you like, silly.

100
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:56,046
- I don't want to talk about it.
- I hate that job anyway.

101
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,090
I don't see why
you just don't quit.

102
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:02,719
Because I want to fit in.

103
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:15,898
Williams party.

104
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:18,984
I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace,

105
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:22,070
since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.

106
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:26,616
But we do,
and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.

107
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:30,870
Patrick,
this is my cousin Vanden
and her boyfriend Stash.

108
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,331
They're both artists.
The menu's in braille.

109
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:36,959
I see you've met everyone.
You look awful.

110
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:40,212
Okay. All right.

111
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,380
I'm fairly certain that...

112
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:45,884
Timothy Bryce and Evelyn
are having an affair.

113
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:48,761
Timothy is the only
interesting person I know.

114
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,306
I'm almost
completely indifferent
as to whether Evelyn knows...

115
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:57,394
I'm having an affair
with Courtney Rawlinson,
her closest friend.

116
00:10:57,603 --> 00:10:59,438
Courtney is almost
perfect looking.

117
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:03,108
She's usually operating on
one or more psychiatric drugs.

118
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:05,568
Tonight, I believe,
it's Xanax.
Mmm. Oh.

119
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:08,780
More disturbing than her
drug use, though, is the fact
that she's engaged...

120
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,450
to Luis Carruthers,
the biggest doofus
in the business.

121
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:14,827
Tell me, Stash.

122
00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:18,455
Do you think Soho
is becoming too...
commercial?

123
00:11:18,622 --> 00:11:21,833
- Yes. I read that.
- Oh, who gives a rat's ass?

124
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:23,919
Hey, that affects us.

125
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:27,922
Well, what about the massacres
in Sri Lanka, honey?
Doesn't that affect us too?

126
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:29,924
Do you know anything about
Sri Lanka?

127
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:32,093
How, like, the Sikhs are killing
tons of Israelis over there?

128
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:34,220
Come on, Bryce.

129
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:37,598
There are a lot more
important problems
than Sri Lanka to worry about.

130
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:41,184
- Like what?
- Well, we have to
end apartheid, for one,

131
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:46,648
slow down the nuclear arms race,
stop terrorism and world hunger.

132
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,485
We have to provide
food and shelter
for the homeless...

133
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:54,780
and oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights,

134
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:57,741
while also promoting
equal rights for women.

135
00:11:57,908 --> 00:12:00,160
We have to encourage
a return...

136
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:02,871
to traditional moral values.

137
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:05,373
Most importantly,

138
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:09,669
we have to promote
general social concern...

139
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,673
and less materialism
in young people.

140
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,468
Patrick,
how thought provoking.

141
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:55,878
Hello.

142
00:12:57,838 --> 00:12:59,673
Hello.

143
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:20,400
Bleaching? Are you
trying to say "bleaching"?

144
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:22,444
Oh, my God.
Two things.

145
00:13:22,611 --> 00:13:24,446
One: You can't bleach a Cerruti.
Out of the question.

146
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:27,407
Two: I can only get
these sheets in Santa Fe.

147
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:29,492
These are very expensive sheets,
and I really need them cleaned.

148
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:33,162
Lady, if you don't shut
your fucking mouth,
I will kill you.

149
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:34,789
Now, listen.

150
00:13:34,955 --> 00:13:37,416
I have a lunch meeting
at Hubert's in 20 minutes
with Ronald Harrison.

151
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,334
I need those sheets
cleaned by this afternoon.

152
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:42,754
Listen, I can't understand you!
This is crazy!
You're a fool.

153
00:13:42,963 --> 00:13:44,839
I can't cope with this
stupid "bitchee"!

154
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:47,467
Understand?
Christ.
Patrick?

155
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:49,886
Hi, Patrick.

156
00:13:50,136 --> 00:13:53,139
I thought that was you.
Hello.
This is...

157
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:56,600
Isn't it ridiculous,
coming all the way up here?
They really are the best.

158
00:13:56,725 --> 00:13:58,644
Then why can't they
get these stains out?

159
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:02,147
I mean, can you talk
to these people or something?
I'm not getting anywhere.

160
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:05,191
- Oh, what are those?
- Well, it's...

161
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:08,444
- Cranberry juice.
Cranapple.
- Really?

162
00:14:08,611 --> 00:14:11,280
Listen, if you
could talk to them,
I would really appreciate it.

163
00:14:11,447 --> 00:14:14,450
I'm really late.
I have a lunch appointment
at Hubert's in 15 minutes.

164
00:14:14,617 --> 00:14:16,827
Hubert's?
That moved uptown, right?
Oh, boy.

165
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:19,204
Listen, I've gotta go.
Thank you, Victoria.

166
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:21,206
Maybe we could do lunch
one day next week.

167
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:24,834
I'm downtown quite often.
What about a Saturday?
I'm at work all the time.

168
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:28,588
Next Saturday?
Can't, I'm afraid.
Sure.

169
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:30,757
At a matinee of Les Mis.
Listen, I really gotta go.

170
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:34,218
Oh, Christ.
I'll call you.
Okay. Do.

171
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:36,720
Listen, you're dating Lewis,
he's in Arizona.

172
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:38,722
You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans.

173
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:40,641
What could you possibly
be up to tonight?

174
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:43,560
Stop it. I'm...
On a lot of lithium?

175
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:46,938
Waiting for Luis to call me.
He said he'd call tonight.

176
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:50,650
Pumpkin? Pumpkin,
you're dating an asshole.

177
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:54,487
Mm-hmm.
Pumpkin, you're dating the
biggest dickweed in New York.

178
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:58,657
Pumpkin, you're dating
a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.

179
00:14:58,907 --> 00:15:01,868
Patrick, stop calling me
pumpkin, okay?

180
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:05,372
I have to go.
Courtney?

181
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,373
Hmm?
Dinner.

182
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,001
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.

183
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:15,422
Dorsia's nice.
Wear something fabulous.

184
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:17,466
Oh, yeah!

185
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:29,769
Dorsia.

186
00:15:29,977 --> 00:15:32,021
Um, yes, I know
it's a little late,

187
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,734
but is it possible
to reserve a table for two
at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps?

188
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:57,378
...a facial at Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing.

189
00:15:57,503 --> 00:16:00,631
And then,
to the Pottery Barn,

190
00:16:00,797 --> 00:16:04,009
where I got this little...

191
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:07,554
silver muffin dish.
Is that Donald Trump's car?

192
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,597
God, Patrick.
Shut up.

193
00:16:09,764 --> 00:16:12,433
You know, Courtney, you should
take some more lithium
or have a Diet Coke.

194
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,394
Some caffeine might get you
out of this slump.

195
00:16:15,603 --> 00:16:18,230
I just want a child.

196
00:16:18,397 --> 00:16:20,899
Just two...

197
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:23,527
perfect...

198
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:25,945
children.

199
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:32,702
Are we here?
Yeah.

200
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:43,587
This is Dorsia?
Yes, dear.

201
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,381
Courtney, you're gonna have
the peanut butter soup...

202
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,050
with smoked duck
and mashed squash.

203
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,012
New York Matinee called it
"a playful but
mysterious little dish."

204
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,932
You'll love it.
And then the red snapper
with violets and pine nuts.

205
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,934
I think that'll
follow nicely.

206
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,813
Mmm.
Thanks, Patrick.

207
00:17:09,152 --> 00:17:11,863
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.

208
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:14,824
Dorsia.
How impressive.

209
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,076
How on Earth did you get
a reservation there?

210
00:17:17,284 --> 00:17:19,453
Lucky, I guess.

211
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,455
That's a wonderful suit.

212
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,874
Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

213
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,918
Mmm, Valentino Couture?

214
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:29,087
Uh-huh.
Hmm.

215
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:32,298
It looks so soft.
Your compliment
was sufficient, Luis.

216
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:39,179
Hello, Halberstram.
Nice tie.
How the hell are you?

217
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:42,474
Allen has mistaken me for this
dickhead, Marcus Halberstram.

218
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:45,185
It seems logical because
Marcus also works at P&P,

219
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:47,729
and in fact does
the same exact thing I do.

220
00:17:47,937 --> 00:17:51,816
He also has a penchant
for Valentino suits
and Oliver Peoples glasses.

221
00:17:52,024 --> 00:17:53,818
Marcus and I
even go to the same barber,

222
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:56,111
although I have
a slightly better haircut.

223
00:17:56,278 --> 00:17:59,531
- How's the Ransom account
going, Marcus?
- It's, uh, all right.

224
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:01,950
Really? That's interesting.
It's not, uh, not great.

225
00:18:02,117 --> 00:18:04,703
- Oh, well, you know.
- So, how's Cecilia?

226
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:07,497
- She's a great girl.
- Oh, yeah. I'm very lucky.

227
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:10,666
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Allen, congratulations
on the Fisher account.

228
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,419
- Thank you, Baxter.
- Listen, Paul. Squash.

229
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:21,510
Call me.
How about Friday?

230
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:26,014
No can do.
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.

231
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:29,600
Great sea urchin ceviche.

232
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:31,686
Dorsia on Friday night?
How'd he swing that?

233
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:33,688
I think he's lying.

234
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:39,526
- Is that a gram?
- New card.

235
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:42,529
What do you think?

236
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:45,156
Whoa-ho.
Very nice.

237
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:49,160
Look at that.
Picked them up from
the printer's yesterday.

238
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:51,162
Good coloring.
That's bone.

239
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,789
And the lettering is something
called Silian Rail.

240
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:57,418
It's very cool, Bateman,
but that's nothing.
Look at this.

241
00:18:57,543 --> 00:18:59,795
That is really nice.

242
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:03,840
Eggshell with Romalian type.
What do you think?

243
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:06,759
Nice.

244
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:11,389
Jesus. That is really super.
How'd a nitwit like you
get so tasteful?

245
00:19:11,556 --> 00:19:13,933
I can't believe that Bryce...

246
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,935
prefers Van Patten's card
to mine.

247
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:19,897
But wait.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

248
00:19:21,732 --> 00:19:27,237
Raised lettering,
pale nimbus... white.

249
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:29,906
Impressive.
Very nice.

250
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:32,033
Hmm.

251
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:34,326
Let's see Paul Allen's card.

252
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:50,758
Look at that subtle
off-white coloring.

253
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:53,761
The tasteful thickness of it.

254
00:19:53,928 --> 00:19:57,014
Oh, my God.
It even has a watermark.

255
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:04,312
Is something wrong,
Patrick?

256
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,314
You're sweating.

257
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,468
Hello. Pat Bateman.

258
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:39,469
You want some, uh, money?

259
00:20:39,678 --> 00:20:41,471
Some food?

260
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:46,309
- Is this what you need?
- I'm-I'm hungry.

261
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:48,311
Yeah.
Cold out too, isn't it?

262
00:20:53,274 --> 00:20:56,527
Why don't you get a job?
If you're so hungry,
why don't you get a job?

263
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:58,529
I lost my job.

264
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:00,656
Why? You drinking?

265
00:21:00,822 --> 00:21:04,367
Is that why you lost it?
Insider trading?

266
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:06,661
Just joking.

267
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,872
Listen, what's your name?
Al.

268
00:21:10,081 --> 00:21:11,916
Hmm? Speak up.
Come on.
Al.

269
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,251
Get a goddamn job, Al.

270
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:17,463
You got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you.

271
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:21,091
You gotta get your act together.
I'll help you.

272
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:24,970
You are so kind, mister.
You're a kind...
You're a kind man.

273
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:26,971
It's okay.
I can tell.

274
00:21:27,138 --> 00:21:30,391
Please, you gotta tell me
what to do.
You gotta help me.

275
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:33,394
I'm so cold,
I'm hungry.

276
00:21:33,602 --> 00:21:36,063
You know how bad you smell?

277
00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:39,233
You reek of shit.
Do you know that?

278
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:42,611
Al.

279
00:21:42,778 --> 00:21:45,655
I'm sorry.
It's just that...

280
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:47,699
I don't know.

281
00:21:49,117 --> 00:21:51,369
I don't have anything
in common with you.

282
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,254
Oh.
Oh, thank you, mister.
Thank you.

283
00:22:02,462 --> 00:22:05,465
I'm cold out here.

284
00:22:05,632 --> 00:22:07,467
You know what
a fucking loser you are?
What?

285
00:22:33,157 --> 00:22:35,826
What beautiful skin you have,
Mr. Bateman.

286
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:39,079
So fine,
so smooth.

287
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:49,088
I have all the characteristics
of a human being...

288
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:52,758
flesh, blood, skin, hair...

289
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:56,136
but not a single, clear,
identifiable emotion,

290
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:59,640
except for greed and disgust.

291
00:22:59,806 --> 00:23:02,350
Something horrible
is happening inside of me,

292
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:04,352
and I don't know why.

293
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:09,607
My nightly blood lust
has overflowed into my days.

294
00:23:09,732 --> 00:23:13,361
I feel lethal,
on the verge of frenzy.

295
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:16,655
I think my mask of sanity
is about to slip.

296
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:32,003
Hey, McCloy,
what do you say?

297
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:34,547
Hey, Hamilton.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas.

298
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:38,842
Is Allen still handling
the Fisher account?
Of course. Who else?

299
00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:41,887
Mistletoe alert.
Merry Xmas, Patrick.

300
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:44,472
Merry Xmas, Harry.
Merry Christmas.

301
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:46,808
You're late, honey.
Oh, yes, you are.
I'm not late.

302
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:50,019
I've been here the entire time.
You just didn't see me.

303
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:54,148
Say hello to Snowball.
Snowball says,
"Merry Christmas, Patrick."

304
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:57,693
What is it?
It's a little baby
piggly-wiggly, isn't it?

305
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,195
It's a Vietnamese
potbellied pig.

306
00:24:00,404 --> 00:24:02,656
They make darling pets.
Don't you?

307
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:05,033
Don't you?

308
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:08,161
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a grinch.

309
00:24:08,328 --> 00:24:10,455
And what does Mr. Grinch
want for Christmas?

310
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:12,790
And don't say
breast implants again.

311
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:18,378
Allen.
Marcus.
Merry Christmas.

312
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:21,548
How you been?
Workaholic, I suppose?
Haven't seen you in a while.

313
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:25,677
Hey, Hamilton.
We're goin' to Nell's.
Limo's out front.

314
00:24:25,885 --> 00:24:29,055
We should have dinner.
Maybe you could bring...

315
00:24:29,263 --> 00:24:32,058
Cecilla?
Yes, Cecilla.

316
00:24:32,224 --> 00:24:34,393
Oh, Cecilla would adore it.

317
00:24:34,602 --> 00:24:37,146
Well, then,
let's do it, Marcus.

318
00:24:37,312 --> 00:24:39,064
Great party.
Thanks.

319
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:41,400
Patrick, why is he
calling you Marcus?

320
00:24:41,608 --> 00:24:44,110
Mistletoe alert.

321
00:24:52,535 --> 00:24:54,954
Marcus Halberstram
for two at 7:00.

322
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:00,709
No, I want to know, okay?
I came here for
the cilantro crawfish gumbo,

323
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:04,379
which is, after all,
the only excuse one could have
for being in this restaurant,

324
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:06,881
which is, by the way,
almost completely empty.

325
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,468
I'm very sorry, sir.
J&B straight,
and a Corona.

326
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,262
Would you like to hear...
Double Absolut martini.

327
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,389
Yes, sir.
Would you like to hear
the specials?

328
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,891
Not if you want
to keep your spleen.

329
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,981
This is a real beehive
of activity, Halberstram.
This place is hot.

330
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:28,901
Very hot.
Listen, the mud soup
and charcoal arugula...

331
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,945
are outrageous here.

332
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,322
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce.

333
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:35,950
Give me a break.

334
00:25:36,158 --> 00:25:41,246
I see they've omitted
the pork loin with lime Jell-O.
We should've gone to Dorsia.

335
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:43,999
I could've gotten us
a table.
Nobody goes there anymore.

336
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,753
Is that Ivana Trump?

337
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,715
Oh, geez, Patrick.
I mean, Marcus.
What are you thinking?

338
00:25:52,923 --> 00:25:56,594
Why would Ivana
be at Texarkana?

339
00:25:56,719 --> 00:26:00,681
So, uh,
wasn't Rothchild originally
handling the Fisher account?

340
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:05,268
How'd you get it?
Well, I could
tell you that, Halberstram,

341
00:26:05,518 --> 00:26:07,687
but then I'd have to
kill you.

342
00:26:14,527 --> 00:26:18,322
I like to dissect girls.
Did you know
I'm utterly insane?

343
00:26:21,366 --> 00:26:23,618
Great tan, Marcus.
I mean, really impressive.

344
00:26:23,785 --> 00:26:25,495
Where do you tan?
Salon.

345
00:26:25,662 --> 00:26:27,830
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.

346
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:31,209
And, uh, Cecilla.

347
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:33,544
How is she?
Where is she tonight?

348
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:36,505
Cecilla's, uh...
Well, you know Cecilla.

349
00:26:36,714 --> 00:26:39,216
I think she's having dinner
with, um, Evelyn Williams.

350
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:42,177
Evelyn?
Great ass.

351
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:45,930
Goes out with that loser
Patrick Bateman.
What a dork.

352
00:26:46,097 --> 00:26:49,183
Another martini, Paul?

353
00:26:55,022 --> 00:26:56,857
You like
Huey Lewis and the News?

354
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:59,109
Um, they're okay.

355
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:04,906
They're early work was a little
too new wave for my taste.

356
00:27:05,115 --> 00:27:07,951
But when Sports
came out in '83,

357
00:27:08,117 --> 00:27:11,078
I think they really
came into their own,
commercially and artistically.

358
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:17,001
The whole album has
a clear, crisp sound,

359
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:19,795
and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism...

360
00:27:19,962 --> 00:27:23,089
that really gives the songs
a big boost.

361
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:34,809
He's been compared
to Elvis Costello,

362
00:27:35,017 --> 00:27:39,521
but I think Huey has
a far more bitter,
cynical sense of humor.

363
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:41,481
Hey, Halberstram?
Yes, Allen?

364
00:27:41,648 --> 00:27:44,401
Why are there copies
of the Style section
all over the place?

365
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:49,364
Do you...
Do you have a dog?
A little chow or something?

366
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,325
- No, Allen.
- Is that a raincoat?

367
00:27:52,491 --> 00:27:54,660
Yes, it is.

368
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:57,329
In '87, Huey released this...

369
00:27:57,496 --> 00:27:59,331
Fore, their most
accomplished album.

370
00:27:59,498 --> 00:28:03,084
I think their undisputed
masterpiece is
"Hip To Be Square."

371
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:05,920
The song's so catchy,
most people probably
don't listen to the lyrics.

372
00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:08,464
But they should,
because it's not just about...

373
00:28:08,631 --> 00:28:11,425
the pleasures of conformity
and the importance of trends.

374
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:15,721
It's also a personal statement
about the band itself.
Hey, Paul!

375
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:24,271
Try getting a reservation
at Dorsia now,

376
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:27,482
you fuckin' stupid bastard!

377
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:31,444
You fucking bastard!

378
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:34,376
He was completely naked
and standing up
on the table.

379
00:29:34,585 --> 00:29:36,962
He had no clothes on
whatsoever, and he...

380
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:38,964
Patrick?
Patrick.

381
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:41,633
Is that you?

382
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,970
No, Luis, it's not me.
You're mistaken.

383
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:47,138
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.

384
00:29:47,305 --> 00:29:51,392
Where are you going?
We're going to Nell's.
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

385
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,228
Ooh.

386
00:29:55,813 --> 00:29:57,648
Where did you get
that overnight bag?

387
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,194
Jean-Paul Gaultier.

388
00:30:13,537 --> 00:30:15,372
When I get
to Paul Allen's place,

389
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,416
I use the keys
I took from his pocket...

390
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,501
before disposing
of the body.

391
00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:22,712
There is a moment
of sheer panic...

392
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:27,175
when I realize that Paul's
apartment overlooks the park...

393
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:29,886
and is obviously
more expensive than mine.

394
00:30:33,305 --> 00:30:35,891
I calm myself
and move into the bedroom,

395
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,061
where I find his suitcase
and start to pack.

396
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:41,980
It's time for Paul
to take a little trip.

397
00:30:44,983 --> 00:30:47,110
Where do I send the bastard?

398
00:30:47,277 --> 00:30:49,112
Dallas?

399
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,739
Paris? Singapore?

400
00:30:51,948 --> 00:30:54,992
London? I'll send
the asshole to London.

401
00:31:00,163 --> 00:31:03,458
Hi. This is Paul.

402
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,585
I've been called away
to London for a few days.

403
00:31:05,794 --> 00:31:08,963
Meredith, I'll call you
when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.

404
00:31:34,695 --> 00:31:36,488
What is it?

405
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:40,158
Patrick.
Yes, Jean?

406
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:43,453
There's a Mr. Donald Kimball
here to see you.
Who?

407
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:46,122
Detective Donald Kimball.

408
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:51,252
Tell him I'm at lunch.

409
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:55,798
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.

410
00:31:55,965 --> 00:31:58,217
Send him in, I guess.

411
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:09,060
Now, John,
you've gotta wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.

412
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,980
There are definite
do's and don'ts, good buddy,
of wearing a bold-striped shirt.

413
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,482
A bold-striped shirt
calls for solid-colored...

414
00:32:15,608 --> 00:32:17,943
or discreetly patterned
suits and ties.

415
00:32:18,152 --> 00:32:21,488
Yes, always tip the stylist
15 percent.

416
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:25,325
Listen, John, I've gotta go.
T. Boone Pickens just walked in.

417
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:30,121
Just joking.
No, don't tip the owner
of the salon.

418
00:32:30,288 --> 00:32:32,123
Okay, John? Right.

419
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:35,376
Got it.
Sorry about that.

420
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,003
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.

421
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,005
Was that anything important?

422
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:43,091
Oh, that?
Just mulling over
business problems,

423
00:32:43,258 --> 00:32:47,554
examining opportunities,
exchanging rumors,
spreading gossip.

424
00:32:47,762 --> 00:32:50,848
Hi.

425
00:32:51,098 --> 00:32:53,893
I'm Donald Kimball.
Hi. Pat Bateman.

426
00:32:54,101 --> 00:32:56,228
Nice to meet you.
Sorry to barge in on you
like this.

427
00:32:56,395 --> 00:32:58,313
I know how busy
you guys can get.

428
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:05,070
So, what's the, uh,
topic of discussion?

429
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:07,614
I've been hired
by Meredith Powell...

430
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,783
to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.

431
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:15,037
I see, yeah.
Paul's disappearance, yeah.

432
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:17,206
So it's nothing
that official.

433
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:20,459
- I just have some questions
about Paul Allen and yourself.
- Coffee?

434
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,669
- No, I'm okay.
- Apollinaris?

435
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:24,713
No, I'm okay.

436
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:27,340
Can you bring Mr...

437
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:30,093
Kimball. No, I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball
a bottle of Apollinaris.

438
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:32,303
It's no problem.

439
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,099
So, what's the topic
of discussion?

440
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,810
The disappearance
of Paul Allen.

441
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:43,522
Uh-huh, right.
Well, I, um, haven't...

442
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,234
I haven't heard anything about
the disappearance or anything.

443
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,445
Not on page six, at least.

444
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:54,198
- I think his family
wants this kept quiet.
- Understandable. Lime?

445
00:33:54,406 --> 00:33:58,327
- No, really, I'm okay.
- You sure? I can always
get you a lime.

446
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,455
Just some preliminary
questions that I need
for my own files, okay?

447
00:34:01,621 --> 00:34:03,456
Shoot.

448
00:34:03,665 --> 00:34:06,042
Hold old are you?
Twenty-seven.

449
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:08,044
Where did you go
to school?
Harvard.

450
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:10,755
Then Harvard Business School.
Your address?

451
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:13,049
The American Gardens Building,
West 81st Street.

452
00:34:13,215 --> 00:34:16,677
- Nice. Very nice.
- Thanks.

453
00:34:16,844 --> 00:34:20,430
What can you tell me
about Paul Allen?
I'm at a loss.

454
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:23,350
He was part of that whole
Yale thing.
"Yale thing"?

455
00:34:23,517 --> 00:34:26,269
- Yeah, Yale thing.
- What do you mean,
"Yale thing"?

456
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:30,314
Well, I think for one
that he was probably
a closet homosexual...

457
00:34:30,523 --> 00:34:32,316
who did a lot of cocaine.

458
00:34:32,525 --> 00:34:34,527
That "Yale thing."

459
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:38,697
What kind of man was he,
besides the information
you've just given?

460
00:34:38,906 --> 00:34:41,616
- I hope I'm not being
cross-examined here.
- You feel like that?

461
00:34:41,742 --> 00:34:43,743
No, not really.

462
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:47,747
Where did Paul hang out?

463
00:34:47,914 --> 00:34:49,749
Hang out?
Yeah, you know, hang out.

464
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:54,003
Let me think.
Um, the Newport, Harry's,

465
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,963
Fluties, Indochine,

466
00:34:56,171 --> 00:34:58,006
Nell's, the Cornell Club,

467
00:34:58,215 --> 00:35:00,467
the New York Yacht Club.
He had a yacht?

468
00:35:00,634 --> 00:35:04,471
- No, he just hung out there.
- And where did he
go to school?

469
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:07,056
Don't you know this?

470
00:35:07,265 --> 00:35:09,142
I just wanted to know
if you know.

471
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:16,315
Before Yale,
if I remember correctly,
St. Paul's.

472
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:19,359
Listen, I just...
I just wanna help.

473
00:35:19,526 --> 00:35:22,446
I understand.

474
00:35:25,073 --> 00:35:26,866
Do you have any witnesses
or fingerprints?

475
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:31,037
Well, there's a message
on his answering machine
that says he went to London.

476
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:33,706
- Well, maybe he did, huh?
- His girlfriend
doesn't think so.

477
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,833
- But has anyone seen him
in London?
- Actually, yes.

478
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:39,169
Hmm.
But I've had a hard time
getting actual verification.

479
00:35:39,378 --> 00:35:43,089
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there.

480
00:35:43,256 --> 00:35:45,091
But I checked it out,
and what happened is...

481
00:35:45,258 --> 00:35:47,510
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth
for Paul, so...

482
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:50,888
- Had his apartment
been burglarized?
- No, actually, it hadn't.

483
00:35:51,055 --> 00:35:54,475
Toiletries were missing,
a suit was gone, so was
some luggage. That's it.

484
00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:56,977
I mean, no one's dealing with
the homicide squad yet
or anything, right?

485
00:35:57,144 --> 00:35:59,521
No, not yet.
As I said, we're not sure.

486
00:35:59,688 --> 00:36:01,898
Basically, no one's seen
or heard anything.

487
00:36:02,107 --> 00:36:04,818
So typical, isn't it?
It's just strange.

488
00:36:05,026 --> 00:36:07,445
One day,
someone's walking around,

489
00:36:07,612 --> 00:36:10,031
going to work, alive,
and then...

490
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,533
Nothing.

491
00:36:12,658 --> 00:36:14,535
People just disappear.

492
00:36:14,702 --> 00:36:18,288
The earth just...
opens up and swallows them.

493
00:36:19,748 --> 00:36:22,667
Eerie.
Really eerie.

494
00:36:28,464 --> 00:36:30,508
Listen, you'll have
to excuse me.

495
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:34,804
I have a lunch meeting
with Cliff Huxtable
at Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

496
00:36:35,012 --> 00:36:38,765
The Four Seasons?
Isn't that a little far uptown?

497
00:36:39,016 --> 00:36:42,310
I mean, aren't you
gonna be late?
No, there's one down here.

498
00:36:42,477 --> 00:36:44,813
Oh, really?
I didn't know that.
Yeah, it's very good.

499
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:49,067
Listen, if anything else
occurs to you,
any information...

500
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:51,819
Absolutely.
I'm 100 percent with you.
Great.

501
00:36:51,986 --> 00:36:55,531
And thanks for your time,
Mr. Bateman.

502
00:36:59,576 --> 00:37:01,411
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.

503
00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:04,177
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been lookin'.

504
00:38:04,344 --> 00:38:08,640
- Would you like to see
my apartment?
- I'm not supposed to.

505
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:12,268
Do you wanna come
to my apartment or not?

506
00:38:14,812 --> 00:38:18,816
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.

507
00:38:20,692 --> 00:38:22,527
Do you take a credit card?

508
00:38:22,694 --> 00:38:25,113
I'm joking.

509
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:27,240
Come on. Get in.

510
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,835
I'd like a girl.
Early 20s.

511
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,255
Blonde,
who does couples.
Couples.

512
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:47,717
And I really can't stress
blonde enough. Blonde.

513
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,430
I'm Paul.

514
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,724
My name's Paul Allen.
You got that?

515
00:38:55,975 --> 00:38:59,811
You're Christie.
You're to respond
only to Christie.

516
00:38:59,978 --> 00:39:01,813
Is that clear?

517
00:39:12,031 --> 00:39:13,866
That's a very fine chardonnay
you're drinking.

518
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:16,702
I want you
to clean your vagina.

519
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,880
No. From behind.
Get on your knees.

520
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:31,799
You have a very nice body.

521
00:39:42,392 --> 00:39:44,394
Mm-hmm?

522
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:47,146
Thank you. Send her up.

523
00:39:49,899 --> 00:39:52,985
Christie,
get out and dry off.

524
00:39:53,152 --> 00:39:55,863
Choose a robe...
not the Bijan...

525
00:39:56,071 --> 00:40:00,492
and come and meet
me and our guest in
the living room for drinks.

526
00:40:07,415 --> 00:40:09,417
You've arrived.
How lovely.

527
00:40:09,584 --> 00:40:11,419
Let me take your coat.

528
00:40:11,586 --> 00:40:14,255
I'm Paul.
How good of you to come.

529
00:40:19,176 --> 00:40:20,969
Not quite blonde,
are you?

530
00:40:21,178 --> 00:40:22,971
More dirty blonde.

531
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,557
I'm gonna call you
Sabrina.

532
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:27,684
I'm Paul Allen.

533
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:48,995
So.

534
00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:50,997
Don't you wanna know
what I do?

535
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:58,003
No.
No, not really.

536
00:40:59,463 --> 00:41:02,674
Well, I work on Wall Street...

537
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:05,051
for Pierce & Pierce.

538
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,220
Have you heard of it?

539
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:19,106
You have a really
nice place here, Paul.

540
00:41:19,314 --> 00:41:21,191
How much
did you pay for it?

541
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:23,318
Well, actually,

542
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:26,196
that's none of your business,
Christie.

543
00:41:26,404 --> 00:41:30,032
But I can assure you,
it certainly wasn't cheap.

544
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:32,368
No. No smoking.
Not in here.

545
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,955
Varda truffle?

546
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:41,668
I don't want you to get drunk,

547
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:45,130
but that's a very fine
chardonnay you're not drinking.

548
00:41:52,637 --> 00:41:55,222
Do you like Phil Collins?

549
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:57,516
I've been a big Genesis fan
ever since the release...

550
00:41:57,683 --> 00:42:01,603
of their 1980 album Duke.

551
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:06,399
Before that,
I really didn't understand
any of their work.

552
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:09,485
It was too artsy,
too intellectual.

553
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,280
It was on Duke where...

554
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,324
Phil Collins' presence
became more apparent.

555
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,956
I think Invisible Touch
is the group's
undisputed masterpiece.

556
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:29,420
It's an epic meditation
on intangibility.

557
00:42:32,465 --> 00:42:35,217
At the same time,
it deepens and enriches...

558
00:42:35,384 --> 00:42:38,595
the meaning of
the preceding three albums.

559
00:42:38,804 --> 00:42:41,681
Christie,
take off the robe.

560
00:42:43,683 --> 00:42:45,769
Listen to the brilliant
ensemble playing...

561
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:48,521
of Banks, Collins
and Rutherford.

562
00:42:48,688 --> 00:42:52,942
You can practically hear
every nuance
of every instrument.

563
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,985
Sabrina, remove your dress.

564
00:42:56,779 --> 00:43:00,115
In terms of
lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer songwriting,

565
00:43:00,324 --> 00:43:03,285
this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.

566
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:05,745
Sabrina, why don't you,
uh, dance a little.

567
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,791
Take the lyrics to
"Land of Confusion."

568
00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:11,959
In this song,
Phil Collins...

569
00:43:12,126 --> 00:43:16,046
addresses the problems
of abusive political authority.

570
00:43:17,881 --> 00:43:21,885
"In Too Deep"
is the most moving pop song
of the 1980s...

571
00:43:22,094 --> 00:43:25,305
about monogamy and commitment.

572
00:43:25,472 --> 00:43:28,641
The song is
extremely uplifting.

573
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:32,103
Their lyrics are
as positive and affirmative...

574
00:43:32,311 --> 00:43:36,482
as, uh, anything
I've heard in rock.

575
00:43:40,152 --> 00:43:42,070
Christie,
get down on your knees...

576
00:43:42,237 --> 00:43:45,198
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

577
00:43:45,365 --> 00:43:47,951
Phil Collins' solo career...

578
00:43:48,117 --> 00:43:50,828
seems to be more commercial,

579
00:43:51,078 --> 00:43:54,081
and therefore more satisfying
in a narrower way,

580
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:58,710
especially songs like
"In the Air Tonight"
and "Against All Odds."

581
00:44:00,796 --> 00:44:02,631
Sabrina,
don't just stare at it.
Eat it.

582
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,719
I also think that
Phil Collins works best...

583
00:44:07,885 --> 00:44:11,722
within the confines
of the group
than as a solo artist.

584
00:44:11,931 --> 00:44:15,226
And I stress the word "artist."

585
00:44:19,313 --> 00:44:21,148
This is "Sussudio."

586
00:44:21,314 --> 00:44:24,192
A great, great song.
A personal favorite.

587
00:44:35,244 --> 00:44:40,707
Look at the camera.

588
00:45:35,073 --> 00:45:36,908
Don't touch the watch.

589
00:45:59,137 --> 00:46:00,972
Can we go now?

590
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:02,932
We're not through yet.

591
00:46:21,115 --> 00:46:24,410
If they have a good personality
and they're not great looking,
then who fucking cares?

592
00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:26,412
Let's just say
hypothetically, okay?

593
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,747
What if they have
a good personality?

594
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:31,917
I know.
I know.

595
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,586
There are no girls
with good personalities.

596
00:46:34,794 --> 00:46:37,505
A good personality consists
of a chick with
a little hard body...

597
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:39,424
who will satisfy
all sexual demands...

598
00:46:39,632 --> 00:46:41,425
without being too slutty
about things...

599
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:43,427
and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth shut.

600
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:45,471
The only girls
with good personalities...

601
00:46:45,638 --> 00:46:48,766
who are smart or maybe funny
or halfway intelligent
or talented...

602
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:51,768
though God knows
what the fuck that means...
are ugly chicks.

603
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,104
Absolutely.
And this is because
they have to make up...

604
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,980
for how fucking
unattractive they are.

605
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:59,275
- Do you know what Ed Gein
said about women?
- Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

606
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:03,279
- No, serial killer, Wisconsin,
in the 50s.
- And what did Ed say?

607
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,490
"When I see a pretty girl
walking down the street,
I think two things.

608
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,951
"One part of me wants to
take her out and talk to her,

609
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,453
be real nice and sweet
and treat her right."

610
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,997
- And what did the other part
of him think?

611
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,666
What her head would look like
on a stick.

612
00:47:21,504 --> 00:47:24,799
Hi, guys.
I wanna get your opinion
on something.

613
00:47:26,342 --> 00:47:28,594
It's my business card.

614
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:32,014
I decided to get
a new one too.

615
00:47:33,682 --> 00:47:35,517
Oh, it's...

616
00:47:35,684 --> 00:47:37,519
Very nice, Luis.

617
00:47:39,187 --> 00:47:40,938
Thank you.

618
00:47:54,868 --> 00:47:56,911
Listen, what about dinner?

619
00:47:57,078 --> 00:47:59,831
Is that all you ever have
to contribute, Van Patten?
"What about fucking dinner"?

620
00:47:59,998 --> 00:48:02,917
Cheer up there, Bateman.
What's the matter?
No shiatsu this morning?

621
00:48:03,084 --> 00:48:06,253
Keep touching me like that,
you'll draw back a stump.
Hold on there, little buddy.

622
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,255
Excuse me.

623
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:48,584
God. Patrick.
Why here?

624
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:51,253
I've seen you
looking at me.

625
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,548
I've noticed your...

626
00:48:54,756 --> 00:48:57,258
hot body.

627
00:48:57,425 --> 00:48:59,385
Don't be shy.

628
00:48:59,552 --> 00:49:01,596
You can't imagine how long
I've wanted this...

629
00:49:01,804 --> 00:49:04,348
ever since that Christmas party
at Arizona 206.

630
00:49:04,515 --> 00:49:07,685
You know, the one you were
wearing that red-striped
paisley Armani tie.

631
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:15,150
I want you.
I want you too.

632
00:49:15,317 --> 00:49:17,152
Patrick.
What is it?

633
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:20,321
Where are you going?

634
00:49:20,488 --> 00:49:23,157
I've gotta return
some video tapes.

635
00:49:30,831 --> 00:49:33,792
Patrick!

636
00:49:57,147 --> 00:49:59,274
Okay, London the...

637
00:49:59,482 --> 00:50:02,151
London, there's, um,
a reservation...
Any Paul Allen?

638
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,653
No.
A reservation, but...
Kimball!

639
00:50:04,862 --> 00:50:06,864
I've been wanting
to talk with you.
Come into my office.

640
00:50:07,072 --> 00:50:08,907
Jean, great jacket.
Matsuta?

641
00:50:09,074 --> 00:50:12,911
Do you remember
where you were the night
of Paul's disappearance,

642
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,955
which was on
the 20th of December?

643
00:50:15,121 --> 00:50:17,040
God.

644
00:50:17,207 --> 00:50:20,209
I guess I was probably
returning video tapes.

645
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:25,631
I had a date
with a girl named Veronica.

646
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,217
That's not what I've got.
What?

647
00:50:28,342 --> 00:50:30,594
That's not the information
I've received.

648
00:50:30,802 --> 00:50:32,971
Well, I... Wait.

649
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,016
- What information
have you received?
- Let me see.

650
00:50:36,224 --> 00:50:38,851
Well...

651
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:40,937
You were with...
Well, I could be wrong.

652
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:44,607
When was the last time
you were with Paul Allen?

653
00:50:44,857 --> 00:50:46,984
We'd gone to a new musical...

654
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:50,571
called
Oh, Africa, Brave Africa.

655
00:50:50,737 --> 00:50:53,740
It was a laugh riot.
That was about it.

656
00:50:53,949 --> 00:50:57,243
I think we had dinner
at Orso's. No, Peto...
No, Orso's.

657
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:00,580
I hope I've been informative.
Long day, a bit scattered.

658
00:51:00,747 --> 00:51:02,582
I'm a little spent now too.

659
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:05,835
But how about lunch
in a week or so...

660
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:08,170
when I've sorted out
all this information?

661
00:51:08,337 --> 00:51:10,172
Great.
Yes, I'd like that.

662
00:51:10,339 --> 00:51:13,425
And if you could
try and pin down
where you were...

663
00:51:10,631 --> 00:51:10,631
23.976

664
00:51:13,633 --> 00:51:17,178
the night of Paul Allen's
disappearance, it would
make my job a lot easier.

665
00:51:17,387 --> 00:51:19,555
Absolutely.
I'm with you on that one.

666
00:51:23,976 --> 00:51:25,811
Huey Lewis and the News.

667
00:51:28,022 --> 00:51:31,191
Great stuff. I just
bought it on my way here.
You heard it?

668
00:51:32,442 --> 00:51:36,071
Never. I mean,
I don't really like singers.

669
00:51:36,446 --> 00:51:39,782
Not a big music fan, huh?
No, I like music.

670
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:44,578
Just they're...
Huey's too black sounding
for me.

671
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:46,705
To each his own.

672
00:51:48,874 --> 00:51:51,001
So, lunch next week?

673
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:53,003
I'll be there.

674
00:52:02,178 --> 00:52:04,138
Oh!

675
00:52:04,305 --> 00:52:06,182
Oh!

676
00:52:28,744 --> 00:52:32,330
Will you call me
before Easter?
Maybe.

677
00:52:36,084 --> 00:52:37,919
What are you doing tonight?

678
00:52:38,086 --> 00:52:40,713
Dinner at, uh, River Cafe.

679
00:52:40,922 --> 00:52:44,133
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.

680
00:52:46,176 --> 00:52:48,887
I never knew you smoked.

681
00:52:49,096 --> 00:52:50,889
You never noticed.

682
00:52:54,267 --> 00:52:56,436
Listen, Patrick.

683
00:52:56,644 --> 00:52:58,354
Can we talk?

684
00:53:04,527 --> 00:53:06,820
You look... marvelous.

685
00:53:08,906 --> 00:53:10,741
There's nothing to say.

686
00:53:10,949 --> 00:53:14,411
You're gonna marry Luis.
Isn't that special?

687
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,914
Patrick?

688
00:53:22,501 --> 00:53:24,336
Yes, Courtney?

689
00:53:27,131 --> 00:53:29,758
If I don't see you
before Easter,

690
00:53:29,883 --> 00:53:31,885
have a nice one, okay?

691
00:53:37,015 --> 00:53:38,850
You too.

692
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:47,107
Patrick?

693
00:53:47,274 --> 00:53:49,067
Yeah?

694
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:54,990
Nothing.

695
00:54:21,222 --> 00:54:23,015
There is this theory now...
Listen to me.

696
00:54:23,224 --> 00:54:25,059
There is this theory now that if
you can catch the AIDS virus...

697
00:54:25,226 --> 00:54:28,520
by having sex
with someone who's infected,
then you can catch anything.

698
00:54:28,729 --> 00:54:31,982
Alzheimer's,
muscular dystrophy,
hemophilia,

699
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:34,818
leukemia, diabetes,
dyslexia.

700
00:54:34,943 --> 00:54:37,570
I'm not sure,
but I don't think dyslexia
is a virus.

701
00:54:37,737 --> 00:54:39,947
But who knows?
They don't know that.

702
00:54:40,156 --> 00:54:41,991
Prove it.

703
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:55,503
Oh, God.
What?

704
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:58,965
It's a fucking milligram
of sweetener.
I wanna get high off this,

705
00:54:59,215 --> 00:55:01,384
not sprinkle it on
my fucking oatmeal.
It's definitely weak,

706
00:55:01,551 --> 00:55:03,552
but I have a feeling
if we do enough of it,
we'll be okay.

707
00:55:03,761 --> 00:55:07,139
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to do drugs.

708
00:55:07,348 --> 00:55:09,558
Fuck you!
Calm down.
Let's do it anyway.

709
00:55:09,725 --> 00:55:11,560
That's right.

710
00:55:11,768 --> 00:55:13,645
That is if the faggot
in the next stall
thinks it's okay!

711
00:55:13,812 --> 00:55:15,647
Fuck you!
Hey, fuck you!

712
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:20,526
Sorry, dude. Steroids.

713
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:22,945
Okay, let's do it.

714
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,633
Where did Craig go?

715
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:49,094
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.
McDermott went
to sign a peace treaty...

716
00:55:49,303 --> 00:55:51,138
between the United States
and Russia.

717
00:55:51,305 --> 00:55:53,974
He's the one behind Glasnost.

718
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,519
- He said he was in
mergers and acquisitions.
- You're not confused, are you?

719
00:55:57,685 --> 00:55:59,646
No, not really.

720
00:55:59,812 --> 00:56:02,565
- Gorbachev is not downstairs.
- Karen's right.

721
00:56:02,732 --> 00:56:05,276
Gorbachev's not downstairs.
He's at Tunnel.

722
00:56:05,484 --> 00:56:07,277
Ask me a question.

723
00:56:08,821 --> 00:56:10,614
So, what do you do?

724
00:56:10,822 --> 00:56:14,159
I'm into, uh,
well, murders
and executions, mostly.

725
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:18,121
- Do you like it?
- Well, it depends. Why?

726
00:56:18,288 --> 00:56:23,459
Well, most guys I know who work
in mergers and acquisitions
really don't like it.

727
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,423
So, where do you work out?

728
00:56:32,259 --> 00:56:34,678
You think I'm dumb,
don't you?

729
00:56:34,844 --> 00:56:37,805
What?
You think I'm dumb.
You think all models are dumb.

730
00:56:38,014 --> 00:56:40,683
No.
I really don't.

731
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:43,477
That's okay.
I don't mind.

732
00:56:43,686 --> 00:56:45,521
There's something sweet
about you.

733
00:57:12,129 --> 00:57:13,964
Doin' the crossword?

734
00:57:19,177 --> 00:57:21,345
You need any help?

735
00:57:31,563 --> 00:57:34,190
- Jean?
- Yes, Patrick?

736
00:57:34,399 --> 00:57:37,569
Would you like to accompany me
to dinner?

737
00:57:37,735 --> 00:57:40,488
That is,
if you're not doing anything.

738
00:57:40,655 --> 00:57:43,282
Um, no. No,
I don't have any plans.

739
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:47,494
Well,

740
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:51,790
isn't this a coincidence?

741
00:57:51,998 --> 00:57:54,209
Listen, where should we go?
Anywhere you want.

742
00:57:54,376 --> 00:57:57,212
Let's not think about
what I want. How about
anywhere you want?

743
00:57:59,297 --> 00:58:01,841
I don't know, Patrick.
I can't make this decision.

744
00:58:02,008 --> 00:58:05,636
Come on.
Where do you wanna go?

745
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:10,515
Anywhere you want,
just say it.
I can get us in anywhere.

746
00:58:10,724 --> 00:58:12,559
What about...

747
00:58:20,817 --> 00:58:22,610
Dorsia?

748
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:31,410
So,

749
00:58:31,576 --> 00:58:33,995
Dorsia is where
Jean wants to go.

750
00:58:34,204 --> 00:58:37,749
Well, I don't know.
We'll go wherever you wanna go.

751
00:58:37,874 --> 00:58:39,625
Dorsia is fine.

752
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:47,966
Dorsia. Yes?

753
00:58:48,133 --> 00:58:52,179
Yeah, can you take two tonight
at, oh, let's say 9:00?
We're totally booked.

754
00:58:52,387 --> 00:58:54,180
Really? That's great.

755
00:58:54,389 --> 00:58:57,809
No, I said
we are totally booked.
Two at 9:00? Perfect.

756
00:58:58,017 --> 00:58:59,977
See ya then.

757
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:04,940
Yeah?

758
00:59:05,149 --> 00:59:08,444
You're... dressed okay.

759
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:12,739
- You didn't give a name.
- They know me.

760
00:59:14,032 --> 00:59:17,577
Why don't you meet me
at my place at 7:00...

761
00:59:17,744 --> 00:59:20,038
for drinks.

762
00:59:20,204 --> 00:59:22,039
And Jean,

763
00:59:22,206 --> 00:59:24,125
you'll wanna change
before we go out.

764
00:59:32,674 --> 00:59:34,634
Patrick, it's so elegant.

765
00:59:34,801 --> 00:59:36,719
What a wonderful view.

766
00:59:36,886 --> 00:59:39,222
Jean,

767
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:41,265
sorbet?

768
00:59:43,017 --> 00:59:45,186
Thanks, Patrick.
I'd love some.

769
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,028
Do you want a bite?
I'm on a diet.
But thank you.

770
00:59:55,195 --> 00:59:58,531
You don't need
to lose any weight.
You're kidding, right?

771
00:59:58,698 --> 01:00:00,700
You look great.
Very fit.

772
01:00:02,118 --> 01:00:05,121
You can always be thinner,
look better.

773
01:00:05,329 --> 01:00:09,708
Well, maybe we shouldn't
go out to dinner. I don't
wanna ruin your willpower.

774
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:12,502
No, it's all right.

775
01:00:12,669 --> 01:00:16,005
I'm not very good
at controlling it anyway.

776
01:00:18,758 --> 01:00:20,593
So listen.

777
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,763
What do you really
wanna do with your life?

778
01:00:23,929 --> 01:00:26,056
Just briefly, summarize.

779
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:28,976
And don't tell me
you enjoy working
with children, okay?

780
01:00:29,143 --> 01:00:33,396
Well, I'd like to travel
and maybe go back to school,

781
01:00:33,605 --> 01:00:36,483
but I don't really know.

782
01:00:36,649 --> 01:00:40,862
I'm at a point in my life
where there seems to be
so many possibilities,

783
01:00:41,112 --> 01:00:44,448
but I'm... I don't know...
I'm just so unsure.

784
01:00:48,035 --> 01:00:50,662
Do you have a boyfriend?

785
01:00:50,829 --> 01:00:54,457
No, not really.
Interesting.

786
01:00:54,624 --> 01:00:58,211
Are you seeing anyone?
I mean, seriously?

787
01:00:58,378 --> 01:01:00,588
Maybe.

788
01:01:00,755 --> 01:01:03,758
I don't know.
Not really.

789
01:01:07,094 --> 01:01:08,887
Jean,

790
01:01:09,096 --> 01:01:11,598
do you feel... fulfilled?

791
01:01:11,765 --> 01:01:14,267
I mean, in your life?

792
01:01:14,517 --> 01:01:17,395
I guess I do. For a long time
I was too focused on my work.

793
01:01:17,562 --> 01:01:22,567
But now I've really begun
to think about changing myself,
you know,

794
01:01:22,775 --> 01:01:25,194
developing and growing.

795
01:01:25,361 --> 01:01:28,447
Growing.
I'm glad you said that.

796
01:01:30,824 --> 01:01:35,120
Did you know that, uh,
Ted Bundy's first dog,

797
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:38,373
a collie,
was named Lassie?

798
01:01:38,539 --> 01:01:41,876
Had you heard this?
Who's Ted Bundy?

799
01:01:43,836 --> 01:01:46,130
Forget it.

800
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,924
What's that?

801
01:01:49,091 --> 01:01:53,929
Duct tape.
I need it for, uh,
taping something.

802
01:01:59,309 --> 01:02:01,686
Patrick,

803
01:02:01,853 --> 01:02:04,563
have you ever wanted to...
make someone happy?

804
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:07,024
What? No!
Put it in the carton.

805
01:02:09,568 --> 01:02:11,695
Sorry.

806
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:13,488
Jean?

807
01:02:15,657 --> 01:02:20,119
What?
Uh, make someone happy?

808
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,831
Have you ever wanted to?

809
01:02:26,292 --> 01:02:28,669
I'm looking for, uh,

810
01:02:32,631 --> 01:02:35,759
I guess you could say
I just wanna have
a meaningful relationship...

811
01:02:35,925 --> 01:02:39,637
with someone special.
Hmm.

812
01:02:47,394 --> 01:02:50,689
Patrick? Patrick?
I know you're there.

813
01:02:50,814 --> 01:02:52,858
Pick up the phone,
you bad boy.

814
01:02:53,108 --> 01:02:57,112
What are you up to tonight?
It's me. Don't try to hide.

815
01:02:57,278 --> 01:03:01,365
I hope you're not with some
little number you picked up
because you're my Mr. Bateman.

816
01:03:01,574 --> 01:03:04,076
My boy next door.

817
01:03:04,243 --> 01:03:06,579
Anyway, you never called me
and you said you would,

818
01:03:06,745 --> 01:03:09,248
and I'll leave
a message for Jean
about this, too, to remind you,

819
01:03:09,373 --> 01:03:11,625
but we're having dinner
with Melania and Taylor.

820
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:14,002
You know Melania.
She went to Sweet Briar.

821
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:16,296
And we're meeting
at the Cornell Club,

822
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:18,339
so I'll call you
tomorrow morning, honey.

823
01:03:18,548 --> 01:03:20,842
Oops. Sorry.
I know you hate that.

824
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:26,430
Bye, Patrick.
Bye, Mr. Big Time C.E.O.
Bye-bye.

825
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:32,686
Was that Evelyn?

826
01:03:35,647 --> 01:03:37,982
Are you still seeing her?

827
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:45,364
I'm sorry.
I have no right to ask that.

828
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,662
Do you want me to go?

829
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:54,623
Yeah.

830
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,419
I don't think
I can control myself.

831
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:06,467
I know. I should go.
I know I have a tendency to get
involved with unavailable men.

832
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:10,929
I mean,

833
01:04:12,347 --> 01:04:14,933
do you want me to go?

834
01:04:15,141 --> 01:04:18,019
I think if you stay,

835
01:04:18,186 --> 01:04:20,772
something bad will happen.

836
01:04:22,189 --> 01:04:23,983
I think I might hurt you.

837
01:04:25,568 --> 01:04:27,820
You don't wanna get hurt,
do you?

838
01:04:28,028 --> 01:04:30,197
No. No, I guess not.

839
01:04:31,656 --> 01:04:34,200
I don't wanna get bruised.

840
01:04:36,244 --> 01:04:39,038
You're right.
I should go.

841
01:04:44,835 --> 01:04:49,631
Oh. Don't forget you have a
lunch date tomorrow with Donald
Kimball at Smith and Wolenski's.

842
01:04:50,841 --> 01:04:53,093
Thanks.

843
01:04:53,301 --> 01:04:55,470
It slipped my mind completely.

844
01:05:14,613 --> 01:05:18,575
So, the night
he disappeared...

845
01:05:18,741 --> 01:05:21,369
any new thoughts
about what you did?

846
01:05:23,454 --> 01:05:26,832
Not sure.
Um, I had a shower...

847
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:28,834
and some sorbet?

848
01:05:29,042 --> 01:05:30,961
I think you're getting
your dates mixed up.

849
01:05:31,128 --> 01:05:32,963
But how?

850
01:05:33,171 --> 01:05:36,132
Where do you place...
Paul that night?

851
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:39,635
According to his date book,
and this was verified
by his secretary,

852
01:05:39,761 --> 01:05:42,597
he had dinner
with Marcus Halberstram.

853
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,932
And?
I questioned him.

854
01:05:45,099 --> 01:05:49,228
- Marcus?
- Yes, and he denies it, though,
at first, he couldn't be sure.

855
01:05:49,394 --> 01:05:52,230
But he denied it.
Yes.

856
01:05:53,565 --> 01:05:55,567
Well, does Marcus
have an alibi?

857
01:05:55,734 --> 01:05:59,112
Yes.
He does?
You're sure?

858
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,155
I checked it out.
It's clean.

859
01:06:05,326 --> 01:06:08,662
Now, where were you?

860
01:06:08,829 --> 01:06:10,789
Where was Marcus?

861
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,041
He wasn't with Paul Allen.

862
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,293
Who was he with?
He was...

863
01:06:15,502 --> 01:06:17,879
at Atlantis... with...

864
01:06:18,046 --> 01:06:22,008
Craig McDermott,
Frederick Dibble,
Harry Newman, George Butner...

865
01:06:22,174 --> 01:06:24,635
and... you.

866
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:30,724
Oh, right, yeah.
Of course.

867
01:06:30,932 --> 01:06:34,978
We had wanted
Paul Allen to come,

868
01:06:35,186 --> 01:06:37,230
but he had made plans.

869
01:06:37,438 --> 01:06:41,234
And I guess I had dinner
with Victoria
the following night.

870
01:06:41,442 --> 01:06:43,694
Personally, I think the guy
went a little nutso.

871
01:06:43,861 --> 01:06:48,657
Split town for a while.
Maybe he did go to London,
sightseeing, drinking, whatever.

872
01:06:48,824 --> 01:06:52,911
Anyway, I'm pretty sure
he'll turn up sooner or later.
I mean, to think...

873
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:58,291
that one of his friends killed
him for no reason whatsoever
would be too ridiculous.

874
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:00,668
Isn't that right, Patrick?

875
01:07:21,646 --> 01:07:23,981
Christie. Christie.

876
01:07:24,148 --> 01:07:27,818
I'm not so sure about this.
I had to go to Emergency
after last time.

877
01:07:28,027 --> 01:07:30,696
This won't be anything
like last time. I promise.

878
01:07:30,821 --> 01:07:33,532
I don't think so.

879
01:07:33,698 --> 01:07:36,868
Just come in the limo
and talk to me for a minute.

880
01:07:37,076 --> 01:07:38,911
The driver's here.
You'll be safe.

881
01:07:57,804 --> 01:08:00,098
Nothing like last time.
Promise.

882
01:08:00,264 --> 01:08:02,099
All right.

883
01:08:02,266 --> 01:08:05,477
So, you're looking great.
How have you been?

884
01:08:05,644 --> 01:08:09,356
Well, I actually might need
surgery after last time.
Really?

885
01:08:09,523 --> 01:08:13,527
My friend told me
I should maybe
even get a lawyer.

886
01:08:13,693 --> 01:08:16,279
Lawyers are so complicated.

887
01:08:16,446 --> 01:08:18,906
Don't do that.

888
01:08:19,115 --> 01:08:20,950
Here's a check.

889
01:09:08,786 --> 01:09:12,539
Uh-uh. Half now,
half later.

890
01:09:17,877 --> 01:09:21,297
Okay, your name is Christie.

891
01:09:21,506 --> 01:09:24,008
We're meeting a friend
of mine, Elizabeth.

892
01:09:24,216 --> 01:09:28,512
She'll be joining us
in my new apartment shortly.

893
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:32,057
You'll like her.
She's a very nice girl.

894
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:41,732
You look really familiar.
Did you go to Dalton?

895
01:09:44,276 --> 01:09:46,904
I think I met you
at Surf Bar, didn't I?
With Spicey?

896
01:09:47,112 --> 01:09:50,198
Well, maybe not with Spicey,
but definitely at Surf Bar.
You know, Surf Bar.

897
01:09:50,365 --> 01:09:52,409
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now.
It's terrible.

898
01:09:52,576 --> 01:09:57,622
Went to a birthday party there
for Malcolm Forbes.
Oh, my God, please.

899
01:09:57,789 --> 01:10:00,291
This is nicer
than your other apartment.

900
01:10:02,627 --> 01:10:04,587
Oh, it's not
that nice.

901
01:10:09,383 --> 01:10:12,969
Where did you two meet?
Oh, God.
We met at...

902
01:10:13,178 --> 01:10:17,473
oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby
in '85, or '86.

903
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,852
You were hanging out
with that bimbo Allison Poole.
Hot number.

904
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:23,229
What do you mean?
She was a hot number.

905
01:10:23,396 --> 01:10:27,900
If you had a platinum card,
she'd give you a blow job. This
girl worked in a tanning salon.

906
01:10:28,067 --> 01:10:30,527
What do you do?

907
01:10:30,694 --> 01:10:34,489
She's my... cousin.

908
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:38,493
Uh-huh.
She's from... France.

909
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:41,871
Where's your phone?
I've gotta call Harley.

910
01:10:45,457 --> 01:10:49,044
Where do you summer,
South Hampton?

911
01:10:50,337 --> 01:10:53,381
- No.
- Oh, God, it's his machine.

912
01:10:53,548 --> 01:10:57,510
It's 3:00 in the morning.
He's a goddamn drug dealer.
These are his peak hours.

913
01:10:57,677 --> 01:10:59,637
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I?

914
01:10:59,846 --> 01:11:01,681
This tastes weird.

915
01:11:01,847 --> 01:11:05,976
Harley, it's me.
I need your services.
Translate that however you want.

916
01:11:06,185 --> 01:11:09,855
- I'm at...
- Paul Allen's.

917
01:11:10,063 --> 01:11:12,190
Who?
Paul Allen's.

918
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:16,236
I want the number, idiot.
Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's
and I'll try you again later.

919
01:11:16,403 --> 01:11:20,073
And if I don't see you at Canal
Bar tomorrow night I'm gonna
sic my hairdresser on you.

920
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,074
Did you know that guy
who disappeared?

921
01:11:22,283 --> 01:11:25,077
Didn't he work
at Pierce & Pierce?
Was he a friend of yours?

922
01:11:25,244 --> 01:11:27,079
No.

923
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:30,040
Do you have any coke?
Or Halcyon?

924
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:33,126
I would take a Halcyon.
Listen.

925
01:11:34,919 --> 01:11:36,880
I would just like to see...

926
01:11:37,088 --> 01:11:39,424
the two of you...
get it on.

927
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:42,718
What's wrong with that?

928
01:11:42,885 --> 01:11:45,012
It's totally disease free.

929
01:11:47,014 --> 01:11:49,975
Patrick, you're a lunatic.
Come on.

930
01:11:50,142 --> 01:11:52,352
Don't you find Christie
attractive?

931
01:11:52,519 --> 01:11:56,189
Let's not get lewd.
I'm in no mood
for a lewd conversation.

932
01:11:56,356 --> 01:11:58,566
Come on.

933
01:11:58,775 --> 01:12:02,069
I think it'd be a turn-on.
Does he do this
all the time?

934
01:12:04,989 --> 01:12:07,574
Christie,
you're not drinking your wine.

935
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:11,453
Are you telling me
you've never gotten it on
with a girl?

936
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:14,664
No. I'm not a lesbian.

937
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:17,584
Why would you think
I would be into that?

938
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,877
Well, you went to
Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

939
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:24,590
Those are
Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.
You're making me feel weird.

940
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:31,138
Did you know...

941
01:12:31,304 --> 01:12:34,683
that Whitney Houston's
debut LP...

942
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:37,685
called simply
Whitney Houston...

943
01:12:37,894 --> 01:12:40,521
had four number-one
singles on it?

944
01:12:42,148 --> 01:12:44,108
Did you know that,
Christie?

945
01:12:44,316 --> 01:12:47,611
You actually listen
to Whitney Houston?

946
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:50,447
You own
a Whitney Houston CD?

947
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:55,118
More than one?

948
01:12:55,327 --> 01:12:58,663
It's hard to choose
a favorite among
so many great tracks.

949
01:13:00,832 --> 01:13:05,544
But the "Greatest Love Of All"
is one of the best,
most powerful songs...

950
01:13:05,711 --> 01:13:07,796
ever written...

951
01:13:08,005 --> 01:13:09,798
about self-preservation...

952
01:13:10,007 --> 01:13:12,092
and dignity.

953
01:13:12,259 --> 01:13:15,720
Its universal message
crosses all boundaries...

954
01:13:15,845 --> 01:13:17,972
and instills one...

955
01:13:18,181 --> 01:13:21,684
with the hope
that it's not too late...

956
01:13:21,851 --> 01:13:24,061
to better ourselves.

957
01:13:24,311 --> 01:13:27,564
Since, Elizabeth,

958
01:13:27,731 --> 01:13:32,569
it's impossible
in this world we live in
to empathize with others,

959
01:13:32,778 --> 01:13:36,239
we can always empathize
with ourselves.

960
01:13:36,406 --> 01:13:40,535
It's an important message.
Crucial, really.

961
01:14:56,354 --> 01:14:58,690
Not the face!

962
01:14:58,815 --> 01:15:02,777
You bitch,
not the fucking face,
you piece of bitch trash!

963
01:16:00,329 --> 01:16:03,332
Aaah!

964
01:16:31,525 --> 01:16:34,152
I want a firm commitment.

965
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:37,822
I think, um, Evelyn,
that, uh, we've lost touch.

966
01:16:38,031 --> 01:16:39,782
Why? What's wrong?

967
01:16:43,369 --> 01:16:45,329
My need to engage
in homicidal behavior...

968
01:16:45,496 --> 01:16:48,165
on a massive scale
cannot be corrected,

969
01:16:48,373 --> 01:16:51,293
but I have no other way
to fulfill my needs.

970
01:16:52,878 --> 01:16:55,672
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick?

971
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,799
It's over, Evelyn.

972
01:16:58,007 --> 01:17:00,384
It's all over.

973
01:17:00,551 --> 01:17:03,721
Touchy, touchy.
I'm sorry I brought up
the wedding.

974
01:17:03,929 --> 01:17:07,349
Let's just avoid the issue,
all right? Now,
are we having coffee?

975
01:17:07,516 --> 01:17:12,187
I'm fucking serious.
It's fucking over, us.
This is no joke.

976
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:15,190
Uh, I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

977
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:20,528
But your friends are my friends
and my friends are your friends.

978
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:23,906
I really don't think
it would work. You have
a little something...

979
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:29,369
I know that your friends
are my friends, and, uh...
and I've thought about that.

980
01:17:29,536 --> 01:17:32,497
You can have 'em.

981
01:17:32,664 --> 01:17:36,042
You're really serious,
aren't you?
Yes, I am.

982
01:17:39,253 --> 01:17:43,299
- What about the past?
Our past?
- We never really shared one.

983
01:17:43,466 --> 01:17:45,426
You're inhuman.
No.

984
01:17:45,593 --> 01:17:48,637
I'm in touch with humanity.

985
01:17:48,804 --> 01:17:53,141
Evelyn, I'm, uh, sorry.
I just, uh...

986
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:55,310
You're not terribly
important to me.

987
01:17:55,477 --> 01:17:58,062
Oh, no!

988
01:17:58,229 --> 01:18:00,398
No. No, Patrick.

989
01:18:00,565 --> 01:18:05,027
I know my behavior can be...
erratic sometimes.

990
01:18:06,487 --> 01:18:09,489
What do you want me to do?
What is it that you want?

991
01:18:09,656 --> 01:18:12,951
If you really wanna do something
for me, then stop making
this scene right now.

992
01:18:13,118 --> 01:18:15,954
Oh, God, I can't believe this.

993
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:18,498
I'm leaving.
I've assessed the situation,
and I'm going.

994
01:18:18,665 --> 01:18:21,876
Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.

995
01:18:22,126 --> 01:18:24,086
But where?

996
01:18:25,337 --> 01:18:27,464
I have to return
some videotapes.

997
01:18:58,368 --> 01:19:00,119
Here, kitty, kitty.

998
01:19:16,509 --> 01:19:18,511
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

999
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,638
Stop that.

1000
01:20:02,551 --> 01:20:04,804
Drop the weapon!
Drop it now!

1001
01:20:05,012 --> 01:20:06,930
Get on the ground!
Put your...

1002
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:52,472
Burning the midnight oil,
Mr. Smith?

1003
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,933
Hey, now don't forget
to sign in.

1004
01:22:24,056 --> 01:22:27,184
Howard, it's Bateman.
Patrick Bateman.

1005
01:22:27,351 --> 01:22:30,187
You're my lawyer,
so I think you should know
I've killed a lot of people.

1006
01:22:30,395 --> 01:22:33,106
Some escort girls
in an apartment uptown,

1007
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:36,443
uh, some homeless people,
maybe five or ten,

1008
01:22:36,568 --> 01:22:38,861
an N.Y.U. girl I met
in Central Park.

1009
01:22:39,028 --> 01:22:41,197
I left her at a parking lot
behind some doughnut shop.

1010
01:22:41,364 --> 01:22:44,366
I killed Bethany,
my old girlfriend,
with a nail gun.

1011
01:22:44,575 --> 01:22:48,912
And-And-And then some man,
s-s-some old faggot
with a dog.

1012
01:22:49,121 --> 01:22:51,164
Last week, I, uh...

1013
01:22:51,415 --> 01:22:54,834
I killed another girl
with a chain saw.

1014
01:22:57,712 --> 01:23:00,882
I had to.
She almost got away.

1015
01:23:01,090 --> 01:23:02,883
And...

1016
01:23:03,092 --> 01:23:08,097
Someone else there.
I can't remember,
maybe a model... She's dead too.

1017
01:23:08,263 --> 01:23:10,766
And, uh, Paul Allen.

1018
01:23:10,891 --> 01:23:14,603
I killed Paul Allen
with an ax in the face.

1019
01:23:14,769 --> 01:23:19,065
His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen.

1020
01:23:19,273 --> 01:23:23,819
I don't wanna leave anything
out here. I guess I've killed
maybe... 20 people.

1021
01:23:24,028 --> 01:23:26,989
Maybe 40!

1022
01:23:27,197 --> 01:23:30,450
I have tapes of a lot of it.

1023
01:23:30,617 --> 01:23:33,161
Some of the girls
have seen the tapes.

1024
01:23:33,328 --> 01:23:35,914
I even, um,

1025
01:23:43,045 --> 01:23:45,422
I ate some
of their brains...

1026
01:23:45,589 --> 01:23:49,218
and I tried to
cook a little.

1027
01:23:51,678 --> 01:23:54,806
Tonight, I, uh...

1028
01:23:55,056 --> 01:23:58,893
I just had to kill
a lot of people!

1029
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:01,062
And, um,

1030
01:24:04,273 --> 01:24:09,278
I'm not sure I'm gonna
get away with it... this time.

1031
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:15,200
So, uh... I mean,

1032
01:24:15,367 --> 01:24:18,745
I guess...

1033
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:21,455
I'm a pretty, uh...

1034
01:24:22,623 --> 01:24:25,459
I mean, I guess
I'm a pretty sick guy.

1035
01:24:25,668 --> 01:24:28,128
So,

1036
01:24:29,838 --> 01:24:32,674
if you get back tomorrow,

1037
01:24:32,883 --> 01:24:35,010
I may show up at Harry's Bar.

1038
01:24:35,218 --> 01:24:38,179
So, you know,

1039
01:24:38,388 --> 01:24:40,431
keep your eyes open.

1040
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:43,601
Okay.

1041
01:24:47,771 --> 01:24:49,606
Oh!

1042
01:27:00,017 --> 01:27:02,270
Are you my 2:00?

1043
01:27:02,395 --> 01:27:06,231
No.
Can I help you?

1044
01:27:07,483 --> 01:27:11,445
I'm looking for...
Paul Allen's place.

1045
01:27:12,696 --> 01:27:16,366
Doesn't he... live here?
No, he doesn't.

1046
01:27:16,574 --> 01:27:19,410
You sure?

1047
01:27:19,619 --> 01:27:21,829
You saw the ad
in the Times?

1048
01:27:22,038 --> 01:27:24,874
No. Yeah.
I mean, yeah.

1049
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,502
In the Times.
There was no ad
in the Times.

1050
01:27:29,878 --> 01:27:32,047
I think you should
go now.

1051
01:27:32,214 --> 01:27:34,049
But I think...

1052
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,927
I wanna know
what happened here.

1053
01:27:38,136 --> 01:27:41,222
Don't make any trouble,
please.

1054
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:43,516
I suggest you go.

1055
01:27:55,443 --> 01:27:57,278
Don't come back.

1056
01:27:57,445 --> 01:27:59,489
I won't.

1057
01:27:59,697 --> 01:28:01,657
Don't worry.

1058
01:28:28,807 --> 01:28:32,853
Patrick Bateman's office.

1059
01:28:33,103 --> 01:28:36,731
Jean? I need help.
Patrick, is that you?

1060
01:28:37,857 --> 01:28:40,276
Jean, I'm not...

1061
01:28:40,443 --> 01:28:44,864
Craig McDermott called. Wants
to meet you, David Van Patten
and Tim Bryce at Harry's.

1062
01:28:45,072 --> 01:28:48,867
Oh, God.
What did you say,
you dumb bitch?

1063
01:28:49,034 --> 01:28:52,787
Patrick, I can't hear you.
What am I doing?

1064
01:28:52,954 --> 01:28:54,831
Where are you, Patrick?
What's wrong?

1065
01:28:57,125 --> 01:29:01,671
I don't think
I'm gonna make it, Jean,
to the, uh,

1066
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:03,672
office this afternoon.

1067
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:05,674
Why?

1068
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:10,470
Just say no!
What is it, Patrick?
Are you all right?

1069
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:14,724
Stop sounding
so fucking sad.

1070
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:16,768
Jesus!

1071
01:30:34,214 --> 01:30:38,509
That's a table for three.
Bateman, you're looking
wild-eyed. Rough day?

1072
01:30:38,676 --> 01:30:41,429
Hey, look.
Bryce is back and
he's drinking mineral water.

1073
01:30:41,637 --> 01:30:44,598
He's a changed man,
except for he still can't
a reservation to save his life.

1074
01:30:44,765 --> 01:30:46,809
Why don't you just try
150 Wooster?

1075
01:30:47,059 --> 01:30:50,479
I'm not going anywhere
unless we have a reservation.

1076
01:30:50,646 --> 01:30:54,357
Le Cirque, Flamingo East,
Oyster Bar. Come on, faggots.
Let's get a "res."

1077
01:30:54,524 --> 01:30:58,194
Keep your shirt on.
Maybe lose the suspenders.

1078
01:30:58,361 --> 01:31:00,279
Need a reservation
for 8:30.

1079
01:31:00,446 --> 01:31:02,865
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Right back.

1080
01:31:03,074 --> 01:31:05,367
10:00 would not be
any good. No.

1081
01:31:05,534 --> 01:31:08,745
Just fucking call them.
Give me the phone. I'll do it.
I'll call you back.

1082
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:12,290
Face it. The Japanese
will own most of this country
by the end of the '90s.

1083
01:31:12,457 --> 01:31:15,335
Shut up, Carnes.
They will not.

1084
01:31:16,878 --> 01:31:20,465
So, uh, Harold,
did you get my message?

1085
01:31:20,673 --> 01:31:24,760
Jesus, yes.
That was hilarious.
That was you, wasn't it?

1086
01:31:24,927 --> 01:31:28,597
Yeah, naturally.
Bateman killing Allen
and the escort girls.

1087
01:31:28,764 --> 01:31:30,599
That's fabulous.
That's rich.
What exactly do you mean?

1088
01:31:30,766 --> 01:31:35,103
The message you left. By
the way, Davis, how's Cynthia?
You're still seeing her, right?

1089
01:31:35,311 --> 01:31:37,272
W-Wait, Harold.
What do you mean?

1090
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:40,858
Excuse me. Nothing.
It's good to see you.

1091
01:31:41,108 --> 01:31:43,569
Is that Edward Towers?

1092
01:31:43,694 --> 01:31:45,487
Carnes, wait. Uh...

1093
01:31:45,696 --> 01:31:51,368
Davis, I'm not one
to bad-mouth anyone.
Your joke was amusing.

1094
01:31:51,576 --> 01:31:55,413
But come on, man.
You had one fatal flaw:

1095
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,540
Bateman is such a dork.

1096
01:31:57,749 --> 01:32:01,252
Such a boring,
spineless lightweight.

1097
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:05,214
Now, if you said Bryce
or McDermott. Otherwise,
it was amusing.

1098
01:32:05,381 --> 01:32:07,883
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really must be going.

1099
01:32:08,092 --> 01:32:11,428
Wait. Uh... Stop.

1100
01:32:12,804 --> 01:32:15,306
I did it, Carnes.

1101
01:32:15,515 --> 01:32:17,308
I killed him.

1102
01:32:17,559 --> 01:32:20,019
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1103
01:32:23,356 --> 01:32:25,482
I chopped Allen's
fucking head off.

1104
01:32:26,859 --> 01:32:31,738
The whole message
I left on your machine was true.

1105
01:32:31,947 --> 01:32:34,658
Excuse me.
I really must be going now.

1106
01:32:34,824 --> 01:32:37,952
No. No, listen.

1107
01:32:38,161 --> 01:32:40,455
Don't you know who I am?

1108
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:43,290
I'm not Davis.
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1109
01:32:46,085 --> 01:32:49,213
We talk on the phone
all the time.

1110
01:32:49,421 --> 01:32:51,882
Don't you recognize me?

1111
01:32:53,383 --> 01:32:56,136
You're my lawyer.

1112
01:32:56,344 --> 01:33:00,848
Now, Carnes, listen.

1113
01:33:00,973 --> 01:33:03,184
Listen very, very carefully.

1114
01:33:07,021 --> 01:33:10,232
I killed Paul Allen,

1115
01:33:10,399 --> 01:33:12,275
and I liked it.

1116
01:33:12,484 --> 01:33:16,154
I can't make myself
any clearer.

1117
01:33:16,321 --> 01:33:20,324
But that's simply not possible.
And I don't find this funny
anymore.

1118
01:33:20,533 --> 01:33:23,953
It never was
supposed to be.
Why isn't it possible?

1119
01:33:24,161 --> 01:33:28,290
It's just not.
Why not,
you stupid bastard?

1120
01:33:28,499 --> 01:33:30,667
Because I had dinner
with Paul Allen...

1121
01:33:30,834 --> 01:33:33,295
twice in London
just ten days ago.

1122
01:33:33,461 --> 01:33:35,463
No, you...

1123
01:33:38,383 --> 01:33:41,010
didn't.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1124
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:24,592
We've seen the results
of that mistrust...

1125
01:34:24,717 --> 01:34:28,137
in the form of lies,
provisions in the states.

1126
01:34:28,345 --> 01:34:32,724
We need to find a way
to cooperate while
realizing foreign policy...

1127
01:34:32,891 --> 01:34:35,185
can't be run
by committee.

1128
01:34:35,352 --> 01:34:37,729
And I believe there's now
the growing sense...

1129
01:34:37,937 --> 01:34:41,649
that we can accomplish more
by cooperating.

1130
01:34:41,816 --> 01:34:45,653
And in the end,
this may be the eventual
blessing in disguise...

1131
01:34:45,861 --> 01:34:47,738
to come out of
the Iran-Contra mess.

1132
01:34:47,946 --> 01:34:51,533
How can he lie like that?

1133
01:34:51,658 --> 01:34:53,535
How can he pull that shit?
What shit?

1134
01:34:53,702 --> 01:34:55,703
Now, where do we have
reservations at?

1135
01:34:55,829 --> 01:34:58,665
I'm not really hungry,
but I'd like to have
reservations someplace.

1136
01:34:58,956 --> 01:35:01,792
How can you be so fucking,

1137
01:35:02,001 --> 01:35:04,420
I don't know,
cool about it?

1138
01:35:04,545 --> 01:35:07,923
Some guys are just
born cool, I guess.

1139
01:35:12,761 --> 01:35:14,804
Bateman?

1140
01:35:15,013 --> 01:35:20,184
- What are you
so fucking zany about?
- I'm just a happy camper.

1141
01:35:20,351 --> 01:35:22,728
Rockin' and a rollin'!

1142
01:35:22,853 --> 01:35:24,855
Oh, brother, look.

1143
01:35:25,022 --> 01:35:29,943
He presents himself
as this harmless old codger,
but inside...

1144
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:32,612
but inside...

1145
01:35:32,821 --> 01:35:35,615
But inside doesn't matter.

1146
01:35:35,824 --> 01:35:39,952
Inside? Believe or not,
Bryce, we're actually
listening to you.

1147
01:35:40,161 --> 01:35:42,622
Come on, Bateman.
What do you think?

1148
01:35:45,666 --> 01:35:49,836
- Whatever.
- Whose moronic idea was it
to order dry beers?

1149
01:35:50,045 --> 01:35:51,922
I need a scotch.

1150
01:36:08,228 --> 01:36:11,189
There are no more barriers
to cross.

1151
01:36:11,398 --> 01:36:15,110
All I have in common
with the uncontrollable
and the insane,

1152
01:36:15,276 --> 01:36:18,529
the vicious and the evil,
all the mayhem I have caused...

1153
01:36:18,696 --> 01:36:20,656
and my utter indifference
toward it,

1154
01:36:20,865 --> 01:36:23,325
I have now surpassed.

1155
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,956
My pain is constant and sharp...

1156
01:36:29,081 --> 01:36:32,667
and I do not hope
for a better world for anyone.

1157
01:36:32,792 --> 01:36:37,213
In fact, I want my pain
to be inflicted on others.

1158
01:36:37,422 --> 01:36:39,841
I want no one to escape.

1159
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:43,844
But even after admitting this,

1160
01:36:44,053 --> 01:36:46,055
there is no catharsis.

1161
01:36:46,263 --> 01:36:48,891
My punishment continues
to elude me...

1162
01:36:49,141 --> 01:36:52,269
and I gain no deeper knowledge
of myself.

1163
01:36:52,435 --> 01:36:56,064
No new knowledge can be
extracted from my telling.

1164
01:36:56,272 --> 01:37:00,359
This confession
has meant... nothing.

1165
01:38:19,432 --> 01:38:21,976
Word.

1166
01:39:16,192 --> 01:39:19,028
Come on.
