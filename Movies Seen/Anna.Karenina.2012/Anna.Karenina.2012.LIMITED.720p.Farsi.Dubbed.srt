1
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,028
What should I do with this, Your Excellency?

2
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:02,363
Yes.

3
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:05,116
I picked it out for Daria
Alexandrovna and the children.

4
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:09,203
Bonjour, Lili.

5
00:02:09,286 --> 00:02:10,913
Bonjour.

6
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:13,666
Bonjour, Grisha.

7
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:14,959
Bonjour.

8
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:16,752
Vasya.

9
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:21,549
Who is coming to see
Grand-maman?

10
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:22,800
Me! Me! Me!

11
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:28,889
Come along,
my little ducklings.

12
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:00,796
Be good today. I'm off.

13
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,469
Read the chapter carefully.

14
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:07,832
I'll come back
to test you on it.

15
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:10,806
Read it twice.

16
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:25,488
Au revoir.

17
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,380
Stiva.

18
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,281
Aunt Dolly found a note
from the governess.

19
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:10,366
Well?

20
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:14,453
Stiva wants me to come to Moscow
to persuade Dolly to forgive him.

21
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:18,207
I'm to be deprived of my wife so
that adultery may be forgiven?

22
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:21,585
I can't excuse him just
because he's your brother.

23
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:23,504
It's for Dolly's sake, too.

24
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:24,797
Four committees today.

25
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:27,007
I have the world
waiting for me.

26
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:30,177
There's never time to
look at your exercises.

27
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:33,639
Serozha is doing very well,
Your Excellency.

28
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:35,474
Who put this shirt on you?

29
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:37,810
Well, never mind.
I'll come and hear you read.

30
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:40,479
Tomorrow, perhaps.

31
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:43,399
Thank you, Lukich.
Perhaps tomorrow.

32
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:46,569
No. No, no, not tomorrow.

33
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:47,945
Thank you, Your Excellency.

34
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,155
Come along.

35
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:52,741
Alexei, do you think nine years
of marriage and children

36
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,995
should count for nothing
against an infatuation?

37
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:58,581
No. Very well.

38
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:02,209
But sin has a price,
you may be sure of that.

39
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:05,004
But why?

40
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:06,839
Because that's
where Aunt Dolly lives.

41
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:10,009
But why? I told you, Serozha.

42
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:12,011
She's not well.
I must go to see her.

43
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:13,554
But why, Mama?

44
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:15,681
Don't make Mama cry.

45
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:17,558
I'll be back before you know,
and bring you a present.

46
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:20,561
I don't want a present.
I want you to stay.

47
00:05:20,644 --> 00:05:22,938
My little Kotik.

48
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:24,899
What present?

49
00:05:24,982 --> 00:05:26,859
That's better.

50
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,470
It's the first time
I've left my little boy.

51
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:58,724
So, you're leaving your son
and I'm returning to mine.

52
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:00,684
I'm Countess Vronskaya.

53
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:04,063
I've been in St. Petersburg for the
christening of a granddaughter.

54
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:05,940
My eldest son married
Princess Chirkov.

55
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,948
You're a charming creature.
Why don't I know you?

56
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:16,784
I've never been
in Moscow society, really.

57
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:18,244
But you know my name.

58
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:20,829
I've heard you mentioned.
Talked about, you mean?

59
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,584
Love.

60
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:28,504
Was it love? Always.

61
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:30,756
My sons are ashamed of me.

62
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,467
But I'd rather end up wishing I
hadn't than end up wishing I had.

63
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,843
Wouldn't you?

64
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:36,887
I don't know.

65
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:07,960
Some man came without an
appointment, Your Excellency.

66
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:09,211
Waiting outside.

67
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:12,381
Levin! Where did you disappear?

68
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:14,550
I'm very anxious to see you.

69
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:17,136
I need your advice.

70
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:18,595
Well, come into my room, then.

71
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:22,057
This is my oldest friend,
Konstantin Dmitrievich Levin.

72
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,393
Someone send word
I'll be a few minutes late.

73
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,438
That's my office, up there.

74
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:32,776
I've been hard at it. Sit down.

75
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,153
Hard at what, exactly?

76
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:36,238
Well, we're overwhelmed
with work.

77
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,323
Paperwork.

78
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:39,658
Paperwork is the soul of Russia.
Farming is only the stomach.

79
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:42,578
Now, when am I going to
come and shoot some snipe?

80
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:48,709
Look at you, in Western clothes you
told me you'd never wear again.

81
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:49,835
Something's up.

82
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,547
Yes, I'm in love.
I've come back to propose.

83
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,508
Have you guessed who she is?

84
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:59,233
I... I have a suspicion.
Why didn't you propose when you were here?

85
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:01,680
I decided it was impossible.

86
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:05,184
Kitty is of the heavens, an angel.
And I am of the earth.

87
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:09,063
But then, I thought and thought, and
there's no life for me without her.

88
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,024
Do I have a chance?
Of course you do.

89
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:13,359
The Shcherbatskys are giving
a soiree this evening.

90
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:15,069
Get there early,
before the crowd.

91
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:16,737
And if I may suggest...
Anything, what?

92
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,989
New boots.
Right. Anything else?

93
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:21,867
We'd better have
dinner together.

94
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,590
Come on.
We'll meet later at I'Angleterre.

95
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,037
Or do you prefer the Hermitage?

96
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,914
Let's say, 5:30
at I'Angleterre.

97
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:28,457
I owe them more
than the Hermitage,

98
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,000
so it wouldn't be fair
to withdraw my custom.

99
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:34,713
So, new boots,
coat, and a proper hat.

100
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:19,466
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

101
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,968
Do you...

102
00:09:21,218 --> 00:09:22,594
Do you...

103
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:26,098
Excuse me.

104
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,585
It's so unfair.

105
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:57,004
You marry for love.

106
00:09:57,504 --> 00:09:58,881
You're a good husband.

107
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:02,843
Children arrive, years depart.

108
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:08,140
And all of a sudden,
your wife grows old and tired.

109
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:10,809
And her hair is thin.
And her body...

110
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,061
And you yourself,
you still have your vigor!

111
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:17,357
And then you find yourself a martyr
to distraction by so many women.

112
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:19,359
Forgive me, but I find
that incomprehensible.

113
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:22,905
As though, I should leave this restaurant
and steal a roll from a baker's shop.

114
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:24,114
Well, you know,
a freshly baked roll.

115
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:28,118
I'm talking about love, and you're
talking about your appetite.

116
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:30,829
Easily confused.
Now, do you know, um, Countvronsky?

117
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:32,498
Who? No. Why?

118
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:34,583
He's your rival. He turned up
from Petersburg after you left.

119
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,667
Who is he?

120
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:38,253
You don't need to worry about him.
He's... He's just...

121
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,005
He's a rich,
good-looking cavalry officer

122
00:10:40,088 --> 00:10:42,716
who has nothing better to do
than make love to pretty women.

123
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,926
Is that cabbage soup?

124
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:47,221
Potage aux choux a la russe,
as the gentleman ordered.

125
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:49,223
It's what I wanted.

126
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:54,311
Understand that, for me, tonight
is a question of life and death.

127
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:55,771
Kostya...

128
00:10:56,396 --> 00:10:58,815
Kostya, Kitty would be
mad to refuse you.

129
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,026
And Dolly's on
your side, you know?

130
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:05,447
She says her sister Kitty was always
meant to be your wife, and will be.

131
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,615
Dolly said that?

132
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:10,452
I've always thought
your Dolly was a gem.

133
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,662
She is.

134
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:13,956
She is.

135
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:15,999
I loved her to distraction.

136
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,877
Konstantin!

137
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:22,464
Konstantin!

138
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,470
Konstantin!

139
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:30,722
I'm too early. I'll come back.

140
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:32,891
No. Come up.

141
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:06,592
Look at me.

142
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:09,595
I'm receiving for Papa and
Maman, who are late to dress.

143
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:11,471
It's my first reception.

144
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:14,349
Princess Ekaterina.

145
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,185
Delighted. Delighted.

146
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:21,857
I'm so pleased you were able to be
with us, Konstantin Dmitrievich.

147
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,318
Kitty, you look...

148
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,530
You look...
Stiva told us you were back.

149
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,615
How long are you staying?

150
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:32,117
I don't know.
It depends on you.

151
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:34,202
On me?

152
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:40,167
What I mean to say is I...

153
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,877
I only came with one purpose.

154
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:45,797
I want to...
Will you be my wife?

155
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,471
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

156
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,514
Wrong moment.
It's the wrong moment.

157
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:55,891
But will you?

158
00:12:58,435 --> 00:12:59,686
I can't.

159
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:08,612
I'm sorry.

160
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:10,864
Yes.

161
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:13,492
It was impossible.

162
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:18,914
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:21,333
Are you the brother
of Nikolai Levin?

164
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,417
Yes.

165
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:26,129
He's in Moscow.
He's staying at the Unicorn in Khitrovka.

166
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:27,339
How do you know?

167
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:29,383
It's the sort of thing I know.

168
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:36,098
Count Vronsky?

169
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:37,599
Yes?

170
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:52,739
Princess Kitty.

171
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:55,534
It's been so long, and yet,
it seems like yesterday.

172
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:57,577
It was yesterday.

173
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:25,689
Excuse me.

174
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:27,149
No.

175
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:29,943
Sorry.

176
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:07,063
It's Kostya.

177
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:09,107
Good God! Look at him.

178
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:12,068
You look like a capitalist.

179
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:14,070
What do you want?

180
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:16,656
Nothing. I came to see you.

181
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,244
Good evening, miss... Madam.

182
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:23,830
Don't talk to her like that.
You sound like a magistrate.

183
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:27,876
More vodka for my brother!
Quick about it.

184
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:30,045
I don't want anything.

185
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,297
I'm all right.

186
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:37,552
Who told you where to find me?

187
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:41,556
A colonel in the Third Department.
They're watching you.

188
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:43,850
Good.

189
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:46,436
They must think I'm dangerous.

190
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:49,439
What have you got
to smile about?

191
00:15:49,523 --> 00:15:50,524
Nothing.

192
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:51,608
That's right.

193
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:55,737
The day is coming.
I have given up my birthright for it.

194
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,782
You're on the wrong side
of history.

195
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:01,451
Not because privilege
is immoral.

196
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:03,912
But because it's irrational.

197
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:07,457
He's sick!

198
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:09,668
Let go, if you know
what's good for you.

199
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,671
I took Marya Nikolaevna
from a brothel.

200
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:16,091
But I consider her my wife.

201
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,010
If her presence offends,
you're free to leave.

202
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:23,515
Are you married?

203
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:26,810
No.

204
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:30,188
Why not?
Are you waiting to fall in love?

205
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:32,107
No. Good.

206
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,026
Romantic love will be the last
illusion of the old order.

207
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:38,592
You should marry
one of your peasants.

208
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:41,283
Yes. I damn well should.

209
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,120
The brotherhood of man!

210
00:16:57,924 --> 00:16:59,634
Nikolai, you need to
see a doctor.

211
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,264
Then come and stay with me at Pokrovskoe
till you get your health back.

212
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:05,765
With my wife?

213
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:07,350
If you.

214
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:09,519
Or...

215
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:12,522
Or go abroad to a spa.

216
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:16,985
I'll send more
if that's what you want.

217
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:29,539
Hello, what's this?

218
00:17:29,623 --> 00:17:32,918
Austrian royalty on their honeymoon.
I've got them for four days.

219
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:35,462
The private carriage will
stop opposite the stand.

220
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:38,298
Bad luck.
What do they like, art?

221
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:39,883
Food.

222
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:42,469
Here's the train.

223
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:05,241
I'll come back.

224
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:15,877
Stiva!

225
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:17,712
Anna!

226
00:18:22,092 --> 00:18:24,594
You don't look ashamed!
I am, I really am.

227
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:28,223
Yes, of course.
Oblonsky's sister, Karenina.

228
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:33,061
Charmante, don't you think?

229
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,040
There, Countess.

230
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:56,204
You have found your son,
and I have found my brother.

231
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:58,003
Madam Karenina has a son, too.

232
00:18:58,086 --> 00:19:00,566
It's the first time they've been
apart, so she frets about him.

233
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:03,258
Excuse me for not
recognizing you before.

234
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:06,678
Au revoir, Countess.
Au revoir, my dear.

235
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:08,763
Let me kiss that pretty face.

236
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,786
Keep your people inside until
this has been cleared up.

237
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:36,207
The sole supporter
of a large family, they say.

238
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,043
Well, can't anything
be done for them?

239
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:39,878
Wait for me, Maman.

240
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,885
Stand back.
Move aside. Stand back.

241
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,762
I have you to thank for that.

242
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,642
What a good fellow!

243
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,228
What a good fellow.

244
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:59,272
Have you known
Count Vronsky long?

245
00:19:59,939 --> 00:20:02,275
Did you like him?
He's in love with Kitty.

246
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:09,282
But we should be discussing
you and Dolly.

247
00:20:09,365 --> 00:20:10,742
What have you got
to say for yourself?

248
00:20:10,825 --> 00:20:13,787
I've said it all.
On my knees, in tears.

249
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,080
Now I need you to say it.

250
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:16,790
I'm going to the office, so
you'll have Dolly to yourself.

251
00:20:16,873 --> 00:20:18,500
Don't be late home.

252
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:21,002
Dear.

253
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,048
Kitty's coming by to see you.

254
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:28,259
She's all grown up
and a bit frightened of you.

255
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:30,428
The belle of
St. Petersburg society.

256
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:32,847
Is that who I am?

257
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:37,685
Dolly.

258
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,648
Stiva has told me.

259
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:47,153
Dolly, I'm sorry.

260
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:49,489
From the bottom of my heart.

261
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:52,033
I don't know what to do.

262
00:20:52,283 --> 00:20:54,369
I know. I know.

263
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:56,704
I can't bear to be with him.

264
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:59,457
And he doesn't care.
He's got what he wants.

265
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,961
What he wants is you.
He loves you, Dolly.

266
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:05,255
You and the children
are everything to him.

267
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:06,589
Are we?

268
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:08,341
And there is room
for a governess?

269
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:11,803
That was shameful, disgraceful,
but it was not love.

270
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:15,140
It was the animal in man
not the soul.

271
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:17,142
Stiva's remorse is
from the soul.

272
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,727
Well, what about me?

273
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:23,022
Does his remorse
make it easier for me?

274
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:26,234
I know you are suffering.
But, Dolly, you must tell me.

275
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,030
Is there enough love left in your heart?
Enough to forgive him?

276
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:37,203
Well, when I think of them
together, I can't forgive him.

277
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:38,371
No.

278
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:42,083
My poor lamb.
So you would rather accept your fate?

279
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,376
My fate?

280
00:21:44,752 --> 00:21:48,006
But I haven't done anything!
It's him who...

281
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:49,757
Do you love him, Dolly?

282
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:57,849
You love him, and he loves you.

283
00:21:57,932 --> 00:21:59,350
But you can't forgive.

284
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:02,562
So, your lives must continue like this
forever, with both of you wretched.

285
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:09,194
That's pretty.
Is that a wedding dress?

286
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:10,486
Yes.

287
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,030
Look for the "G" for "Grisha."

288
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:14,324
Here.

289
00:22:14,407 --> 00:22:15,825
Can you do your whole name?

290
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:17,952
Doesn't that look
like a princess? No?

291
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:22,498
I'm home! Home, home, home!

292
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:24,667
Now, where are
my little ducklings?

293
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:28,880
Papa! Papa!

294
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:30,215
Papa!

295
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,304
Will you stay for
the Bobrishchevs' ball, Anna?

296
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:38,640
I always feel dull at a ball.

297
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:43,436
Stiva, tell Anna
she must come to the ball.

298
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,146
Well, of course she must.

299
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:48,858
And God go with you.

300
00:22:50,318 --> 00:22:52,403
You can introduce me
to your new governess.

301
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:54,989
But she's old! She's a hundred!

302
00:22:57,825 --> 00:22:59,202
I know why you want me to come.

303
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:01,579
You want everyone to be there

304
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:04,290
because you're quite sure
it's going to be your night.

305
00:23:04,374 --> 00:23:06,084
How did you know?

306
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:09,254
I know everything.

307
00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:14,008
To be your age again.

308
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,511
Surrounded by that...

309
00:23:17,053 --> 00:23:18,429
That blue mist.

310
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,474
I was 18, too,
when I got married.

311
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:40,368
Is the prince at home?

312
00:23:40,827 --> 00:23:42,662
He's just gone up, I believe.

313
00:23:42,745 --> 00:23:44,539
Is nobody receiving?

314
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:47,709
I can enquire, sir.
I don't think so.

315
00:23:48,918 --> 00:23:52,463
The princess retired early.
Is there a message?

316
00:24:03,016 --> 00:24:04,726
No. Thank you.

317
00:24:54,317 --> 00:24:56,152
We thought you would
come back married.

318
00:24:56,235 --> 00:24:57,445
Did you?

319
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:03,117
But you only came back
with a hat.

320
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:05,661
A black silk hat.

321
00:25:06,662 --> 00:25:09,207
What kind of animal can you
make a hat like that from?

322
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,833
It's not natural.

323
00:25:12,418 --> 00:25:14,128
Next time, perhaps.

324
00:25:15,004 --> 00:25:16,964
There'll be no next time.

325
00:26:05,638 --> 00:26:06,681
Kitty.

326
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:09,350
May I have a waltz?

327
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,185
You may, Boris.

328
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:14,272
I'll save you the third, just
because it's your first ball.

329
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:15,982
You're my first conquest!

330
00:26:44,427 --> 00:26:46,512
Where do you want to be taken?

331
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,723
There.

332
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,492
How are you, Stiva?

333
00:27:07,575 --> 00:27:10,369
Thanks to Anna, lam a happy man.
Would you like to dance?

334
00:27:10,453 --> 00:27:12,121
No. Ask Anna.

335
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:13,998
No, I don't...

336
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:19,504
Look out!

337
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:00,419
This vile, idiotic
matchmaking of yours.

338
00:28:00,503 --> 00:28:02,880
For goodness' sake,
what have I done?

339
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,925
Is anything the matter?

340
00:28:06,008 --> 00:28:07,218
No.

341
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:14,350
You look as lovely as ever,
Princess Kitty.

342
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:25,486
Don't ask me, Maman.

343
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,947
Kitty, it's us next.

344
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,369
Princess, I have the honor
to claim my dance.

345
00:28:53,514 --> 00:28:56,684
He'll dance the mazurka
with Kitty. You'll see.

346
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:19,832
Lam! I really am!

347
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:28,883
Dance with me.

348
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:32,678
I'm not used to being
spoken to like that

349
00:29:32,762 --> 00:29:34,889
by a man I met once
at a railway station.

350
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:37,475
I dare say, but if I'm
not to dance with you,

351
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:40,478
then I'm getting out of
this operetta and going home.

352
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:43,356
Then, for Kitty's sake.

353
00:31:16,949 --> 00:31:18,075
That's my sister.

354
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:10,187
Next stop is Bologoyel
Bologoye, next stop.

355
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:34,879
Can I be of service to you?

356
00:33:38,632 --> 00:33:40,134
Why are you leaving Moscow?

357
00:33:42,052 --> 00:33:43,637
What else can I do?

358
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:46,724
I have to be where you are.

359
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:48,350
Stop, that's enough.

360
00:33:49,476 --> 00:33:50,644
Go back to Kitty.

361
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,605
No.

362
00:33:53,939 --> 00:33:55,190
This is wrong.

363
00:33:55,274 --> 00:33:56,650
It makes no difference.

364
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:57,985
You have no right.

365
00:33:58,068 --> 00:33:59,612
It makes no difference.

366
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,573
You must forget me.

367
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:05,576
If you're a good man,
you'll forget everything.

368
00:34:05,993 --> 00:34:08,162
And you? Will you forget?

369
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,874
Yes.

370
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:46,367
Ls Serozha all right?

371
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,952
Is that all I get?

372
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:49,119
Yes, he's quite well.

373
00:34:50,704 --> 00:34:51,956
Were you a success?

374
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:53,123
L?

375
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:54,792
Dolly and Stiva.

376
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:57,044
Yes, I think so.

377
00:35:02,007 --> 00:35:03,759
I'll announce myself.
Very good, sir.

378
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,721
Vronsky. The master himself.

379
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,750
Baroness, coffee from the new
coffee pot for Count Vronsky.

380
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:13,727
I'll be off home
if I'm in the way.

381
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:16,188
You're at home
where you are, Baroness.

382
00:35:16,271 --> 00:35:19,233
Pierre, you never say
such pretty things to me.

383
00:35:19,483 --> 00:35:21,276
We were just
discussing my husband.

384
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,320
He won't divorce me, you see,
and do you know why?

385
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:26,281
No. Because he likes eating
off my family silver.

386
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:27,574
I want to bring an action.

387
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,243
Just because I'm supposed
to be unfaithful,

388
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:31,366
I don't see why I have to
eat off Pierre's crockery.

389
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,538
Look at it!

390
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,498
It's my crockery.

391
00:35:35,749 --> 00:35:37,251
How was Moscow?

392
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:39,378
Provincial.

393
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:06,864
Thank you for my presents.

394
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:44,443
I'm writing to Dolly
and to Kitty.

395
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:47,905
You are good.

396
00:37:00,584 --> 00:37:02,169
Time for bed.

397
00:37:06,423 --> 00:37:09,593
What are they saying in Moscow
about the new statute?

398
00:37:10,385 --> 00:37:11,887
What new statute?

399
00:37:13,388 --> 00:37:14,973
The new statute
I carried in Council.

400
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,936
No one mentioned it.

401
00:37:19,895 --> 00:37:21,105
Really?

402
00:37:26,902 --> 00:37:29,196
Here, it caused
quite a sensation.

403
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,563
Princess Betsy.

404
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:04,064
Cousin.

405
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:06,108
I didn't know
you were an art lover.

406
00:38:06,191 --> 00:38:07,734
I'm prepared to be one.

407
00:38:48,984 --> 00:38:50,277
Countess Lydia tells me

408
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,946
you haven't been to one of her
evenings since you returned.

409
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,364
The last one was to
meet a missionary.

410
00:38:54,448 --> 00:38:55,532
The one before that

411
00:38:55,616 --> 00:38:58,744
was for a lecture on the union
of the Greek and Roman Churches.

412
00:39:00,829 --> 00:39:02,706
I'm sorry.

413
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:04,458
I know you're fond of her.

414
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:07,377
Come on, or we'll be late.

415
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,524
Here's the thing, Vronsky.

416
00:39:29,608 --> 00:39:32,402
A posting's come up, and there's
a promotion in it for you.

417
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:33,445
Thank you, sir.

418
00:39:33,528 --> 00:39:35,113
In the garrison in Tashkent.

419
00:39:35,197 --> 00:39:37,074
Tashkent? But...

420
00:39:38,492 --> 00:39:42,037
I would like to stay in Peter,
sir, if you don't mind.

421
00:39:42,454 --> 00:39:43,997
Well, I don't mind.

422
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:48,752
But your mother...
It's her idea.

423
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,688
Your husband is a saint,

424
00:40:08,021 --> 00:40:10,774
and we must all cherish him
for Russia's sake.

425
00:40:17,322 --> 00:40:19,491
You didn't come to my dinner.

426
00:40:19,574 --> 00:40:21,076
I had to see my
Commanding Officer.

427
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:23,495
Well, "she" didn't come either.

428
00:40:27,165 --> 00:40:29,084
I do hope you can
come on afterwards.

429
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:33,171
Father Kristof's report on the Chinese
mission will be with lantern slides.

430
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:36,091
I'm expected at the Tverskoys'.

431
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,302
No doubt.

432
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:42,014
But I'm sure that Princess
Betsy can wait for you.

433
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:53,108
Yes, in fact, I don't think
I will go to Betsy's.

434
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:54,568
You're caught.

435
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:59,239
I'm afraid I'm becoming
quite ridiculous.

436
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:32,314
Now, there's a phenomenon.

437
00:41:32,397 --> 00:41:35,609
Look, Anna's shadow
has arrived before Anna.

438
00:41:35,984 --> 00:41:37,569
I'm Anna's friend.

439
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:39,781
But all this making up
one's mind to it in public

440
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:42,491
is not polite to a distinguished
man like Karenin.

441
00:41:42,574 --> 00:41:46,620
In my opinion, Karenin is a fool
and Anna is the best of us.

442
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:49,748
And we all love you for your
contrary opinions, Princess.

443
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:07,808
Alexei, you look desperate.

444
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:11,186
It's not attractive.

445
00:42:11,478 --> 00:42:12,813
I'm losing hope.

446
00:42:12,896 --> 00:42:14,231
Hope of what?

447
00:42:14,314 --> 00:42:16,475
Persuading a virtuous woman
to break her marriage vows?

448
00:42:18,652 --> 00:42:19,861
No, you're right.

449
00:42:21,696 --> 00:42:23,073
She won't come.

450
00:42:57,691 --> 00:42:59,067
He's gone.

451
00:42:59,192 --> 00:43:01,361
But you're just in time
for the surprise.

452
00:43:40,525 --> 00:43:42,068
Turn around!

453
00:43:42,903 --> 00:43:46,323
May I have the honor
of bringing you an ice?

454
00:43:52,078 --> 00:43:54,247
Ices are being served.

455
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,961
I would prefer
to try a cigarette.

456
00:44:16,102 --> 00:44:17,521
Courage.

457
00:44:17,938 --> 00:44:19,356
I'll try another one sometime.

458
00:44:20,273 --> 00:44:21,441
When?

459
00:44:22,108 --> 00:44:23,318
Where?

460
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:26,738
Just as I was thinking your manners
had improved since Moscow.

461
00:44:26,821 --> 00:44:28,156
You behaved badly.

462
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,533
Very badly.

463
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:31,660
And who was
responsible for that?

464
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,249
Give me a cup of tea.

465
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,047
How nice!

466
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,966
Alexei Alexandrovich
has arrived.

467
00:44:48,426 --> 00:44:50,906
I'm not sure my nerves can stand
another Alexei at this moment.

468
00:44:57,644 --> 00:44:59,312
Were you glad to see me or not?

469
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,940
So the Schuzburgs
asked us to dinner.

470
00:45:02,023 --> 00:45:06,319
The sauce was said to have cost a
thousand rubles, and it was ghastly.

471
00:45:12,158 --> 00:45:15,912
I gave them a sauce that cost
85 kopeks and it was a triumph.

472
00:45:17,664 --> 00:45:19,249
This must stop.

473
00:45:19,499 --> 00:45:21,209
You make me feel as if I
were guilty of something.

474
00:45:21,293 --> 00:45:22,502
What do you want me to do?

475
00:45:23,086 --> 00:45:25,287
I want you to go to Moscow
and beg Kitty to forgive you.

476
00:45:25,338 --> 00:45:27,007
No, that's not what you want.

477
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,842
Moscow?
I can do better than that.

478
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:32,262
Tonight I refused a posting
to Tashkent.

479
00:45:33,013 --> 00:45:35,515
I can change my mind,
and you'll never see me again.

480
00:45:37,225 --> 00:45:39,705
If you have any thought for me,
you will give me back my peace.

481
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:41,271
I have no peace to give.

482
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:43,106
There can be no peace for us.

483
00:45:43,189 --> 00:45:46,192
Only misery
or the greatest happiness.

484
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:50,280
Your husband is impossible.

485
00:45:50,363 --> 00:45:51,448
His opinions are all wrong,

486
00:45:51,531 --> 00:45:53,617
but he talks so brilliantly,
he wins every argument.

487
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,118
What?

488
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,578
I called to take you home.

489
00:45:57,162 --> 00:45:58,413
No, I'm staying.

490
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:01,082
Send the carriage back for me.

491
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,250
Of course.

492
00:46:23,355 --> 00:46:25,732
Do you want me
to go to Tashkent?

493
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:40,246
So I'll go to Tashkent.

494
00:46:40,372 --> 00:46:41,498
No!

495
00:46:45,085 --> 00:46:46,586
I don't want you to go.

496
00:47:16,324 --> 00:47:18,451
I stayed up to talk to you.

497
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:26,084
What about?

498
00:47:27,502 --> 00:47:28,920
It's late.

499
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:31,548
Where's Annushka?

500
00:47:34,759 --> 00:47:35,969
I sent her off.

501
00:47:38,888 --> 00:47:40,056
Well.

502
00:47:41,808 --> 00:47:43,810
If you want to talk,
but we should go to bed.

503
00:47:43,977 --> 00:47:45,228
I must warn you
about something.

504
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:46,396
Warn me?

505
00:47:49,107 --> 00:47:50,400
It's really rather late.

506
00:47:50,483 --> 00:47:52,527
I wish to warn you that
you may, inadvertently

507
00:47:53,528 --> 00:47:55,739
by indiscretion
and carelessness,

508
00:47:55,822 --> 00:47:57,462
give the world occasion
to talk about you.

509
00:47:57,532 --> 00:47:59,075
I am not a committee.

510
00:48:00,326 --> 00:48:01,786
Please say
what you want to tell me.

511
00:48:05,248 --> 00:48:07,333
You and Count Vronsky
attracted attention tonight.

512
00:48:09,961 --> 00:48:11,762
You don't like it
when I don't talk to people,

513
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:13,131
and you don't like it
when I do.

514
00:48:13,214 --> 00:48:14,632
I didn't notice
anything myself,

515
00:48:14,716 --> 00:48:15,967
but I saw
everyone else noticed.

516
00:48:17,385 --> 00:48:21,097
I consider jealousy to be insulting
to you and degrading to me.

517
00:48:21,181 --> 00:48:23,141
I have no right
to inquire into your feelings.

518
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,560
They concern
only your conscience.

519
00:48:25,894 --> 00:48:29,272
But it's my duty to remind you
that we are bound together by God,

520
00:48:29,355 --> 00:48:32,859
and this bond can only be
broken by a crime against God.

521
00:48:33,234 --> 00:48:35,403
I have nothing to say to you.

522
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,198
And you have a son.

523
00:48:38,573 --> 00:48:39,949
And I'm tired.

524
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:53,171
If I am wrong,
I ask your pardon.

525
00:48:55,965 --> 00:48:58,218
I don't know
what you're talking about,

526
00:48:58,301 --> 00:49:00,178
and it's really
too late for this.

527
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,141
Excuse me, please.

528
00:49:14,567 --> 00:49:15,902
Too late.

529
00:50:32,145 --> 00:50:34,230
God! Forgive me!

530
00:50:35,064 --> 00:50:36,649
It's the end of everything.

531
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:39,152
I've got nothing left now
except you, remember that.

532
00:50:41,195 --> 00:50:43,323
How could I not remember?

533
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:46,826
You're my happiness.

534
00:50:52,081 --> 00:50:53,625
Happiness?

535
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:55,752
You murdered my happiness.

536
00:50:56,711 --> 00:50:58,171
Murderer.

537
00:50:58,546 --> 00:50:59,923
Murderer.

538
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:02,592
Go on.

539
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:04,010
Yes.

540
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:06,471
Go on. Murderer.

541
00:51:07,722 --> 00:51:08,890
Murderer.

542
00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:25,365
Look out, here they come.

543
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,327
Bad luck.

544
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:40,380
Potage aux choux a la russe!

545
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,632
Agafia, if you
opened up in Moscow,

546
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:44,759
the I'Angleterre
would go out of business.

547
00:51:47,261 --> 00:51:48,680
It's true.

548
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,224
Do you want news of Moscow?
Babylon? No.

549
00:51:51,557 --> 00:51:52,934
You're right, what do you care?

550
00:51:53,017 --> 00:51:54,310
You love the country,
you've got it.

551
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:56,854
You love agriculturing, and,
Lord knows, you've got that.

552
00:51:56,938 --> 00:51:58,189
You love shooting,
you've got that.

553
00:51:58,272 --> 00:51:59,649
You've got everything you want.
Ha!

554
00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:03,194
All right, go on, then.

555
00:52:03,277 --> 00:52:04,757
Have you stopped
stealing bread rolls?

556
00:52:05,905 --> 00:52:08,574
Ballet girl, Oriental type.
How can I help it?

557
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:11,035
How is...

558
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,578
How are the Shcherbatskys?

559
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:13,913
You mean Kitty.

560
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:16,624
Is she engaged now? No.

561
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:19,335
Vronsky went back
to St. Petersburg.

562
00:52:21,337 --> 00:52:23,965
Kitty will be seeing Dolly
at Ergoshovo in the summer.

563
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:25,591
You could...

564
00:52:25,717 --> 00:52:27,385
Yes, as if I had
time in the summer.

565
00:52:27,468 --> 00:52:30,013
And I've got extra land at Kashin
this year for the haymaking.

566
00:52:30,096 --> 00:52:32,015
Kashin? That's on the
Ergoshovo road, isn't it?

567
00:52:32,265 --> 00:52:33,599
Couldn't you see Kitty
when she's there?

568
00:52:33,725 --> 00:52:36,185
Especially, not then.
I humiliated myself once.

569
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:38,604
Damn you, Kostya.
You love Kitty.

570
00:52:40,064 --> 00:52:41,625
You love Kitty
and you can't forgive her

571
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,860
because, first, you funked it,
and then you bungled it.

572
00:52:43,943 --> 00:52:45,744
And then you ran away
from an 18-year-old girl

573
00:52:45,778 --> 00:52:48,364
who was made
a fool of by a uniform.

574
00:52:48,948 --> 00:52:50,588
It's not you I feel
sorry for, it's Kitty.

575
00:52:50,658 --> 00:52:51,993
Her heart told her no.

576
00:52:53,411 --> 00:52:56,330
Did you come to shoot snipe
or criticize me?

577
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:05,465
Well, don't hold him
like a parcel.

578
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,551
It's Aunt Kitty, darling.

579
00:53:10,386 --> 00:53:13,556
Doesn't he make you ashamed
of dwelling on your troubles?

580
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:14,849
I have no troubles.

581
00:53:15,433 --> 00:53:17,727
That man wasn't worth
the tears, believe me.

582
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:21,064
I don't care about him.
I don't even think about him, or her.

583
00:53:21,814 --> 00:53:23,441
Except to hate her.

584
00:53:24,317 --> 00:53:26,819
Then we'll never
speak of it again.

585
00:53:29,322 --> 00:53:31,908
There are better men
waiting for you.

586
00:53:32,492 --> 00:53:33,993
Stiva says...

587
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:40,625
Kitty, my lamb,
did Konstantin...

588
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:42,960
What has Levin
got to do with it?

589
00:53:43,044 --> 00:53:45,004
Anyway, I'll never get married.

590
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:48,758
The whole business of it
has become disgusting to me.

591
00:53:48,841 --> 00:53:51,122
And look what it's done for you.
Why do they call it love?

592
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:55,515
Because it's love.

593
00:54:00,686 --> 00:54:02,021
I want you to,
I don't care about it.

594
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:03,189
You should care.

595
00:54:03,523 --> 00:54:06,025
Anyway, someone
might be watching.

596
00:54:18,746 --> 00:54:20,706
But I'm damned, anyway.

597
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:23,209
I'm not. I'm blessed.

598
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:27,672
You love me. Yes.

599
00:54:27,755 --> 00:54:29,173
Only me. No.

600
00:54:31,926 --> 00:54:33,970
Apart from Frou-Frou? Yes.

601
00:54:34,262 --> 00:54:36,264
But me more than your horse?

602
00:54:36,347 --> 00:54:37,390
Yes.

603
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:41,936
Are you happy?

604
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:43,938
Yes.

605
00:54:45,731 --> 00:54:47,191
And you love me?

606
00:54:47,275 --> 00:54:48,484
Yes.

607
00:54:50,278 --> 00:54:51,362
How much?

608
00:54:52,405 --> 00:54:53,531
This much.

609
00:54:55,366 --> 00:54:56,450
This much?

610
00:54:56,868 --> 00:54:57,952
Yes.

611
00:54:58,411 --> 00:55:00,079
This much? Yes.

612
00:55:00,246 --> 00:55:01,414
And this much?

613
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:03,249
Yes.

614
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:04,458
This much?

615
00:55:04,542 --> 00:55:05,960
Yes.

616
00:55:06,085 --> 00:55:08,254
This much? And this much?

617
00:55:25,688 --> 00:55:27,565
So, this is love.

618
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:30,276
This.

619
00:55:34,947 --> 00:55:36,032
Countess.

620
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:40,494
I thought you would be
at Peterhof now.

621
00:55:40,578 --> 00:55:41,871
I've come from there.

622
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,790
I'm distressed that you haven't
taken your usual house this year.

623
00:55:45,124 --> 00:55:46,959
Anna wanted a change.

624
00:55:47,543 --> 00:55:50,504
Nearer to Princess Betsy
at Tsarskoe Selo.

625
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,218
The guards are in summer camp
at Tsarskoe.

626
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:58,304
Alexei Alexandrovich,

627
00:55:59,805 --> 00:56:01,474
forgive me, but...

628
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,228
You are too tolerant.
Your wife is...

629
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:07,605
Is this about my wife?

630
00:56:07,688 --> 00:56:09,815
My wife is beyond reproach.

631
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,777
She is, after all, my wife.

632
00:56:25,831 --> 00:56:27,667
Alyosha! Alyosha!

633
00:56:30,753 --> 00:56:32,296
A message from Maman.

634
00:56:32,463 --> 00:56:34,590
Her friend Princess Sorokina
has a house here

635
00:56:34,674 --> 00:56:36,926
and a virgin daughter.

636
00:56:37,051 --> 00:56:38,928
Well, that's not
part of the message,

637
00:56:39,011 --> 00:56:40,388
but they'll all be at the races

638
00:56:40,471 --> 00:56:42,072
and you're expected
to supper afterwards.

639
00:56:42,306 --> 00:56:44,934
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

640
00:56:45,017 --> 00:56:47,520
I give you the regiment!

641
00:56:48,354 --> 00:56:50,189
The regiment!

642
00:56:54,902 --> 00:56:56,821
I heard you turned down
a promotion.

643
00:56:56,904 --> 00:56:58,906
That was Maman interfering.

644
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,074
Yes.

645
00:57:00,324 --> 00:57:02,125
And now she's come up
with a princess for you.

646
00:57:04,745 --> 00:57:07,873
Alexei, we're brothers,
so don't take offense.

647
00:57:08,582 --> 00:57:11,335
Getting married
puts the pack on your back.

648
00:57:11,419 --> 00:57:14,171
It leaves your hands free
for climbing the ladder.

649
00:57:16,215 --> 00:57:18,092
Getting serious
about a married woman

650
00:57:18,175 --> 00:57:19,635
is like carrying
your pack in your arms.

651
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:21,387
So, they talk about me.

652
00:57:24,181 --> 00:57:25,933
I'm leaving, Sasha.

653
00:57:27,226 --> 00:57:28,728
An assignation?

654
00:57:28,811 --> 00:57:30,604
Come on, I'll introduce you.

655
00:57:34,233 --> 00:57:35,609
Beautiful.

656
00:57:36,652 --> 00:57:38,863
A man would come to no harm.

657
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:43,576
Do you think
you'll win tomorrow?

658
00:57:43,951 --> 00:57:45,619
Makhotin's
Gladiator is favorite.

659
00:57:46,287 --> 00:57:47,788
Sixteen hands.

660
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:49,665
Frou-Frou looks dainty
beside him.

661
00:57:50,624 --> 00:57:52,376
But she's got heart.

662
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,086
Haven't you, my darling?

663
00:58:10,603 --> 00:58:11,771
Anna.

664
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:15,399
Alexei!

665
00:58:15,983 --> 00:58:17,068
What is it?

666
00:58:17,985 --> 00:58:20,780
I couldn't bear not to
see you before the race.

667
00:58:27,953 --> 00:58:30,122
What were you thinking about?

668
00:58:34,293 --> 00:58:35,669
Tell me.

669
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,382
I'm pregnant.

670
00:58:41,509 --> 00:58:42,968
My love.

671
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:47,932
Well, love was
never a game to us.

672
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:50,976
Here's an end
to living in corners,

673
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,645
existing day to day on lies.

674
00:58:53,104 --> 00:58:54,647
Yes.

675
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:56,982
Now we can be together.

676
00:58:57,858 --> 00:58:59,652
How can we, Alexei?

677
00:58:59,819 --> 00:59:01,821
Tell Karenin everything.

678
00:59:01,946 --> 00:59:03,906
Do you think my husband
will make you a present of me?

679
00:59:03,989 --> 00:59:05,074
Leave him.

680
00:59:05,157 --> 00:59:06,534
Leave him and be your mistress?

681
00:59:06,617 --> 00:59:08,327
Yes, run away.

682
00:59:11,539 --> 00:59:13,833
I would never see my son again.

683
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:16,585
The laws are made by
husbands and fathers.

684
00:59:16,669 --> 00:59:18,045
What, then?

685
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:22,174
I'll never forgive myself
for your unhappiness.

686
00:59:22,675 --> 00:59:24,176
Unhappiness?

687
00:59:25,177 --> 00:59:27,638
I'm like a starving beggar
who's been given food.

688
00:59:28,514 --> 00:59:29,849
I, unhappy?

689
00:59:31,642 --> 00:59:32,852
No.

690
00:59:34,895 --> 00:59:36,814
This is my happiness.

691
00:59:39,316 --> 00:59:40,943
Serozha!

692
00:59:42,862 --> 00:59:44,572
Serozha, I'm coming to get you!

693
00:59:49,743 --> 00:59:51,287
Where are you?

694
00:59:53,247 --> 00:59:54,707
Serozha!

695
00:59:56,667 --> 00:59:58,210
Where are you?

696
00:59:59,837 --> 01:00:01,839
How are you, young man?

697
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:04,105
Your tutor doesn't seem
to be in evidence.

698
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:05,384
Yah!

699
01:00:09,513 --> 01:00:10,890
Alexei.

700
01:00:11,223 --> 01:00:13,434
You got away at last.
Can you stay?

701
01:00:13,893 --> 01:00:15,144
Why?

702
01:00:17,104 --> 01:00:19,190
Go and find Vastly Lukich.

703
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,026
I have to change.

704
01:00:22,109 --> 01:00:23,944
Princess Betsy
is sending her trap for me.

705
01:00:24,028 --> 01:00:26,780
Would you like to come?
She's taking me to watch the race.

706
01:00:27,072 --> 01:00:28,657
Races, surely.

707
01:00:28,908 --> 01:00:32,328
No, I'll come on later.
Then I must get back to town.

708
01:01:07,863 --> 01:01:09,198
Yes!

709
01:01:22,002 --> 01:01:23,379
Princess! Princess!

710
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:25,214
A bet!
Who do you fancy in the next?

711
01:01:25,881 --> 01:01:27,049
Kusolev.

712
01:01:27,466 --> 01:01:29,176
I'm on Vronsky. Pair of gloves?

713
01:01:29,969 --> 01:01:31,470
Done.

714
01:01:35,891 --> 01:01:37,810
Alexander Vronsky.

715
01:01:50,656 --> 01:01:52,616
You are an exquisite creature.

716
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,868
You really ought to be
the spoils of victory today.

717
01:02:42,207 --> 01:02:43,626
Yah! Yah!

718
01:02:48,589 --> 01:02:50,341
Go, Frou-Frou! Go!

719
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:58,057
Go!

720
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:06,231
Go, Frou-Frou! Go!

721
01:03:11,403 --> 01:03:13,072
Alexei!

722
01:03:19,703 --> 01:03:21,080
I'm here.

723
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:32,549
I'm here.

724
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:37,554
Get up!

725
01:03:39,598 --> 01:03:40,766
Get up!

726
01:03:43,394 --> 01:03:44,687
Her back is broken.

727
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:04,289
You know...

728
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:11,463
They say the Emperor
disapproves of the races.

729
01:04:12,172 --> 01:04:13,507
The danger of injury.

730
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:14,675
But I...

731
01:04:14,758 --> 01:04:15,926
What?

732
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:22,516
I'm saying I think there's a value
in manly sport, for the military.

733
01:04:24,143 --> 01:04:25,477
I don't understand.

734
01:04:26,895 --> 01:04:31,316
In my opinion, it's not the sport itself.
It's the spectacle.

735
01:04:32,109 --> 01:04:34,027
It's making
a cruel spectacle out of...

736
01:04:34,153 --> 01:04:35,988
What are you talking about?

737
01:04:38,949 --> 01:04:40,576
I have to tell you... Yes.

738
01:04:40,701 --> 01:04:43,996
I have to tell you,
you behaved improperly today.

739
01:04:45,247 --> 01:04:46,457
How is that?

740
01:04:49,001 --> 01:04:52,671
By making plain your feeling
when one of the riders fell.

741
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:54,965
Your conduct was improper.

742
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:59,219
It must not occur again.
I have said it before.

743
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:05,309
You will say my concern
is unnecessary and ridiculous.

744
01:05:05,392 --> 01:05:07,019
You are my wife.

745
01:05:08,187 --> 01:05:10,189
I'm wrong to think that.

746
01:05:12,483 --> 01:05:13,692
Yes?

747
01:05:14,568 --> 01:05:16,028
Perhaps I was mistaken...

748
01:05:16,153 --> 01:05:17,446
No.

749
01:05:18,697 --> 01:05:20,574
You were not mistaken.

750
01:05:24,036 --> 01:05:25,496
I love him.

751
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,541
I am his mistress.

752
01:05:33,504 --> 01:05:35,422
Do what you like to me.

753
01:05:49,686 --> 01:05:51,188
Wait. Please, move away.

754
01:05:57,277 --> 01:06:00,948
I will not have a scandal.
Therefore, you will not see this man again.

755
01:06:01,573 --> 01:06:05,285
You will behave in a way that
nothing is known against you

756
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:07,120
by society or by the servants.

757
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:12,251
In return, you will keep the
privileges of a wife, and the duties.

758
01:06:12,709 --> 01:06:15,587
Tomorrow you will return home.
That is all.

759
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,663
Are you hurt?

760
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:55,002
What's happened?

761
01:06:55,961 --> 01:06:58,130
I told him I'm your mistress.

762
01:06:59,047 --> 01:07:00,807
He thinks I can give you
up and go on living.

763
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:02,634
No. You cannot.

764
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:50,974
Time for bed?

765
01:08:01,568 --> 01:08:04,529
It was pleasant to hear you being
congratulated on your husband.

766
01:08:05,822 --> 01:08:07,616
Not that I care
for decorations, but...

767
01:08:07,824 --> 01:08:09,534
Alexei, I can't. I'm sorry.

768
01:08:12,704 --> 01:08:14,665
But I'm his wife, now.

769
01:08:21,338 --> 01:08:23,173
I'm having his child.

770
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:59,584
Tell me what I did
to deserve this.

771
01:09:29,573 --> 01:09:30,615
Halt!

772
01:09:54,306 --> 01:09:56,308
How many mowers
is it, Theodore?

773
01:09:56,391 --> 01:09:58,477
Forty-two, Master.

774
01:09:59,311 --> 01:10:03,023
In your father's time, it was
work for two days for 30 men.

775
01:10:03,106 --> 01:10:04,900
Though he never
picked up a scythe himself.

776
01:10:06,443 --> 01:10:08,695
The men don't like me for it.

777
01:10:08,862 --> 01:10:11,031
They like what they're used to.

778
01:10:11,323 --> 01:10:12,699
It settles me.

779
01:10:12,783 --> 01:10:13,992
How is that, Master?

780
01:10:14,951 --> 01:10:17,621
When I'm mowing, I don't
ask myself why I'm here.

781
01:10:17,704 --> 01:10:20,290
You're here to be
Master Konstantin Dmitrievich.

782
01:10:20,499 --> 01:10:22,667
As it's always been,
by the grace of God.

783
01:10:23,043 --> 01:10:25,337
My father owned you, Theodore.

784
01:10:25,962 --> 01:10:28,423
Owned you like chattels
to be bought and sold.

785
01:10:28,673 --> 01:10:30,175
Was that by the grace of God?

786
01:10:31,885 --> 01:10:33,261
It was.

787
01:10:33,845 --> 01:10:36,014
That's my youngest
you were looking at, there.

788
01:10:36,973 --> 01:10:41,019
His young life is perilous now since the
freedom came and work must be found.

789
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,605
They look happier
than I've ever been.

790
01:10:46,691 --> 01:10:49,486
Is it living simply
that I'm looking for?

791
01:12:25,999 --> 01:12:27,542
I'm expected.

792
01:12:31,087 --> 01:12:32,297
No.

793
01:12:33,465 --> 01:12:35,550
I will not live like this.

794
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:39,179
This waiting
for hour after hour,

795
01:12:39,304 --> 01:12:41,473
not knowing
when I'll ever see you again.

796
01:12:42,307 --> 01:12:43,475
Sorry.

797
01:12:44,559 --> 01:12:46,269
It's my demon. I can't help it.

798
01:12:46,478 --> 01:12:47,729
You wrote that you were ill.

799
01:12:47,812 --> 01:12:49,022
Don't worry,
it won't be for long.

800
01:12:49,105 --> 01:12:50,565
Stop. No, it's true.

801
01:12:50,649 --> 01:12:51,942
I was told it in a dream.

802
01:12:52,025 --> 01:12:53,318
There. It was only a bad dream.

803
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:55,028
Yes, and I'm only going
to die having your baby.

804
01:12:55,111 --> 01:12:57,614
That's all nonsense.
Tell me it is.

805
01:12:58,365 --> 01:13:00,075
Tell me it is.

806
01:13:02,118 --> 01:13:03,495
You love me, only me.

807
01:13:03,578 --> 01:13:06,373
Your note said
your husband would be out.

808
01:13:06,539 --> 01:13:09,042
He was late.
It serves him right.

809
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:13,672
And you...

810
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,799
Why do you call him my husband?

811
01:13:15,882 --> 01:13:17,342
He isn't my husband,
he's a clock.

812
01:13:17,425 --> 01:13:20,345
But it was awkward. My honor.
You made an agreement.

813
01:13:20,428 --> 01:13:23,390
Do you think of your honor when you're
sharing whores with your Colonel?

814
01:13:23,473 --> 01:13:25,183
Your demon again?

815
01:13:26,601 --> 01:13:28,687
I'll be glad to die
before you start to hate me.

816
01:13:28,812 --> 01:13:30,105
Anna.

817
01:13:32,023 --> 01:13:33,566
Put your hand there.

818
01:13:35,235 --> 01:13:36,820
You can feel him move.

819
01:13:39,155 --> 01:13:41,866
I respectfully ask
Minister Karenin

820
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:47,539
whether his proposals for the regulation
of these colorful gypsy tribes

821
01:13:48,164 --> 01:13:51,459
of these scholarly,
God-fearing Jews, and of...

822
01:13:52,669 --> 01:13:56,172
But I'm afraid I've lost
the Minister's attention.

823
01:13:58,633 --> 01:13:59,718
Who is here?

824
01:13:59,801 --> 01:14:01,553
Only Madame, Your Excellency.

825
01:14:07,892 --> 01:14:09,436
I wanted to see him because...

826
01:14:09,519 --> 01:14:13,106
I do not wish to know why a
woman wants to see her lover.

827
01:14:13,898 --> 01:14:15,191
What are you doing?

828
01:14:15,358 --> 01:14:16,818
I want his letters!

829
01:14:22,532 --> 01:14:24,868
Lam going to Moscow tomorrow,
and then the provinces

830
01:14:24,951 --> 01:14:27,871
with a commission to investigate
conditions among the Jews and gypsies,

831
01:14:27,954 --> 01:14:30,874
whose conditions
I infinitely prefer to my own.

832
01:14:30,957 --> 01:14:35,295
I will not return to this house until
divorce has driven you into the street.

833
01:14:35,378 --> 01:14:37,778
Meanwhile, my son will be sent
to live with my eldest sister.

834
01:14:37,922 --> 01:14:40,342
No, Alexei, please.
Please, leave me Serozha!

835
01:14:40,675 --> 01:14:42,802
Do you think
I would let you have my son?

836
01:14:42,886 --> 01:14:44,971
You are depraved.
A woman without honor.

837
01:14:45,055 --> 01:14:48,183
I thank God the curse of
love is lifted from me.

838
01:15:05,742 --> 01:15:07,494
I need your advice.

839
01:15:14,834 --> 01:15:16,836
Come on, come on! Yes, yes.

840
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:23,551
Right, after you, after you.

841
01:15:23,635 --> 01:15:25,387
Are we late?
Of course, you're late.

842
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:27,597
I'm Countess Nordston.

843
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,433
We nearly met at the
Shcherbatskys' last winter.

844
01:15:30,517 --> 01:15:31,976
Come into the fold.

845
01:15:32,102 --> 01:15:33,436
Come on.

846
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:39,150
You've been waiting for me.
Forgive me.

847
01:15:41,111 --> 01:15:42,695
Kitty is here.

848
01:15:45,907 --> 01:15:49,327
Konstantin, what a long time
since we saw each other.

849
01:15:49,786 --> 01:15:52,497
Since you saw me, but I
saw you not so long ago.

850
01:15:52,831 --> 01:15:53,873
When?

851
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:55,834
You were driving to Ergoshovo.

852
01:15:55,917 --> 01:15:57,335
I was at Kashin
for the haymaking.

853
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:58,586
But why didn't you

854
01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:00,338
I'm so glad to see you.

855
01:16:01,339 --> 01:16:02,924
You're just the same.

856
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:06,719
I hope not.

857
01:16:07,846 --> 01:16:09,722
I was young and silly
in those days.

858
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,683
Months and months ago.

859
01:16:15,645 --> 01:16:17,063
And you haven't changed.

860
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:21,359
No. I haven't.

861
01:16:26,656 --> 01:16:29,576
Permit me to announce,
um, soup Marie-Louise carp

862
01:16:29,659 --> 01:16:31,744
with asparagus and roast beef.

863
01:16:31,828 --> 01:16:33,830
I went to the market in person.

864
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:38,543
An extra place.

865
01:16:40,795 --> 01:16:44,132
I've come to tell you our
connecfion must be severed.

866
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:46,718
I'm going to
divorce your sister.

867
01:16:48,094 --> 01:16:49,345
Divorce?

868
01:16:51,347 --> 01:16:53,266
Dear me, what are you
talking about?

869
01:16:53,349 --> 01:16:54,989
Well, don't be in a hurry.
Stay to dinner.

870
01:16:55,059 --> 01:16:56,311
And later, you can talk
it over with Dolly.

871
01:16:56,394 --> 01:16:58,313
Prince Oblonsky, everything
is over between our families.

872
01:16:58,396 --> 01:17:01,274
Alexei, divorce is one thing.
Dinner is quite another.

873
01:17:01,941 --> 01:17:05,320
You Petersburgers
think yourselves so de bon ton

874
01:17:05,403 --> 01:17:08,531
compared with dull,
old-fashioned Moscow.

875
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,909
But we know how to do things.

876
01:17:11,034 --> 01:17:12,118
Only the other day,

877
01:17:12,202 --> 01:17:15,121
I hear Vasya Pryachnikov fought a
duel with Kvitsky and killed him.

878
01:17:15,205 --> 01:17:16,289
Well, what...

879
01:17:16,372 --> 01:17:17,999
What was the challenge about?

880
01:17:18,082 --> 01:17:19,709
Pryachnikov's wife, naturally.

881
01:17:19,792 --> 01:17:21,503
It was a matter
of honor, defending a woman's honor.

882
01:17:21,586 --> 01:17:25,215
Sounds like barbarism to me.
What if the lover had killed the husband?

883
01:17:25,298 --> 01:17:27,884
Would that have preserved
the wife's honor, too?

884
01:17:27,967 --> 01:17:30,512
Still, not many of us can say
our lover died for love.

885
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,930
Love?

886
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:35,099
"Thou shall not covet
thy neighbor's wife."

887
01:17:44,651 --> 01:17:47,820
Would you die for love,
Konstantin Dmitrievich?

888
01:17:48,154 --> 01:17:50,281
I would. But not for
my neighbor's wife.

889
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:56,871
An impure love
is not love to me.

890
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:00,124
To admire another man's wife
is a pleasant thing,

891
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,795
but sensual desire indulged
for its own sake is greed,

892
01:18:04,128 --> 01:18:05,797
a kind of gluttony,

893
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,883
and a misuse of something
sacred, which is given to us

894
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:12,303
so that we may choose the one person
with whom to fulfill our humanness.

895
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,183
Otherwise,
we might as well be cattle.

896
01:18:17,267 --> 01:18:18,893
An idealist!

897
01:18:25,525 --> 01:18:27,777
But she will be nobody's wife.

898
01:18:28,278 --> 01:18:29,529
She'll be ruined.

899
01:18:30,613 --> 01:18:33,241
I tried to save her.
She chose ruin.

900
01:18:33,908 --> 01:18:35,285
Alexei Alexandrovich.

901
01:18:35,785 --> 01:18:36,995
Look at me.

902
01:18:39,205 --> 01:18:42,667
You will have no peace of mind
until you forgive her.

903
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:46,170
It was Anna who taught me that.

904
01:18:46,296 --> 01:18:47,797
I do not wish to forgive.

905
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,757
I'm not a cruel man.

906
01:18:49,841 --> 01:18:51,884
I've never hated anyone.

907
01:18:52,302 --> 01:18:54,053
But I hate her with all my soul

908
01:18:54,137 --> 01:18:56,639
for all the wrong
she has done me.

909
01:18:58,349 --> 01:19:01,144
Now, it is your turn
to play us something, Countess.

910
01:19:01,227 --> 01:19:03,271
I thought you'd never ask.

911
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:04,814
Very good.

912
01:19:06,941 --> 01:19:08,985
Since we last met,

913
01:19:09,068 --> 01:19:12,155
there is something I have
often wanted to ask you.

914
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:13,781
What is that?

915
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:25,793
This.

916
01:19:28,963 --> 01:19:30,381
Do...

917
01:19:31,215 --> 01:19:32,258
Not...

918
01:19:38,222 --> 01:19:39,515
Did.

919
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:43,227
Did not.

920
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:57,742
The last word is "never."

921
01:21:08,771 --> 01:21:10,231
I know what it says.

922
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,548
Then.

923
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:40,219
But now?

924
01:21:48,478 --> 01:21:50,146
Can you forgive

925
01:21:52,023 --> 01:21:53,399
and forget?

926
01:22:10,374 --> 01:22:11,959
I never stopped.

927
01:23:35,459 --> 01:23:37,211
Why doesn't he come?

928
01:23:38,421 --> 01:23:41,465
He is kind. He will forgive me.

929
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:45,803
Her fever is higher.

930
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:48,306
I want Alexei.
Why doesn't he come?

931
01:23:48,848 --> 01:23:50,600
Give me some water.
No, I mustn't.

932
01:23:51,225 --> 01:23:52,685
It isn't good
for my little girl.

933
01:23:52,852 --> 01:23:54,687
Or let her have a nurse, yes.

934
01:23:55,229 --> 01:23:57,857
Don't bring her here
because Alexei is coming

935
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:59,901
and it will hurt him
to see her.

936
01:24:00,026 --> 01:24:02,194
He's come, my dear. Look there.

937
01:24:02,695 --> 01:24:05,197
Her deliverance
is still in God's hands.

938
01:24:05,281 --> 01:24:08,826
You think he won't forgive
me but you don't know him.

939
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,829
No one knows him except me.

940
01:24:12,538 --> 01:24:14,665
I'm not afraid of him, now.

941
01:24:17,084 --> 01:24:18,961
I'm afraid of death, though.

942
01:24:29,388 --> 01:24:30,848
You poor man.

943
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:36,562
Let him come closer.

944
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:39,982
Alexei.

945
01:24:43,402 --> 01:24:44,612
Alexei.

946
01:24:59,251 --> 01:25:00,711
Look at my husband.

947
01:25:01,754 --> 01:25:03,214
He's a saint.

948
01:25:04,256 --> 01:25:05,758
Take his hand.

949
01:25:22,149 --> 01:25:23,484
Thank God.

950
01:25:25,403 --> 01:25:26,487
Thank God.

951
01:25:43,546 --> 01:25:45,256
You must leave now.

952
01:25:46,173 --> 01:25:49,176
I promise to send for you
if she asks for you.

953
01:25:50,553 --> 01:25:52,888
I don't know
what happened to me.

954
01:25:53,055 --> 01:25:56,100
I forgive you. I forgive Anna.

955
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:00,730
My soul is filled with joy.

956
01:26:02,565 --> 01:26:05,776
I will remain with her
and look after her forever.

957
01:26:11,323 --> 01:26:12,616
Come now.

958
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:21,292
Come now.

959
01:26:22,168 --> 01:26:23,586
Look at you.

960
01:26:24,336 --> 01:26:27,506
You look like what you've become.
A laughingstock.

961
01:26:28,924 --> 01:26:30,968
I fancy you will be asked
to leave the regiment.

962
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:32,553
I would like you to go, Maman.

963
01:26:32,636 --> 01:26:34,305
I'll go when I'm ready to go.

964
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:36,932
A little affair
with a married woman

965
01:26:37,016 --> 01:26:38,893
puts a finishing touch
to a young man's education.

966
01:26:38,976 --> 01:26:41,479
But this morbid,
selfish obsession...

967
01:26:41,562 --> 01:26:42,938
You've publicly
humiliated yourself

968
01:26:43,022 --> 01:26:45,223
and dishonored a man who has
devoted his life to Russia.

969
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:48,819
So you'd better come back
to Moscow with me.

970
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:50,863
You're finished here.

971
01:27:11,383 --> 01:27:15,387
And there was her husband,
wearing her best ball gown.

972
01:27:15,471 --> 01:27:17,598
Rouge all over his face.

973
01:27:19,225 --> 01:27:21,102
Ma chére, le scandale!

974
01:27:23,312 --> 01:27:26,232
But I'd better tell you
some regimental news.

975
01:27:26,565 --> 01:27:27,566
Who is here?

976
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:31,904
Princess Elisabeth Federovna
Tverskaya, Your Excellency.

977
01:27:32,738 --> 01:27:34,240
I don't want to see him.

978
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:37,451
But surely your husband
wouldn't stop...

979
01:27:38,452 --> 01:27:39,787
I'm so glad to see you.

980
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:40,996
You look feverish.

981
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,124
We've been talking too much,
so I'm going.

982
01:27:43,207 --> 01:27:45,126
Princess Betsy
came to tell me...

983
01:27:46,252 --> 01:27:48,212
I don't want to hide
anything from you.

984
01:27:48,504 --> 01:27:51,799
Count Vronsky asked to come to say goodbye.
He's going away.

985
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:57,429
I've told him
that I can't receive him.

986
01:28:00,266 --> 01:28:01,892
Well, goodbye, my treasure.

987
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,625
I agree with you.

988
01:28:26,709 --> 01:28:29,211
As he is going away, there's no
need for Count Vronsky to come.

989
01:28:29,295 --> 01:28:31,255
I just said so, so there's
no need to repeat it.

990
01:28:31,338 --> 01:28:32,673
But it is for you to decide.

991
01:28:32,756 --> 01:28:34,967
Yes, and I decided.

992
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:36,131
Then I am very glad that...

993
01:28:36,135 --> 01:28:38,971
That we agree, so perhaps we
can stop talking about it.

994
01:28:39,054 --> 01:28:41,974
Of course.
Is there anything I can do for you?

995
01:28:42,057 --> 01:28:46,729
Yes, can you please, please, please
stop cracking your knuckles?

996
01:28:52,318 --> 01:28:53,944
I'm a bad woman.

997
01:28:57,198 --> 01:28:58,949
But I can't breathe.

998
01:29:00,701 --> 01:29:03,162
Your kindness, which I can't
repay, and your forgiveness...

999
01:29:03,245 --> 01:29:06,123
You begged me
for my forgiveness.

1000
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:07,791
But I didn't die, and now
I have to live with it.

1001
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:10,711
Then what? What do you want?

1002
01:29:10,794 --> 01:29:14,089
Do you know what you want?
Do you want to see Count Vronsky?

1003
01:29:14,173 --> 01:29:16,300
Not to say goodbye.

1004
01:29:19,845 --> 01:29:21,263
I can't hear.

1005
01:29:22,223 --> 01:29:23,974
Not to say goodbye.

1006
01:29:26,769 --> 01:29:30,814
You would be lost.
Irretrievably lost.

1007
01:29:31,523 --> 01:29:33,484
You would have no position.

1008
01:29:33,567 --> 01:29:37,029
And worse, if we divorce,
you would be the guilty party.

1009
01:29:37,112 --> 01:29:39,698
That means you cannot
legally remarry.

1010
01:29:39,782 --> 01:29:43,202
Your union with Count Vronsky
would be illegitimate,

1011
01:29:43,285 --> 01:29:45,871
as would your daughter, who now
has the protection of my name.

1012
01:29:45,955 --> 01:29:47,957
And this is what you want?

1013
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:53,337
It would be a sin
to help you destroy yourself.

1014
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:55,214
You forget something.

1015
01:29:56,590 --> 01:30:00,302
Count Vronsky and I
love each other.

1016
01:30:01,595 --> 01:30:05,641
And this love sanctifies
a criminal folly?

1017
01:30:05,724 --> 01:30:07,559
All I know
is that I sent him away

1018
01:30:07,643 --> 01:30:10,145
and it's as if I'd shot
myself through the heart!

1019
01:30:14,191 --> 01:30:15,609
I see.

1020
01:30:19,822 --> 01:30:21,573
And what of Serozha?

1021
01:30:23,993 --> 01:30:25,869
I would die for him,

1022
01:30:26,996 --> 01:30:29,415
but I won't live
like this for him.

1023
01:30:31,208 --> 01:30:34,003
When he knows of love,
he will forgive me.

1024
01:30:38,048 --> 01:30:40,509
Then I must choose
the smaller sin.

1025
01:30:41,385 --> 01:30:45,180
Vronsky has robbed me of my cloak
and I will give him my coat.

1026
01:30:45,431 --> 01:30:46,682
No, I...

1027
01:31:14,585 --> 01:31:16,795
My darling. My darling.

1028
01:31:19,631 --> 01:31:20,716
You look so pale.

1029
01:31:20,799 --> 01:31:22,343
My darling.

1030
01:31:23,927 --> 01:31:26,764
We'll go south
to the sea air and sunshine.

1031
01:32:32,121 --> 01:32:35,165
Is it all right?
Sit down a minute.

1032
01:32:36,291 --> 01:32:38,293
I want to see everything.

1033
01:32:41,922 --> 01:32:43,215
A moment.

1034
01:32:46,009 --> 01:32:48,262
And now I'm doing
kitchenmaid's work

1035
01:32:48,345 --> 01:32:51,223
because Nadya's parents won't
let her set foot in the house.

1036
01:32:51,306 --> 01:32:53,892
And who can blame them?
It's indecent.

1037
01:33:32,848 --> 01:33:34,558
It's Konstantin.

1038
01:33:36,226 --> 01:33:37,561
Yes, good.

1039
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:40,564
The doctor here is useless.

1040
01:33:41,482 --> 01:33:43,400
Get me one from Moscow.

1041
01:33:44,902 --> 01:33:46,570
Where did you go?

1042
01:33:48,238 --> 01:33:51,658
I asked for you everywhere
when I was getting married.

1043
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:02,169
I'm sorry.
I couldn't leave him.

1044
01:34:02,586 --> 01:34:05,130
Yes. My wife...

1045
01:34:07,049 --> 01:34:08,759
You can't stay now.

1046
01:34:12,930 --> 01:34:15,098
I will nurse him with Agafia.

1047
01:34:16,058 --> 01:34:18,018
The woman will find
somewhere in the village.

1048
01:34:18,101 --> 01:34:19,811
You won't see her.

1049
01:34:20,604 --> 01:34:23,232
She knows it is impossible
to meet you.

1050
01:34:24,525 --> 01:34:26,902
It is a torment to me that I've
brought you under the same roof

1051
01:34:26,985 --> 01:34:30,072
as this unfortunate...
As this fallen...

1052
01:34:30,739 --> 01:34:33,450
And in your precious,
delicate condition.

1053
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:36,537
Kostya.

1054
01:34:39,623 --> 01:34:42,251
Good. A clean nightshirt
and sheets.

1055
01:34:42,334 --> 01:34:45,003
A towel and a clean
pail of warm water.

1056
01:34:45,671 --> 01:34:46,713
Wait.

1057
01:34:51,969 --> 01:34:53,129
And bring the perfume bottle,

1058
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:56,265
in the outside pocket
of my handbag.

1059
01:36:13,508 --> 01:36:17,554
Twenty-one to Stremov, four to Karenin.
The motion is carried.

1060
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:39,076
Alexei, they're back.

1061
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:41,912
Here, in St. Petersburg.

1062
01:36:42,537 --> 01:36:44,122
She has written to me.

1063
01:36:44,998 --> 01:36:46,083
To you?

1064
01:36:57,427 --> 01:37:00,347
They think I don't have
the right to refuse.

1065
01:37:01,098 --> 01:37:02,265
It's the boy's birthday.

1066
01:37:02,933 --> 01:37:04,351
My friend,

1067
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:10,399
you would be blowing on the embers of
a fire which must be allowed to die.

1068
01:37:12,943 --> 01:37:14,444
Let me write to her.

1069
01:37:59,614 --> 01:38:01,575
I'm here to see Serozha.

1070
01:38:03,827 --> 01:38:04,995
Madame?

1071
01:38:09,291 --> 01:38:11,710
I beg your pardon,
Your Excellency.

1072
01:38:16,298 --> 01:38:18,425
No, I've come to see Serozha.

1073
01:38:37,027 --> 01:38:38,737
Serozha.

1074
01:38:39,070 --> 01:38:40,238
Maman?

1075
01:38:42,032 --> 01:38:43,366
My dear little boy.

1076
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:45,327
I knew you would come.

1077
01:38:46,036 --> 01:38:47,287
Today is my birthday.

1078
01:38:47,370 --> 01:38:48,872
I know.

1079
01:38:49,539 --> 01:38:51,291
Are you crying?

1080
01:38:51,374 --> 01:38:52,542
No, I won't cry.

1081
01:38:53,335 --> 01:38:54,628
Where did you go, Maman?

1082
01:38:54,711 --> 01:38:56,463
I don't know.

1083
01:38:56,671 --> 01:38:58,590
Everywhere. The south.

1084
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:02,219
I thought about you every day.

1085
01:39:03,053 --> 01:39:05,889
And I thought
about you every day.

1086
01:39:08,350 --> 01:39:10,977
And you must love Papa.
He's better than I am.

1087
01:39:11,061 --> 01:39:14,022
No one in the whole world
is better than you.

1088
01:39:32,207 --> 01:39:33,250
No.

1089
01:40:08,285 --> 01:40:09,536
Where's Anya?

1090
01:40:09,619 --> 01:40:11,371
She's still asleep.

1091
01:40:12,956 --> 01:40:14,916
Should I take your coat?

1092
01:40:18,211 --> 01:40:20,130
Are you feeling unwell, madam?

1093
01:40:20,213 --> 01:40:21,840
I'm not sleeping.

1094
01:40:22,507 --> 01:40:24,634
I can send out for something.

1095
01:40:25,385 --> 01:40:26,469
Yes.

1096
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:50,660
Why are you in the dark?

1097
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:53,955
Yashvin is going to call.
You remember him.

1098
01:40:54,331 --> 01:40:55,373
Are you going out?

1099
01:40:55,957 --> 01:40:57,250
To where?

1100
01:40:58,460 --> 01:40:59,669
To whom?

1101
01:41:00,003 --> 01:41:01,671
What's the matter?

1102
01:41:02,672 --> 01:41:04,049
I didn't know
what happened to you.

1103
01:41:04,132 --> 01:41:05,592
But I told you
yesterday. My brother.

1104
01:41:05,675 --> 01:41:08,511
Does it take all day
to meet your brother?

1105
01:41:08,762 --> 01:41:10,847
Does he need you
more than I do?

1106
01:41:11,264 --> 01:41:12,724
What's happened?

1107
01:41:16,937 --> 01:41:19,105
Well, Alexander agreed
to everything.

1108
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:20,899
Mother's house in Moscow
will go to him,

1109
01:41:20,982 --> 01:41:23,902
and the country estate
will be our new home.

1110
01:41:26,696 --> 01:41:28,615
As soon as the divorce.

1111
01:41:30,075 --> 01:41:32,786
Karenin hasn't answered
your letter yet?

1112
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:39,960
You're the very first person to
call on me since our return.

1113
01:41:40,043 --> 01:41:42,295
I received a note
from Princess Betsy

1114
01:41:42,379 --> 01:41:45,298
asking me to call on her
between 6:30 and 8:00.

1115
01:41:45,382 --> 01:41:47,050
Or was it 7:00?

1116
01:41:47,384 --> 01:41:49,928
But perhaps you'll meet
at the opera tonight.

1117
01:41:50,011 --> 01:41:51,972
I would love to be there
if I could get a box.

1118
01:41:52,222 --> 01:41:53,848
Madame, your box
is number four.

1119
01:41:54,391 --> 01:41:56,893
You'll find me there
with Princess Myagkaya.

1120
01:41:57,894 --> 01:41:59,062
Will you come, Vronsky?

1121
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:06,194
Well... I see why Alexei
is so fond of you.

1122
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:15,286
You know you can't
go to the theater.

1123
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:17,122
Annushka! For heaven's sake.

1124
01:42:17,205 --> 01:42:18,540
A bath! I'll come in
and choose a dress.

1125
01:42:18,623 --> 01:42:19,708
Anna, I implore you.

1126
01:42:19,791 --> 01:42:22,168
I'm not ashamed of who I am
or what I've done.

1127
01:42:22,252 --> 01:42:24,004
Are you ashamed for me?

1128
01:42:24,170 --> 01:42:26,798
Why don't you book
a room at the hotel?

1129
01:42:26,881 --> 01:42:28,591
Aren't we together?

1130
01:42:29,384 --> 01:42:30,505
Have you changed towards me?

1131
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:32,012
It's because I love you
and care about you.

1132
01:42:32,095 --> 01:42:33,888
If that's the case, then I don't
know why you aren't coming with me.

1133
01:42:33,972 --> 01:42:34,973
That would make it worse.

1134
01:42:35,056 --> 01:42:36,558
You're afraid.

1135
01:42:36,975 --> 01:42:38,476
Well, I'm not.

1136
01:43:17,307 --> 01:43:19,476
Should we visit, or stay put?

1137
01:43:20,101 --> 01:43:21,352
Stay put.

1138
01:43:23,938 --> 01:43:26,399
Minister! Congratulations.

1139
01:43:27,067 --> 01:43:28,860
Come in for a moment.

1140
01:43:48,463 --> 01:43:50,715
Princess
Sorokina and her daughter.

1141
01:43:50,799 --> 01:43:54,135
They're from Moscow, neighbors
of Count Vronsky's mother.

1142
01:43:54,344 --> 01:43:57,722
Quite well off. No sons.
She's a widow.

1143
01:44:00,058 --> 01:44:02,060
My dear, I'm a sales catalog.

1144
01:44:10,401 --> 01:44:11,611
Alexei.

1145
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:16,741
You'll come up
to see us afterwards?

1146
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:18,952
I'll talk to Varya.

1147
01:44:23,081 --> 01:44:24,415
Will you call on Anna?

1148
01:44:24,541 --> 01:44:28,002
Alexei. I'm fond of...

1149
01:44:28,086 --> 01:44:29,129
For God's sake!

1150
01:44:31,548 --> 01:44:32,590
Anna isn't a criminal.

1151
01:44:32,674 --> 01:44:35,593
I'd call on her if she'd
only broken the law.

1152
01:44:36,344 --> 01:44:38,304
But she broke the rules.

1153
01:44:53,653 --> 01:44:56,906
Who has made the décor?
Haven't we got a program?

1154
01:44:57,198 --> 01:44:58,741
Colonel, would you be so kind?

1155
01:44:58,825 --> 01:44:59,868
Of course.

1156
01:44:59,951 --> 01:45:03,538
Please, I would be honored
if you would take mine.

1157
01:45:03,746 --> 01:45:05,582
Thank you. How very...

1158
01:45:08,251 --> 01:45:09,294
It's a disgrace.

1159
01:45:09,377 --> 01:45:10,753
Hush, dean A common courtesy.

1160
01:45:15,633 --> 01:45:17,343
Everyone's looking.

1161
01:45:17,427 --> 01:45:20,263
Let them look! Fetch my cloak.

1162
01:45:21,055 --> 01:45:22,932
What are we coming to?

1163
01:45:23,224 --> 01:45:26,060
It's an insult to decency.
Take me home.

1164
01:45:26,144 --> 01:45:29,606
Hush. I beg you, my dear.
It was only a word or two.

1165
01:45:29,814 --> 01:45:31,232
I have a word or two
for some people

1166
01:45:31,316 --> 01:45:33,157
one didn't expect
to be rubbing shoulders with.

1167
01:45:34,277 --> 01:45:37,822
She has a nerve, flaunting
herself like a slut in society.

1168
01:45:42,118 --> 01:45:43,494
Yes, why don't you?

1169
01:45:43,578 --> 01:45:45,914
Rescue her and put your
seal on the fiasco.

1170
01:46:01,512 --> 01:46:02,847
Alexei

1171
01:46:03,348 --> 01:46:05,308
you see why she must divorce.

1172
01:46:06,267 --> 01:46:09,604
Marriage will solve everything.
When will it be?

1173
01:46:09,687 --> 01:46:11,731
As far as I'm concerned,
she's my wife.

1174
01:46:11,814 --> 01:46:13,816
As you saw, she isn't.

1175
01:46:16,069 --> 01:46:18,230
We're going to Moscow, then
to my place in the country.

1176
01:46:18,321 --> 01:46:19,822
That sounds like a good idea.

1177
01:46:19,989 --> 01:46:21,709
But, for a day or two,
Anna will be at home.

1178
01:46:23,993 --> 01:46:25,036
Then“.

1179
01:46:26,913 --> 01:46:28,706
I'll say goodbye now.

1180
01:46:48,518 --> 01:46:50,853
Well, you had
an excellent night.

1181
01:46:52,897 --> 01:46:55,483
Does your mother want you to
marry the widow or the child?

1182
01:46:56,359 --> 01:46:58,528
Either one. Don't joke about it.

1183
01:46:58,611 --> 01:47:02,407
If you loved me, you would have
looked me in to stop me going!

1184
01:47:18,339 --> 01:47:20,133
Yes, it was my fault.

1185
01:47:33,604 --> 01:47:35,106
I won't sleep.

1186
01:47:39,068 --> 01:47:41,195
I know how to make you sleep.

1187
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,253
Anna, I am very glad
to see you.

1188
01:48:39,629 --> 01:48:41,964
Are you well?
How is your little one?

1189
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:46,886
Stiva wanted to invite you and
Count Vronsky to the house,

1190
01:48:46,969 --> 01:48:48,554
but it's impossible.

1191
01:48:48,638 --> 01:48:50,139
No, I understand.

1192
01:48:50,223 --> 01:48:52,141
No. No, you don't.

1193
01:48:53,017 --> 01:48:55,144
Kitty and her husband
are with us.

1194
01:48:55,228 --> 01:48:57,105
She's in Moscow
to have the baby.

1195
01:48:57,188 --> 01:49:00,483
Kitty! Tell her
how pleased I am.

1196
01:49:01,192 --> 01:49:03,486
Perhaps I'll wait
a year or two.

1197
01:49:05,446 --> 01:49:06,489
Love.

1198
01:49:08,366 --> 01:49:09,700
Yes, love.

1199
01:49:14,956 --> 01:49:17,166
Don't you disapprove of me
for what I've done?

1200
01:49:17,708 --> 01:49:20,837
No. I wish I'd done the same.

1201
01:49:21,337 --> 01:49:23,089
But no one asked me.

1202
01:49:24,424 --> 01:49:27,927
Well, I wouldn't have been
brave enough.

1203
01:49:29,429 --> 01:49:31,264
Stiva, you know,

1204
01:49:31,889 --> 01:49:33,558
he doesn't change.

1205
01:49:34,684 --> 01:49:36,644
Like all men, I suppose.

1206
01:50:38,164 --> 01:50:39,749
I had an inspiration.

1207
01:50:39,916 --> 01:50:41,125
Why do we have to wait here?

1208
01:50:41,209 --> 01:50:43,002
Why can't we wait
in the country?

1209
01:50:43,085 --> 01:50:45,338
I don't want to hear any more about
a divorce or think about it.

1210
01:50:45,421 --> 01:50:47,048
Good, I'm bored here.
When should we go?

1211
01:50:47,507 --> 01:50:49,427
If I bore you here,
I'll bore you in the country.

1212
01:50:49,592 --> 01:50:52,392
I didn't say you bore me, Moscow bores me.
When should we go? Tomorrow?

1213
01:50:52,512 --> 01:50:53,846
I can't be ready by tomorrow.

1214
01:50:53,930 --> 01:50:55,097
The day after, then.
If you like.

1215
01:50:55,181 --> 01:50:58,100
No, wait, that's Sunday.
I have to see Maman.

1216
01:50:58,434 --> 01:50:59,834
That's 20 minutes away
on the train.

1217
01:51:00,269 --> 01:51:02,104
You could go
to see her tomorrow.

1218
01:51:03,356 --> 01:51:06,108
Or was it that you wanted to spend
Sunday with Princess Sorokina?

1219
01:51:06,359 --> 01:51:08,611
Please. Don't spoil everything.

1220
01:51:09,111 --> 01:51:12,352
I can't see Maman tomorrow because she won't
have read the papers she has to sign.

1221
01:51:12,657 --> 01:51:14,283
In that case, let's not bother.

1222
01:51:14,408 --> 01:51:16,368
I'll leave on Sunday or not at all.
That's absurd.

1223
01:51:16,369 --> 01:51:19,121
It's absurd to you because you have
no understanding of my life here.

1224
01:51:19,664 --> 01:51:22,041
Anna.
No, you've stopped loving me.

1225
01:51:22,792 --> 01:51:25,419
You've given up everything for me
and it's turned you against me.

1226
01:51:25,545 --> 01:51:27,296
Why lie about it? Stop!

1227
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:30,300
I put off our departure for a day or
two and you tell me I don't love you.

1228
01:51:30,341 --> 01:51:32,218
Because I've been living off
your love and there's none left.

1229
01:51:32,301 --> 01:51:33,386
So this is over. Finished.

1230
01:51:47,483 --> 01:51:48,818
I'm sorry.

1231
01:51:58,869 --> 01:52:00,204
I don't mind when we go.

1232
01:52:00,288 --> 01:52:02,498
I'll telegraph Maman.
We'll go on Sunday.

1233
01:52:02,832 --> 01:52:04,458
I'll do anything you want.

1234
01:52:04,584 --> 01:52:07,670
You should leave me.
I don't want to. I love you.

1235
01:52:08,379 --> 01:52:09,463
Why?

1236
01:52:10,673 --> 01:52:13,676
You can't ask "why" about love.

1237
01:52:39,744 --> 01:52:41,871
So, will you be all packed?

1238
01:52:42,538 --> 01:52:44,624
I'll be out today
making the arrangements.

1239
01:52:44,707 --> 01:52:46,500
Is that your way of telling
me you'll be at your mother's

1240
01:52:46,584 --> 01:52:47,984
with that simpering
little princess?

1241
01:52:48,002 --> 01:52:50,838
No. I'll be at my lawyer's,
waiting for some documents.

1242
01:52:50,921 --> 01:52:52,798
Then I'm having dinner to say
goodbye to old comrades.

1243
01:52:52,882 --> 01:52:53,924
I know what that means.

1244
01:52:54,008 --> 01:52:56,510
My God, this is unendurable!

1245
01:52:58,387 --> 01:52:59,639
I can invite them here,
if you like.

1246
01:52:59,722 --> 01:53:02,516
Thank you, but if I'm not fit to dine
in society, I won't eat with the band.

1247
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:06,228
Who was the telegram from?

1248
01:53:06,646 --> 01:53:09,357
I didn't show you because Stiva keeps
telegraphing what we already know.

1249
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:11,067
Karenin promises nothing,
but will consider...

1250
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:14,236
I told you I don't care about the
divorce, so why hide the telegram?

1251
01:53:24,997 --> 01:53:27,708
Is there anything
you wish to say to me?

1252
01:54:02,326 --> 01:54:03,994
So it's the child.

1253
01:54:04,787 --> 01:54:06,288
She brought papers from Maman.

1254
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:12,545
Anna.

1255
01:54:32,648 --> 01:54:33,649
No.

1256
01:58:07,655 --> 01:58:09,031
God.

1257
01:58:09,198 --> 01:58:11,200
Forgive me.

1258
01:58:48,153 --> 01:58:51,031
I'll be buying in feed
before winter's over.

1259
01:58:51,115 --> 01:58:54,660
Well, you don't press people
hard, but you live rightly.

1260
01:58:55,494 --> 01:58:58,038
For your soul not your belly.

1261
01:59:00,916 --> 01:59:02,668
How do we know what's rightly?

1262
01:59:03,002 --> 01:59:05,337
Just by knowing it. How else?

1263
01:59:06,130 --> 01:59:09,383
But I believe in reason.

1264
01:59:09,842 --> 01:59:13,137
Reason. Was it reason that
made you choose your wife?

1265
01:59:40,330 --> 01:59:42,249
I came looking for you.

1266
01:59:44,626 --> 01:59:46,295
I understood something.

1267
01:59:46,628 --> 01:59:48,589
What did you understand?

1268
02:00:01,852 --> 02:00:03,479
He smiled at me.

1269
02:00:03,645 --> 02:00:05,856
He's very advanced for his age.

1270
02:00:08,817 --> 02:00:10,819
What did you understand?

1271
02:00:28,087 --> 02:00:29,963
I'm so proud of you.

1272
02:00:30,047 --> 02:00:31,715
Night-night.

1273
02:00:46,313 --> 02:00:47,356
And you, too.

1274
02:00:47,439 --> 02:00:49,983
Good night, my darling boy.

1275
02:01:10,546 --> 02:01:12,047
Anya!

1276
02:01:13,423 --> 02:01:14,758
Anya!

1277
02:01:17,052 --> 02:01:18,428
Anya!
