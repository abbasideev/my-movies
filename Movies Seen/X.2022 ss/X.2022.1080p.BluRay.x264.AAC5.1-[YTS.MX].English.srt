00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,919
<i>We come together today...</i>

2
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:57,927
<i>In dark times such as these,</i>

3
00:01:57,961 --> 00:02:00,830
<i>we must all remember</i>

4
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:04,800
<i>to look
to the Lord for guidance.</i>

5
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,636
<i>Submit yourselves, then, to God.</i>

6
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,737
<i>Amen.</i>

7
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:10,471
<i>Resist the Devil...</i>

8
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,841
<i>...and he will flee from you.</i>

9
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,276
<i>I regret to say</i>

10
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:19,312
<i>I know the powers
of Satan firsthand.</i>

11
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:21,314
<i>Our very own daughter was taken</i>

12
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:22,917
<i>by perverts and swindlers</i>

13
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,419
<i>and let fall
into a world of sin.</i>

14
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:26,554
Sheriff?

15
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:28,890
<i>I hope...</i>

16
00:02:28,923 --> 00:02:30,824
You ought to come take
a look at this.

17
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:06,624
My God.

18
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:48,462
Go easy on that stuff, will ya?

19
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:51,298
You know what they say

20
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,612
about too much
of a good thing...

21
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:58,973

00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,752

00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,461
Now giddyup.

25
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:24,495
Time is money.
Everybody is waiting.

26
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:37,009

00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:19,603
Wow.

53
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:21,805
Hollywood, here we come.

54
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,874
No, ma'am.
We don't need Hollywood.

55
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:26,677
These type of pictures
turn regular folks into stars.

56

We're gonna do it all ourselves.

57

- Ain't that right, RJ?
- Yes, sir.

58
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:32,616
Finally,
a level playing field for people like us.

59
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,750
I don't know, Wayne.

60
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:35,551
Sounds an awful lot
like what you said

61
00:06:35,585 --> 00:06:37,053
about <i>The Topless Carwash.</i>

62
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:37,921
You remember that?

63
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:40,455
Yeah.
And had the IRS not had

64
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:41,834
a goddamn personal vendetta
against me,

65
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:43,492
that would've panned out
beautifully.

66
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:44,560
Uh-huh.

67
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:46,930
Well, you know I'm always game.

68
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:48,462
My American Dream
is not unreasonable.

69
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:51,033
I just want a paid-for house
with a big ole pool,

70
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,810
so I can float around
with my knees in the breeze

71
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,703
and tan these titties.

72
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:58,907
What? I was dealt a good hand.

73
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:01,508
People spend a lot of money
to look at what God gave me.

74
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:03,077
Be a sin
not to take care of 'em.

75
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,178
Mmm.

76
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,481
Yes, it sure would.

77
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:11,484
What about you, Maxine?

78
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:12,920
What's your American Dream?

79
00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:14,922
Hmm.

80
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:51,521
Hurry it up, we aren't
gonna be long in there.

81
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:58,962
If this kid I picked up
from the university

82
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:00,797
can put it together
like he says,

83
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:03,033
our days of struggling
may soon be over.

84
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,168
We do even half the numbers
of <i>Debbie Does Dallas,</i>

85
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:06,670
I'm outta the red for good.

86
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,839
Hell, let's make
a picture a week, then.

87
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:10,073
Patience, darlin'.

88
00:08:10,107 --> 00:08:13,242
I've been being patient
my whole life.

89
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:15,144
Well, that's the thing
about being patient.

90
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:18,948
- I need to be famous, Wayne.
- Mmm-hmm.

91
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,716
I'm ready for the high life.

92
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,594
I'm sick and tired of
never gettin' what I want.

93
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:25,321
Well, you help me keep those
jokers in line out there,

94
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:27,264
I'll make sure you get
everything your heart desires.

95
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:28,923
You better have.

96
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:30,558
I don't wanna worry
no more, Wayne.

97
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:33,762
I deserve nice things.
I have cosmopolitan taste.

98
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:35,930
- Don't I know it.
- I mean it.

99
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:38,233
I want the whole world
to know my name.

100
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:40,568
Like Lynda Carter or some shit.

101
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:41,735
Hey, everyone with a pulse

102
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:43,937
is gonna lust
after a piece of Maxine Minx

103
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:45,305
once they see what you can do.

104
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:46,774
You know why?

105
00:08:48,609 --> 00:08:50,077
Why?

106
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,012
'Cause you got that X factor.

107
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:55,149
Fuckin'-A-right.

108
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:56,616
Now, mosey on over there

109
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:58,651
and grab us some Wonder
Bread, Wonder Woman.

110
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:03,923
I don't like his girlfriend.

111
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:05,958
You don't like
anybody's girlfriend.

112
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:08,828
She hardly says a word.
She just stares at everyone.

113
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:10,295
Well, she's shy.

114
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:12,798
Probably ain't never seen
nobody like us before.

115
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:14,966
People who stare
give me the heebie-jeebies.

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,034
Better get used to that

117
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:17,602
if you're gonna be
in the movies.

118
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:28,913
Your little boyfriend is cute.

119
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:31,949
You help him with all his films?

120
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:36,020
Sometimes, yeah.

121
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:40,723
Is that your boyfriend?

122
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,129
Sometimes, yeah.

123
00:09:48,431 --> 00:09:51,034
Hey, how come you don't gotta
film none of this in order?

124
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:52,378
Well, once I have it all
in the can,

125
00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:53,836
I can rearrange it
however I want.

126
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:55,370
No shit.

127
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:56,905
I actually intend
on experimenting

128
00:09:56,939 --> 00:09:57,873
a lot with the film's editing.

129
00:09:57,906 --> 00:10:00,142
Giving it a certain sense
of the avant-garde,

130
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:01,319
like they're doing in France.

131
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,078
It's classier that way.

132
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:05,180
And it's a good trick
to disguise the low budget.

133
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,187
All right, let's slate it.

134
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:13,688
And hit it.

135
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:23,263
All right,
go ahead and fill her up.

136
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:30,270
You know,

137
00:10:30,303 --> 00:10:32,372
if you tilt the camera up

138
00:10:32,405 --> 00:10:34,407
from the nozzle...

139
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:36,709
...it'll look
like he's using his cock.

140
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:58,963
See? I got good sense, too.

141
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,067
How come we couldn't do

142
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:05,802
any of this filming in Houston?

143
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:06,737
Ain't they got plenty of farms?

144
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,106
Well, this county
raised property taxes,

145
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:11,875
a little bit of cash
goes a long way out here.

146
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:12,986
Most older folks can't compete

147
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,078
with the bigger outfits no more.

148
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:17,247
Now, we're not the only ones
trying to make a buck.

149
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:19,749
<i>Kidnappers, murderers,</i>

150
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:21,083

00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:29,358
I wanna advertise around town.

155
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:30,760
You know how some people can get

156
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:32,128
when it comes to sex.

157
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:33,195

- Yes. God damn.

I'm just askin'.

00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,009
Hey, if I'm gonna be
having sex for you,

164
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,477
I'm gonna need cigarettes.

165
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:53,914
How's the script?

166
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,017
I don't know.
It's all right.

167
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,453
Does it matter?

168
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:02,088
Hey, I don't wanna have
to wear a hard hat

169
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,856

170
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,159
No.

173
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,164
Negativity attracts
negative results.

174
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:19,238
Winstons? You know
I only smoke Old Golds.

175

<i>That's right.</i>

180
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:36,555
<i>The deviants are
already amongst us,</i>

181
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:39,323
<i>waiting for our sons
and daughters.</i>

182
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:41,560
<i>So, heed dire warnings,</i>

183
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:45,061
<i>and repent
before it is too late.</i>

184
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:47,364
<i>He may be a forgiving God,</i>

185
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:51,935
<i>but every man
has got his limits.</i>

186
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:09,218
Must be a bad wreck.

187
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:10,452
<i>Y'all stay safe out there.</i>

188
00:13:10,486 --> 00:13:12,954
<i>I'll be right back
with some more golden oldies</i>

189
00:13:12,987 --> 00:13:14,422
<i>right after
this commercial break.</i>

190
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:16,891
<i>93.5, KBQB.</i>

191
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:21,497
<i>...the 60th anniversary</i>

192
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,132
<i>...take place this Saturday.</i>

193
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:27,301
<i>Don't miss your chance
to tour the entire state...</i>

194
00:13:37,944 --> 00:13:40,247
- What is it?
- Oh, don't look.

195
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,081
I hate blood and guts.

196
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,618
Just when you thought

197
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:46,218
you'd escaped
the slaughterhouse.

198
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,054
Yeah.

199
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:49,488
<i>Now, that's a bonanza...</i>

200
00:13:49,523 --> 00:13:51,924
Was that the...

201
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:15,212
This is it.
Our own studio backlot.

202
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:17,114
Thank goodness.
I'm horny.

203
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,017
- You're always horny.
- No, not always.

204
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,287
It's perfect.

205
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,489
It's really gonna
add a lot of production value.

206
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:05,126
Y'all stay put while I go

207
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,438
and handle business right quick.

208
00:15:37,388 --> 00:15:38,724
This wasn't I had in mind

209
00:15:38,757 --> 00:15:40,458
when I agreed to help out
on your film.

210
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:42,293
Gotta start somewhere, Lorraine.

211
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:44,195
RJ, it's smut.

212
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:47,231
When did you become
such a prude?

213
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,167
I'm not.

214
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,570
I just don't understand
why you're doing all this.

215
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:55,472
Because it is possible
to make a good dirty movie.

216
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,418
Who's that?

217
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:14,957
Yes, sir. It's Wayne Galleroy.
We spoke on the telephone.

218
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,171
Uh...

219
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,006
Howard, right?

220
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,076
You from the county?

221
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,279
This here's private property.

222
00:16:39,313 --> 00:16:42,517
Didn't you see the signs
down at the end of the drive?

223
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,352
Oh, easy, partner.

224
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:54,761
Somethin's wrong.

225
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:57,598
What'chu talkin' 'bout?

226
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,406
You're trespassing.
The law says I can shoot.

227
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,043
Sir, I ain't from the county.

228
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:14,312
I'm from Houston.

229
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:17,181
We spoke on Tuesday.
You remember?

230
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:19,584
About y'all's boarding house.

231
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:23,788
Oh, that's right.

232
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:26,357
You're looking
for a place to stay.

233
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:33,664
Well, you never can be
too careful with strangers.

234
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:38,636
You had me pretty nervous there.

235
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:40,638
It ain't even loaded.

236
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:42,438
Most of the times,

237
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:44,641
just wavin' it around
is all it takes.

238
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:48,076
Oh, yes, sir.

239
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:51,648
I keep the same thing
in my glove box.

240
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:56,351
Wow, that's one ugly sumbitch.

241
00:17:58,854 --> 00:18:00,054
What?

242
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:01,690
He is.

243
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:26,535
Hell of a spread you got here.

244
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:30,906
We like it.

245
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:47,622
You all right there, old-timer?

246
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,324
I'm fine.

247
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:11,878
- She ain't much.
- She's gorgeous.

248
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:20,819
Building was for soldiers
during the Civil War.

249
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,522
They never saw
any action though.

250
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,189
What about you?

251
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:27,526
You serve?

252
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,529
Flat feet.

253
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,965
I did.
Two tours in South Vietnam.

254
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:34,832
Had enough farmers

255
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:37,200
tryin' to shoot me
for one lifetime.

256
00:20:39,036 --> 00:20:40,638
Know what I mean, Pops?

257
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:41,939
Oorah.

258
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:50,647
Oh, careful, Howie.

259
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,515
Hot damn,
that's my future fiancee

260
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:53,550
you're eyeballin' there.

261
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:56,486
Been a while

262
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,253
since you seen
anythin' that nice?

263
00:20:58,287 --> 00:20:59,856
I don't recall you mentioning

264
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:01,891
you'd bringing all these others.

265
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:04,927
Now, about that...

266
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,429
See, your ad said $30, but...

267
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:11,500
I threw in a little extra
to sweeten the deal.

268
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:12,801
I hope that's okay.

269
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:22,577
I don't think I like you, Wayne.

270
00:21:25,046 --> 00:21:26,814
In fact,

271
00:21:26,848 --> 00:21:29,282
I don't much like the looks
of none of y'all.

272
00:21:29,316 --> 00:21:30,985
Now, my wife is next door,

273
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:34,554
so I would appreciate
a little discretion.

274
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:38,692
I give you my word.

275
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:42,562
You won't even know we're here.

276
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,903
That was
some stellar negotiating.

277
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:52,938
You really do have
a knack for business.

278
00:21:52,972 --> 00:21:54,339
You keep jawin', towhead,

279
00:21:54,372 --> 00:21:56,475
I'll pull you off
the main stage for a month.

280
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:57,676
Oh, but then, honey,

281
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,478
you won't make no money neither.

282
00:21:59,512 --> 00:22:00,621
How could you just stand there

283
00:22:00,645 --> 00:22:01,856
and let him talk
about us like that?

284
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,914
Oh, calm down.

285
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,348
Ain't no need
to harsh the mellow.

286
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:05,817
It's harmless.
He's just old.

287
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,351
His pecker ain't
probably been hard

288
00:22:07,384 --> 00:22:08,428
since before you were born.

289
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,320
I'd hate people
like us then, too.

290
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:11,914
He don't know
what we're doing, does he?

291
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,894
So, church mouse, you do speak.

292
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:23,432
No.

293
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,903
He sure doesn't.

294
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:28,472
And I intend
to keep it that way.

295
00:22:28,505 --> 00:22:30,706
Now, I don't wanna give
the old codger a heart attack.

296
00:22:31,607 --> 00:22:33,543
Would you?

297
00:22:33,576 --> 00:22:34,944
It's better to beg
for forgiveness

298
00:22:34,977 --> 00:22:36,378
than ask for permission.

299
00:22:36,411 --> 00:22:37,680
You know what I mean?

300
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:41,316
All right.

301
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,653
That's enough jabberin'.

302
00:22:44,686 --> 00:22:47,122
I reckon it's about high time
we cut to the chase

303
00:22:47,155 --> 00:22:49,024
and we give the people
what they wanna see.

304
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:50,859
What do you say?

305
00:22:51,893 --> 00:22:53,061
Fucking finally!

306
00:23:18,918 --> 00:23:20,887
Okay. Now...
Now flip her over.

307
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:22,822
Ooh!

308
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,866
Oh, yeah.
Fuck me.

309
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:35,534
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

310
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:36,602
That's great.

311
00:23:36,635 --> 00:23:38,470
Just scooch your chin up for me.

312
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:41,438
All right, now slow it all down.

313
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:43,808
- I wanna see the passion.
- Hey, kid.

314
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:46,077
How about you just
point the camera

315
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,478
and stay in your lane.

316
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:48,980
Let me do the screwing here.

317
00:23:56,653 --> 00:23:57,654
Yeah!

318
00:23:58,755 --> 00:23:59,756
Yes!

319
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,673
Oh, my God.

320
00:26:22,255 --> 00:26:24,324
<i>Now,
I may not know shit from Shinola</i>

321
00:26:24,357 --> 00:26:25,191
when it comes to filmmaking,

322
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:27,060
but I know for damn sure
people are gonna

323
00:26:27,093 --> 00:26:28,728
wanna see
what I just saw in there.

324
00:26:28,762 --> 00:26:29,805
Well, that's
'cause I'm not treatin' it

325
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:32,031
like pornography, but as cinema.

326
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:35,000
That's what these other
adult films are lackin'.

327
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:38,137
Whatever you're doin',
you keep doin' it.

328
00:26:39,705 --> 00:26:41,006
People's eyes are gonna pop out

329
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,075
of their damn skulls
when they see this.

330
00:26:43,108 --> 00:26:44,276
We're gonna be rich.

331
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:46,010
Feel how hard my cock is.

332
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:05,328
Oh, sorry, baby.

333
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,601
Don't be standing there

334
00:27:11,635 --> 00:27:13,336
like you're all proud
of yourself.

335
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,638
I was born
for this line of work.

336
00:27:15,671 --> 00:27:19,308
Uh. You didn't
do nothin', dummy.

337
00:27:20,076 --> 00:27:22,678
It's called actin'.

338
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:25,614
You good,
but you ain't that good.

339
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:35,190
Fuck my pussy.

340
00:27:35,223 --> 00:27:37,258
Oh, you make me so wet.

341
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:39,794
Oh, my God, you're so big.

342
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:46,767
Aw, don't look so glum.

343
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,002
You did just fine. Come here.

344
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,341
I think I love you.

345
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:57,009
Bless your heart.

346
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:36,936
<i>And action!</i>

347
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,044
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,

348
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:48,314
but my van broke down
on the highway back yonder,

349
00:29:48,347 --> 00:29:49,281
and I was hopin'

350
00:29:49,315 --> 00:29:51,149
I could use y'all's phone
to call for help.

351
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:55,286
Oh, my goodness.

352
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,389
I'm afraid we don't own
a telephone,

353
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,124
but my daddy will be home soon,

354
00:30:00,158 --> 00:30:03,161
and I'm sure he could give you
a lift to town.

355
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:05,762
Would you like to come inside?

356
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:10,801
Much obliged.

357
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,521
Hello?

358
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:19,887
Hello?

359
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:51,183
Lemonade?

360
00:33:06,264 --> 00:33:08,967
Sure is hot out there.

361
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:12,002
You must be awful thirsty.

362
00:33:12,035 --> 00:33:14,304
Yes, ma'am.

363
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:25,047
It's got a good taste.

364
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:12,560
I should probably get back now.

365
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,463
My boyfriend gets real fussy

366
00:34:15,496 --> 00:34:17,163
when he don't know
where I'm at, so...

367
00:34:30,543 --> 00:34:34,414
Come with me
before Daddy gets home.

368
00:34:54,632 --> 00:34:57,067
I was young once, too.

369
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,173
It was taken
right before the first war.

370
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,713
Believe it or not,
my Howard served in both.

371
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:14,250
He survived the trenches
and Omaha Beach.

372
00:35:15,251 --> 00:35:16,453
There wasn't anything

373
00:35:16,486 --> 00:35:18,320
he wouldn't do for me back then.

374
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:28,797
That's the power of beauty.

375
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:33,034
I was a dancer
in those early years.

376
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:37,237
But then the war came, so...

377
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:40,408
Not everything in life
turns out how you expect.

378
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:51,350
Such a special face.

379
00:35:57,123 --> 00:35:58,291
Beautiful.

380
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:01,761
Look.

381
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,712
I don't know
what's come over me.

382
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,314
I've never quite
felt like this before.

383
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,151
If Daddy catches us,

384
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,754
<i>there's no telling
what he might do.</i>

385
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,859
What are you doing?

386
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:47,235
You should go.

387
00:36:49,204 --> 00:36:50,707
It will be our secret.

388
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:52,842
What will?

389
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:54,844
Shh.

390
00:37:32,712 --> 00:37:33,713
Watch out!

391
00:37:35,448 --> 00:37:36,859
I've been looking
everywhere for you!

392
00:37:36,883 --> 00:37:37,951
Sorry.

393
00:37:37,984 --> 00:37:40,285
The kid says
we're gonna lose the light!

394
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:41,720
Well, come on now, chop-chop.

395
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,501
<i>You're not good.
Bluff it.</i>

396
00:37:58,603 --> 00:38:00,303
<i>You're a fucking sex symbol.</i>

397
00:38:06,544 --> 00:38:10,312
I will not accept a life
I do not deserve.

398
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:50,317
Are you ready?

399
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:58,559
Let's go to work.

400
00:39:22,581 --> 00:39:24,416
Coast is clear.

401
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:25,851
- Right...
- Sound speed.

402
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:27,986
Okay, we're rollin'.

403
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:29,855
<i>Farmer's Daughter,</i> take one.

404
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:36,994
Action.

405
00:39:40,965 --> 00:39:42,933
I'm looking
for the owner of this farm.

406
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:45,603
His daughter said I could
find him in here.

407
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:48,338
You must have been
talking to my sister.

408
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:49,473
Sister?

409
00:39:49,507 --> 00:39:52,809
- She didn't mention you.
- Not surprised.

410
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:56,412
She's always been jealous.

411
00:39:56,446 --> 00:39:59,649
I'm younger,
get all the attention.

412
00:40:01,618 --> 00:40:04,020
Daddy never lets her
leave the farm anymore.

413
00:40:05,754 --> 00:40:08,023
He's very protective.

414
00:40:08,056 --> 00:40:09,792
Well, I was hopin'
he could give me a ride

415
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,894
back to town before it got dark.

416
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,801
We shouldn't disturb him.

417
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:22,537
It would only make him angry.

418
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:26,306
You wouldn't like Daddy
when he's angry.

419
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:33,013
I could give you a ride.

420
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:10,648
We talked about this.

421
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:14,552
Howard?

422
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:16,187
Please.

423
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,662
You know I can't.

424
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:27,297
My heart...

425
00:44:49,018 --> 00:44:53,989
<i>♪ They're gonna put me
in the movies</i>

426
00:44:54,022 --> 00:44:57,592
<i>♪ They're gonna make
a big star out of me</i>

427
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,996
<i>♪ They'll make
a film about a girl</i>

428
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:04,331
<i>♪ Who's sad and lonely</i>

429
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:08,035
<i>♪ And all I gotta do
is act naturally ♪</i>

430
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:10,271
You were amazing out there.

431
00:45:10,304 --> 00:45:12,840
Now I know why Wayne
left his wife for you.

432
00:45:12,873 --> 00:45:15,076
So do I.

433
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:16,077
Careful.

434
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:18,678
Told y'all
she was somethin' special.

435
00:45:18,711 --> 00:45:19,879
X factor.

436
00:45:21,815 --> 00:45:22,816
Thanks, baby.

437
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:35,961
What are you looking at?

438
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:37,329
Wait, come on now.

439
00:45:37,363 --> 00:45:38,964
No, Wayne.

440
00:45:38,997 --> 00:45:40,933
Anybody ever teach you
not to stare?

441
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:42,634
It's rude.

442
00:45:43,836 --> 00:45:45,737
You got somethin' to say to me
or what?

443
00:45:45,771 --> 00:45:46,771
No.

444
00:45:50,007 --> 00:45:52,276
Well, I do have a question.

445
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:54,379
See, she's interested, is all.

446
00:45:54,413 --> 00:45:56,214
What's on your mind,
church mouse?

447
00:45:56,247 --> 00:45:58,116
Isn't it strange

448
00:45:58,149 --> 00:46:00,151
watching her doin' it with him?

449
00:46:00,184 --> 00:46:02,319
It's just business.

450
00:46:02,352 --> 00:46:04,721
As long as the camera
is runnin'.

451
00:46:04,754 --> 00:46:06,656
So the camera changes things?

452
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:07,757
That's right.

453
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:08,959
It's not real life, Raine.

454
00:46:08,992 --> 00:46:10,361
It's just a movie.

455
00:46:11,328 --> 00:46:12,363
I know that.

456
00:46:14,965 --> 00:46:16,031
Just sayin'.

457
00:46:16,966 --> 00:46:18,134
What about love?

458
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:19,436
What about love?

459
00:46:19,469 --> 00:46:20,836
Well, don't y'all believe in it?

460
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:22,405
Of course we believe in love.

461
00:46:22,439 --> 00:46:23,739
How can you love someone

462
00:46:23,772 --> 00:46:25,141
and still be with other people?

463
00:46:25,174 --> 00:46:26,008
You think we don't have

464
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:27,676
no morals or somethin',
is that it?

465
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:29,811
No. No, I just...

466
00:46:29,844 --> 00:46:32,347
Take it from me,
letting outdated traditions

467
00:46:32,381 --> 00:46:34,450
control how you live your
life will get you nowhere.

468
00:46:34,483 --> 00:46:35,451
I don't know about you,
but I got

469
00:46:35,484 --> 00:46:37,752
better places to be
than where I came from.

470
00:46:37,785 --> 00:46:38,920
Amen to that.

471
00:46:38,953 --> 00:46:40,855
And besides, it's just sex.

472
00:46:40,889 --> 00:46:41,932
You can decide
who you wanna love,

473
00:46:41,956 --> 00:46:43,224
but not who you wanna screw.

474
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:45,292
Attraction's out of our control.

475
00:46:45,325 --> 00:46:48,028
It ain't healthy keeping those
feelings locked away inside.

476
00:46:48,061 --> 00:46:48,929
I seen you sneaking

477
00:46:48,962 --> 00:46:51,432
a few long peeks
at Jackson over here.

478
00:46:51,466 --> 00:46:54,268
- No, I... I wasn't looking...
- It's okay.

479
00:46:54,301 --> 00:46:55,769
He don't mind none.

480
00:46:55,802 --> 00:46:57,004
She's right.

481
00:46:57,804 --> 00:46:58,938
I don't mind.

482
00:47:00,173 --> 00:47:01,207
No offense.

483
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,377
Everybody likes sex.

484
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:04,911
It's a gas.

485
00:47:04,944 --> 00:47:07,213
We're just not afraid
to admit it.

486
00:47:07,246 --> 00:47:09,949
Queer, straight, Black, white...

487
00:47:09,982 --> 00:47:11,884
It's all disco.

488
00:47:11,918 --> 00:47:14,119
You know why?
Because one day,

489
00:47:14,152 --> 00:47:16,254
we're gonna be too old to fuck.

490
00:47:16,288 --> 00:47:18,723
And life's too short,
if you ask me.

491
00:47:18,757 --> 00:47:20,258
Roger that.

492
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:22,227
The fact
of the truth of the matter is,

493
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,895
we turn folks on.

494
00:47:26,097 --> 00:47:28,966
- And that scares 'em.
- They can't look away neither.

495
00:47:28,999 --> 00:47:30,935
That's right.

496
00:47:30,968 --> 00:47:33,505
We're like a foxy car wreck.

497
00:47:33,538 --> 00:47:35,172
Which is how I know

498
00:47:35,206 --> 00:47:38,108
that this new home video
market is set to explode.

499
00:47:38,142 --> 00:47:40,445
Finally, people are gonna
get to see what they desire

500
00:47:40,478 --> 00:47:43,846
in the privacy of their
own homes, free of judgment.

501
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,282
We're gonna give that to them
before anyone else.

502
00:47:46,316 --> 00:47:47,418
Porn ain't only gonna be

503
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:49,386
- for perverts no more.
- Aw.

504
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,253
Toast to the perverts.

505
00:47:50,286 --> 00:47:52,356
They've been payin'
our bills for years.

506
00:47:52,389 --> 00:47:54,391
Hear, hear!
To the perverts!

507
00:47:54,425 --> 00:47:56,158
To livin' a life of excess,

508
00:47:56,191 --> 00:47:59,828
being young and having fun
till the day we die.

509
00:47:59,861 --> 00:48:01,930
To the power
of independent cinema.

510
00:48:01,964 --> 00:48:03,799
To living life on our own terms.

511
00:48:03,832 --> 00:48:04,866
And never accepting what

512
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,902
self-righteous naysayers
have to say.

513
00:48:06,935 --> 00:48:08,971
Right on.

514
00:48:09,004 --> 00:48:11,339
I don't know
if I agree with all of that,

515
00:48:12,474 --> 00:48:14,443
but I did like what I saw today.

516
00:48:17,845 --> 00:48:19,313
I didn't think I would,
but I did.

517
00:48:19,347 --> 00:48:20,515
Cheers to that.

518
00:48:22,183 --> 00:48:23,883

- Yeah.

00:50:33,672 --> 00:50:35,206
I wanna do a scene in the movie.

538
00:50:43,981 --> 00:50:44,982
What?

539
00:50:49,052 --> 00:50:50,421
I wanna be in the movie.

540
00:50:51,955 --> 00:50:53,156
No.

541
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,429
Well, why not?

542
00:51:00,063 --> 00:51:02,131
Well...

543
00:51:02,164 --> 00:51:03,232
Because...

544
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:05,368
No.

545
00:51:08,303 --> 00:51:09,648
Did y'all put her up to this
or somethin'?

546
00:51:09,672 --> 00:51:10,973
- No!
- Hey!

547
00:51:11,006 --> 00:51:12,709
Take it easy.
They didn't do nothin'.

548
00:51:12,742 --> 00:51:14,309
Nobody put me up to anything.

549
00:51:14,344 --> 00:51:16,244
I've been thinking
about it all day.

550
00:51:16,277 --> 00:51:17,311
And...

551
00:51:18,547 --> 00:51:19,515
Well, I'm young.

552
00:51:19,548 --> 00:51:22,250
And if we really are makin'
a good dirty movie,

553
00:51:22,283 --> 00:51:24,152
then I don't wanna
just carry the equipment.

554
00:51:25,521 --> 00:51:26,622
I wanna be in it.

555
00:51:27,556 --> 00:51:28,923
Well, you can't.

556
00:51:31,024 --> 00:51:32,025
Says who?

557
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:35,430
It's my film, Lorraine.

558
00:51:35,463 --> 00:51:37,130
I mean,
it wouldn't make any sense.

559
00:51:37,164 --> 00:51:39,099
We've already shot half of it.

560
00:51:39,132 --> 00:51:42,135
The story can't just suddenly
change midway through.

561
00:51:44,203 --> 00:51:45,237
Why?

562
00:51:47,072 --> 00:51:48,608
Because it just isn't done.

563
00:51:49,776 --> 00:51:52,278
What about in <i>Psycho?</i>
You love that movie.

564
00:51:54,548 --> 00:51:58,517
Well, <i>Psycho</i> is a horror film.

565
00:51:58,551 --> 00:52:01,986
And that plot was a MacGuffin
to build suspense.

566
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,556
And I'm not making
that kind of movie.

567
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:05,056
Oh, come on, RJ.

568
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:07,292
Nobody's comin'
to see this film for the plot.

569
00:52:07,325 --> 00:52:09,361
They're comin'
to see tits and ass.

570
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:13,163
- And a big dick.
- Lorraine!

571
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:14,298
It's the truth.

572
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:17,569
Why not just give the people
what they're payin' for?

573
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:20,003
Because I'm making
something better than that.

574
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:23,541
When did you become
such a prude?

575
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,644
All right, hold on.

576
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:31,448
I am the executive producer,
which means I get a word.

577
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,350
So, why don't we just
take a step outside

578
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:36,252
before anythin' gets said
that someone might regret.

579
00:52:44,527 --> 00:52:46,496
You gotta back me up
in here, Wayne!

580
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:47,773
I mean, this situation is fixin'

581
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:50,198
to get outta control.
It is awfully close.

582
00:52:50,232 --> 00:52:51,767
Relax.

583
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,035
Hey, what is it they say,
"Life imitates art"?

584
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:56,036
It's the other way around.

585
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:57,137
Whatever, it don't matter.

586
00:52:57,171 --> 00:52:58,181
But you need
to listen to me, okay?

587
00:52:58,205 --> 00:53:01,543
Because you ain't been 42,
and I have been 23.

588
00:53:01,576 --> 00:53:03,110
And I'm gonna explain
somethin' to you

589
00:53:03,143 --> 00:53:04,613
about young women.

590
00:53:04,646 --> 00:53:06,213
Now, if she's serious,

591
00:53:07,516 --> 00:53:09,315
which I suspect she is,

592
00:53:10,551 --> 00:53:13,086
she's gonna do it
whether you like it or not.

593
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,523
Now, you try to stop her,
not only is she gonna do it,

594
00:53:15,556 --> 00:53:17,767
she's gonna go on and do it
with God knows how many people

595
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:19,192
in God knows
how many other films,

596
00:53:19,225 --> 00:53:20,661
and nobody wants that.

597
00:53:21,529 --> 00:53:22,563
The way I see it,

598
00:53:22,596 --> 00:53:24,531
you only got
one good option here.

599
00:53:24,564 --> 00:53:27,165
What, letting her get balled
by some man whore?

600
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:28,835
Come on now,
Jackson is a professional.

601
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:30,670
He ain't got no diseases
or nothin'.

602
00:53:30,703 --> 00:53:32,539
You just want more sex
in the movie.

603
00:53:32,572 --> 00:53:34,607
That ain't me, hoss.
She wants it, you heard her.

604
00:53:35,675 --> 00:53:37,409
Heck, if she does great,

605
00:53:37,442 --> 00:53:39,511
she gets famous,
maybe she'll take you with her.

606
00:53:41,279 --> 00:53:42,748
Wayne, you don't get it.

607
00:53:44,483 --> 00:53:46,785
Lorraine is not
like the others in there.

608
00:53:46,818 --> 00:53:49,086
She is a nice girl.

609
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:52,757
I beg your pardon?

610
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:54,759
No, I didn't mean it like that.

611
00:53:54,792 --> 00:53:58,161
Oh, I hate to be the one
to tell you this,

612
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:02,165
but ain't none of them
nice girls.

613
00:57:11,842 --> 00:57:12,876
To hell with this.

614
00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:14,276
She can have it.

615
00:57:14,311 --> 00:57:15,688
Let's see how far they get
without me.

616
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:17,481
Good luck finding

617
00:57:17,514 --> 00:57:18,682
your own way out of here.

618
00:57:29,091 --> 00:57:30,291
What the...

619
00:57:43,404 --> 00:57:44,539
Ma'am?

620
00:57:55,749 --> 00:57:56,850
Are you all right?

621
00:58:07,427 --> 00:58:08,461
Sorry, I'm...

622
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:20,473
Ma'am?

623
00:58:35,987 --> 00:58:36,987
What?

624
00:58:38,489 --> 00:58:39,590
How come you just did that?

625
00:58:41,759 --> 00:58:44,628
Why won't you look at me?

626
00:58:44,662 --> 00:58:47,331
Look at me
like you looked at her.

627
00:58:47,665 --> 00:58:49,433
What?

628
00:58:49,466 --> 00:58:51,467
I can show you
what I'm capable of.

629
00:58:51,501 --> 00:58:53,403
Stop. I don't
wanna see it.

630
00:58:58,041 --> 00:59:01,110
Maybe we should just go
find your husband.

631
00:59:36,576 --> 00:59:37,611

Hey, hey, hey.

640
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,122
What's goin' on, church mouse?

641
01:04:37,156 --> 01:04:41,294
It's RJ.
I woke up, and he was gone.

642
01:04:41,327 --> 01:04:42,327
I...

643
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,098
You don't think he left me,
do you?

644
01:04:47,932 --> 01:04:49,200
Well, the van's still here.

645
01:04:50,234 --> 01:04:51,702
He's gotta be around somewhere.

646
01:04:55,773 --> 01:04:59,911
Oh, hey, it ain't
like your dog ran off.

647
01:04:59,944 --> 01:05:02,245
He's probably just
processin' things, you know?

648
01:05:03,146 --> 01:05:04,147
Go on back to bed.

649
01:05:04,181 --> 01:05:07,717
I feel bad if I hurt him.
I don't wanna break up.

650
01:05:07,751 --> 01:05:10,153
Hun, you didn't
do nothin' wrong.

651
01:05:10,187 --> 01:05:11,855
He'll get over it.

652
01:05:11,888 --> 01:05:14,224
He just needs
to toughen up, is all.

653
01:05:14,257 --> 01:05:15,859
Come on. I'll talk to him
in the morning.

654
01:05:16,892 --> 01:05:18,328
Will you help me find him?

655
01:05:20,297 --> 01:05:22,264
Please? I'm worried.

656
01:05:25,801 --> 01:05:27,203
All right.

657
01:05:27,236 --> 01:05:29,905
I ain't gettin' in the middle
of no more of this shit.

658
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:41,417
RJ!

659
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:44,985
Are you in here, brother?

660
01:05:45,018 --> 01:05:47,455
This ain't the way
to go about handlin' this.

661
01:05:59,533 --> 01:06:01,200
Oh, no.

662
01:06:07,873 --> 01:06:10,277
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

663
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:12,211
What are you doin' out here?

664
01:06:15,481 --> 01:06:17,316
I'm lookin' for my boyfriend.

665
01:06:24,923 --> 01:06:26,958
Have you seen my wife?

666
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,159
No, sir.

667
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:38,769
Two keys to keepin'
a healthy relationship.

668
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,872
Never let a good woman
out of your sight.

669
01:06:44,441 --> 01:06:46,277
Never mention her weight.

670
01:06:47,544 --> 01:06:49,112
How do you think
I've been surrounded

671
01:06:49,145 --> 01:06:52,181
by so many beautiful females
my whole life?

672
01:06:53,149 --> 01:06:54,784
There's an art to it.

673
01:06:56,152 --> 01:06:57,786
Just like business.

674
01:07:09,264 --> 01:07:12,501
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

675
01:07:25,546 --> 01:07:27,147
Oh, fuck me!

676
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:33,287
Oh, shut up, cheeseburger!
Go wander into traffic.

677
01:07:33,321 --> 01:07:35,889
Oh, fuck.

678
01:07:41,661 --> 01:07:43,363
RJ, you in here?

679
01:07:44,229 --> 01:07:46,265
I stepped on a nail.

680
01:07:46,299 --> 01:07:49,034
Come on out and help me,
for Christ's sake!

681
01:07:50,437 --> 01:07:52,605
I'm gonna catch tetanus
from this shit.

682
01:08:03,682 --> 01:08:04,916
RJ?

683
01:08:07,151 --> 01:08:09,252
Church mouse, that you?

684
01:08:57,432 --> 01:09:00,200
There's another light
down in the cellar.

685
01:09:00,234 --> 01:09:01,469
Can you go get it?

686
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:06,205
Please. My wife is not well.

687
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:07,541
It's very dark,

688
01:09:07,574 --> 01:09:10,277
and I'm worried she could fall
and break her hip.

689
01:09:26,626 --> 01:09:30,195
Downstairs.
You'll see my workbench.

690
01:11:17,362 --> 01:11:18,496
Found it!

691
01:11:33,209 --> 01:11:34,478
Hey, I'm locked in!

692
01:11:39,115 --> 01:11:40,216
Hey!

693
01:11:42,552 --> 01:11:45,388
Hey! Hey! Open up!

694
01:12:52,818 --> 01:12:54,285
What is it, baby?

695
01:12:55,753 --> 01:12:57,521
Thought I heard somethin'.

696
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:01,492
Probably nothin'.

697
01:13:03,193 --> 01:13:04,695
Old habits die hard.

698
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:07,397
Go back to sleep.

699
01:13:08,965 --> 01:13:10,500
Aye, aye, captain.

700
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,655
Everything okay, Pops?

701
01:14:12,358 --> 01:14:15,294
My wife, she's gone missing.

702
01:14:15,327 --> 01:14:16,395
Missin'?

703
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:19,664
She gets confused.

704
01:14:19,698 --> 01:14:22,834
It happens sometimes after dark.

705
01:14:22,867 --> 01:14:25,303
Lot of firepower
for a missin' wife.

706
01:14:26,037 --> 01:14:27,872
It's for gators.

707
01:14:27,906 --> 01:14:31,242
I found her once
by the edge of our pond.

708
01:14:31,276 --> 01:14:32,876
If she was to fall in...

709
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,848
Want some help?

710
01:14:41,051 --> 01:14:43,320
Not for self
but for country, right?

711
01:14:46,757 --> 01:14:48,524
Let me go and get my skivvies.

712
01:17:31,943 --> 01:17:34,613
I say we each
take a side of the perimeter.

713
01:17:34,646 --> 01:17:36,715
Cover ground quicker that way.

714
01:17:36,748 --> 01:17:38,716
I only got the one light.

715
01:17:41,085 --> 01:17:42,486
No offense,

716
01:17:42,519 --> 01:17:44,788
but it's been a while
since you was deployed.

717
01:17:44,822 --> 01:17:46,957
I spent three nights face down
in a rice paddy

718
01:17:46,991 --> 01:17:49,059
scanning for land mines
and trip wires.

719
01:17:49,093 --> 01:17:51,996
Once a marine, always a marine.

720
01:17:52,962 --> 01:17:54,497
If she's out here...

721
01:17:55,832 --> 01:17:57,066
I'll find her.

722
01:20:00,181 --> 01:20:01,715
I got nothin', Pops.

723
01:20:09,857 --> 01:20:11,058
Shit.

724
01:20:13,193 --> 01:20:15,194
What you doing
all the way in there?

725
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:31,076
Oh, no.

726
01:20:32,811 --> 01:20:35,147
Pops, you okay?

727
01:20:35,814 --> 01:20:36,848
You in here?

728
01:20:38,116 --> 01:20:42,255
Help!
Help, somebody, please!

729
01:20:42,288 --> 01:20:43,921
Please help me!

730
01:20:45,790 --> 01:20:46,857
RJ!

731
01:20:48,759 --> 01:20:49,827
Help!

732
01:21:27,995 --> 01:21:30,064
Oh, shit!

733
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:32,967
You scared me, Pops.

734
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,903
Once a marine, always a marine.

735
01:21:36,971 --> 01:21:37,972
Well...

736
01:21:39,006 --> 01:21:40,740
Your lady ain't in there.

737
01:21:40,774 --> 01:21:43,743
I can't give her
what she wants anymore.

738
01:21:46,179 --> 01:21:48,282
You don't understand
what it's like.

739
01:21:48,316 --> 01:21:50,384
You can still do as you please.

740
01:21:50,917 --> 01:21:52,185
Say what?

741
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:55,921
The last bohemian
that stayed here was the same.

742
01:21:55,955 --> 01:21:59,326
Traipsin' around
in barely any clothes.

743
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:01,261
Enticin' my wife.

744
01:22:03,230 --> 01:22:04,997
Yeah...

745
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:07,434
Okay, well,

746
01:22:07,467 --> 01:22:09,135
we better get back up
to the house

747
01:22:09,168 --> 01:22:11,002
and find out what's goin' on.

748
01:22:11,035 --> 01:22:13,805
I know exactly what's goin' on.

749
01:23:04,085 --> 01:23:06,720
Maxine?

750
01:23:08,923 --> 01:23:12,059
That woman was in my bed
touching me!

751
01:23:45,225 --> 01:23:46,959
You're just makin' things worse.

752
01:23:46,992 --> 01:23:48,394
Help me!

753
01:23:48,428 --> 01:23:50,329
Somebody! Please!

754
01:23:50,362 --> 01:23:52,264
Nobody is comin' for ya.

755
01:23:52,297 --> 01:23:55,200
Get back down in that cellar
and be quiet!

756
01:24:00,037 --> 01:24:02,773
- Shut up!
- Help!

757
01:24:02,807 --> 01:24:06,310
- Hey! Somebody, please!
- <i>Kidnappers, murderers,</i>

758
01:24:06,344 --> 01:24:07,944
<i>sex fiends,</i>

759
01:24:07,978 --> 01:24:09,055
<i>lurkin' where we least expect...</i>

760
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:10,113
Help!

761
01:24:10,146 --> 01:24:12,849
- Somebody, help!
- <i>...in good Christian homes,</i>

762
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:15,185
<i>right under our very noses!</i>

763
01:24:21,991 --> 01:24:22,992
Jackson?

764
01:24:24,261 --> 01:24:25,262
Wayne?

765
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:27,230
Where are y'all?

766
01:24:45,347 --> 01:24:46,381
Oh, my goodness.

767
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,316
Ma'am?

768
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:51,018
Ma'am? Be careful!

769
01:24:51,051 --> 01:24:53,887
Step away from the edge,
it's dangerous.

770
01:24:56,023 --> 01:24:58,459
It's all right. Here, here.

771
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:01,261
You're safe now, okay?

772
01:25:01,295 --> 01:25:04,298
Are you hurt?
I don't see anything.

773
01:25:04,331 --> 01:25:06,600
My nana gets confused
sometimes as well.

774
01:25:06,633 --> 01:25:08,268
I learned all about it.

775
01:25:08,302 --> 01:25:09,379
Believe it or not,
I've even thought

776
01:25:09,403 --> 01:25:11,003
about becomin' a nurse one day.

777
01:25:11,037 --> 01:25:12,071
So...

778
01:25:12,104 --> 01:25:13,344
Okay. Why don't you
come with...

779
01:25:13,373 --> 01:25:14,906
Oh!

780
01:25:16,107 --> 01:25:17,352
What the hell
did you do that for?

781
01:25:17,376 --> 01:25:20,212
I don't need a nurse.

782
01:25:20,246 --> 01:25:22,113
Why should you get
to have it all?

783
01:25:22,147 --> 01:25:24,916
What have you ever done
except be a whore?

784
01:25:25,618 --> 01:25:28,986
Okay, you know what?

785
01:25:29,019 --> 01:25:31,389
You don't want my help?
No problem.

786
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:33,425
I was just tryin' to be nice.

787
01:25:33,458 --> 01:25:36,126
You don't deserve
to be able to just flaunt it

788
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,196
in my face like you do.

789
01:25:38,229 --> 01:25:41,399
It ain't my fault you didn't
live the life you wanted.

790
01:25:41,433 --> 01:25:44,601
Now move out of the way, please.

791
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:49,206
Move! You mean old ugly b...

792
01:25:56,347 --> 01:25:57,480
Bitch.

793
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:23,572
Was that the one?

794
01:26:24,606 --> 01:26:27,006
You know I don't like blondes.

795
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:45,891
Disgustin'.

796
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:55,133
Lorraine?

797
01:26:56,268 --> 01:26:57,269
RJ?

798
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,469
Uh, place is empty.

799
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:12,171
What about
that other fella, Wayne?

800
01:28:12,206 --> 01:28:15,476
In the barn.
Stuck like the pig he was.

801
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:19,178
Well, that's three down.

802
01:28:19,213 --> 01:28:21,280
Four.

803
01:28:21,314 --> 01:28:24,417
And I got another
kept up at the house for you.

804
01:28:24,450 --> 01:28:26,051
I don't want her.

805
01:28:26,084 --> 01:28:28,321
This one was different.

806
01:28:28,354 --> 01:28:30,490
She had something special.

807
01:28:30,523 --> 01:28:32,123
Like I did.

808
01:28:32,157 --> 01:28:34,693
Sick and tired of never
gettin' what I want.

809
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:41,266
You know I want to give it
to you, Pearl.

810
01:28:41,299 --> 01:28:43,301
But I'm tired, too.

811
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:47,506
I know.

812
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,648
Tell me I'm special.

813
01:29:03,553 --> 01:29:05,255
Of course you are.

814
01:29:08,424 --> 01:29:10,593
I've felt that way

815
01:29:10,627 --> 01:29:12,662
since the first moment we met.

816
01:29:14,464 --> 01:29:18,065
You were the most
beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

817
01:29:23,104 --> 01:29:25,541
Oh, not anymore.

818
01:29:27,743 --> 01:29:29,278
Always.

819
01:29:36,284 --> 01:29:38,084
Tell me I'm yours.

820
01:29:40,855 --> 01:29:42,723
That you still want me.

821
01:29:52,164 --> 01:29:54,099
Make me feel young again.

822
01:30:04,510 --> 01:30:06,378
What if my heart can't take it?

823
01:30:06,412 --> 01:30:07,680
It can.

824
01:31:43,869 --> 01:31:46,905
Fuck me, Howard.

825
01:31:46,938 --> 01:31:48,573
Fuck me.

826
01:32:05,690 --> 01:32:07,458
Fuck me.

827
01:32:26,809 --> 01:32:30,546
Help!

828
01:32:30,579 --> 01:32:31,747
Help!

829
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:34,917
Somebody, help me, please!

830
01:33:14,954 --> 01:33:17,523
Let me out of here!

831
01:33:17,556 --> 01:33:18,891
Keep your voice down.

832
01:33:20,024 --> 01:33:21,593
Don't tell me to be quiet!

833
01:33:21,626 --> 01:33:23,862
I was locked in a dungeon
down there!

834
01:33:23,895 --> 01:33:26,531
These old people
are fucking crazy!

835
01:33:26,564 --> 01:33:27,641
I have to get out of this house

836
01:33:27,665 --> 01:33:29,000
before they kill me, too.

837
01:33:29,033 --> 01:33:31,069
We need to find the keys
to their truck.

838
01:33:31,102 --> 01:33:32,771
I never should have
listened to you.

839
01:33:32,804 --> 01:33:34,471
This is all your fault!

840
01:33:34,505 --> 01:33:36,640
Lorraine, we need
to stick together.

841
01:33:36,673 --> 01:33:38,408
I hate you!

842
01:33:38,442 --> 01:33:40,644
I hate you all so much!

843
01:33:41,545 --> 01:33:42,746
Lorraine!

844
01:33:47,351 --> 01:33:50,319
I told her to stay
in the damn cellar!

845
01:33:50,853 --> 01:33:52,355
That's all right.

846
01:33:53,022 --> 01:33:54,991
We don't need her anymore.

847
01:33:56,392 --> 01:33:58,995
We got each other again.

848
01:33:59,028 --> 01:34:01,597
Help me drag the body inside.

849
01:34:01,631 --> 01:34:03,799
If she's in the house,
that's self-defense.

850
01:34:03,832 --> 01:34:05,767
That's the law.

851
01:34:05,801 --> 01:34:06,701
You don't really believe

852
01:34:06,735 --> 01:34:09,004
anyone's gonna come
looking for 'em, do you?

853
01:34:09,037 --> 01:34:10,705
We ain't gonna risk it.

854
01:34:13,675 --> 01:34:15,744
We need
to play this smart, Pearl.

855
01:34:15,777 --> 01:34:17,812
No sense in making a mess now.

856
01:34:19,647 --> 01:34:21,749
If nobody shows up by tomorrow,

857
01:34:21,782 --> 01:34:23,918
we'll take the body
and we'll dump her

858
01:34:23,951 --> 01:34:25,786
in the pond with the others.

859
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:27,988
Which reminds me,
we're gonna need

860
01:34:28,022 --> 01:34:29,757
to get Wayne outta the barn

861
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:31,457
and sink him, too.

862
01:34:48,707 --> 01:34:50,776
She's heavier than she looks.

863
01:35:00,117 --> 01:35:02,019
Howard. Howard!

864
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:07,525
Howard?

865
01:35:08,626 --> 01:35:09,660
Howard?

866
01:35:09,694 --> 01:35:10,828
Howard!

867
01:35:12,129 --> 01:35:14,030
Where are the keys to the truck?

868
01:35:14,064 --> 01:35:16,466
- He's having a heart attack.
- I don't give a shit!

869
01:35:16,499 --> 01:35:18,602
- Where are the fucking keys?
- <i>Well, now...</i>

870
01:35:18,635 --> 01:35:20,437
- In the kitchen...
- <i>...here we all are...</i>

871
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:23,573
- ...under the lamp.
- <i>...together.</i>

872
01:35:23,607 --> 01:35:24,674
Howard?

873
01:35:24,708 --> 01:35:26,509
<i>We have reached a crossroad.</i>

874
01:35:26,543 --> 01:35:27,944
<i>With salvation...</i>

875
01:35:27,978 --> 01:35:29,678
- Howard?
- <i>...or damnation?</i>

876
01:35:29,712 --> 01:35:32,648
You're gonna rot when people
find out what you've done.

877
01:35:32,681 --> 01:35:33,816
<i>The time is now.</i>

878
01:35:33,849 --> 01:35:36,785
- What I have done?
- <i>For if we do not take control</i>

879
01:35:36,819 --> 01:35:38,988
- <i>of our own fate, the Lord...</i>
- What about you?

880
01:35:39,021 --> 01:35:40,789
<i>...shall do it for us.</i>

881
01:35:40,823 --> 01:35:43,124
You don't think I know
who you really are?

882
01:35:43,158 --> 01:35:46,461
I saw what you did in the barn.

883
01:35:46,494 --> 01:35:48,663
You're a deviant little whore.

884
01:35:49,564 --> 01:35:50,632
We're the same.

885
01:35:52,967 --> 01:35:55,170
You'll end up just like me.

886
01:35:55,204 --> 01:35:58,505
<i>Time to turn our backs on sin
and make the commitment...</i>

887
01:35:58,538 --> 01:35:59,673
I'm nothin' like you.

888
01:35:59,706 --> 01:36:00,941
<i>...once and for all.</i>

889
01:36:00,974 --> 01:36:03,510
You're a kidnappin',
murderin' sex fiend.

890
01:36:03,543 --> 01:36:05,045
I'm a fucking star!

891
01:36:05,078 --> 01:36:06,089
The whole world
is gonna know my name.

892
01:36:06,113 --> 01:36:07,447
<i>I want to hear you all.</i>

893
01:36:07,481 --> 01:36:08,882
<i>Say it with me now.</i>

894
01:36:08,916 --> 01:36:10,617
I will not accept a life

895
01:36:10,651 --> 01:36:12,518
- I do not deserve.
- <i>I will not accept a life</i>

896
01:36:12,551 --> 01:36:15,054
<i>I do not deserve.</i>

897
01:36:15,087 --> 01:36:17,690
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

898
01:36:17,723 --> 01:36:20,126
Stop fuckin' starin' at me!

899
01:36:48,786 --> 01:36:53,123
<i>Now, that's what I call
divine intervention!</i>

900
01:36:53,158 --> 01:36:59,595
<i>The Lord smiles on those who
accept Him. Praise his name!</i>

901
01:36:59,629 --> 01:37:03,099
<i>Glory be to Jesus!</i>

902
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:24,952
My hip...

903
01:37:24,986 --> 01:37:25,987
Help.

904
01:37:30,891 --> 01:37:33,828
Shh!

905
01:37:45,272 --> 01:37:47,073
You whore!

906
01:37:48,275 --> 01:37:50,277
You're not innocent!

907
01:37:52,312 --> 01:37:54,247
You're not special!

908
01:37:55,681 --> 01:37:58,851
It'll all be taken from you!

909
01:37:58,884 --> 01:38:01,520
Just like it was from me!

910
01:38:02,288 --> 01:38:03,323
I'll tell everyone

911
01:38:03,356 --> 01:38:04,989
what you are!

912
01:38:10,862 --> 01:38:12,264
It'll be our secret.

913
01:38:31,315 --> 01:38:33,251
Divine intervention.

914
01:38:59,074 --> 01:39:01,177
Praise the fuckin' Lord.

915
01:39:20,059 --> 01:39:23,629
<i>I hope that,
through my own admission,</i>

916
01:39:23,663 --> 01:39:25,332
<i>others may find the light.</i>

917
01:39:26,366 --> 01:39:28,067
<i>I wanna show y'all somethin'.</i>

918
01:39:30,304 --> 01:39:31,770
<i>Get a shot of this.</i>

919
01:39:34,706 --> 01:39:36,108
<i>There she is.</i>

920
01:39:36,142 --> 01:39:38,311
<i>My beautiful
little daughter Maxine.</i>

921
01:39:39,111 --> 01:39:41,214
<i>Lured into a life of sin</i>

922
01:39:41,247 --> 01:39:42,647
<i>by the very deviants</i>

923
01:39:42,681 --> 01:39:45,983
<i>we warn of here
on a daily basis.</i>

924
01:39:46,016 --> 01:39:50,255
<i>From our lovin' home
into the hands of devils.</i>

925
01:39:51,021 --> 01:39:53,258
<i>We pray, one day,</i>

926
01:39:53,291 --> 01:39:56,961
<i>she'll find her way home to us.</i>

927
01:39:56,994 --> 01:39:58,963
<i>Amen.</i>

928
01:39:58,996 --> 01:40:01,132
<i>Bless you, bless you.</i>

929
01:40:10,707 --> 01:40:12,309
What do you reckon
happened, Sheriff?

930
01:40:15,411 --> 01:40:17,213
How the hell should I know?

931
01:40:21,783 --> 01:40:22,985
Hey, boss.

932
01:40:26,922 --> 01:40:30,392
One of the boys
found this inside.

933
01:40:34,396 --> 01:40:35,930
What do you think is on it?

934
01:40:38,099 --> 01:40:41,303
Well, by the looks
of everythin'...

935
01:40:43,137 --> 01:40:46,407
I'd say one goddamn fucked up
horror picture.
