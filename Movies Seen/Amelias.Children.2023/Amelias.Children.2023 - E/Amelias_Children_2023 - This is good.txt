This is good
for your anxiety.

This vision that haunts you...

it haunts me too.

You must fight him, Ed.

You must...

block him from your mind.

Close your eyes, brother Ed.

What?

What the fuck?

It's okay, brother Ed.

It just means
you're part of this family.

What?

Close your eyes again.

Do you see
a vision from the past?

Or is it Mama?

What are you doing here, Ryley?

We have a gift,
brother Ed.

What the fuck?

What the fuck? Stop that.

Fucking stop.

Get the fuck out
of my mind! Stop that!

Calm down.

- Stop.
- It's okay.

<i>Stop. This can't be</i>
<i>fucking...</i>

This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

Please stop! What are you doing?

Oh, God!

It's okay.

Okay, brother.

It's okay.

This gift is a blessing.
