1
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:57,625
No!

2
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,134
No!

3
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:12,472
No!

4
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,105
- Yeah.
<i>- Yeah hello,</i>

5
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,273
<i>my name is Dwaine Derkly.</i>

6
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,208
<i>Am I speaking to Edward Ipus?</i>

7
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:48,609
Yeah, hi.

8
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,246
<i>Yeah, hi. I'm calling</i>
<i>from Woodland Foster Homes.</i>

9
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,348
<i>I received your online request</i>

10
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,317
for biological
parent information.

11
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,352
- Yeah, of course.
<i>- We've gone ahead and</i>

12
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,222
<i>retrieved your documentation</i>
<i>from the Woodland Archive,</i>

13
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:04,558
<i>and we went through</i>
<i>your admittance registration</i>
<i>documents,</i>

14
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,061
<i>where your information</i>
<i>would be listed.</i>

15
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:09,864
Did you find anything?

16
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:12,066
<i>Well, the document lists</i>
<i>your weight and size.</i>

17
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,602
<i>The date of birth is unknown.</i>

18
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,071
<i>There's no biological parent</i>
<i>contact.</i>

19
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,740
<i>So, if there's anything else</i>
<i>I can help you with...</i>

20
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:22,076
<i>uh, just send me an email.</i>

21
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,283

00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:42,630
-Thank you.
-I love you.

26
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:48,536
Yeah. I just found out

27
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,838
that today is probably not
my birthday,

28
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:52,472
but thank you.

29
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,142
-You talked to Woodland?
-Yeah.

30
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:02,917
Well, then I guess
you can't have this.

31
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:05,586
- No...
- Oh, no,

32
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,021
this is a birthday present,
so...

33
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,756
And you just made a wish
on a birthday cupcake

34
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,624
knowing it wasn't your birthday.

35
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:13,027
-No, that's not fair.
-Uh-uh.

36
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,162
- Give it to me.
- No...

37
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,034
Okay, fine, fine, fine, but...

38
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,537
You can have it,
but it's bad luck.

39
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,155
God, I'm nervous.

40
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,223
What's this?

41
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:43,524
Oh.

42
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,193
Here.
I think you have to scan it.

43
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,233
<i>AnceStory.</i>

00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,968

<i>Please insert your finger</i>

<i>It will collect a microdroplet</i>

47
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:03,577
It's just a pinprick.

48
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:06,113
Uh... Yeah, I guess.

49
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,153

Did you feel anything?

52
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,931
Uh... I don't think so.

53
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,872

<i>Thank you.</i>

60
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,095
<i>Maybe it was a panic attack.</i>

61
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:05,366
<i>Like the suddenness</i>
<i>of connecting to my brother.</i>

62
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,335
<i>But it's everything</i>
<i>I've ever wanted.</i>

63
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,271
I mean,
maybe you should call him.

64
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,374
Or if you want to wait
until I get home,

65
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:14,576
we can call him together.

66
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,978
<i>- I'm nervous, you know?</i>
- Yeah.

67
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:20,515
It's going to be okay.

68
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:23,484
This is exciting.

69
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:24,752
<i>You're right.</i>

70
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,788
I'll pick up soup dumplings
on the way home, okay?

71
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:29,356
<i>I love you.</i>

72
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:31,225
I love you too.

73
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:33,427
Bye.

74
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:01,055
<i>Hello. Edward?</i>

75
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,790
Uh, Hi. Yeah. Manuel?

76
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,825
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>Yeah, it's Manuel here.</i>

77
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,194
<i>Um... This is strange.</i>

78
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,730
<i>-Um...</i>
-Yeah, for sure.

79
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:10,998
<i>Yeah.</i>

80
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,268
<i>-Hey, Edward. How old are you?</i>
-Uh...

81
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:16,571
you can call me Ed. I'm 31.

82
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:18,205
<i>Thirty-one.</i>

83
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:19,340
<i>No way.</i>

84
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:20,975
<i>It's you.</i>

85
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:22,677
What do you mean?

86
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:23,877
<i>This will sound crazy,</i>

87
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:26,380
<i>but... I have a twin.</i>

88
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:28,683
<i>He was kidnapped</i>
<i>when he was a baby.</i>

89
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,386
<i>And Mom's been looking for you</i>
<i>ever since.</i>

90
00:12:34,723 --> 00:12:35,856
<i>Edward?</i>

91
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:37,992
<i>Are you there?</i>

92
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:01,448
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>Portugal was so green.</i>

93
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,518
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Give me another one.</i>

94
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,232
What does that mean?

95
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,434
"I want
a cream-covered codfish."

96
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:23,270
Oh, that's a bit gross.

97
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:27,241
Come on, this is, like,
your national... food.

98
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,710
You gotta get used to this.

99
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,077
You're going to have
the creamiest...

100
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,313
wettest fish.

101
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,282
Oh, my God, so many butterflies,
so beautiful.

102
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,383
Oh, my God.

103
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,253
It really is amazing.

104
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,791
Do you know
where you're going?

105
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,091
Uh...

106
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,728
I don't think
the GPS is working.

107
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,596
-No, it's not locating us.
-Hmm.

108
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,268
-Shit.
-Okay, yeah. Pull over here.

109
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,338
I can ask for help.

110
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:11,218
Be right back.

111
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,920
Yeah.

112
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,366
Would you
mind helping me with something?

113
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:26,500
We're, um,

114
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,836
<i>perdidas,</i> uh...

115
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:29,804
Mrs. Vieira:

116
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:30,938
Lost, yeah.

117
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:34,908
Um... And we're looking
for this house.

118
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,904
Okay.

119
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:08,142
All right.

120
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:11,145
Um... Well, thank you.

121
00:15:19,621 --> 00:15:20,555
What happened?

122
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:22,624
Let's get out of here.

123
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,332
What the fuck?

124
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,549
- God. It's huge.
- This is insane.

125
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:28,055
Brother Ed.

126
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:34,261
-I can't believe you're here.
-Hi.

127
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:38,265
Hey.

128
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,001
It's so nice to meet you.

129
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,303
- This is crazy.
- It is.

130
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,044
Did you
have a good trip?

131
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,279
Yeah.

132
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,081
- How do you feel?
- This is amazing.

133
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:00,522
Wow.

134
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,397
My brother.

135
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:14,669
Welcome home.

136
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:20,708
Let me show you around.

137
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:25,914
This is the living room

138
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:28,683
with a fireplace,
it's very warm.

139
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:30,183
It's good in the winter.

140
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:32,020
I want you to feel at home,
brother.

141
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,454
I'm sure you will,
because we're twins

142
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:37,992
and we have a deep spiritual
connection in this family.

143
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,161
It's strange, but it's true.

144
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,064
What? I'm not kidding.
It's not a bad thing.

145
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:45,833
Oh.

146
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,602
Those are my pets.

147
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:51,438
Hi.

148
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:52,740
They're beautiful.

149
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:54,842
Are they brothers?

150
00:17:55,043 --> 00:17:56,778
-Mm. Lovers.
-Oh.

151
00:17:57,712 --> 00:17:59,881
Wow. I like the one
in the purple shirt.

152
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,382
That's Carlos.
The other one is Castanheda.

153
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:06,153
Well, hello,
Carlos and Castanheda.
It's good to meet you.

154
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:08,255
I love these birds.

155
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:11,759
Yeah, that's Mommy.

156
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:14,762
Wow.

157
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,731
She's so beautiful.

158
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,366
She really is.

159
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,738
Let me show you this painting.

160
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:27,875
This is our great,
great grandmother Beatriz,

161
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:29,877
painted by Goya.

162
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,513
Eighteenth century.
It's original painting.

163
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:34,849
Um... Is Mom around?

164
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,385
You know, Mommy
is not feeling very well today.

165
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,588
It's better if you meet her
tomorrow.

166
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:51,532
<i>God, that was intense.</i>

167
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,201
<i>Maybe we should have rented</i>
<i>a place or something.</i>

168
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:57,739
No, what?
Manuel is fucking hilarious.

169
00:18:58,006 --> 00:18:58,940
I guess.

170
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:01,141
What's the matter, brother Ed?

171
00:19:02,777 --> 00:19:03,745
You don't like me?

172
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,648
This is my birds.

173
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:10,618
This is Carlos, Castanheda.

174
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,253
They are lovers...

175
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:16,223
Like me.

176
00:19:23,598 --> 00:19:25,566
I love you more than anything
in the world.

177
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,668
Hmm.

178
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:32,372
Thank you for taking
time off to come with me.

179
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:35,877
Of course, baby.

180
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,682
We're family.

181
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:09,003
Hey, brother Ed.

182
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:11,773
Brother Ed.

183
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,575
Huh?

184
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:18,713
Do you want to meet her?

185
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:21,649
What, now?

186
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:22,917
Yeah.

187
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,577
Hmm?

188
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,547
Hmm?

189
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:14,802
My boy.

190
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,605
My son.

191
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:30,017
My son.

192
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,421
My son.

193
00:22:38,926 --> 00:22:40,661
I've been dreaming
of this moment

194
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:42,462
since the day they took you.

195
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:50,504
You're perfect.

196
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:52,240
You're so beautiful.

197
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:56,577
My son.

198
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:30,011
You're the most
perfect thing in the world.

199
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:34,815
You're perfect too, Mom.

200
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:56,704
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

201
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:02,343
-Hey.
-Hey, good morning.

202
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:03,611
Morning.

203
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:06,514
What?

204
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:15,656
-I met my mom this morning.
-What?

205
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:16,891
Yeah.

206
00:24:17,425 --> 00:24:18,326
How was it?

207
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,561
It was beautiful.

208
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:22,930
Yeah.

209
00:24:24,065 --> 00:24:24,999
But...

210
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,936
I was a bit freaked out by her.

211
00:24:30,371 --> 00:24:31,539
-Really?
-Yeah.

212
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,241
Why? What happened?

213
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,781
It was a weird moment.

214
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:43,084
Like...

215
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:47,521
when I first saw her, I was...

216
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:53,027
She's had a little
too much work done.

217
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:55,930
-Like, on her face.
-Okay.

218
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,001
How bad?

219
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:07,308
-Like...
-Like the whole,

220
00:25:07,975 --> 00:25:10,011
-the whole thing.
-Yeah,

221
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:11,245
- like...
- Hmm.

222
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:15,883
Yeah.

223
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,654
Oh, baby.

224
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,225
How are you feeling?

225
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:26,694
I don't know.

226
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:30,664
-Strange.
-Mm-hmm.

227
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,344
Hi.

228
00:26:17,478 --> 00:26:19,013
Sorry.

229
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:19,847
Hi.

230
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:22,216
Sorry, you scared me.

231
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:24,385
-You're Ryley?
-Yes.

232
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:26,320
-Amelia.
-Amelia,

233
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:28,322
it's... so nice to meet you.

234
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:31,292
-Yeah, nice to meet you.
-It's just such a pleasure.

235
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:34,795
Oh, you're so talented.

236
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:36,730
Thank you.

237
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:38,599
You did it?

238
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:41,869
- Yeah.
- Oh, you draw so well.

239
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:46,006
You should draw me
one of these days.

240
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,308
Oh.

241
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:50,177
I love to pose.

242
00:26:52,514 --> 00:26:54,115
Well, I love to draw, so...

243
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:57,084
...perfect pair.

244
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:07,094
Amelia, thank you so much
for having us here.

245
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:11,132
I mean, this is so special
for Ed to be able to meet...

246
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,267
his family.

247
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:17,905
Are you from New York?

248
00:27:18,507 --> 00:27:20,542
Yes. Um... I...

249
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:22,743
I've lived in New York
for nine years,

250
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:26,747
um, but I'm originally
from Boise.

251
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:29,116
Oh, Idaho.

252
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:31,051
Yes.

253
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:33,487
The land of potatoes.

254
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:35,756
I love potatoes.

255
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,058
I cannot eat them.

256
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:39,493
Yeah, I mean...

257
00:27:40,027 --> 00:27:41,662
But I love them.

258
00:27:41,795 --> 00:27:43,164
They're the best.

259
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:45,366
Potatoes are so good.

260
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,036
Um... How do you know Idaho?

261
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:51,772
I was in America

262
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:53,374
a long time ago.

263
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:54,576
Okay.

264
00:27:55,176 --> 00:27:57,745
It was already
a very idiotic country.

265
00:27:59,548 --> 00:28:02,116
Puritans in love with guns.

266
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:04,385
Right?

267
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:06,153
I mean,

268
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:09,023
it doesn't compare
to this place.

269
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:11,458
It's just gorgeous here.

270
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,328
It's like a fairy tale.

271
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:18,032
It is.

272
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:20,768
I mean, this house must be...

273
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:26,106
When was this built? Like,
a million years ago?

274
00:28:33,414 --> 00:28:34,616
Time is a whore.

275
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:39,086
Time is like this...

276
00:28:39,954 --> 00:28:41,288
perfidious master.

277
00:28:43,658 --> 00:28:45,993
It blooms tragedy into comedy.

278
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:51,932
It transforms magic
into science.

279
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,042
Time eats us.

280
00:29:04,311 --> 00:29:05,412
Like potatoes.

281
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:12,286
Well, it was so nice
to meet you.

282
00:29:12,621 --> 00:29:14,822
I'm going to go find Ed,
'cause he's probably...

283
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:17,324
running around somewhere,

284
00:29:17,692 --> 00:29:19,460
um, but I'll see you later.

285
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:24,865
You have
very sensual lips.

286
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:34,341
Thank you.

287
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:35,843
Mm-hmm.

288
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:42,463
What are you doing?

289
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:45,165
Trying to write a song.

290
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,034
About what?

291
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:48,469
Uh...

292
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,072
It's embarrassing.

293
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:55,008
Well, come to bed, it's late.

294
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:17,431
I just heard
something really weird.

295
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:19,466
What?

296
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:23,437
I think your mom
and brother sleep together.

297
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:26,508
What?

298
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:28,108
Yeah.

299
00:33:28,743 --> 00:33:29,744
Are you sure?

300
00:33:29,878 --> 00:33:31,411
-Yeah.
-How?

301
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:33,648
Because I just heard them.

302
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:36,784
Oh.

303
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,220
That's weird.

304
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:52,934
<i>Exhale.</i>

305
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,169
<i>Bring your hands</i>
<i>down to the floor.</i>

306
00:33:57,906 --> 00:33:59,707
<i>Dive your body down.</i>

307
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:03,011
<i>Inhale, halfway lengthen.</i>

308
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:05,345
<i>Exhale.</i>

309
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:08,148
<i>Step back into plank pose.</i>

310
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,150
<i>Or chaturanga.</i>

311
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:14,689
<i>Inhale and release up...</i>

312
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:17,525
<i>into upward-facing dog.</i>

313
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:21,194
<i>Exhale, push back,</i>

314
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:23,665
<i>downward-facing dog.</i>

315
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:26,000
<i>Take another breath in.</i>

316
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:22,255
Oh.

317
00:35:22,624 --> 00:35:24,491
Hi, my boy.
Come here.

318
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:27,194
Come in, come.

319
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:29,697
Come here.

320
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:31,833
Oh, my boy.

321
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,268
This is my new boyfriend.

322
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:41,809
Isn't he beautiful?

323
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:47,582
And they are my slaves.

324
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,151
-Hello, Edward.
-Hi.

325
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:53,286
We represent
your mother's estate,

326
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,523
and we are,
according to her wishes,

327
00:35:55,657 --> 00:35:58,225
formalizing you
as co-beneficiary,

328
00:35:58,358 --> 00:35:59,493
along with Manuel,

329
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:02,764
to all of your mother's assets
when she passes,

330
00:36:02,897 --> 00:36:06,266
currently valued
at 65 million euros.

331
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:10,270
We have drafted
all the paperwork.

332
00:36:10,404 --> 00:36:12,106
So, if you could just sign here,

333
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:14,307
we can go ahead
and start the process.

334
00:36:22,717 --> 00:36:23,651
Mm.

335
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,921
I don't even speak Portuguese.

336
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:29,090
Oh,
it's just a pro-forma

337
00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:30,390
giving us power of attorney

338
00:36:30,525 --> 00:36:31,926
to take care of this legally
for you.

339
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,895
And it's best
if you stay in Portugal

340
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:35,228
for the next month

341
00:36:35,495 --> 00:36:37,598
because Portuguese
bureaucracy is quite slow.

342
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:38,766
Yes.

343
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:40,802
It's very slow.

344
00:36:49,544 --> 00:36:51,445
- Uh...
- And Edward,

345
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:55,116
I'd prefer if we keep this
our little secret.

346
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:56,517
Okay.

347
00:36:56,951 --> 00:36:57,885
Sure.

348
00:37:10,932 --> 00:37:11,833
<i>Ryley.</i>

349
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,433
Hey, Jay.

350
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:14,802
<i>Oh my God. How are you?</i>

351
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:16,904
Uh, it's so good
to hear your voice.

352
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:19,607
<i>Yeah, good to hear you,</i>
<i>too. Are you in Portugal?</i>

353
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:21,209
- Yeah.
<i>- In Lisbon?</i>

354
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:25,278
No. We are in the middle
of a forest,

355
00:37:25,546 --> 00:37:27,215
in a remote palazzo.

356
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:30,017
- It's very European.
<i>- Wow. Okay.</i>

357
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:32,120
I'm in the meditation room
right now.

358
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:36,023
Wait, can you hear me?

359
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:39,259
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
- Yeah.

360
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:40,728
<i>How is it?</i>

361
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:42,563
Yeah, it's just, it's...

362
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:45,398
- it's weird.
<i>- Oh, yeah?</i>

363
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,969
They have a mausoleum
in the house.

364
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:50,337
<i>- Oh, that is weird.</i>
- I know.

365
00:37:53,808 --> 00:37:54,709
Jay?

366
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:57,578
Hello?

367
00:38:28,743 --> 00:38:30,077
-Hey, Ryley.
-Sorry.

368
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:42,577
My suitcase was
literally reorganized,

369
00:45:43,477 --> 00:45:45,980
like she had come in the night
and folded my underwear.

370
00:45:46,113 --> 00:45:48,148
<i>- No, and it wasn't Ed?</i>
- No.

371
00:45:48,983 --> 00:45:50,719
<i>Okay, that's really scary.</i>

372
00:45:51,352 --> 00:45:53,354
And I've been having
the weirdest dreams.

373
00:45:54,088 --> 00:45:55,724
<i>It's like</i>
<i>they've brainwashed him.</i>

374
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,091
Yeah.

375
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:58,593
<i>You gotta try</i>
<i>talking to him.</i>

376
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:00,094
No, I promise.

377
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:02,763
Tomorrow by the latest.

378
00:46:03,264 --> 00:46:04,532
<i>You gotta</i>
<i>get out of there.</i>

379
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:06,133
I just have to convince Ed.

380
00:46:07,034 --> 00:46:08,402
<i>These people</i>
<i>sound like freaks.</i>

381
00:46:08,703 --> 00:46:09,803
Yeah.

382
00:46:10,204 --> 00:46:11,171
I know.

383
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,108
Ryley.

384
00:46:19,246 --> 00:46:20,147
Ryley.

385
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:25,520
Ryley.

386
00:48:52,433 --> 00:48:54,468
This is good
for your anxiety.

387
00:48:57,906 --> 00:48:59,973
This vision that haunts you...

388
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:02,376
it haunts me too.

389
00:49:12,386 --> 00:49:14,087
You must fight him, Ed.

390
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:18,425
You must...

391
00:49:19,193 --> 00:49:21,962
block him from your mind.

392
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:34,709
Close your eyes, brother Ed.

393
00:50:32,466 --> 00:50:33,367
What?

394
00:50:34,836 --> 00:50:35,803
What the fuck?

395
00:50:37,104 --> 00:50:38,405
It's okay, brother Ed.

396
00:50:40,307 --> 00:50:42,610
It just means
you're part of this family.

397
00:50:46,781 --> 00:50:47,682
What?

398
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,117
Close your eyes again.

399
00:51:10,572 --> 00:51:12,774
Do you see
a vision from the past?

400
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:25,687
Or is it Mama?

401
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:40,133
What are you doing here, Ryley?

402
00:51:43,004 --> 00:51:45,138
We have a gift,
brother Ed.

403
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:47,809
What the fuck?

404
00:51:47,942 --> 00:51:50,444
What the fuck? Stop that.

405
00:51:50,745 --> 00:51:52,814
Fucking stop.

406
00:51:52,947 --> 00:51:54,816
Get the fuck out
of my mind! Stop that!

407
00:51:54,949 --> 00:51:56,249
Calm down.

408
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:58,185
- Stop.
- It's okay.

409
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,220
<i>Stop. This can't be</i>
<i>fucking...</i>

410
00:52:00,922 --> 00:52:02,991
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

411
00:52:05,927 --> 00:52:08,796
Please stop! What are you doing?

412
00:52:09,262 --> 00:52:10,732
Oh, God!

413
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:18,405
It's okay.

414
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:20,340
Okay, brother.

415
00:52:20,775 --> 00:52:21,676
It's okay.

416
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,145
This gift is a blessing.

417
00:53:18,633 --> 00:53:19,967
You know I love you, right?

418
00:53:36,984 --> 00:53:37,952
I'm sorry.

419
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:41,254
I'm not in the mood.

420
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:43,825
That's okay.

421
00:53:47,662 --> 00:53:49,296
Baby, I've been thinking.

422
00:53:54,168 --> 00:53:55,469
We should get out of here.

423
00:54:00,842 --> 00:54:02,476
I don't feel comfortable here.

424
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,449
I mean, these people are weird.

425
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:15,523
They're really weird.

426
00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:19,927
I mean,
they... they give me the creeps.

427
00:54:24,498 --> 00:54:26,534
And if we leave now,

428
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:29,904
we can go to Lisbon
or we can go to the beach.

429
00:54:31,304 --> 00:54:33,875
Or we could go back to New York
for a couple of days

430
00:54:34,008 --> 00:54:35,777
and enjoy
the rest of our time off.

431
00:54:40,915 --> 00:54:43,618
These people are strangers,
basically.

432
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:45,887
They're not your real family.

433
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:47,622
Fuck you, Ryley.

434
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:50,658
What did you just say?

435
00:54:51,826 --> 00:54:53,360
You're being a real bitch.

436
00:54:56,831 --> 00:54:58,900
Excuse me.
Are you fucking kidding me?

437
00:55:00,935 --> 00:55:02,003
Look at me.

438
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:05,973
You did not just
call me a bitch.

439
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:08,209
I'm done with this.

440
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:10,077
I'm leaving with or without you.

441
00:55:11,712 --> 00:55:12,914
You better grow up.

442
00:55:13,781 --> 00:55:15,315
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

443
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,718
<i>So, did you talk to him?</i>

444
00:55:18,451 --> 00:55:20,353
Yeah. We got in a fight.

445
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:21,589
<i>Uh, that's annoying.</i>

446
00:55:21,956 --> 00:55:24,058
And I found weird shit
online about the house.

447
00:55:24,692 --> 00:55:25,760
<i>What do you mean?</i>

448
00:55:26,127 --> 00:55:28,361
It used to be owned
by a Portuguese witch.

449
00:55:29,964 --> 00:55:30,932
<i>A witch?</i>

450
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:34,334
<i>-You sound crazy, Ryley.</i>
-No, I don't know.

451
00:55:35,236 --> 00:55:36,469
The thing is, I think...

452
00:55:37,104 --> 00:55:39,240
Ed is really
falling in love with them.

453
00:55:39,774 --> 00:55:42,610
<i>- Mm-hmm</i>
- He's always wanted a family.

454
00:55:43,376 --> 00:55:44,545
<i>Yeah.</i>

455
00:55:44,879 --> 00:55:46,514
And it's like he's
buying into their bullshit.

456
00:55:47,048 --> 00:55:48,149
I don't know what to do.

457
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:49,449
<i>Can you change your ticket?</i>

458
00:55:49,584 --> 00:55:50,718
I don't know.

459
00:55:51,118 --> 00:55:53,287
<i>Okay, well,</i>
<i>you've got to get out of there,</i>

460
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,655
<i>so just figure it out.</i>

461
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:56,591
<i>I'm... I'm sure</i>
<i>you can change it</i>

462
00:55:56,724 --> 00:55:58,125
<i>or buy a new one</i>
<i>if you have to.</i>

463
00:55:58,259 --> 00:55:59,527
<i>They're not that expensive.</i>

464
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:01,428
<i>Just get yourself over here</i>
<i>as fast as you can.</i>

465
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:02,763
- I'll call you back, Jay.
<i>- What?</i>

466
00:56:04,232 --> 00:56:05,199
<i>Ryley.</i>

467
00:56:18,346 --> 00:56:19,479
Brother.

468
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,084
Brother Ed.

469
00:56:25,485 --> 00:56:26,921
-Brother Ed.
-Hmm.

470
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:33,393
Come see Mommy.

471
00:56:34,028 --> 00:56:34,996
She's dancing.

472
00:56:40,201 --> 00:56:41,102
What?

473
00:56:42,036 --> 00:56:42,937
Mommy's dancing.

474
00:57:07,228 --> 00:57:08,495
My son.

475
00:57:16,804 --> 00:57:18,973
I haven't danced in years

476
00:57:41,696 --> 00:57:43,463
Oh, my sweet boy.

477
00:58:42,323 --> 00:58:43,657
Oh, my loved ones.

478
00:58:57,671 --> 00:58:59,173
Is this Manuel?

479
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,908
Mrs. Vieira:

480
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:06,614
- Papa.
- Oh.

481
00:59:07,348 --> 00:59:09,950
Oh, he's their dad.
Ed and Manuel's father.

482
00:59:11,285 --> 00:59:13,654
He looks exactly like them.

483
00:59:19,894 --> 00:59:21,062
Your daughter.

484
00:59:24,598 --> 00:59:27,468
Mrs. Vieira:

485
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:30,171
- She was in love with him.
 -Yes.

486
00:59:31,772 --> 00:59:33,641
Mrs. Vieira:

487
00:59:36,777 --> 00:59:37,978
Wait.

488
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:40,748
Hold on.

489
00:59:41,682 --> 00:59:43,417
Here, speak slowly.

490
00:59:44,151 --> 00:59:45,986
Automated voice:

491
00:59:46,887 --> 00:59:48,222
Hmm.

492
00:59:56,664 --> 00:59:59,834
<i>- My daughter told me</i>
<i>- Arthur's mother was a witch.</i>

493
01:00:10,512 --> 01:00:12,646
<i>In exchange for eternal youth,</i>

494
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,048
<i>she has children with her sons,</i>

495
01:00:14,415 --> 01:00:16,984
<i>but when she has daughters,</i>
<i>she kills them.</i>

496
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:24,526
<i>My daughter said</i>

497
01:00:24,692 --> 01:00:26,460
<i>Amelia locked her father</i>
<i>in the basement</i>

498
01:00:26,595 --> 01:00:27,728
<i>and tortured him.</i>

499
01:00:30,865 --> 01:00:33,334
<i>She said she wanted</i>
<i>to free him...</i>

500
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:39,974
<i>But the truth is my daughter</i>
<i>never came back.</i>

501
01:00:40,207 --> 01:00:41,308
Oh.

502
01:00:42,676 --> 01:00:44,011
I'm so sorry.

503
01:01:45,607 --> 01:01:46,707
Hey babe.

504
01:01:47,441 --> 01:01:49,143
- You wanna come dance?
- Can we talk?

505
01:01:49,843 --> 01:01:51,312
Come on, we're having fun.

506
01:01:51,445 --> 01:01:53,747
I... I really don't feel
like it. I need to talk to you.

507
01:01:53,881 --> 01:01:55,684
Come on, I can show you
some Portuguese music.

508
01:01:55,816 --> 01:01:57,251
I don't want to fucking dance.

509
01:02:03,157 --> 01:02:04,425
This is weird.

510
01:02:05,025 --> 01:02:06,360
This is really weird.

511
01:02:08,329 --> 01:02:09,964
I don't feel comfortable here.

512
01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:19,840
Why are you ruining this moment?

513
01:02:22,943 --> 01:02:25,412
You're making me want to cry.

514
01:02:28,315 --> 01:02:32,853
You're making me cry.

515
01:02:33,354 --> 01:02:38,993
Why are you ruining
this moment with my boys?

516
01:02:39,793 --> 01:02:40,794
Why?

517
01:02:45,966 --> 01:02:49,770
She wants to take my boys
away from me.

518
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:55,943
She wants to take my boys
away from me.

519
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:06,420
I'm sorry.

520
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:18,866
What the fuck?

521
01:03:24,972 --> 01:03:26,473
Why did he block me in?

522
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:42,691
You want me to ask him
to move it?

523
01:03:42,823 --> 01:03:43,857
No.

524
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:45,192
We'll walk.

525
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:46,894
- Where are you going?
- Come on.

526
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:23,163
This is it, we're here.

527
01:04:35,976 --> 01:04:37,211
<i>Senhora</i> Vieira?

528
01:04:47,955 --> 01:04:49,223
<i>Senhora</i> Vieira!

529
01:04:52,192 --> 01:04:53,528
What are you doing?

530
01:04:56,865 --> 01:04:58,065
Ryley.

531
01:05:02,871 --> 01:05:04,104
Are you crazy?

532
01:05:11,912 --> 01:05:13,147
Shit.

533
01:05:18,485 --> 01:05:19,453
Hello?

534
01:05:21,488 --> 01:05:22,557
It's Ryley.

535
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:25,593
<i>Senhora</i> Vieira?

536
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:33,568
<i>-Senhora</i> Vieira?
-Ryley?

537
01:05:34,702 --> 01:05:36,003
What are you doing?

538
01:05:36,136 --> 01:05:37,505
<i>Senhora</i> Vieira,
it's Ryley.

539
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:38,640
Shit.

540
01:05:53,855 --> 01:05:57,024
Look at this. This is your dad.

541
01:06:11,004 --> 01:06:12,339
It looks like Manuel.

542
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:14,274
No, but look at the date.
It's 30 years ago.

543
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,912
Think about it.
They never talk about him.

544
01:06:18,045 --> 01:06:19,514
They don't have
any photos of him.

545
01:06:21,381 --> 01:06:22,750
Wake the fuck up.

546
01:06:23,383 --> 01:06:24,919
These people are psychos.

547
01:06:25,252 --> 01:06:26,688
Don't say that, Ryley.

548
01:06:27,522 --> 01:06:28,723
Oh, my God.

549
01:06:34,762 --> 01:06:36,931
How... How are you
not hearing me right now?

550
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:38,499
You just broke
into someone's house.

551
01:06:38,633 --> 01:06:40,100
- This is so fucked up.
- What is?

552
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:41,936
All of this.
You saw the photos.

553
01:06:42,369 --> 01:06:44,071
I'm sure
there's an explanation.

554
01:06:49,276 --> 01:06:50,512
Why are you doing this?

555
01:06:50,645 --> 01:06:53,413
Okay. I love you,
but I'm leaving.

556
01:06:53,548 --> 01:06:54,516
All right?

557
01:06:55,249 --> 01:06:56,985
-Come on, baby.
-Don't do this.

558
01:06:57,117 --> 01:06:58,553
We gotta go, all right?

559
01:06:58,820 --> 01:06:59,721
Why?

560
01:06:59,921 --> 01:07:00,822
Okay,

561
01:07:01,321 --> 01:07:02,624
just forget about this.

562
01:07:07,896 --> 01:07:09,096
What's up?

563
01:07:11,933 --> 01:07:12,867
Hey.

564
01:07:17,304 --> 01:07:18,540
What's going on?

565
01:07:25,513 --> 01:07:26,814
Can you move your car?

566
01:07:27,147 --> 01:07:28,983
-It's blocking the garage.
-Mm-mm.

567
01:07:29,116 --> 01:07:30,585
It's parked out front now.

568
01:07:31,553 --> 01:07:33,453
You can take it for a spin
if you like.

569
01:07:36,323 --> 01:07:37,725
I'm going to wait in the car.

570
01:07:42,095 --> 01:07:43,363
What's wrong with her?

571
01:07:48,302 --> 01:07:50,805
Nothing. She just wants
to go explore a bit.

572
01:07:52,172 --> 01:07:54,042
Yeah, I understand. It's okay.

573
01:07:54,374 --> 01:07:55,677
You should do it.

574
01:07:56,343 --> 01:07:57,512
Go explore.

575
01:08:42,222 --> 01:08:43,958
<i>Hello,</i>
<i>my name is Dr. Sunderson,</i>

576
01:08:44,092 --> 01:08:46,928
<i>and I'm calling</i>
<i>from AnceStory Genetics.</i>

577
01:08:47,795 --> 01:08:50,464
<i>I have this as a secondary</i>
<i>contact number</i>

578
01:08:50,598 --> 01:08:52,800
<i>for Mr. Edward Ipus.</i>

579
01:08:53,835 --> 01:08:58,506
<i>I've been trying to contact you</i>
<i>for quite some time now.</i>

580
01:08:59,807 --> 01:09:03,711
<i>We found a genetic anomaly</i>
<i>in your DNA,</i>

581
01:09:03,945 --> 01:09:08,783
<i>and what it suggests</i>
<i>is disconcerting.</i>

582
01:09:09,784 --> 01:09:14,822
<i>There's a high probability</i>
<i>of inbreeding confirmed...</i>

583
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:26,259
Ma?

584
01:10:29,362 --> 01:10:30,497
Hey.

585
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:50,718
I poured us some tea.

586
01:10:52,954 --> 01:10:53,921
Thank you.

587
01:10:59,961 --> 01:11:00,862
I'm sorry.

588
01:11:04,999 --> 01:11:06,968
I didn't mean for this
to happen.

589
01:11:08,502 --> 01:11:09,871
It's okay.

590
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:15,710
Ryley's a good girl.

591
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,983
I think we're going to have
to leave for a few days.

592
01:11:28,523 --> 01:11:29,624
It's okay.

593
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:36,731
Drink your tea.

594
01:11:45,706 --> 01:11:46,841
Mmm.

595
01:13:35,482 --> 01:13:36,684
Ryley.

596
01:13:52,533 --> 01:13:53,901
Where are you, Ryley?

597
01:14:01,542 --> 01:14:03,177
I just want to talk, Ryley.

598
01:14:05,513 --> 01:14:06,814
We need to talk.

599
01:14:27,001 --> 01:14:28,602
Get the fuck away from me.

600
01:15:27,028 --> 01:15:28,062
Ryley?

601
01:15:31,132 --> 01:15:32,299
Are you okay?

602
01:15:33,534 --> 01:15:34,635
I feel tired.

603
01:16:57,685 --> 01:16:58,953
Ryley.

604
01:17:02,656 --> 01:17:04,091
Where are you, Ryley?

605
01:17:23,612 --> 01:17:25,312
Ryley, open this door.

606
01:17:28,048 --> 01:17:30,684
Open this door now, Ryley.

607
01:17:38,058 --> 01:17:39,393
Open the fucking door!

608
01:17:40,961 --> 01:17:43,397
Open this door.

609
01:18:26,707 --> 01:18:28,876
Open this door!

610
01:18:32,012 --> 01:18:34,215
Listen to me!

611
01:18:52,833 --> 01:18:53,934
Help me.

612
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:36,070
Baby, are you okay?

613
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:38,105
Oh, God.

614
01:20:43,911 --> 01:20:45,245
I feel tired.

615
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,295
Manuel.

616
01:22:10,431 --> 01:22:11,566
You...

617
01:22:22,176 --> 01:22:23,977
What have you done?

618
01:22:24,546 --> 01:22:25,613
No!

619
01:22:37,792 --> 01:22:39,126
My love.
