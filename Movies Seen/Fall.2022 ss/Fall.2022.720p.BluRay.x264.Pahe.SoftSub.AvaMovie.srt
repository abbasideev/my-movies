1
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,530
There's a big gap.

2
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,869
This feels
like the only route, let's keep going.

3
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:24,668
You okay?

4
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,632
It's all right, kid.
Never be easy.

5
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:32,718
Okay.

6
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,180
- One, two, three!
- Be careful.

7
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,725
You okay?

8
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,768
Okay.

9
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,731
- Oh, my god.
- Never better.

10
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,900
Okay.

11
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,576
- Whoa, whoa, you're good.
- Shit.

12
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,411
You're good. Yeah?

13
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,997
- You're good?
- No.

14
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay, you've done way scarier than this.

15
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,377
Remember a.J. Hackett, snake dike?

16
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,756
Stupid singing competition.
God, you married this sad sack,

17
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,382
for Christ's sake.

18
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,426
- Yeah? Okay.
- Okay.

19
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,847
Two...

20
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,931
Three!

21
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,225
Come on! I got you.

22
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,935
That's my girl.

23
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,774
Ew! Gross!

24
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,817
You guys, get a room!

25
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,320
Here comes Ethan hunt.

26
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,281
Careful, h, there's loose rock
around the elbow.

27
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,825
Worry about your ropes, bitches.

28
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,285
I'm fine.

29
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,371
Whoo!

30
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,997
Try to keep up!

31
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,967
Taking your time there, hotshot.

32
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,389
Hunter, you show off!

33
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,765
Whoo!

34
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,572
Hold on, Dan.
Hold on, I'm coming.

35
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,895
Dan, are you okay?

36
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,230
Just hold on. I'm coming down.

37
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,484
Come on. Come on. I can't make it.

38
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,737
- [Gaspingl oh, my god.
- Okay, Becky, Becky.

39
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,946
I need a little more length.

40
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,449
Can you UN-clip?
Are you secure?

41
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,033
- Are you secure?
- Yeah.

42
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,201
Yeah, I'm... I'm secure.

43
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,704
Just UN-clip and I'll be able
to swing to the rock.

44
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,497
- Okay.
- I think I can reach it.

45
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,623
Ready?

46
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,421
Can you reach it?

47
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,922
Just... just one second.

48
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,382
All right. I think I can make it.

49
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,342
Hold on, Dan.

50
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,279
- I'm almost there.
- Just need a little more momentum.

51
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,304
Okay.

52
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,098
No!

53
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,268
Dan!

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,002
Hey!

55
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,213
This is Becky and Dan.
Leave a message.

56
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,007
Hey, Becky, it's me.

57
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,761
Look, I've tried to console you
every way I know how.

58
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,012
But I...

59
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,808
I can't help you
if you don't pick up the phone.

60
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,435
Sweetheart, I'm worried about you.

61
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,480
So whenever you stop hating on me,

62
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,898
I am here.

63
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,556
Hey, what's up?

64
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,685
This is just the voice mail.
You've reached Dan.

65
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,895
Just leave a message,
I'i/ hit you back when I can.

66
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,523
Get it off at the beep.

67
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,858
Hey.

68
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,861
Miss you.

69
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,289
Dad, what? Are you stalking me now?

70
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,709
No, I just don't know what else to do,
'cause you're not answering your phone.

71
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,794
- Take a hint.
- I-I think this is getting

72
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,130
- a little bit ridiculous.
- "Ridiculous"?

73
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,217
You told me I shouldn't be so broken up
about him because he was an asshole.

74
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,970
No. I said that maybe he didn't
belong on this pedestal

75
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,197
that you were putting him up on,

76
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,224
that he wasn't this martyr
that you've been making him out to be.

77
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,018
This is how you console your daughter?

78
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,353
I just want you to be able
to move on with your life.

79
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:39,482
I don't want to move on. I miss him!

80
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,860
Every day, I miss the way he looked at me.

81
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,904
- I miss the way he made me feel.
- Sweetie.

82
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,572
- Don't!
- Don't what?

83
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,174
What do you think you're doing, Becky?

84
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,218
- Getting away from you.
- You are not driving. Stop it.

85
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,577
Fuck off!

86
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,329
You don't get to talk to me like that.

87
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,290
Your mother and I,
we raised you better than that.

88
00:06:55,373 --> 00:07:00,420
So getting shit-faced
and pushing the people away that love you,

89
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,713
it's not gonna work.

90
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,550
All right, look,
a horrible thing happened to you,

91
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,844
but you have to start
living your life again.

92
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,139
All right? There's a whole big wide world
out there that needs you

93
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,934
and believe it or not, I need you.

94
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,144
Let me give you a ride home.

95
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,814
I'd rather walk.

96
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,110
Let me ask you something.

97
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,115
If roles reversed, if it had been you
that had fallen that day,

98
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,826
do you think Dan
is standing out here alone?

99
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,289
Drowning in booze, grief, sorrow,
whatever the hell this is?

100
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,126
He's not.

101
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,753
And you damn well know it.

102
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,674
God damn it, Becky, I need you to try.

103
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,294
Do you know what I need, dad?

104
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,722
I need you to leave me alone.

105
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,190
God damn it.

106
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,451
The number you have
called has been disconnected.

107
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,667
Mwmm

108
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,416
- Hi!
- Hey.

109
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,209
You look, um...

110
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,587
- Awful.
- Yeah.

111
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,798
Yeah, like really freakin' awful.
Well, come here.

112
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,805
So, what brings you back?

113
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,599
Are you finally ready to rest?

114
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,226
I'll rest when I'm dead.

115
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,231
I have something that's planned
and I need a partner in crime.

116
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,111
Look, your dad called me a few weeks ago.

117
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,824
He didn't know who else to turn to,
and he said that you were in a bad place.

118
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,202
- He had no right to do that.
- He's worried about you.

119
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,663
It's coming up on a year.
He doesn't want you to be alone.

120
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,707
Look, the only thing
that drives me crazier

121
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,668
than Dan's boxed ashes
collecting dust in there

122
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,837
is my best friend stuck in here with him.

123
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,216
So I have something
that I wanna pitch you.

124
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,219
You're not gonna like it,
but just try to keep an open mind.

125
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,809
The 8-6? TV tower.

126
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,811
It's only a six-hour drive from here.

127
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,854
I was planning on climbing it this weekend

128
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,357
and I wanted to see
if you'd climb it with me.

129
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,197
It would be an adventure,
like old times.

130
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,826
And you could scatter Dan's ashes on top.

131
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,080
- I just... I haven't climbed since...
- I get it.

132
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,919
But if you don't confront your fears,
you are always going to be afraid.

133
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,629
What is it that Dan used to say?

134
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,842
"Don't... die if you wanna live

135
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,511
or keep living even if you're dying."

136
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,314
Shit, I feel like
I'm messing this pitch up.

137
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,140
No, I'm sorry.

138
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,225
Hunter, I just... I can't.

139
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,020
It's like I know I can't do it, I'm sorry.

140
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,772
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

141
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,774
- I can't.
- Hey, hey, it's okay.

142
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,193
It's okay.

143
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,733
Morning, Princess.

144
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,529
What's wrong?

145
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,781
"If you're scared of dying,
don't be afraid to live."

146
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,619
That's what Dan used to say.

147
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,997
Let's do it.

148
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,458
Let's climb your stupid tower.

149
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,544
Oh, my god, Becky, baby, I'm so excited!

150
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,221
I've never
actually seen this video.

151
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,766
Shit, I was really ripped.

152
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,185
Yeah! You're awesome.

153
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,270
That is the Becky
that we need for this trip.

154
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,107
Aw!

155
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,319
Holy shit! Look at your beaming face.

156
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,071
Now, who's this in the photo with you?

157
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,697
I don't know. It's an oldie.

158
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,367
- Who is it?
- Nobody.

159
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,285
- Just give it back.
- Hunter has a boyfriend.

160
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,496
It's nothing. Just some guy.

161
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,165
Oh, that some guy sure knew
how to tickle your whistle.

162
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,221
Yo, what's up, guys?

163
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,974
Danger d, and I'm back stateside, yo!

164
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,934
Hashtag, super badass.

165
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,520
Okay, in my defense,

166
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,773
I may act like a total dick on camera,
but it's worth it.

167
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,233
I get paid for this shit.

168
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,568
It's enough to keep me traveling
and you know me,

169
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,238
I have to be doing dangerous shit
to keep my blood pumping,

170
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,240
so I might as well monetize that.

171
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,034
I'm just saying,
if you're gonna be a youtuber,

172
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,995
why not be yourself? You are awesome.

173
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,706
- Natural born clickbait.
- No.

174
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,875
What we're doing here, this is clickbait.

175
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,214
Excuse me?

176
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,300
Do you have somewhere
I could charge my phone?

177
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,051
Power ain't free, ma'am.

178
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,346
Oh, and do you know
where the b-67 TV tower is?

179
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,515
We can't find it on the map.

180
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,561
You don't need a map.
You see that light way up there?

181
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,023
That's your tower.

182
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,150
That's insanely high.

183
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,833
What's with the light? I thought you said
it was out of commission.

184
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,531
So aircraft can see it.

185
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,453
You know, this was once
the tallest structure in the us.

186
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,122
Now it's just this old relic.

187
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,583
They're due
to tear it down next winter.

188
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:55,793
Becky?

189
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,004
Becky?

190
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,089
- What?
- Give me your phone charger.

191
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,759
What are you doing?

192
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,763
A very cool life hack.

193
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,391
Now I'm just gonna line up the prongs

194
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,644
with the elements in the lamp. And...

195
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,107
How's that for a dumb youtuber?

196
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,421
Hey, honey.

197
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,423
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you sleep well?

198
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,223
I love you.

199
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,230
You're not gonna say it back?

200
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,358
I am saying it.

201
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,238
Four...

202
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,321
Three...

203
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,283
I love you.

204
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,098
Hey, come on, becks. Sun's up.

205
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,482
What up, El capitan?

206
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,985
I don't know,
but something's up, sports illustrated.

207
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,611
Tits for clicks.

208
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,826
Are you live streaming?

209
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,036
No, dude. Shoot now, post later.

210
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,330
Oh, good. I don't wanna be in it.

211
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,959
Hey, guys. Danger d here

212
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,837
and I have somebody
very special for you to meet.

213
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,299
- Say hello, Becky c.
- Hi.

214
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:11,846
And we have something
totally bat shit crazy for you guys today.

215
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,766
The b-67 TV tower.

216
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,103
This bad boy is over 2,000 feet tall.

217
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:23,441
And your home girls are gonna be climbing
to the tippy, tippy top.

218
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,360
But don't worry, Becky c,

219
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,154
- because you're safe with...
- Watch out!

220
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,872
Holy shit!

221
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:38,998
Whoo!

222
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,042
Eight more lives, baby!

223
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:18,788
Shit.

224
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,173
Looks like we're walking from here.

225
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,092
- How far?
- I don't know.

226
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,680
Like a mile?

227
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,014
Maybe two-ish?

228
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,604
Damn, it's hot.

229
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,940
You'll cool down
once we get some air time.

230
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,627
We've got enough water, you think?

231
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,112
Water's check. Harnesses check.

232
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,781
Super badass 4k drone check.

233
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,908
Selfie stick, all the essentials.

234
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,410
Food?

235
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,012
Nah, we'll be back in time before lunch...

236
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,705
Oh, Jesus.

237
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,793
Holy shit, they're big.

238
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,593
It's still alive. Get off of him!

239
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,012
- Hey! Hey!
- Go away!

240
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,930
Just go. Go!

241
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,063
Poor thing.

242
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,277
Pricks.

243
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,554
Survival of the fittest, right?

244
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,868
You'd do the same
if you were starving out here.

245
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,122
- "Feeling peckish."
- Hunter.

246
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,374
What? That's funny.

247
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,933
- Holy shit, 300 likes.
- Oh, wow.

248
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,853
350.

249
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,522
I wonder how many
of your followers are serial killers.

250
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,027
Holy shit.

251
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,697
Looks a lot bigger up close, right?

252
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,826
This is sick.

253
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,788
This is awful.

254
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,499
Hey, guys!

255
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,042
Danger d here.

256
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:32,296
And we are at the foot
of this stomach-churningly massive

257
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,340
fourth-highest structure in the us.

258
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,218
We 're gonna begin our grueling journey

259
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,804
with an 1,800-foot ladder climb

260
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,306
inside a steel cage.

261
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,725
And then after the cage...

262
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:49,689
We have a zoo-foot, vertigo-inspiring
mast with an external ladder.

263
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,692
Your girl's gonna be wide open
to the elements.

264
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,736
And then beyond that,
we have the precipice.

265
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,990
- The ledge. The top of the world, ma.
- Hunter?

266
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,038
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

267
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,124
Babe, of course you can.

268
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,167
No, um, I really can't. I'm, like...

269
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,838
I'm petrified. I'm, like, shaking.

270
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,381
I'm here.

271
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,591
Take a breath.

272
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,763
After Dan died,
I was afraid of my own shadow.

273
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,850
But I pushed through.

274
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,477
I overcame the fear. I took control.

275
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:35,401
Do not let this fear consume you.
Come at it head on and kick its ass.

276
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,154
If you can beat it, you can beat anything.

277
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,366
And I'm right here
beside you the whole time.

278
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,495
You are so much stronger
than you think you are.

279
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,833
So shut your shit and let's do this.

280
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,795
God, hunter.

281
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,882
You know, that's the kind of shit
you should be posting on Instagram.

282
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,342
Come on.

283
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,891
Dude, this is so cool.

284
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,350
Holy shit.

285
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,313
Look at this.

286
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,399
Damn it, hunter.
You are such an asshole.

287
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,278
- What are you getting us into?
- Don't worry.

288
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,447
We've got 50 feet of rope between us.

289
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,365
We're clipped in and we're all good.

290
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:25,993
Okay.

291
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,329
One rung at a time,
and let me know if you have to rest.

292
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,071
Okay, okay.

293
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,373
See?

294
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,874
It's easy.

295
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,712
Sure.

296
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,092
You're doing great. Come on.

297
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,679
You okay?

298
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,310
You're doing great.

299
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,436
Come on.

300
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:53,974
Hunter?

301
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,354
- Hunter?
- Yeah?

302
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,649
Can we rest a moment?
I need a drink.

303
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,150
Of course.

304
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,363
Those guy lines means we're halfway up.

305
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,661
Perfect spot.

306
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,746
You wanna know something crazy?

307
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,165
What?

308
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,792
Halfway up?

309
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,753
That means we've climbed about 1,000 feet.

310
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,047
So we've climbed the height
of the Eiffel Tower.

311
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,258
Please don't say shit like that, hunter.

312
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,970
Whoa!

313
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,555
There's the motel. And the diner.

314
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:37,476
No way. Looks like a little toy town.

315
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,441
- Let's just get this over with.
- Yeah.

316
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,572
Come on. Catch up.

317
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,969
That's it.

318
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,263
Becky, you're doing amazing.

319
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,352
Come on! Come on, Becky!

320
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,996
Okay.

321
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,498
This is the end of the internal ladder.

322
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,709
One step at a time, okay? You got this.

323
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,714
The next 200 feet is external.

324
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,840
I'm not gonna lie.

325
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:53,010
It's gonna get a little bit crazy
when we're out of the cage in the open.

326
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,386
But don't panic.

327
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,776
Hunter. Hunter!

328
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,360
Hunter! Hunter!

329
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,322
Becky! You gotta come up. It's so sick!

330
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,241
Okay.

331
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,256
- Hunter?
- I'm here.

332
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,051
It's just like 200 feet more, that's all.

333
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:37,221
- I can't!
- Yes, you can!

334
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,766
Just look up and only up.

335
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,607
You're doing great. You got this.

336
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,363
Okay. Okay.

337
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,917
Okay.

338
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,107
Yeah! You're killing it!

339
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,191
Whoo!

340
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,697
You're okay.

341
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,658
Remember, only look up.

342
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,416
What the hell are we doing?

343
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,501
Hey!

344
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,170
Stop over thinking.

345
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,963
- How?
- I don't know.

346
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,673
Concentrate on something else, like...

347
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:59,386
Sing a-a nursery rhyme or some shit.

348
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:03,932
Okay, okay.

349
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,350
Okay.

350
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,687
<i>♪ Ring around the roses ♪</i>

351
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,315
<i>♪ pocket full of posies ♪</i>

352
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:15,235
<i>♪ ashes, ashes, we all fall down ♪</i>

353
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,946
<i>♪ down! ♪</i>

354
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,158
I wouldn't have picked that one.

355
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,159
Wow.

356
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,661
Okay. Okay, becks,

357
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:27,915
this is gonna look
a little bit worse than it is.

358
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,834
Ah, what the hell, hunter?
Let's just go back down!

359
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:40,135
Becky, if I let you go back now,
fear wins.

360
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,971
And I'm not going to let that happen.

361
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,591
It's okay, becks.

362
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,427
It's okay.

363
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,179
I've got your weight.

364
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,767
Thanks. Okay.

365
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,036
- Reach up. Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

366
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,379
Okay.

367
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:01,216
Smooth as sailing to the top now.
You got this.

368
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,096
I actually really do hate you, hunter.

369
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,516
Hey, does this ladder feel loose to you?

370
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,022
Stop, you click, hunter!

371
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,816
Sorry.

372
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,031
What was that?

373
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,910
Come on, we're almost there.

374
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,207
- Come on.
- Okay.

375
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,739
Wow.

376
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,037
Becky, you're not gonna believe this.
You gotta come up here.

377
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,121
I'm coming.

378
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,167
- Okay.
- Whoo!

379
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,460
Okay.

380
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,383
Hunter.

381
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,975
Hey, trust me.

382
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,937
Okay, okay.

383
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,408
Fuck, Becky!

384
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,284
Oh, I'm here. Oh, my god.

385
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,087
Oh, my god.

386
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,673
We did it, becks!
I knew you could.

387
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,218
Whoo!

388
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,194
Whoo!

389
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,407
Here we go!

390
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,538
- On top of the goddamn world!
- Whoo!

391
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,335
Do you wanna try?

392
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,714
Shit! Hunter, stop!

393
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,384
Just focus on getting a good shot.
I didn't wear this stupid bra for nothing.

394
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,679
- No, hunter.
- Whoo!

395
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,016
Swoop it around!

396
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,394
Seize your day!

397
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,688
Okay. Oh, my god.

398
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:15,076
How'd it look?

399
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,787
Insane! Insane. Crazy.

400
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,917
Let's get this bad boy back.

401
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,378
Holy shit, so sick, dude.

402
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,340
Okay. Now the ultimate, becks.

403
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,050
Your turn.

404
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,640
What? No.

405
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,600
Do you want to kick fear
in the dick or not?

406
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,977
No. No, hunter.

407
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,105
The old Becky would have done it.

408
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,984
- Just saying...
- Dude.

409
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,612
Here. I'll hold your hand.

410
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,995
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah?

411
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,665
Shit.

412
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,793
Come on, come on!

413
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,419
You can do this.

414
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,425
- You can do it.
- Okay, okay, okay.

415
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,680
- I got you.
- Okay.

416
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,181
Okay. Whoa!

417
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,891
- You can trust me.
- Whoa, okay.

418
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,685
- I've got you, becks.
- Oh, my god.

419
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,563
Careful over the ledge.

420
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,107
Take it easy.

421
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,734
Okay, I've got you. I've got you.

422
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,867
Open your eyes.

423
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:43,290
Whoo-hoo!

424
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,463
Okay, just one more.

425
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,387
You're coming up right now.

426
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,601
My god, you did it.

427
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:05,687
You did it! You did it, you idiot.

428
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,650
Yes! Look.

429
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:14,279
- Look how amazing these are.
- Oh, my god. Whoa!

430
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,536
Next time you are ever afraid of anything,

431
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,457
I want you to look at these and know
that you have nothing to be afraid of.

432
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,669
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

433
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,129
I'm really proud of you.

434
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,882
Dan would be, too.

435
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,396
Okay.

436
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,149
Okay, it's time.

437
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:30,105
You and I were one, Dan.

438
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,651
And whenever I needed a laugh,

439
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,237
you told me one of your shit jokes.

440
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,495
And whenever I needed
a shoulder to cry on, it was yours.

441
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,875
And now you're gone and I'm...

442
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,464
I don't feel whole anymore.

443
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,848
I miss you, um, just so much and I'm...

444
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,309
I love you.

445
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,688
Goodbye, Dan.

446
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:32,125
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

447
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,336
I just didn't expect it
to hit me like that.

448
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,550
I've just been so far away for so long.

449
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,052
It just didn't really feel real
until then.

450
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,392
Come on.

451
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:53,688
Let's get back down on earth, okay?

452
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,459
I don't know about you,
but I really need to pee.

453
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,568
I've needed to pee
since we passed the Eiffel Tower.

454
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,404
Okay?

455
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:05,283
- Okay, home time.
- Home time.

456
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,452
- Harnesses?
- Harnesses.

457
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,375
Think of the ice-cold
beers waiting for us.

458
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,085
Oh, stop.

459
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,965
- I've got you.
- Okay, slowly.

460
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,093
Okay.
Uh, I'm just getting a stitch here.

461
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,179
Okay, okay.

462
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,114
Okay.

463
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,590
Hunter!

464
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,656
Oh, my god! Oh, my god, holy shit.

465
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,619
- Don't let go.
- Yeah, I got you.

466
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,747
Hunter!

467
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,882
Oh, god, please don't drop me.

468
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,761
Don't drop me.

469
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,317
Becks?

470
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,990
I've got you, becks.

471
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,245
I can see the ladder.

472
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,969
I've got you.

473
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,893
I just died almost.

474
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,731
Oh, my god.

475
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,192
Did that really just happen?

476
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,486
- Oh, my...
- Jesus Christ!

477
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,530
I wish we'd filmed that.

478
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,657
Oh, you're here.

479
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,576
Let's get back on the ground
before I actually pee myself.

480
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:55,954
Okay, take two.

481
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,882
Oh, no.

482
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,802
The ladder. It's gone.

483
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,613
Hunter, how do we get down?

484
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,199
- Shit!
- Please tell me there's a way to go down.

485
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,522
There's nothing on the pole
I can get a good foothold on.

486
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,328
- No.
- Oh, no.

487
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,663
No, no, no.

488
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,165
Um, there must be something.

489
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,962
No. Shit. I don't have a signal.

490
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:49,966
I don't get it, either.

491
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,654
I'm sure there's something,
I'm sure it's just really spotty up here.

492
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,930
No, we're too freaking high.
There's no signal up here.

493
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,015
We're gonna be okay.

494
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,978
Freaking out is not gonna help anything
right now, so just take a breath.

495
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,312
We're stuck on a pizza-sized platform
in the middle of nowhere, hunter.

496
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,773
Becky, freaking out
is not gonna help anything.

497
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,025
It's not gonna help, okay?

498
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,653
It's okay.

499
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,531
- I'm sure we can...
- Wait, hunter. Hunter, hunter.

500
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,741
Look at this.

501
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,617
Oh, my god.

502
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,412
- Binoculars. Amazing.
- Okay.

503
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,663
We have a flare.

504
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:21,956
Okay.

505
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,001
Okay.

506
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,628
- This is great news.
- Okay. Great.

507
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:39,015
Oh, shit, our bag is down there.

508
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,350
Oh, man, our water's in there.

509
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,270
Shit, we're gonna die of thirst.

510
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,980
- No. No.
- We don't have water.

511
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,250
- No, think about it...
- That's how you die when you're stranded.

512
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,651
The noise! The noise that this thing
made when it crashed,

513
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,988
there is no way nobody heard that. Okay?

514
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:58,034
I'm-I'm sure that there are, like,
multiple calls to 911 as we speak.

515
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:02,163
- Do you really think so?
- Yeah.

516
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,833
Yeah, the cavalry is coming, okay?
We just... we just have to wait.

517
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,794
Okay. Okay.

518
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,464
Holy...

519
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,775
- What? What?
- Becky, your leg.

520
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:15,760
My god.

521
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,512
What the hell?

522
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,138
I didn't even notice this.

523
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,432
Whoa!

524
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,558
- Um, whoa!
- Come here.

525
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:24,185
- Let's compress it.
- Ow!

526
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,580
- Are you okay? I know.
- It really hurts. Can you just like...

527
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,898
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay.
- Can you warn me?

528
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,691
- Count of three?
- Yeah. One...

529
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,694
Two... sorry. I'm really sorry.

530
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,071
- I know.
- Oh, man.

531
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,031
Are you okay?

532
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,117
Yeah, I know I'm like,
I'm okay. It's like...

533
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:46,290
I really have to pee.

534
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,750
Just go.

535
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,336
- Just pee.
- No, it's fine. I can hold it.

536
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,421
I just need to get comfortable.

537
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:04,642
Can you go any farther?
It's, like, spraying.

538
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,644
- Okay, careful over the ledge.
- I'm trying.

539
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,646
Stop looking at me.

540
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,566
Oh, god. That's a relief.

541
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,985
I'm just grateful you didn't need to shit.

542
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,572
Okay, well, we should find
a way to get comfortable,

543
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,615
'cause I think we're gonna
be up here for a while.

544
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,702
All right.

545
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,083
All right!

546
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,674
Do you really think someone's coming?

547
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,511
One million percent.

548
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:24,347
Hey, danger d, what's happening, guys?

549
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,225
I'll tell you what's happenin', Becky c.

550
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:32,021
We are stuck at the top
of a 2, 000-foot tower with no way down.

551
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:35,107
And I shot some of the best
goddamn footage of my life.

552
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,484
And no way to upload it.

553
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,445
That's what worrying you
about the situation?

554
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,738
It's quite ironic.

555
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,449
Well, don't worry,
you'll still be famous if you fall,

556
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:47,536
as the girl who died taking a selfie.
Now, that is ironic.

557
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:52,166
I would like to be remembered for my life,
not my death, thank you very much.

558
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,918
Hashtag, life over death.

559
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,337
Hashtag, Becky's a dick hole.

560
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,507
Hashtag, hunter says she's doing
this YouTube thing for the money,

561
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,134
but really I think
she's just like a "like" whore.

562
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:05,346
- It's not like that.
- Okay, what is it like, then?

563
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,766
Come on, show us who you are.
Show us Shiloh hunter.

564
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,686
Tell us why you vlog.

565
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:17,066
Okay, firstly, you're an asshole.

566
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,113
Secondly,

567
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,531
um... ahem...

568
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,494
And this is gonna sound stupid...

569
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,540
But I do this because of Dan.

570
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,547
What happened, it...

571
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,049
It just made me realize
that life is fleeting.

572
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,640
And I want to spread that message,
that life is short, too short.

573
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,810
So, you gotta use every moment.

574
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:56,897
You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.

575
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,076
That was amazing.

576
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,247
Wow, I mean, I told you,
you should just be yourself.

577
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,750
That was really great.

578
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,673
- Should I kill danger d?
- Mm-hmm.

579
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,092
I'll help you Bury the body.

580
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,818
Oh, shit.

581
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,071
There's like an old rv thing down there.

582
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:48,157
- Can I see?
- Just past the gate, a little over.

583
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,662
Yeah. That looks abandoned.

584
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:59,502
It's been five hours. If anyone
called 911, they'd be here by now.

585
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:19,730
Oh, my god. Holy shit.

586
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,900
Hold on, Becky,
we don't get service up here,

587
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,861
but we definitely did down there.
Remember I got all those likes?

588
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,905
Shit.

589
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:28,989
Okay.

590
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,200
Okay, so we don't know
at what point we lost service.

591
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,369
Maybe it was just up here
because of some, like,

592
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,454
- interference with the broadcast antenna.
- Yeah.

593
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,623
I think you're definitely
onto something, hunter.

594
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,375
Okay, we have 50 feet of rope.

595
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,127
We can try to fish for coverage.

596
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,462
I just need something to secure this with.

597
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:45,714
- My hair tie.
- Yeah, perfect.

598
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:46,798
Okay.

599
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:50,302
Okay. Can you message
emergency services?

600
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:53,139
I don't think so. But I have
over 60,000 followers.

601
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:55,349
- Okay.
- "Help us."

602
00:48:55,433 --> 00:49:01,355
Stuck on 8-67 tower. Call 911

603
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,898
it's ready to post.

604
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:05,151
We should hear it when it sends.

605
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,075
Come on, come on.

606
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,412
Okay. Okay.

607
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,126
Let me see if I can get lower.

608
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,005
Just be careful.

609
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,300
Got it, okay. Come on.

610
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,098
That's the end.

611
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:38,392
- I didn't hear anything.
- I didn't, either.

612
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,060
I don't think it posted.

613
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:46,192
Okay, maybe I can get lower.

614
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,735
What? What do you mean? Just...

615
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,153
I've got it. I've got an idea.

616
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,954
- Careful, hunter.
- Feels solid.

617
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,000
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

618
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,341
Okay.

619
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,302
- Oh, my god. Careful.
- Shit. Shit.

620
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,887
Oh, my god, hunter.

621
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,015
- Are you okay? Oh, my god.
- Yeah. Yeah.

622
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,603
Careful. Shit.

623
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,446
I don't hear anything. Nothing.

624
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,657
Okay, you need to come back up.

625
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,827
Shit.

626
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:47,795
I got it.

627
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:01,809
- Did it post?
- No.

628
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,646
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.

629
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,526
Wait, hold on.

630
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,695
We know there's a signal
at the base for sure.

631
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,905
- Yeah.
- What if we just drop the phone?

632
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:17,469
Okay, but what if my phone
just shatters into a million pieces?

633
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:20,578
Not if we reinforce it somehow,
so it doesn't like the egg drop challenge.

634
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,413
Yeah. Okay, shit.

635
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,457
Um, we just need something to...
To put it in.

636
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,085
- Yeah.
- This.

637
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:31,422
It's welded on. My shoe's too flimsy.

638
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,382
- Your shoe?
- Yeah, perfect.

639
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:35,926
Okay, got it.

640
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:42,975
We need some padding.
Can we use your sock?

641
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,893
Yeah. Okay.

642
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,354
Okay.

643
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:52,276
We still need something more substantial.

644
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:56,614
Oh, hunter.
Your push-up bra.

645
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,949
- That is more substantial.
- Yeah.

646
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,951
Dying to get this thing off, anyway.

647
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,663
Thank you, vs.

648
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:07,415
Okay.

649
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:09,585
Hope it's strong enough.

650
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,961
Shove it real good.

651
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:15,924
Okay.

652
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,720
Here goes nothing.

653
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:37,302
- Did it work?
- I don't know. I can't tell.

654
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:55,673
- Do you see anything?
- No, nothing.

655
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,968
Don't worry. They're coming.

656
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:10,020
Holy shit! There's a freaking guy!

657
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,398
- What?
- Oh, my god. Yes.

658
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,691
And a dog, too.

659
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,778
- Hey! Up here!
- Hey, help us!

660
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,617
Look, I sent you the check, man. Come on.

661
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,120
I need that...

662
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,038
- Hey!
- Hey, boy! Big boy!

663
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:34,503
Parker.

664
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,840
Come! Come on, boy.

665
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,299
No, no, no, no, no.

666
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,593
Shit!

667
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,432
Hey!

668
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:47,558
Let's go.

669
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,824
Goddamn it, they're getting away.

670
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,537
Parker.

671
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,664
He got the shoe.

672
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:13,500
- Hey! Up here!
- Look up here. Please!

673
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,218
- Hey!
- Hey!

674
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:24,302
- He's walking!
- Hey!

675
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,312
- No, no, no, turn around!
- Turn around!

676
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,563
Right here!

677
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,234
- Shit! Shit!
- Hey!

678
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,907
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
Do not fire the flare, he's not looking.

679
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,658
This might be our only chance.

680
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:48,744
No, no, no, he's not looking.

681
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,789
Wait.

682
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,415
Hold on. There's somebody by the rv.

683
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:56,794
- He's setting up a grill or some shit.
- Okay.

684
00:54:56,877 --> 00:55:00,589
And we'll fire the flare when the sun goes
down in like... in like an hour.

685
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,952
We've only got one shot at this.

686
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,178
- Oh, damn.
- What?

687
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,806
- They're making ribs.
- Oh, no.

688
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,558
- And they have really cold beer.
- Don't.

689
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,118
These guys are definitely a couple.

690
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:33,372
Dirty weekend away.

691
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,456
I'm jealous.

692
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,476
Hey, hey, hey. They're finishing up.

693
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,311
It's now or never, fire the flare.

694
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,480
- Is it dark enough?
- Uh-huh.

695
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:00,816
Okay.

696
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,150
- Shit.
- Shit. What the hell?

697
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:03,819
- Why isn't it firing?
- I fired it.

698
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,547
I cocked it, maybe
there's a safety or something?

699
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:08,299
Shit. Okay, they're going in, they're
going in. You have to do the flare now.

700
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,717
- I'm trying. It's stuck.
- Get it to go.

701
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:10,868
Okay, I got it. I got it.

702
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,585
Hey, Randy,
come check this shit out.

703
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,837
- Okay, give me your phone.
- Okay.

704
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,800
Hey, sons of bitches, up here!

705
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,886
Holy shit! Check this out.

706
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,221
Up here! Hey!

707
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:32,782
Wait, wait, wait,
they're looking at us.

708
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:33,807
- What?
- They can see us.

709
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,017
Oh, my god!

710
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,310
Holy shit! Oh, my god,

711
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,812
let me see, let me see, let me see.

712
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,439
Oh, my god, they're coming.

713
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:42,774
Hey!

714
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,650
Holy shit, they found the car.
They found our car, they found our car.

715
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,245
They have a... a crowbar.
They're probably gonna open the gate.

716
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:57,956
- Okay.
- Okay.

717
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,542
- Wait, what the hell?
- Wait, what's going on?

718
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,544
- They stopped.
- What?

719
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,922
Quit chatting, go open the freakin' gate.

720
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,758
No. No, no, no. What the hell?

721
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,010
- They're stealing my freakin' car!
- What?

722
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,262
- No, you sons of bitches!
- Hey!

723
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:14,389
You asshole! What the hell?

724
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:16,475
No! I need to see it!

725
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:22,105
- Oh, my god. No, no!
- Die, you freakin' assholes!

726
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,534
Okay. New rule.

727
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,121
If somebody falls off the tower,

728
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:22,958
they bring the cell phone with them,
and call for help on the way down.

729
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,504
And maybe post that video.

730
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,466
Kidding-ish.

731
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:38,724
Yeah, my leg. I could eat aspirin
like skittles right now.

732
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,562
It's looking a little funky.

733
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,439
Could use some washing, here.

734
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,535
I'm sorry.

735
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,047
We'll just keep it wrapped up.

736
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,551
What's wrong?

737
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,098
Dan could never say the words,
"I love you."

738
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,020
1-4-3.

739
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,318
1-4-3.

740
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,867
- Becky, I...
- How long?

741
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,414
Four months.

742
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,046
It was a huge mistake.

743
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:55,759
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

744
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,345
For sleeping with my husband
or me finding out about it?

745
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,972
For falling in love with the same guy.

746
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:33,880
Who made the move?

747
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,883
- Both super drunk.
- Who?

748
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,263
He did.

749
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:47,269
But it was a huge, huge mistake, becks.

750
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:51,231
No.

751
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,068
A mistake is a kiss, a one-night stand.

752
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,780
You said you loved him, so...

753
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,535
It got out of hand.

754
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:08,874
I tried so hard not to,
but I fell for him. I mean...

755
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:10,709
He listened to me, he was...

756
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:15,463
He was just different than every
other douche bag that I'd ever dated and...

757
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,676
And I'd never felt that way before.

758
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,489
And then you asked me to be
your maid of honor

759
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,683
and it all hit me like a ton of bricks,
how messed up this all was.

760
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,770
I loved him, but...

761
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:35,317
But I love you more, so I ended it.

762
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:42,032
It was just so hard
seeing you guys together.

763
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,410
And after Dan died, I...

764
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:49,748
I just didn't have the strength
to be there for you,

765
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:52,125
to be strong enough for you, so...

766
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,961
So, I ran away.

767
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,548
And now you hate me and I don't blame you,

768
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:01,176
and now we're stuck on this stupid,
freaking tower

769
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,886
in the middle of freaking nowhere.

770
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,889
And it's all my fault.

771
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:10,435
I am so, so sorry.

772
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:25,802
What's that?

773
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:29,639
I set it when we dropped
the phone down yesterday.

774
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:33,852
It's been 24 hours.

775
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:40,317
I think it's time to accept that either
your 60,000 followers don't give a shit

776
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,819
or your phone's down there
in a million pieces.

777
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,280
Okay.

778
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:49,576
Well, we've got one more shot. Your phone.

779
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,537
Yeah, no padding this time, though.
Even less of a chance.

780
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,498
And if this fails
we really don't have any hope.

781
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,795
How long till we die of thirst?

782
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:05,550
It's just killing me that our water
is just right down there in that bag.

783
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,803
Yeah, with the drone.

784
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,389
We could've used that to get help.

785
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:15,310
We could have flown it back to our motel
with a good old fashioned note.

786
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,567
Wait, maybe I can get it.

787
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:26,863
What do you mean?
You said it was too smooth. No footholds.

788
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,706
Yeah, but when I hung
my cell down yesterday,

789
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,992
I think the rope
was long enough to reach it.

790
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,789
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

791
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,209
Yeah, I seriously think I can get it.

792
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,011
Hunter, I don't think this is a good idea.

793
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:52,806
Becky, I don't think we have a choice.

794
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,933
Every hour that passes, the weaker we get.

795
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,563
Besides...

796
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,566
Maybe you'll get lucky and I'll fall.

797
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:15,620
Hunter.

798
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,417
Be careful.

799
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:24,963
I'm sorry, becks.

800
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:27,424
I love you.

801
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,603
Okay.

802
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:52,782
Are you okay?

803
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:53,867
Yeah.

804
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,578
Yeah, all good.

805
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,128
Okay.

806
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:13,428
Okay.

807
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:22,437
Hunter, careful.

808
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,690
Shit.

809
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,902
I can't quite reach it.

810
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,905
- Come back up. We'll attach it lower.
- Come on.

811
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,907
Shit.

812
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,204
I think I can drop myself lower.

813
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:41,080
What?

814
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,583
What the hell are you doing, hunter?

815
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:45,960
Hunter!

816
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:54,927
Shit.

817
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:05,355
- I think I can swing to it.
- Hunter, no!

818
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,690
Hunter! Come back up!

819
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,025
Hunter, no!

820
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,485
Hunter!

821
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,159
Are you okay?

822
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,121
Yeah.

823
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,169
Is there a way down?

824
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:31,422
No. The ladder ripped all the way off.

825
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,191
- Oh, my god.
- Wait, hunter.

826
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:52,485
How are you gonna get back on the rope?

827
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:57,614
Uh.

828
01:07:58,449 --> 01:07:59,826
Shit.

829
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,663
Can... can you reach it?

830
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:16,801
<i>♪ Humpty dumpty sat on the wall ♪</i>

831
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:19,053
oh, my god.

832
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:22,348
<i>♪ Humpty dumpty had a big fall... ♪</i>

833
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:35,862
Shit.

834
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:42,452
- You okay?
- Yeah.

835
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,245
I have an idea.

836
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:54,797
Okay.

837
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:57,592
I'm gonna try to hook it on with this,

838
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,345
and then we're gonna
work together to pull me up.

839
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:02,764
- Okay?
- That's amazing.

840
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,391
That's some good MacGyver shit
right there.

841
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:35,672
Oh, come on. Please. Come on.

842
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,927
- You did it!
- Okay.

843
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:44,597
Okay. I'm gonna jump onto this.

844
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,766
I'm gonna need your help to pull me up.

845
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,184
- Okay.
- Get ready, becks.

846
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,268
- Okay.
- Okay.

847
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,146
Okay.

848
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:58,319
Okay, come on, come on.
Come on, you can do it.

849
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:08,496
Shit.

850
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:10,915
Hunter, are you okay? You okay?

851
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:16,170
Okay. I'm okay.

852
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,214
Let's do this fast and quick, Becky.

853
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,757
Work together to pull me up.

854
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:23,177
- Okay.
- I climb, you pull.

855
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:27,306
Okay? Okay, now!

856
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:59,422
I can almost reach the ladder.

857
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:05,011
Almost there, becks.

858
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,394
Okay.

859
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:47,220
Becky! I landed on the bag!

860
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,347
Oh, my god... are you okay?

861
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:53,017
I hurt my hands, real bad.
I don't think I can climb.

862
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,977
You're gonna have to pull me up, okay?

863
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:56,312
Okay. Okay.

864
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:01,359
I got you.

865
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:43,025
Oh, shit.

866
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:45,194
Oh, no. Are you okay?

867
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:47,822
Shit. I thought you died there.

868
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:50,533
I'm not going anywhere, becks.

869
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,159
Yeah, that was scary.

870
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,837
- We should ration it.
- Okay. You're right.

871
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:06,424
Is there any food in there?

872
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,509
No, it's just your cherry lip balm.

873
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,678
I don't think you can eat that.

874
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:14,765
Okay, it's getting dark.
I think it's now or never on that drone.

875
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:19,020
I guess we need to...
We need to write a note.

876
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:22,148
Okay, the receipt from the diner.

877
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:25,735
- A pen... do you have a pen?
- Eyeliner in here.

878
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:28,138
Aren't you glad I brought up makeup now?

879
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,741
"Help."

880
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:36,996
Stuck on top of 8-67 tower.
Call 911

881
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:40,249
yeah, perfect.

882
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,589
Okay. See that?

883
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,175
That's the road
where we almost got wiped out.

884
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,636
It leads to the motel.

885
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:53,721
Let's do this while we still have light.

886
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,684
Okay.

887
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:03,689
Okay, just keep it straight
and follow the line of the road.

888
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,775
- Let it drift down as it goes.
- Okay.

889
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,332
Okay.

890
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:23,334
Okay, we're almost past the gate.

891
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,853
Oh, my god.

892
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,521
- No, no, no. The battery.
- What?

893
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,547
- It's running out of juice.
- Oh, shit.

894
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:31,175
Hit retrieve. Or has it gone too far?

895
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:33,135
- Is it gonna make it?
- There's no chance!

896
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:34,939
- Are you sure?
- It's not even at the gate.

897
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:36,263
Shit. It's dropping.

898
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:37,616
- Hit retrieve, hit retrieve...
- Hunter.

899
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,683
- Hit retrieve.
- Okay.

900
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:41,577
- It's coming back.
- Fly it up.

901
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:43,202
Give it the best shot to get back to us.

902
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,231
Come on, just get it
higher, higher, higher.

903
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,818
- Just get it higher!
- I'm trying.

904
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:52,530
- We'll grab it when it gets close.
- Okay.

905
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,868
Okay. We've got this.

906
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:00,746
Get it, becks, get it.

907
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,127
Nice! Good job.

908
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,600
We have a charger,
but we don't have any power.

909
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:24,770
Maybe just turn it off and once it's
rested, it will have more juice.

910
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:27,398
It's never gonna be enough. Hunter.

911
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,576
What are we gonna do?

912
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:40,995
Hey, we're not gonna panic.

913
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,497
We're gonna stay calm.

914
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:46,417
We're gonna figure it out, okay?
There's gotta be a way.

915
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:53,299
- Are we gonna die?
- No.

916
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,885
No, we're gonna be okay.

917
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:26,832
Hunter. Hunter...

918
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,418
Where are you? Hunter...

919
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:37,842
Hunter...

920
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,347
Hunter, where are you?

921
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,520
Hunter. Hunter!

922
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:51,709
Becky, it's okay.

923
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,670
You just had a bad dream.

924
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:59,967
You're nice and safe,
2,000 feet up in the middle of nowhere.

925
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,895
I have an idea.

926
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,521
How to charge the drone.

927
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,774
Your dumb life hack.

928
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:18,944
Becky, you freakin' genius.

929
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:28,621
I think it's light enough now.
Let's do it.

930
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:51,352
Okay, it's a standard bulb fitting,
but it's gonna be hot.

931
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,562
It's 30 feet
but it's gonna feel like 1,000.

932
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,485
- Is your leg okay?
- Yeah.

933
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:02,863
It smells, but it doesn't hurt
anymore. It's fine.

934
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,324
Okay.

935
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,164
You can do this.

936
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:20,965
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

937
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,595
Keep going, Becky.

938
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:32,142
You got this, Becky.

939
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,823
- I can't.
- It's okay, it's okay.

940
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:47,700
I can't.

941
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,159
You can do it, Becky.

942
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:50,786
You got it.

943
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:58,419
It's okay. It's just like pole dancing.

944
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:01,213
Um... okay, "cherry pie."

945
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:04,049
<i>♪ She's my cherry pie ♪</i>

946
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:07,136

01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:13,517

949
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,185

955
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:29,283
yes!

956
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:36,623
You did it, my little cherry pie.

957
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:37,708
Good job!

958
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,254
- Okay.
- Yeah!

959
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:45,466
You did it, cherry pie!

960
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,926
All right. All right.

961
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:51,013
- Okay. Okay.
- Remember, it's hot.

962
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:54,558
Be careful.

963
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:15,579
Okay, just think back to the diner.

964
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,915
You're gonna want to line
the prongs of the charger

965
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:20,542
with the elements of the bulb socket.

966
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:27,716
I don't think it's long enough.

967
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,593
I think the back prong doesn't reach.

968
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:34,348
Okay, you're gonna need something small
and metal to carry the current, like a...

969
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:37,726
Like a screw or something
that you can jam in there.

970
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:40,354
- There isn't anything.
- Jesus. Um...

971
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:11,885
It's working! It's freaking working!

972
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:13,929
Holy shit, my hero!

973
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:16,598
Okay, we're gonna need a full charge.

974
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:19,268
I don't know. It just has four lights.

975
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:22,813
Okay, we have to charge it all the way.
Give ourselves the best shot.

976
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:24,731
You gonna be okay?

977
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:27,151
Yeah. I got this.

978
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,933
You okay?

979
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:02,686
Hang in there, becks.

980
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:05,606
Past halfway.

981
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:29,630
Get off of me!

982
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:39,348
It's okay, it's okay, Becky.
You've got it.

983
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:41,600
Three lights.

984
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:48,732
Come on, Becky, you're so close.

985
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:57,699
Get the hell away from me!

986
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:04,873
You did it!

987
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:12,881
Jesus, I'm so proud of you.

988
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,595
- Why didn't you catch the bag?
- Uh...

989
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:21,098
Babe, you okay?

990
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:31,191
We need to fly that thing
when the motel is the busiest.

991
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:33,318
Checkout, 10:00 am.

992
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:35,904
Just a couple of hours.

993
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:07,728
You know, he was right about Dan.
He was just trying to help me and...

994
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:12,941
And I was so horrible to him.

995
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,363
If there was anyone
I could text, it would be him.

996
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:21,158
Just to say...

997
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:22,826
I'm so sorry.

998
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:26,830
I love him.

999
01:25:33,337 --> 01:25:36,214
I'm tapping out here.

1000
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:39,968
Stay with me.
Try to keep your mind occupied.

1001
01:25:41,053 --> 01:25:43,680
Tell me something, something that...

1002
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:45,766
That you and your dad used to do together.

1003
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:51,355
We would watch wrestling.

1004
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:55,609
- Wwe.
- Yeah.

1005
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:57,694
I forgot you guys were into that.

1006
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:01,490
Yeah. It was our thing, you know?

1007
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:06,244
He was always said I'd be world champion
with my fighting spirit.

1008
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:11,124
I always felt so close to him
when we would watch it.

1009
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:16,630
Name some of your favorite wrestlers.

1010
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:22,427
Uh, "stone cold" Steve Austin.

1011
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,389
The rock.

1012
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:30,060
What was cactus Jack's name
when he was wearing the mask?

1013
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:31,353
Mankind.

1014
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:34,356
Mankind.

1015
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:38,235
Wait, I thought you said
you didn't watch it.

1016
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:39,986
I didn't.

1017
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:42,072
Keep going, you need to stay awake.

1018
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:45,909
Batista.

1019
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,625
Okay. It's checkout time.

1020
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:58,880
Okay, here it goes.

1021
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:09,266
Just keep that shit straight.
Follow the line of the road.

1022
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:16,022
Come on, you son of a...

1023
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:26,074
I'm past the point of no return,
so how's the battery?

1024
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:27,409
Should I retrieve?

1025
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:29,703
No, keep going.

1026
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:35,167
Come on, come on, just follow the road.

1027
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:42,966
Oh, shit.

1028
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:51,057
It's gonna work.

1029
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:01,067
Oh, god.

1030
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:06,448
No.

1031
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:11,995
Screw your truck.
Get the drone! Get it!

1032
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:19,795
No, no, no, no!

1033
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:22,756
Go back! Go back.

1034
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:26,301
No, no, no. Go back!

1035
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:27,594
Go back!

1036
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:34,434
Fuck, no!

1037
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:25,026
Is that a storm?

1038
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,197
It's kind of beautiful from up here.

1039
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:37,706
I can't survive another night.

1040
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:40,000
Becky, don't talk like that.

1041
01:29:43,086 --> 01:29:44,504
I just...

1042
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:47,966
- I just wanna sleep.
- You can't sleep.

1043
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:50,552
The vultures, they can smell your leg.

1044
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:53,263
They're waiting for you
to give up so they can attack.

1045
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:58,685
Survival of the fittest.

1046
01:29:59,686 --> 01:30:01,646
You need energy.

1047
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,648
We should eat something.

1048
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:09,154
What? We're 2,000 feet up
in the middle of the desert.

1049
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:12,657
- There's no food up here.
- There's always something.

1050
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:17,704
It's hopeless.

1051
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:24,044
Let's send another message.

1052
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:26,296
We can pad the cell better this time.

1053
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:28,632
- With what?
- Give me your shoe.

1054
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:31,426
- I can't.
- Why?

1055
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:34,137
- It's not up here, is it?
- What?

1056
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:38,224
It's down there.

1057
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:42,520
It's on your foot.

1058
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:47,776
I'm...

1059
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:51,738
Down there, remember?

1060
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:58,703
I fell.

1061
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:04,709
You can't have the shoe,

1062
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:06,878
because I didn't catch the bag.

1063
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:09,798
I bled out.

1064
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:30,902
You didn't really think your scrawny ass
could pull me up, did you?

1065
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,292
You pulled the bag up.

1066
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:57,137
I guess you were just too afraid

1067
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:59,639
to realize that you were up here...

1068
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,059
All alone.

1069
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:19,969
Hi, dad.

1070
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:24,099
I wanted you to know that I...

1071
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:27,143
I found my fight again.

1072
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:32,440
Please leave your message...

1073
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,568
I wanna live.

1074
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:38,696
I wanna go home...

1075
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:44,285
But I'm not gonna make it.

1076
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:52,127
You were right about everything and I...

1077
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:55,630
I'm sorry, dad.

1078
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:05,682
By the time you see this...

1079
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:06,891
I'll be gone.

1080
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:16,776
[Love you.

1081
01:35:52,789 --> 01:35:55,625
That's it! Fuck!

1082
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:21,442
You need energy.

1083
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:23,987
You should eat something.

1084
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:30,118
Survival of the fittest.

1085
01:37:06,612 --> 01:37:10,241
I can pad the cell better this time.

1086
01:37:10,325 --> 01:37:11,826
Give me your shoe.

1087
01:38:30,696 --> 01:38:31,739
Hunter.

1088
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,588
God, I love you.

1089
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:22,540
I'm sorry.

1090
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:26,169
I'm so sorry, but I really have
to make sure this gets through.

1091
01:39:26,252 --> 01:39:28,087
God, god, I'm sorry.

1092
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:48,709
You can't park here.

1093
01:40:48,793 --> 01:40:51,337
Becky! Becky!

1094
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:06,352
Dad?

1095
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:07,435
Dad?

1096
01:41:08,938 --> 01:41:10,273
Dad!

1097
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,823
I thought that was you.

1098
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:22,743
Dad, I love you. I'm so sorry.

1099
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:25,413
It's okay.

1100
01:41:27,873 --> 01:41:30,585
I just... I just want you to be okay.

1101
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,592
I am, you know? I'm gonna be okay.

1102
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:40,011
Really.

1103
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:57,153
Let's go home.

1104
01:41:59,739 --> 01:42:02,033
Life is fleeting.

1105
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:04,368
Life is short.

1106
01:42:05,911 --> 01:42:09,206
So, you gotta use every moment.

1107
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:12,460
You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.

1108
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,462
And that shit?

1109
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:18,758
That would spread that message
far and wide.
