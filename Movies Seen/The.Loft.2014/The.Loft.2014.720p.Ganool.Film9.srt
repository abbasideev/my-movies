1
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:58,338
I swear to God
I had nothing to do with this.

2
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:00,867
We would love to believe you,
Mr. Stevens, but you have to admit

3
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:03,660
your version of events does sound
pretty bizarre, don't you think?

4
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,089
Look. It was a setup, okay?
The whole thing was staged.

5
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:10,261
So you were framed. That's your claim?
You were the victim.

6
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:13,067
Well, I mean, you know,
not... not like...

7
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:16,808
Not like who? Not like her?

8
00:02:17,108 --> 00:02:19,596
Please, just talk to the other guys.
Have you talked to the others yet?

9
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:20,841
We're doing our jobs.

10
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,979
So why don't you just do yourself
a favor and confess?

11
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,659
You know, save some time,
save some legal fees. Come on.

12
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,398
Why don't you take us through
the events of this morning?

13
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:30,502
- Again?
- Again, Mr. Stevens.

14
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:11,022
Where were you this morning,
Mr. Stevens?

15
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:14,629
I was at home, alone.
My wife's taken the kids skiing.

16
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,033
Actually your wife's on her way back,
as we speak.

17
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:20,707
Apparently, she has...
quite a few questions of her own.

18
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:23,078
So the phone woke you around
what time this morning?

19
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:27,861
I don't know. 9:00, 9:30. It was Luke
in a panic. He said I had to come.

20
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,090
Where were you supposed to go?

21
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:31,094
To the loft. He told me
to come to the loft.

22
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:33,295
- Did he say why he was panicking?
- No.

23
00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:37,725
- Did you know why he was panicking?
- No, not yet.

24
00:05:53,406 --> 00:05:54,442
Luke.

25
00:05:57,814 --> 00:05:59,684
Luke?

26
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,472
Oh, my God.

27
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:22,498
Oh, fuck.

28
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:29,244
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.

29
00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:33,987
- What do you mean? You just... What...
- I walked in, she was lying there.

30
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:36,424
Oh, fuck.

31
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:41,568
- Have you called the others?
- Chris and Marty are on their way.

32
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,406
I... I still haven't reached Philip.

33
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:46,478
Okay, well, keep calling.
We need everybody here.

34
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,417
Do you know who she is?

35
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:52,034
Vincent, do you know who's lying there?

36
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:56,031
What? No, of course not.

37
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:59,270
How the fuck did they get in?
Was it a window, a door or...

38
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,178
Windows are sealed, the door was locked,
and the alarm was turned off.

39
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:05,349
- That's impossible.
- I'm telling you, the door was locked.

40
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,186
And the alarm was turned off.

41
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:11,997
- But that would mean that...
- Someone got in with one of our keys.

42
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:19,477
Do you know the loft building at the corner
of Second and South Hope, Mr. Seacord?

43
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:22,150
- No.
- The new residential one by the Sports Arena?

44
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,721
Designed, I believe,
by your good friend Vincent Stevens.

45
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:27,871
Vincent runs a very large firm.
He's done a lot of buildings.

46
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:30,833
There's a loft on the ninth floor,
Mr. Seacord. Have you ever been there?

47
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,170
No.

48
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,908
Strange, because according
to our information,

49
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:39,350
you and four friends are sharing this loft
secretly, without your wives' knowledge.

50
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,053
That is ridiculous.

51
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:43,258
Don't the five of you
bring women up there?

52
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:46,798
Girlfriends, mistresses,
one-night stands, catch of the day.

53
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,339
Five pals just looking
for privacy and fun

54
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,212
without the hassle of Visa statements
and hotel bills the missus might find.

55
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:56,541
- That is preposterous.
- Maybe, Mr. Seacord,

56
00:07:56,641 --> 00:08:01,042
but one of your friends already made
a full confession. You want to know who?

57
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:04,183
Listen, I don't do things
like that. You know?

58
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,170
Fool around with other women. I...

59
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,677
- You love your wife.
- I love my wife, yes.

60
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:12,716
What happened to your face, Mr. Seacord?

61
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:14,788
- I walked into a door.
- Or were you in a fight?

62
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:17,593
- I said I walked into a door.
- Where were you this morning?

63
00:08:17,693 --> 00:08:20,231
Out with Chris, having breakfast.

64
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:22,202
There will be a lot of people
in the restaurant to verify that.

65
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,674
By Chris, you mean
Dr. Chris Vanowen, the psychiatrist?

66
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:26,745
- That's right.
- One of your loft buddies?

67
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:28,567
Chris is married. He's got two kids.

68
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:32,455
And he's not a guy
who cheats on his wife either.

69
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:38,434
I got a serious fuckin' problem, Chris.

70
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,973
Oh, shit.

71
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,378
Philip.

72
00:09:00,478 --> 00:09:04,186
Philip? You think your brother
has something to do with this?

73
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:06,991
I don't know. We gotta call the cops.

74
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:10,047
You realize what'll happen if we call
the cops? Think about our wives.

75
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:13,405
- There's a dead woman here, Vincent.
- Why do we think Philip is involved?

76
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:15,374
Look, Chris,
you know what he's capable of.

77
00:09:15,474 --> 00:09:17,446
Yeah, I know.

78
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:21,088
Maybe we can help him, okay? If we can
just figure out what the fuck happened,

79
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:23,257
- maybe we could...
- We gonna dump the body somewhere?

80
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:27,198
Look, I don't fucking know,
but I'm not taking the fall for this!

81
00:09:36,383 --> 00:09:39,389
- Marty.
- Son of a bitch.

82
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:43,797
Have you seen Phil? Do you know
where he is? Was he here last night?

83
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:45,183
This can't be real.

84
00:09:49,543 --> 00:09:51,814
No. Wait, what are you doing?

85
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:54,520
I want to see her.

86
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:04,314
Just put her back.

87
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:07,029
- Goddamn it.
- Who is she?

88
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,381
I don't know.

89
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:11,186
Look, none of us has anything
to do with this, right?

90
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:14,025
Right?

91
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,465
We're gonna find out what happened here,
and we will figure a way out.

92
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:20,538
We're in this together.
We'll get out of it together. Okay?

93
00:10:20,738 --> 00:10:24,346
'Cause we're friends. Agreed?

94
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:26,424
Agreed?

95
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:41,447
Well, it looks like
they'll let anybody in, right?

96
00:10:41,747 --> 00:10:43,416
- Congratulations, man.
- Thanks.

97
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,289
- This one's really spectacular, very special.
- I appreciate that.

98
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:48,193
Ally, it's been too long.
You look terrific.

99
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:49,470
Thank you.

100
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,905
- So, what do you think?
- Well, it's bold and focused, as always.

101
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:55,975
- I like it.
- Great. You made it.

102
00:10:56,075 --> 00:10:57,511
- Hi.
- Hi.

103
00:10:57,612 --> 00:11:00,651
- Hi, Barbara. How are you?
- Want to buy yourselves a little condo?

104
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:02,956
I think Vincent's little condos
are a little out of our league.

105
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:05,595
Right. You and your puny
psychiatrist's salary.

106
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:07,999
You guys grab a drink
and we'll catch up with you later.

107
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:10,905
- All right. Congrats, bud.
- Thanks, man.

108
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:15,682
- One hour tops, and then we're out of here.
- Come on, hon. We just got here.

109
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:19,488
Man, check out all these babes. So hot!

110
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:21,626
It's like they're in violation
of the fuckin' fire code.

111
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,568
Marty, calm down. I see them.
I can also see Mimi, your wife.

112
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:30,344
- Okay, save me, help me, protect me.
- What's up, Tubs? Having too much fun?

113
00:11:30,444 --> 00:11:34,384
Nope. Just checkin' out the hipster crowd
with my pal Luke.

114
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:36,824
Yeah, if you embarrass me,
I'll leave you here all by yourself.

115
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:39,695
Oh, don't raise my hopes
only to dash them.

116
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:42,067
Hi, Luke. Where's Ellie?

117
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:45,707
She was just feeling dizzy.
Ducked out to check her blood sugar.

118
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:48,046
Hi, Elle. Do you feel okay?

119
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:52,321
Oh, I started to feel
not so great before, but I'm better now.

120
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,291
We can always go home, sweetie.

121
00:11:54,391 --> 00:11:57,197
Did you hear that? "Sweetie."
After she just checked her blood sugar.

122
00:11:57,297 --> 00:11:59,335
That's funny. That's really good.

123
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:01,639
I would love to see you deal
with something like that if that was me.

124
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:04,211
Oh, you know, baby. I'd love
to stick you in the ass every day.

125
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:07,185
- How many times have I asked? Lots.
- Honey? Not now.

126
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:21,846
- You're the shrink, aren't you?
- Yeah, that's right. Chris Vanowen.

127
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:25,045
Dr. Vanowen. That's right.
Yes, I remember.

128
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:28,393
- Do we know each other?
- No. You knew my sister.

129
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:33,769
She was a patient of yours actually.
Sophie? Sophie Morris?

130
00:12:35,774 --> 00:12:38,112
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

131
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:41,786
Some people are just born unhappy.

132
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:44,141
I'm sorry. Are you buying an apartment?

133
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:48,699
What? No. No, no.
I'm friends with the architect.

134
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,570
Are you?

135
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,910
No. No, I'm here with...
Joel Kotkin, the city councilman.

136
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,782
I work for him
as sort of a personal assistant.

137
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,803
- I'm Anne. Anne Morris.
- Very nice to meet you, Anne.

138
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:05,037
- And listen, about your sister...
- It's okay.

139
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:08,952
You couldn't have saved her. Her mood
disorder kind of runs in the family,

140
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:11,010
unfortunately, so...

141
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:14,652
Well, you're not thinking of doing
something stupid, are you, Anne?

142
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,560
Me? You mean like falling
for the wrong man?

143
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,498
Well, I do that all the time.

144
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:33,574
Everything's all right! Come on.
Keep partying. What are you doing?

145
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:36,656
- Phil, I should've guessed.
- Hey, Vince. What's up?

146
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:40,122
- How are you? Thanks for comin'.
- I'm sorry about this. She slipped.

147
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:42,239
No worries. As long as you're okay.
You all right?

148
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:45,612
She's fine. Let me introduce you to a...

149
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:48,052
colleague who works with me
up the office.

150
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:52,726
And this one works with me
down at the office.

151
00:13:53,362 --> 00:13:55,666
- Or is it the other way around?
- Philip.

152
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:59,173
Oh, my big brother. How you doin', man?

153
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:02,847
- Friends of Vicky's? Bridesmaids?
- Come on, man. I'm still single.

154
00:14:02,948 --> 00:14:05,486
- What are you doing?
- It's not like I don't love my little Vicky.

155
00:14:05,586 --> 00:14:07,390
I love her madly. You know that.
All right?

156
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,414
It's not like I hate
all the other women in the world.

157
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:11,369
All right. Relax.

158
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:14,071
There's something I want to show you.
Let's go get Marty and Luke.

159
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:25,453
Chris.

160
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,907
Gentlemen, welcome to the loft.

161
00:14:33,007 --> 00:14:36,046
Wow. This is impressive, Vince.

162
00:14:36,347 --> 00:14:41,074
Check out the view. Then imagine
this is our own private oasis

163
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:43,262
right in the heart of downtown.

164
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:46,868
- What do you mean?
- A place where no one hassles you.

165
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:50,107
A place you can escape to
any time you want.

166
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:54,604
- So this is your loft?
- No. It's ours. If you want it.

167
00:14:54,704 --> 00:14:56,721
What? Ours?

168
00:14:56,821 --> 00:14:58,325
Think about it.

169
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:02,833
No messy hotel bills.
No questionable credit card activity.

170
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:06,618
This would be our secret place...
to steal away,

171
00:15:06,718 --> 00:15:10,783
discreetly and economically...
in these challenging times.

172
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:13,353
Five-way split.

173
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,624
What do you think?

174
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:17,730
I don't know. I'm not like that.

175
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,538
Come on, Chris. We're men.
We're all a little like that.

176
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:24,212
Yeah, tell me about it. Give me your key
right now. Bring your twins up here,

177
00:15:24,312 --> 00:15:27,259
- give 'em a little private tour.
- You know what they cost, Marty?

178
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,793
How much? I might have it
on me right now. Seriously.

179
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:32,626
Think about it. It's a great investment.

180
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:37,068
A once-in-a-lifetime golden opportunity.

181
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:46,790
- I can't stay here.
- Where are you going?

182
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,974
Luke!

183
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:51,630
You cannot freak out right now.
We have to stay together like we said.

184
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:53,835
All right. Luke, you need
to calm the fuck down.

185
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:56,264
No! No! It's over, Vincent!
It's all gonna come out!

186
00:15:56,364 --> 00:15:58,800
It's not over. Listen.
We're gonna find out what happened here

187
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,172
and we're gonna fix it. Okay?

188
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:05,178
Try Phil again.

189
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:17,716
This is Philip. Please leave a message
after the tone.

190
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:23,655
What if he doesn't show?
He could be out of the country by now.

191
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:24,636
He'll show.

192
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:27,535
We can't cover for him, Chris.
Not this time.

193
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:30,175
Guys? Look at this.

194
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:47,642
What does it mean? What does it mean?

195
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:53,932
You know Latin, Doctor?

196
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:58,129
- Excuse me?
- Latin. Do you know Latin?

197
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:01,670
I took it premed, yeah.

198
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,441
What's it say on the wall there?

199
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:08,216
Fatum nos iungebit.

200
00:17:08,884 --> 00:17:12,986
Yeah, I know. Fatum nos iungebit.

201
00:17:13,393 --> 00:17:16,400
I can read that. What's it mean?

202
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,205
I'm guessing you already know
what it means.

203
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,296
No. We would like to hear you say it.

204
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:25,116
You'd like to hear me say it.
Okay. Fatum nos iungebit.

205
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:28,196
Fate will unite us.

206
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:32,097
Now, all I can possibly think is that
somebody who knows Latin like you

207
00:17:32,197 --> 00:17:36,641
reached over with this young lady's hand
and wrote "Fatum nos iungebit" on the wall.

208
00:17:38,611 --> 00:17:42,657
- Fatum nos iungebit is wrong.
- How so, Doctor?

209
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:46,092
The future imperfect tense
of the verb unite, iungere...

210
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:49,562
is not iungebit, it's iunget.
It should say "Fatum nos iunget."

211
00:17:49,662 --> 00:17:52,894
So the person you're looking for
made a classic Latin error.

212
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:56,212
But I'm guessing you knew that
already too, didn't you?

213
00:17:59,151 --> 00:18:02,826
You know the phrase "Fuck you"?
Germanic origin.

214
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,346
Where's your brother?

215
00:18:09,446 --> 00:18:12,040
I'm sorry.
I can't help you with that one.

216
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,473
Actually, he's your half-brother, isn't he?
Same mother, different fathers.

217
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:19,754
He spent some time in various institutions
with your half-sister Zoe?

218
00:18:19,855 --> 00:18:22,564
Yeah, that's right.

219
00:18:22,664 --> 00:18:25,237
After our mother died...

220
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:30,180
Philip wasn't...
wasn't as lucky with his father.

221
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,596
Apparently not. Alcoholic child beater.

222
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:35,757
You didn't spend much time
with Philip back then, did you?

223
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:38,931
- No.
- But now you're best friends.

224
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,139
We've had a lot of catching up to do.

225
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:46,179
You really don't know
where we can find him?

226
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:52,590
Fate will unite us?
Where the hell's your brother, Chris?

227
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,603
I don't know.

228
00:18:56,699 --> 00:18:58,433
What the hell is this?

229
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:01,109
- Where the fuck is Philip?
- I'm right here.

230
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:09,392
- What the hell's going on?
- You did this.

231
00:19:10,794 --> 00:19:13,800
- You did this!
- Luke! Luke, Luke, Luke!

232
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,539
- Come here! Hey! Hey!
- Hands off! Come on. Bring it on!

233
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:19,184
- Cool it.
- What is this?

234
00:19:19,862 --> 00:19:20,720
Shit.

235
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,183
- Did you have anything to do with this?
- What the fuck you talkin' about?

236
00:19:23,284 --> 00:19:25,118
Just answer the fucking question!
Did you do this?

237
00:19:25,218 --> 00:19:27,428
- Of course not!
- Jesus Christ.

238
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:30,232
- Were you here last night?
- No, man, I wasn't here last night.

239
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,038
I slept at my in-laws.
You don't believe me, call Vicky.

240
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,842
What about this morning?
Were you here this morning?

241
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:38,950
I was at a project site, all right?
With my father-in-law.

242
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,689
My God. Where were you last night?

243
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,593
- Where've you been?
- Philip, take it easy.

244
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:45,464
Before accusing everyone else,
where have you been?

245
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:49,972
'Cause I never got a text saying
the loft was taken. Never.

246
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:51,576
- Last night, I was at home.
- Can you prove it?

247
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:54,013
No, I can't prove it
'cause Barbara's taken the kids skiing.

248
00:19:54,113 --> 00:19:56,118
- You'll have to take my word for it.
- Your word?

249
00:19:56,418 --> 00:20:00,277
There's a dead woman in our loft
that only us have access to.

250
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:04,000
If anybody has anything to do with this,
now's the time to say it, right now.

251
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:16,158
Philip's got a ball and chain now.

252
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:19,097
- Who would have thunk it?
- Who's the father-in-law again?

253
00:20:19,497 --> 00:20:22,705
His name's Hiram Fry.
He's a huge property developer.

254
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,972
His friends call him "the man of steel."

255
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:27,866
Worth millions.
Think she's his only daughter.

256
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:31,455
- So what's not to love?
- I just hope Philip will be happy.

257
00:20:35,663 --> 00:20:38,201
- Well, that's cozy.
- What?

258
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,573
Ever since Councilman Kotkin
got elected,

259
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,710
the man of steel's been busy
rebuilding downtown.

260
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:45,990
- Kotkin came to your opening, right?
- Yeah, he turned up for a photo op.

261
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,052
When it comes to handing out permits
and contracts though, the game's rigged.

262
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:52,933
Tell me what we're talking about again
'cause I just saw some mini cheesecakes.

263
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:08,629
Gorgeous?

264
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:12,937
I mean, this whole setup.

265
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,446
Whoever said money can't buy happiness
sure hasn't lived this life.

266
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,689
Sorry, boys. You lost your bachelor mascot.
He's all mine now.

267
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,075
Good luck with breaking this bronco, Vicky.
God knows others have tried.

268
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:35,252
- But I'm not others, am I, Philip?
- She told you!

269
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:39,122
And it's not just me.
Philip's married into the Fry family now.

270
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:40,493
Soon as we're back from Fiji.

271
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:43,399
Yeah. Well, gonna sell
some properties with Vicky's dad.

272
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,172
- You know, see how it grabs me.
- Grabs you.

273
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:50,412
Well, guys, thanks for coming.

274
00:21:50,512 --> 00:21:52,116
- Congratulations.
- Come on.

275
00:21:52,216 --> 00:21:56,190
I'll be with you in a second, baby.
I need a break from all the ass-kissing.

276
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,693
Shit.

277
00:21:57,793 --> 00:22:00,632
- Where is Fiji?
- I don't know, man.

278
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,928
Phil?

279
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:17,767
Your wedding present.

280
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:22,108
- Are you for real?
- Absolutely. Don't lose it.

281
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,081
There's only five of these in existence.

282
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:34,676
Accepting a key to the loft means
you accept the rules to the loft. Marty?

283
00:22:34,776 --> 00:22:36,939
What, are you crazy? Our wives are here.

284
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:42,850
Don't you think that's a bit cynical,
handing those things out here?

285
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,424
Cynical? It's just a key to a room.
You should check it out.

286
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:49,603
Oh, no, you're not like that.

287
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:53,755
Not now. Maybe later.
What about you, Luke? Now or later?

288
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:57,265
Come on.

289
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:02,624
- That-a-boy.
- Oh, wow.

290
00:23:02,724 --> 00:23:05,178
You just make sure this doesn't
blow up in your faces.

291
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:08,138
How's it gonna blow up in our face?
It's just a room, like Vince said.

292
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:10,396
Our room.

293
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:12,542
Now, we keep it to ourselves, all right?

294
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:16,450
Tell nobody. It just stays
within our circle. Marty?

295
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,025
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

296
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,228
You just need to find someone
willing to go with you, Marty.

297
00:23:20,328 --> 00:23:23,431
Oh, yeah? Yeah, yeah.
I think there's plenty choices right here.

298
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:25,635
Some of these guys bring
some premium-grade high-test pussy.

299
00:23:25,735 --> 00:23:28,006
Like that little
dewy-eyed vixen right there.

300
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,679
- She looks underage.
- No, she's 20.

301
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:33,417
And ne of you guys messes with her,
I'm gonna crack your head wide open.

302
00:23:33,817 --> 00:23:37,492
- What, do you got dibs on Miss Curly Locks?
- Listen, man. That's Zoe, all right?

303
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:39,329
- Zoe?
- Yeah.

304
00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:42,813
- Like as in skin-and-bones tomboy Zoe?
- Yeah.

305
00:23:43,605 --> 00:23:46,610
I hate to say it, Phil,
but your little sister's seriously hot.

306
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,295
- Thanks, man.
- She's not little anymore.

307
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:50,952
- That is the finest piece of ass...
- Marty, that's enough.

308
00:23:51,052 --> 00:23:53,257
I'm just saying,
I'd like to fuck her like an animal.

309
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:55,428
- Come on, Marty. That's enough.
- Feel her from the inside.

310
00:23:55,528 --> 00:23:57,899
I want to fuck you like an animal

311
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,368
You don't sing. You don't laugh.
You don't talk about my sister. Got it?

312
00:24:02,468 --> 00:24:04,716
Got it?

313
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:10,792
- Don't fuck with me!
- You watch it.

314
00:24:10,892 --> 00:24:14,198
You watch it. Kick your ass
at your own fucking wedding.

315
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,791
Hi.

316
00:24:26,891 --> 00:24:28,731
Hi.

317
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:32,101
We met at the... the building opening.

318
00:24:32,201 --> 00:24:34,572
That's right. You're Anne Morris.

319
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:36,777
I'm glad you remember me, Chris.

320
00:24:38,947 --> 00:24:41,285
I see you work weekends.

321
00:24:41,385 --> 00:24:44,125
What a dedicated personal assistant.

322
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:46,212
What a lucky city councilman.

323
00:24:46,763 --> 00:24:48,767
Screw him.

324
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:49,935
Do you?

325
00:24:54,713 --> 00:24:57,952
Does it get a bit boring walking around
all these parties by yourself?

326
00:24:58,652 --> 00:25:01,592
He wants you close, but not too close.

327
00:25:01,692 --> 00:25:04,733
Not when there's
important people around.

328
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:06,736
I told you I fall for the wrong men.

329
00:25:08,072 --> 00:25:10,036
Can you keep a secret?

330
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:13,342
Our city councilman
likes to keep my panties

331
00:25:13,442 --> 00:25:15,351
with him at these events, in his pocket.

332
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:18,259
It's a turn-on for him...

333
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:21,765
the thought of me in a crowd so naked.

334
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:23,036
Only he knows.

335
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,548
- Why do you let him use you like that?
- Who says he's using me?

336
00:25:29,648 --> 00:25:33,039
Maybe it turns me on.

337
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:38,032
Maybe me telling you about it
turns me on even more.

338
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:45,748
I hope you don't catch cold.

339
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,891
Chris.

340
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:55,200
Chris, I'm sorry... I don't know.
Maybe I was testing you.

341
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,012
I don't need to be tested.

342
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:01,245
Listen, do you want to maybe
get a cup of coffee...

343
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:04,285
someplace quiet... private?

344
00:26:27,364 --> 00:26:29,362
I'd like to use your key.

345
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,774
Just once. It's not what you think.

346
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:35,514
Hey, it doesn't matter what I think.

347
00:26:36,615 --> 00:26:37,651
Have fun.

348
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,581
- Does everyone still have a key?
- Course we do.

349
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:55,263
It's crucial we get this right.
Five keys were cut.

350
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:59,453
To make a sixth, you'd need the code,
which is in my safe, so we can rule that out.

351
00:26:59,553 --> 00:27:02,124
But there was no break-in.
So does everyone still have a key?

352
00:27:02,224 --> 00:27:04,793
What, you think we've been
givin' away our keys?

353
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:07,162
- It's against your rules, Vince.
- Then show me.

354
00:27:07,262 --> 00:27:09,398
What are we trying to prove here?

355
00:27:09,498 --> 00:27:12,134
Look, I don't know.
Maybe someone's lost a key, okay?

356
00:27:12,234 --> 00:27:16,472
Let's just rule that out. Okay?
Look. Here's mine. All right?

357
00:27:21,878 --> 00:27:23,680
Chris?

358
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:26,626
You didn't use a key to get in just now.

359
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,121
- No. I didn't bring it.
- Where is it?

360
00:27:31,221 --> 00:27:33,471
I don't have it on me, okay?
It's not like I need it every day,

361
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:35,281
- like some of you guys.
- But you do still have it?

362
00:27:35,381 --> 00:27:38,162
Vincent, whether or not I have my key
on me right now is really not important.

363
00:27:38,262 --> 00:27:42,136
It's extremely fuckin' important. Someone
got in using a key, and yours is missing!

364
00:27:42,236 --> 00:27:43,708
Is that right, Vincent?

365
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:46,237
Then how do you account for the fact
that the alarm was shut off?

366
00:27:46,337 --> 00:27:50,475
So let's just cut the bullshit, 'cause
it definitely had to be one of us five.

367
00:27:52,642 --> 00:27:55,013
Unless...

368
00:27:55,713 --> 00:27:59,484
- Unless what?
- Unless she let him in.

369
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:02,053
Oh, yeah?
Then how'd she get in, Vincent?

370
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:05,128
Any way you look at it,
it keeps coming back down to us.

371
00:28:05,228 --> 00:28:07,331
And I, for one, would like to know
who's hiding something.

372
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,029
I seriously don't believe it.
There's a word for that?

373
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,748
Yes. Polyamory. It's a philosophy,
some sort of belief system

374
00:28:17,848 --> 00:28:21,341
about being romantically involved
with more than one person at the same time.

375
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:22,924
And your boss gets away with that?

376
00:28:23,024 --> 00:28:26,177
Yes. He says that he's in love
with his wife and his girlfriend,

377
00:28:26,323 --> 00:28:29,590
so why should he have to choose?
And his wife is amazingly cool with it.

378
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,676
Oh, really? Is she special needs?
Maybe oxygen-deprived? What?

379
00:28:32,776 --> 00:28:34,987
- Explain. I'd like to know.
- This sounds like my kinda philosophy.

380
00:28:35,127 --> 00:28:37,424
Barbara, what's it called again?
Polly and Marie?

381
00:28:37,524 --> 00:28:39,926
Please. Spare us, Tubs.
You can barely handle one woman.

382
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:43,263
- What would you do with two?
- Bury one.

383
00:28:44,358 --> 00:28:46,733
I would make up something,
some sort of game

384
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:50,672
that involves two ladies and one guy.
Start a trapeze act or somethin'.

385
00:28:53,907 --> 00:28:56,844
Could you at least fake some enthusiasm?

386
00:28:57,612 --> 00:29:00,882
It's your party. Anyway, I'm cooking.

387
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,251
If you absolutely have to invite
your friends over,

388
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:07,430
could you at least try
to make it home on time?

389
00:29:09,524 --> 00:29:11,694
Look, they're never here, okay?
Will you just join us?

390
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:17,999
I just hope the pudgy clown
doesn't puke on the rug.

391
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:22,705
He's been chugging vodka like it's Evian.
I mean, doesn't his wife see that?

392
00:29:23,105 --> 00:29:26,075
Actually, she was just cool with it
long enough to catch him in the act.

393
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:29,611
She hired a detective.
Cell phone records, credit card receipts.

394
00:29:29,712 --> 00:29:31,547
Audio, video, the works.

395
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:36,318
And in a heartbeat, my poor boss
went from polyamory to alimony.

396
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:42,926
Man, your boss sounds mentally retarded.
So, what... what happened to him?

397
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:47,563
He and his concubine are now cramped
in a tiny one-bedroom condo.

398
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:49,199
But I'm guessing he's happy.

399
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:52,863
She's blonde, 23,
with a brand-new pair of fake breasts.

400
00:29:52,963 --> 00:29:55,379
How can men stand fake breasts?

401
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:59,210
Why are women always talking about
"fake tits" this, "fake tits" that?

402
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:03,481
I mean, listen. Girls, if it's a decent
boob job, who fuckin' cares. You know?

403
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:06,717
My mom... My mom,
she's got... false teeth.

404
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:10,788
Okay? When she smiles, do people give her
shit and say, "Oh, my God! Look! Fake!"

405
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:16,760
No, they don't. They say, "Wow! You look
way better now. It's an improvement."

406
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,398
You know, you women,
you're so catty, so competitive.

407
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:21,866
Calm down, Tubby dearest.

408
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:24,636
You know what?
No, it's nothin' to be calm about, Mimi.

409
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:27,406
I mean, a glorious,
big set of fuckin' tits...

410
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:31,264
and a nice piece of ass, it's thrilling!
It's thrilling!

411
00:30:32,877 --> 00:30:38,184
This is all a little too highbrow
for my teeny, tiny, catty female mind.

412
00:30:38,284 --> 00:30:40,320
Oh, well, you know what?
You should have that enlarged.

413
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,088
And while you're under, you should have
the corners of your mouth lifted

414
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:45,389
so you can smile
every once in a while. Sorry.

415
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:46,900
- Sorry, Chris. What? What?
- Marty. Marty.

416
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,547
- Come on.
- No.

417
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:53,967
No, you're a class act, Marty.

418
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:57,404
Mimi, would you like to get your husband
another drink or should I do the honors?

419
00:30:57,504 --> 00:31:00,671
You should do it. And I want it chilled.

420
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:04,545
- And then you go with her and stir.
- Honey?

421
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:09,183
The problem with your boss, Barbara,
is he didn't have his shit together.

422
00:31:09,283 --> 00:31:11,351
I mean, apart. Apart, I mean.

423
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:16,223
He did... No, I mean he didn't
compartmentalize. You guys agree?

424
00:31:17,124 --> 00:31:20,460
All right, Marty.
How would you compartmentalize?

425
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:22,463
How? Okay. Well, since you ask.

426
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:26,033
First thing first is I wouldn't have
a place that you could get caught.

427
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:28,937
Not a hotel, not your girlfriend's crib.

428
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:31,439
That's key, right?
Am I right, Vinnie boy?

429
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,475
- Am I right?
- Marty, you've lost us all.

430
00:31:36,284 --> 00:31:39,632
I doubt that! I doubt that, Vinnie boy.

431
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,650
But it... Okay, first of all...
Sorry, baby.

432
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,854
I would just get a little... you know,
a little one-bedroom condo...

433
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:45,721
or something like that.

434
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,293
You all right?

435
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:54,463
Mimi, your husband tends to talk out of
his ass when he's been drinking. Yeah?

436
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,839
Hon, would you give me a hand?

437
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:04,508
Sure.

438
00:32:11,815 --> 00:32:14,301
- Sorry. Didn't know you were in here.
- Yeah, no problem.

439
00:32:14,401 --> 00:32:17,887
Ate too much too fast, I guess.
Thai food, you know.

440
00:32:17,988 --> 00:32:19,506
Yeah, it gets all up
in your nose and shit.

441
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:24,595
- Yeah. It's a little spicy.
- Yeah. I'm outta here. Bye.

442
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:37,409
- I need to pick up some more insulin.
- Luke?

443
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:39,844
Is there something you wanna tell me?

444
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:42,814
Are you keeping secrets?

445
00:32:42,914 --> 00:32:45,438
What kind of secrets?

446
00:32:46,451 --> 00:32:48,754
Is there someone else?

447
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:54,893
I don't know why you start asking me
silly questions, but the answer is no.

448
00:32:55,394 --> 00:32:59,502
- I'm not cheating on you, Ellie.
- That's not what I'm asking, Luke.

449
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:02,468
I'm asking if there's someone else.

450
00:33:02,568 --> 00:33:05,938
Listen, sweetie.
Whatever I may be or may not be...

451
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:09,410
and I know I'm not
as glamorous as some...

452
00:33:10,743 --> 00:33:13,847
but I'll always be there for you
and the children.

453
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,319
I don't know what I'd do without you.

454
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,822
I want you to know...

455
00:33:21,922 --> 00:33:24,493
there's a lot I could put up with.

456
00:33:34,836 --> 00:33:37,572
- What are you doing?
- We need to get her out of here.

457
00:33:37,672 --> 00:33:40,942
- How? She is shackled to the bed!
- Can't you guys see what's going on?

458
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:44,378
- Someone is trying to frame us.
- Who? Who wants to frame us?

459
00:33:44,478 --> 00:33:47,031
I don't know. But think about it.
The body's cuffed to the bed.

460
00:33:47,131 --> 00:33:49,745
It's impossible to move.
The Latin, the knife.

461
00:33:49,845 --> 00:33:52,855
Someone did this for a reason.
The cops could be here any second.

462
00:33:52,955 --> 00:33:56,324
None of us know who this girl is.
We don't even know how she got in here.

463
00:33:56,725 --> 00:33:59,996
Who else knew about the arrangement?
Who else knows about our arrangement?

464
00:34:00,096 --> 00:34:02,597
Did anyone blab, tell one of the girls
that have been up here?

465
00:34:02,698 --> 00:34:05,234
- Marty?
- What? Why me?

466
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,304
- Some night you were hammered?
- I've always followed the rules, Vincent.

467
00:34:08,404 --> 00:34:11,006
Did you give anyone your code?
Did you key in while someone was watching?

468
00:34:11,106 --> 00:34:13,376
Absolutely not. I just told you.

469
00:34:13,476 --> 00:34:15,311
Wait. What's your point, Vincent?
Where are you going with this?

470
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:17,881
- Someone is trying to set us up.
- Like who?

471
00:34:17,981 --> 00:34:21,084
I don't know. A rejected girlfriend.
A jealous boyfriend.

472
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,453
Betrayed husband. Someone with a motive.

473
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,892
Look. Is one of you guys
in some kind of trouble?

474
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:05,798
I think I may be
falling in love with you.

475
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:12,804
You don't have to say that.

476
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:15,175
No, but I mean it.

477
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:20,079
Why would you say that, Chris?
Why would you even feel it?

478
00:35:21,648 --> 00:35:25,585
I've never cheated on my wife before.
And I don't fall in love easily.

479
00:35:25,685 --> 00:35:29,178
Chris, I don't want you to love me.
You don't even know me...

480
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:31,658
apart from these stolen moments.

481
00:35:31,758 --> 00:35:34,795
I mean, they're exciting,
yeah, sure, but...

482
00:35:36,463 --> 00:35:37,790
they're just moments.

483
00:35:38,164 --> 00:35:41,329
Let's change that. I wanna see you
more often and not just for this.

484
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,145
No, stop it.

485
00:35:44,245 --> 00:35:46,796
I don't want you to love me.

486
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:50,211
Well, I don't wanna
keep sneaking around.

487
00:35:51,412 --> 00:35:53,281
- I'm gonna tell Alison about us.
- No, you're not.

488
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:56,483
Yes, I am. Anne.

489
00:35:57,785 --> 00:36:00,590
- I'm gonna leave her.
- Stop it!

490
00:36:01,322 --> 00:36:03,877
Why are you doing this?

491
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:06,261
The people you love,

492
00:36:08,196 --> 00:36:10,499
they're the only ones who can hurt you.

493
00:36:12,668 --> 00:36:14,737
- I would never hurt you, Anne.
- Stop.

494
00:36:14,837 --> 00:36:17,122
Stop what? I don't know
what you're talking about. Would you...

495
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:19,826
Stop it, okay? You don't know me.
Okay? That's the end of it.

496
00:36:19,926 --> 00:36:24,514
- Would you give me a chance, at least...
- I'm a whore. All right?

497
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,451
- What?
- I'm a prostitute.

498
00:36:30,152 --> 00:36:32,979
I fuck men for money.

499
00:36:33,623 --> 00:36:35,691
Do you get it now?

500
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:38,061
Don't worry, Doctor. I won't bill you
for the past few months.

501
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:41,031
Anne, would you wait?
Would you wait a minute?

502
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:44,435
Please stop it. You don't know
the half of it. Just go home.

503
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,139
Go home to your wife and your kids.

504
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:54,378
Is your friend Chris Vanowen
cheating on his wife, Mr. Landry?

505
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,648
Oh, I doubt that. Chris is a very
devoted husband and...

506
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,451
And a model dad, just like
all the rest of your pals, right?

507
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:04,222
Except for you. You're not exactly
squeaky clean, are you, Marty?

508
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,523
I don't know what you mean.

509
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,727
- Why does your wife want a divorce?
- Divorce? That's not right.

510
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:11,796
What we're going through is a separation.
It's a trial separation.

511
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,031
Why?

512
00:37:13,132 --> 00:37:16,135
Because she found out something
that she... wasn't too happy about.

513
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:19,771
- You fucked around on her.
- If you wanna be technical.

514
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,941
How'd she find out?

515
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:27,515
- The woman with whom I...
- Fucked around?

516
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:29,182
Yeah.

517
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:33,586
Apparently expected something a little more
and she showed up on our front porch.

518
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:37,357
The bitch started to... the woman
in question started saying things.

519
00:37:37,457 --> 00:37:40,186
And my only hope is that Mimi
will come around eventually,

520
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:42,047
because I love her very much.

521
00:37:42,247 --> 00:37:43,763
Did you go with this woman
up to the loft?

522
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:45,699
What? No. This happened in San Diego.

523
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:48,569
Oh, that's where you met
the woman, right? In San Diego.

524
00:37:48,669 --> 00:37:49,903
- Yeah.
- Why were you there?

525
00:37:50,003 --> 00:37:52,772
A commercial real estate convention.
Vince had a couple extra tickets.

526
00:37:52,872 --> 00:37:54,866
A VIP thing, you know. It's...

527
00:37:54,966 --> 00:37:57,678
a couple nights in a fancy hotel
and a chance to get away for a couple days.

528
00:37:58,178 --> 00:37:59,414
And nights.

529
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:02,950
Yeah. Nights too.

530
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,454
Man, do you see that? Jesus, Vince.
Those girls are drooling all over you.

531
00:38:06,554 --> 00:38:10,792
Invite 'em over. You got first dibs.
I'm happy with second best too.

532
00:38:12,326 --> 00:38:14,495
He's cute. See him?

533
00:38:15,096 --> 00:38:17,265
I'll take a rain check on that.

534
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:19,868
What? What, are you fucking crazy?
Why wouldn't you invite them over?

535
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:24,906
'Cause, Marty, I'd rather dive
for some rare and exotic sea creature

536
00:38:25,006 --> 00:38:27,409
than shoot fish in a barrel.

537
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:31,013
Does Barbara know about
these deep-sea expeditions of yours?

538
00:38:31,113 --> 00:38:33,082
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah. What's your problem, Seacord?

539
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:37,139
You got a key to the loft. What do you do
up there, your laundry? Dishes?

540
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:42,124
Hey, are you guys here on business
or what? I'm Dana. My first time here.

541
00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:44,260
It's a little overpriced
for what you get, don't you think?

542
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,332
Hi, Dana. I'm Vincent. This is Marty,
Luke. Can we... buy you a drink?

543
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:52,319
Hey, when I said "overpriced,"
I wasn't trolling for free booze.

544
00:38:52,419 --> 00:38:55,005
- No, I mean, I didn't think...
- Since you asked, what are you drinking?

545
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:57,507
Oh, champagne? A girl can dream.

546
00:38:57,607 --> 00:38:58,876
- Champagne?
- Please.

547
00:38:58,976 --> 00:39:01,311
All right. One champagne coming up.

548
00:39:01,411 --> 00:39:04,548
What are you doing? The fat chick's
gonna scare off all the hot chicks.

549
00:39:04,648 --> 00:39:08,185
Marty. Every fat chick
has a good-looking friend.

550
00:39:08,285 --> 00:39:10,154
Hers is probably
on her way down right now.

551
00:39:10,254 --> 00:39:12,456
Okay. Yeah, well, what if she
is the good-looking friend...

552
00:39:12,556 --> 00:39:15,866
and the really fat chick's
on her way down?

553
00:39:17,462 --> 00:39:20,181
I think that's Philip's father-in-law.

554
00:39:21,265 --> 00:39:23,635
- Yeah, it is.
- I'll be.

555
00:39:24,336 --> 00:39:27,172
That's the man of steel, all right.
But that ain't Mrs. Steel.

556
00:39:27,772 --> 00:39:30,976
- Think we should give him a key?
- Maybe. Not mine.

557
00:39:32,822 --> 00:39:35,914
I'd like a bottle of your finest champagne
and four glasses, please,

558
00:39:36,014 --> 00:39:37,466
at the table in the corner.

559
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:43,223
You... were at my daughter's wedding.
Philip's friends. You're the architect.

560
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,906
- Vincent Stevens.
- We should talk sometime, Mr. Stevens.

561
00:39:48,006 --> 00:39:50,289
Sure. What do you got in mind, Mr. Fry?

562
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:54,900
We have a new waterfront project.
It's massive. It's cutting-edge.

563
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,669
It might be right up your alley.

564
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,241
Of course, it's all preliminary,
and we have to keep it under wraps.

565
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:02,276
I hope you can be discreet.

566
00:40:03,476 --> 00:40:04,811
Sure.

567
00:40:04,911 --> 00:40:08,316
Discretion, Mr. Stevens.
That's the main thing.

568
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:13,521
Dictum sapienti sat est.
A word to the wise.

569
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:15,857
You are wise?

570
00:40:18,258 --> 00:40:22,196
Yeah, sure. Wise...
wise and discreet, Mr. Fry.

571
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:25,560
I'm in software.
I can be discreet myself, and wise.

572
00:40:28,102 --> 00:40:32,608
I'll pick up their tab as well.
Have a nice evening, gentlemen.

573
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:42,084
Fantastic.

574
00:40:42,184 --> 00:40:43,553
Oh, they're right over here.

575
00:40:52,795 --> 00:40:54,831
Sweetheart?

576
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:57,801
- Sweetheart?
- Excuse me.

577
00:40:58,034 --> 00:41:00,964
Hi, this is Anne. Leave a message.

578
00:41:06,442 --> 00:41:08,134
Who are you calling at this hour?

579
00:41:12,482 --> 00:41:14,450
I wasn't.
I was just checkin' my voice mail.

580
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:19,324
And what does your voice mail say?
That you're a lousy liar, Chris Vanowen?

581
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,228
What are you talk... Is something wrong?

582
00:41:25,729 --> 00:41:28,333
You tell me, Chris.

583
00:41:32,971 --> 00:41:34,606
- Alison, I...
- I'm going to bed.

584
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:38,177
Alison!

585
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:46,523
Excuse me. That's not thinking.
It's called following your dick around.

586
00:41:46,623 --> 00:41:49,121
Okay, two kinds of articles in Cosmo
month after month...

587
00:41:49,221 --> 00:41:50,989
One: men are pigs.

588
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:53,855
Two: How do I seduce a pig
to chop my wood?

589
00:41:53,955 --> 00:41:56,828
I don't read Cosmo month after month.

590
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:59,132
- Well, I do.
- I don't.

591
00:41:59,232 --> 00:42:01,267
- Well, I do.
- And I find it strangely compelling.

592
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:03,061
- You know what I find strangely compelling?
- What?

593
00:42:03,162 --> 00:42:06,373
Your eyebrows. Lumberjack contest.

594
00:42:06,473 --> 00:42:08,040
I can't leave you alone for a minute.

595
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:11,645
Sarah. It's been more like an hour.
Thank God I've been subsidized.

596
00:42:11,745 --> 00:42:15,115
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your new friends?

597
00:42:17,351 --> 00:42:18,923
And that was the first time you met her?

598
00:42:20,687 --> 00:42:23,391
Yeah, that was...

599
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:26,361
- That was the first time.
- Sarah?

600
00:42:28,261 --> 00:42:31,298
Yeah. Her name was Sarah.

601
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:33,644
Mr. Stevens, what else happened
in San Diego?

602
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:37,505
- What do you want to know?
- Everything.

603
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,291
- I got another one!
- No! No!

604
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:44,278
Keep it down. Keep it down.

605
00:42:44,378 --> 00:42:48,283
- This is insane, Sarah.
- You should never dare a crazy woman.

606
00:42:48,383 --> 00:42:52,621
- Vincent, we should probably go back.
- Luke, lighten up. It's okay.

607
00:42:54,522 --> 00:42:57,660
Said I'd get you to the pool. Now you have
to keep your end of the bargain.

608
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,561
- Come over here. Sit down.
- Yeah.

609
00:43:03,032 --> 00:43:06,329
Come on. Don't keep us waiting.
Take it off.

610
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,506
- I'm gonna be sick.
- What? Vince's body's not that bad.

611
00:43:10,606 --> 00:43:14,164
- Not Vince, the shrimp cocktail!
- What? Dana!

612
00:43:14,364 --> 00:43:17,314
Dana! Come... Come back. Come back here!

613
00:43:38,269 --> 00:43:41,805
- Your turn.
- No.

614
00:43:41,906 --> 00:43:44,620
Take it all off.

615
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,421
Not bad.

616
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,090
Is this still too scary for you, Luke?

617
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,286
Are you gonna join us?

618
00:44:49,009 --> 00:44:50,817
I'm... I'm fine right here.

619
00:44:51,412 --> 00:44:54,348
But I need you, 'cause Vincent's gonna try
and make a move on me soon.

620
00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:57,819
And if you're here, maybe he won't dare.

621
00:44:58,419 --> 00:45:03,125
Well, maybe Vincent's not interested.
Maybe Vincent would rather do laps.

622
00:45:03,525 --> 00:45:07,108
That would explain the last few hours
of casual-but-meaningful glances

623
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:09,998
that each lasted a second too long.

624
00:45:10,198 --> 00:45:12,067
You like to play games?

625
00:45:12,655 --> 00:45:14,069
I do.

626
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:18,600
And I'll tell you something else:
I'm better at it than you.

627
00:45:23,645 --> 00:45:27,650
- Can you feel me?
- Most definitely.

628
00:45:50,573 --> 00:45:52,442
Marty?

629
00:45:53,343 --> 00:45:57,215
- Marty, I need my room key.
- Dude! I'm kinda busy here.

630
00:45:57,315 --> 00:45:58,983
- Don't stop!
- Go!

631
00:45:59,283 --> 00:46:01,486
- I'm not stopping.
- Just do it!

632
00:46:13,365 --> 00:46:16,346
You're scared, is what it is.

633
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:20,506
You're running away from your feelings.

634
00:46:23,709 --> 00:46:26,258
I don't want to say good-bye.

635
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:35,088
Do you have any idea
what it's like to really love someone?

636
00:46:37,523 --> 00:46:39,487
I'm sorry.

637
00:47:04,084 --> 00:47:06,154
What are you doing?

638
00:47:08,986 --> 00:47:11,192
Throwing it away. It's empty.

639
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:15,413
You were here yesterday, weren't you?

640
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:22,393
Guys?

641
00:47:22,493 --> 00:47:25,223
We gotta go to the cops.
We're not getting anywhere with this.

642
00:47:25,423 --> 00:47:27,376
First, I think Vincent
has something to tell you.

643
00:47:30,178 --> 00:47:32,215
All right, let's hear it.

644
00:47:35,177 --> 00:47:36,895
What the hell?

645
00:47:46,262 --> 00:47:49,309
- Hello?
- Who is it?

646
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:51,836
Who is it?

647
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,540
It's a Realtor who wants to come up.
Somebody listed the loft for sale?

648
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,247
- What?
- Oh, Jesus fucking...

649
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:01,879
Listed the loft?

650
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:05,415
She said she has an appointment
with a Deakins, Sarah Deakins.

651
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,324
Who... Who's Sarah Deakins?

652
00:48:08,424 --> 00:48:11,656
Wait. Who the hell
is trying to sell our loft?

653
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:17,929
You know her, Marty.

654
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:21,774
- What?
- You know her, and so does Luke.

655
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,037
Sarah Deakins is lying on the bed.

656
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:33,922
You guys, I promise,
I've never seen a Sarah Deakins.

657
00:48:34,022 --> 00:48:37,216
- That's not true. You know her.
- Why do you keep saying that?

658
00:48:37,316 --> 00:48:41,632
You met her in San Diego the last night
in the bar. Remember? Dana's friend.

659
00:48:42,855 --> 00:48:46,459
The last night? I was wasted
outta my mind. The whole night's a blur.

660
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,144
Jesus!

661
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,498
- Luke, you remember her, don't you?
- That's Sarah?

662
00:48:52,598 --> 00:48:54,917
You remember Sarah.
You remember her, right?

663
00:48:55,017 --> 00:48:58,405
Yes. I remember Sarah. But how
was I supposed to know that's Sarah?

664
00:48:58,505 --> 00:49:00,240
Come on, guys. What the hell's going on?

665
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,230
You guys turned her over
and looked at her face. I did not.

666
00:49:08,114 --> 00:49:11,686
Yeah. I think there's been a mistake.
We don't know anyone named Sarah Deakins.

667
00:49:12,686 --> 00:49:14,422
Marty. Come on!

668
00:49:19,593 --> 00:49:22,546
- Who is it? Do we know her?
- I don't know.

669
00:49:25,366 --> 00:49:26,502
Fuck.

670
00:49:30,872 --> 00:49:34,609
So is that all you wanted
to tell us, Vince? Or is there more?

671
00:49:37,812 --> 00:49:41,717
I had a thing with her.

672
00:49:41,817 --> 00:49:44,820
I brought her up here a couple of times.

673
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,289
I swear on my kids,
I had nothing to do with this.

674
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:49,659
Would you just fuckin' tell me?
Were you here with her last night?

675
00:49:49,798 --> 00:49:52,172
Were you the one who let her in?

676
00:49:54,563 --> 00:49:56,532
I broke up with her last night.

677
00:50:08,979 --> 00:50:12,015
I swear she was alive when I left.

678
00:50:12,115 --> 00:50:14,919
It still doesn't explain
why someone listed the loft!

679
00:50:56,629 --> 00:51:00,066
Something special or just browsing?

680
00:51:02,835 --> 00:51:04,704
Why don't you return my phone calls?

681
00:51:04,804 --> 00:51:08,468
- If you're dumping me, at least have...
- Chris, how can I dump you?

682
00:51:09,209 --> 00:51:10,378
There's nothing between us.

683
00:51:13,145 --> 00:51:15,681
So that's what it meant to you? Nothing?

684
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,785
Did you forget what I told you already?
Who I am, what I do?

685
00:51:18,885 --> 00:51:22,970
No. I haven't. It doesn't change
how I feel about you.

686
00:51:24,758 --> 00:51:26,544
How many women
have you taken to that fuck pad

687
00:51:26,644 --> 00:51:29,480
you share with your four little buddies?

688
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,716
- What?
- Please, Chris.

689
00:51:32,816 --> 00:51:34,702
Save it for some girl
who'll actually buy your bullshit.

690
00:51:34,802 --> 00:51:36,270
Anne, no, wait. Wait.

691
00:51:38,171 --> 00:51:40,409
You know I'm not like that.

692
00:51:42,544 --> 00:51:43,785
Here.

693
00:51:45,513 --> 00:51:48,518
I only need this if I'm with you,
so you keep it.

694
00:51:51,285 --> 00:51:53,288
If you wanna see me again,
you let me know.

695
00:51:59,861 --> 00:52:02,632
Chris? What are you doing here?

696
00:52:04,399 --> 00:52:06,635
Shopping for Alison?

697
00:52:06,735 --> 00:52:10,444
No. No, I was just here
with a colleague.

698
00:52:19,548 --> 00:52:22,185
Does your wife know you've been sharing
the loft with your pals?

699
00:52:22,285 --> 00:52:24,921
I already told you,
I'm not sharing a loft with any pals.

700
00:52:25,021 --> 00:52:28,291
I was there just once, at a party,
when the building first opened.

701
00:52:29,192 --> 00:52:32,620
Then you have been there. A minute ago,
you didn't even know where the building was.

702
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,564
I never took anyone up there.
I thought that's what you meant.

703
00:52:34,664 --> 00:52:36,633
Well, did you know the girl?

704
00:52:39,436 --> 00:52:41,872
We met once in San Diego.

705
00:52:41,972 --> 00:52:45,509
Are you aware that Mr. Stevens began
a relationship with her in San Diego?

706
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:48,062
- That would surprise me, frankly.
- You didn't know?

707
00:52:48,162 --> 00:52:50,748
Isn't Vincent Stevens your best friend?

708
00:52:50,848 --> 00:52:52,783
It's so obvious
what you're trying to do here.

709
00:52:52,883 --> 00:52:54,773
You're trying to turn us against
each other. But guess what?

710
00:52:54,873 --> 00:52:56,921
I'm not about to start trashing
my friend.

711
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:01,727
Is it possible, Mr. Seacord,
that you are jealous of your best friend...

712
00:53:02,227 --> 00:53:04,129
when he's nailing
all these beautiful women?

713
00:53:04,229 --> 00:53:05,764
I am a married man.

714
00:53:05,864 --> 00:53:08,934
I'm not interested in nailing women.
I'm not jealous of Vincent.

715
00:53:09,034 --> 00:53:12,637
Oh, no. I didn't mean
jealous of him, Mr. Seacord.

716
00:53:12,737 --> 00:53:15,575
I meant jealous of the women.

717
00:53:25,218 --> 00:53:28,088
Where do you get off
with an innuendo like that?

718
00:53:31,658 --> 00:53:34,737
- Fucking bastards.
- Why are you so angry, Mr. Seacord?

719
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:38,330
Vincent is my closest friend.
And he has been for years.

720
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:43,904
Yeah, fine. But your best friend is
selling you out as we speak, Mr. Seacord.

721
00:53:44,004 --> 00:53:45,406
You and the rest of your gang.

722
00:53:45,506 --> 00:53:50,545
No. Vincent would never sell out
his friends. You're full of shit, asshole.

723
00:53:51,746 --> 00:53:54,449
- What'd you call me?
- You heard me, you lying piece of shit!

724
00:53:54,549 --> 00:53:56,523
I broke up with her and I left!
That's it!

725
00:53:56,623 --> 00:53:58,051
Yeah?

726
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,972
- After you cut her up with this. Right?
- Put the knife down!

727
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:03,054
- I didn't kill her.
- Back off.

728
00:54:03,154 --> 00:54:05,727
- Put the knife... Put the knife down!
- Back off.

729
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:08,530
The loft was listed in her name.
That's not a coincidence.

730
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:11,600
- Someone's trying to pin this on us.
- On you, you mean.

731
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,613
Jesus! Get a fuckin' grip!

732
00:54:16,772 --> 00:54:17,807
Fuck!

733
00:54:19,775 --> 00:54:22,111
Guys, we cannot keep doing this.

734
00:54:22,211 --> 00:54:25,414
Well, what do you wanna do, Marty?
Just leave me hanging?

735
00:54:29,451 --> 00:54:31,755
Hey, Vince? Vince? Are you in there?

736
00:54:32,055 --> 00:54:34,891
If you're in there, hey, man,
I need to talk to you for just a second.

737
00:54:34,991 --> 00:54:37,627
Christ, Marty, I've got company.
Didn't you get my text?

738
00:54:37,728 --> 00:54:39,964
Mimi's gone.

739
00:54:40,663 --> 00:54:44,053
- She's gone. Fucking gone.
- What do you mean "gone"? Gone where?

740
00:54:44,153 --> 00:54:46,535
She left me.
She found out about San Diego.

741
00:54:46,635 --> 00:54:49,439
That dumpy chick, she showed up
and then told her everything.

742
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:51,100
Fuck!

743
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,878
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell Mimi about the loft?

744
00:54:53,978 --> 00:54:58,582
What? It's not about the goddamn loft,
Vince! It's about my wife!

745
00:54:58,682 --> 00:55:01,986
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without her!

746
00:55:02,086 --> 00:55:03,988
Did you... Did you confess?

747
00:55:04,088 --> 00:55:06,557
Then never confess, Marty.
Never confess.

748
00:55:06,657 --> 00:55:10,295
Would you go to her and just...
just tell her that I love her?

749
00:55:10,395 --> 00:55:13,598
You know? And that Dana's lying?
She'll believe you.

750
00:55:13,698 --> 00:55:17,135
Marty, I will straighten this out for you.
I promise you I will straighten this out.

751
00:55:17,235 --> 00:55:19,537
- Okay.
- Hey, come here.

752
00:55:19,637 --> 00:55:22,007
It's okay.

753
00:55:30,949 --> 00:55:32,318
Thanks.

754
00:55:32,418 --> 00:55:35,288
Okay, so what's the plan?
What do we do now?

755
00:55:36,222 --> 00:55:37,890
We get her out of here.

756
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:41,894
- We can't just make a body disappear.
- That's too bad. It's our only hope.

757
00:55:41,994 --> 00:55:46,413
You had a relationship with her. Now she's
some inconvenient piece of evidence?

758
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:49,095
- What kind of man are you?
- That's a laugh, coming from you.

759
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:52,406
And how do you plan to get her
off the bed? Cut off her hand?

760
00:55:53,528 --> 00:55:54,824
Or do you have the key to those cuffs?

761
00:55:54,924 --> 00:55:57,311
You know what? I thought handcuffs
were more your thing than mine, Phil.

762
00:55:57,411 --> 00:56:01,281
- Meaning what?
- You know exactly what I mean.

763
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:14,829
Shut up! Shut up! Just keep
your fuckin' mouth shut! All right?

764
00:56:14,929 --> 00:56:17,397
Please help... help me! Please help me!

765
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:19,558
Keep that fucking mouth shut!

766
00:56:20,414 --> 00:56:21,401
He's crazy!

767
00:56:21,502 --> 00:56:23,572
This fucking whore's
trying to rip me off!

768
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:25,707
- Please help me! He raped me!
- Shut up!

769
00:56:25,807 --> 00:56:27,242
- Hey. Hey. Easy, easy!
- What?

770
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,744
- All right. All right.
- It's gonna be okay.

771
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:32,213
He's crazy!

772
00:56:32,313 --> 00:56:34,182
Shit. Okay, okay.

773
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,820
- Philip, give me the keys.
- Bitch is gonna go to the cops, man.

774
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,487
- The keys to the handcuffs.
- She's gonna go to the cops!

775
00:56:39,668 --> 00:56:41,023
Keys!

776
00:56:41,123 --> 00:56:43,159
You want the key?

777
00:56:43,259 --> 00:56:46,662
- Shit.
- He made me do things I didn't want to do.

778
00:56:46,762 --> 00:56:48,831
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Easy. Easy.

779
00:56:49,331 --> 00:56:53,435
What? You want more money?
That's it, right? It's all about the money?

780
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:57,174
It's all about the fucking money!
Here's your fucking money! It's right there!

781
00:56:57,474 --> 00:56:59,810
Jesus Christ. What the fuck
is the matter with you?

782
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:02,479
- Have you lost your fucking mind?
- She's a whore, Chris!

783
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:04,214
- Do you know what a whore is?
- Shut up!

784
00:57:04,314 --> 00:57:06,657
- You can't rape a whore!
- Shut up!

785
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:09,058
- You can't rape a...
- Shut up!

786
00:57:09,586 --> 00:57:12,858
You don't treat a woman like that!
You got it? Not any woman!

787
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,655
- Don't fuckin' touch me!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

788
00:57:18,755 --> 00:57:20,965
You're putting us all at risk!

789
00:57:21,065 --> 00:57:23,601
I want police. He... He hit me.

790
00:57:23,701 --> 00:57:25,369
Shut...

791
00:57:25,705 --> 00:57:27,138
- He raped me!
- Shut up!

792
00:57:27,238 --> 00:57:30,008
Stop screaming, or I'm gonna rip
your goddamn throat out!

793
00:57:30,108 --> 00:57:33,112
I've had it with you.
You're no better than your father.

794
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,750
- I'm what?
- You heard me.

795
00:57:38,817 --> 00:57:41,165
Oh, right, Chris.

796
00:57:41,265 --> 00:57:43,322
That's a nice one.

797
00:57:43,422 --> 00:57:45,691
Chris had a better deal
with his daddy, right?

798
00:57:45,891 --> 00:57:48,795
The great guy who wants
to save everyone.

799
00:57:49,862 --> 00:57:54,234
Where were you... when Zoe and I
were getting beat up?

800
00:57:55,368 --> 00:57:58,136
And Mom in the next room

801
00:57:58,237 --> 00:58:01,708
pretending not to hear. Where were you?

802
00:58:01,908 --> 00:58:05,927
In your cozy college dorm
getting laid and wasted

803
00:58:06,328 --> 00:58:08,484
- 'cause you didn't give a fuck!
- I didn't know anything about it.

804
00:58:08,584 --> 00:58:11,619
You didn't give a crap!
All those years we didn't exist for you!

805
00:58:11,919 --> 00:58:15,372
I didn't know anything about it! If you
would've told me or said something...

806
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:16,990
Then what, you phony? Then what?

807
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:20,795
Then I would've gotten you out of there,
goddamn it! Both of you!

808
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:31,405
Listen. I'm really, really sorry,
but we can't go to the cops.

809
00:58:31,506 --> 00:58:33,949
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I have a friend. He's a doctor.

810
00:58:34,049 --> 00:58:35,443
- No.
- Yes. I'm gonna drive you to him.

811
00:58:35,743 --> 00:58:37,497
He's gonna take care of you. Okay?

812
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,982
- No!
- Here. Listen.

813
00:58:41,082 --> 00:58:43,352
Take it. I know it's not enough
for what happened tonight, but...

814
00:58:45,186 --> 00:58:48,123
He's an animal. He should be locked up!

815
00:58:48,423 --> 00:58:50,059
And we're gonna deal with him,
I promise you.

816
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,462
Come on. Get your clothes.
I'm gonna take you to the doctor.

817
00:58:54,562 --> 00:58:56,895
- No!
- Easy. Here we go.

818
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:59,051
No.

819
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:11,046
I'll never forgive you for this. Never!

820
00:59:15,452 --> 00:59:18,051
What's the problem?

821
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:24,061
Jesus Christ! Why don't I know
anything about this?

822
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:27,264
- And when did it happen?
- A couple of weeks ago.

823
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:30,367
We decided to keep it to ourselves
'cause that's the kind of friends we are.

824
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:33,403
Don't lecture me, all right?
Especially about friendship.

825
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:36,407
Yeah, yeah, right. Sorry. I meant
to give you the cokehead rapist lecture.

826
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:37,474
Fuck you.

827
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,712
You can see how I think
you'd be involved in this.

828
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,411
I need to say something.

829
01:00:05,604 --> 01:00:08,041
Oh, shit.

830
01:00:29,563 --> 01:00:30,897
You had that coming!

831
01:00:30,997 --> 01:00:32,933
- Hey, come on! Get up!
- Relax. Take it easy.

832
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:34,205
You son of a bitch.

833
01:00:34,406 --> 01:00:38,628
You recorded everything
that went on here. Every woman...

834
01:00:39,228 --> 01:00:43,578
Not every. Not always.
Just... sometimes.

835
01:00:45,696 --> 01:00:48,850
- At least I don't cheat on my wife.
- No, you just watch us and beat off.

836
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:51,954
- You sick fuck.
- You're a sick fuck!

837
01:00:55,123 --> 01:00:57,275
Luke, did you record last night?

838
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,128
No.

839
01:01:00,228 --> 01:01:03,699
You didn't say you were coming,
which is against your rules.

840
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:08,438
And that wasn't the first time
you broke your own rules, by the way.

841
01:01:09,738 --> 01:01:12,875
Now you're scared, aren't you?

842
01:01:12,975 --> 01:01:15,478
Now you know I've documented pretty much
everything you've been up to here.

843
01:01:19,315 --> 01:01:23,336
No worries, Vincent. I'll keep
my mouth shut, like I always do.

844
01:01:24,411 --> 01:01:28,860
Did you see anything that can help us
out here? Anything at all?

845
01:01:30,593 --> 01:01:35,834
If all the people who've been hurt
and cheated on find out the truth,

846
01:01:36,933 --> 01:01:39,270
what do you think'll happen, Vincent?

847
01:02:01,226 --> 01:02:03,294
What's the matter?

848
01:02:03,394 --> 01:02:07,532
- I just don't feel like leaving tomorrow.
- Serious? You love skiing.

849
01:02:07,632 --> 01:02:10,969
Yes, I love to ski,
but just not by myself.

850
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,602
Are you sure you can't come?

851
01:02:12,702 --> 01:02:17,410
Babe, you know I can't come.
I can't just take off right now.

852
01:02:18,177 --> 01:02:21,202
Hey. I'll call you every day.

853
01:02:22,915 --> 01:02:23,950
I love you.

854
01:02:34,361 --> 01:02:38,698
- I know the drill. One hour, right?
- Wrong. Have a blast. Don't mind me.

855
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:40,934
Why should tonight be any different
from the past few months?

856
01:02:41,034 --> 01:02:44,538
Alison, if it's all right with you,
I'd rather not spoil tonight.

857
01:02:44,638 --> 01:02:48,409
I'm sure it must be tempting
to grab something shiny and new.

858
01:02:48,509 --> 01:02:51,145
But do you ever think about
what you might stand to lose, Chris?

859
01:02:51,245 --> 01:02:53,781
You could ruin a lot more
than just this evening.

860
01:02:54,582 --> 01:02:56,585
Tell me. Are you so happy, Alison?

861
01:03:03,257 --> 01:03:05,192
Well, what do you know?
If it's for charity,

862
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:08,998
my mother-in-law is allowed
to join the party for a little while.

863
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:13,301
Heard anything about
the waterfront project?

864
01:03:13,401 --> 01:03:16,037
No. He's gonna call
once he gets his permits.

865
01:03:16,137 --> 01:03:19,107
Now, as far as I know,
everything's approved.

866
01:03:19,207 --> 01:03:21,778
- Really?
- Yeah.

867
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:33,555
Good evening, gentlemen. Ladies,
you look absolutely ravishing tonight.

868
01:03:33,656 --> 01:03:35,424
- Thank you.
- This is Vincent Stevens.

869
01:03:35,524 --> 01:03:38,828
He's the architect who designed
the new loft building near the sports arena.

870
01:03:38,928 --> 01:03:40,797
Oh, wonderful. I love that building.

871
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:43,233
Why, thank you, Mrs. Kotkin.
I really appreciate that.

872
01:03:44,034 --> 01:03:46,737
As I was saying to your husband
in San Diego,

873
01:03:47,437 --> 01:03:51,508
gentlemen in our business
can't afford to be exposed

874
01:03:51,608 --> 01:03:53,911
to the negative consequences
of bad design.

875
01:03:54,411 --> 01:03:58,548
Speaking of... San Diego, how's that
waterfront project coming along?

876
01:03:58,849 --> 01:04:01,452
Yes. We're still working on it.

877
01:04:01,552 --> 01:04:03,654
We've applied for all our permits
and now we're waiting.

878
01:04:03,754 --> 01:04:05,990
Standing in line like everyone else.

879
01:04:06,891 --> 01:04:11,079
You don't strike me as the type of man
that stands in line, Mr. Fry.

880
01:04:11,179 --> 01:04:14,231
What about you, Mr. Kotkin?
Are you a gambling man?

881
01:04:14,331 --> 01:04:16,901
And you, Mr. Stevens?
You like to take chances?

882
01:04:17,002 --> 01:04:22,040
As a matter of fact, I do. Especially
when I'm holding a handful of hearts.

883
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,798
Anyway, I don't mean to interrupt.

884
01:04:23,898 --> 01:04:26,778
Ladies, if you're as lucky on the tables
tonight as you are in love,

885
01:04:26,878 --> 01:04:30,949
then I am sure you'll hit your jackpots.
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.

886
01:04:57,344 --> 01:04:58,248
Blackjack!

887
01:04:59,746 --> 01:05:03,483
- Set aside enough for the "ali-money."
- Mimi, what are you doin' here?

888
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:05,511
Just 'cause I booted you out
doesn't mean I'm stuck at home.

889
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:09,289
I want to come back.
I know I screwed up once. Once.

890
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:12,394
But I was drunk off my ass.
I swear it didn't mean a damn thing.

891
01:05:12,494 --> 01:05:16,130
Something I don't understand about men.
If it doesn't mean anything, why bother?

892
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:18,533
- I promise I'll change.
- Into what? A frog?

893
01:05:18,633 --> 01:05:21,101
Certainly not a prince.
How about the ass you already are?

894
01:05:21,201 --> 01:05:24,239
What if I told you I wanted
to fuck around tonight? Sorry.

895
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,325
It would hurt like hell, wouldn't it?
Hey, maybe I already got even.

896
01:05:27,826 --> 01:05:30,613
Maybe with one of your pals.
Maybe Chris. He's cute.

897
01:05:30,713 --> 01:05:34,215
Or how about Vincent? The night you sent him
over for that tragic heart-to-heart.

898
01:05:34,315 --> 01:05:37,274
"Marty's really suffering, man.
Mimi, you've gotta talk to him."

899
01:05:38,419 --> 01:05:40,088
Blackjack!

900
01:05:40,188 --> 01:05:42,908
Well, look at that, Tubs.
Your first-ever winning streak.

901
01:05:43,008 --> 01:05:46,429
Just remember, dear heart...
half of it is mine.

902
01:05:52,969 --> 01:05:55,071
I love you!

903
01:05:55,171 --> 01:05:57,506
- You gave Zoe a ticket for tonight?
- Philip, let go.

904
01:05:57,606 --> 01:05:59,843
I keep her away from bullshit like this,
and then behind my back...

905
01:05:59,943 --> 01:06:02,579
Christ, Phil, she's almost 20 years old.
What are you, her father?

906
01:06:02,679 --> 01:06:05,148
Did you see her? She looks like a whore.

907
01:06:05,548 --> 01:06:08,207
- I thought you like whores.
- Yeah.

908
01:06:08,307 --> 01:06:09,720
Let her have some fun.
If you'll excuse me

909
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:11,621
I'm about to have some fun too.
I'm kind of on a roll.

910
01:06:11,721 --> 01:06:12,689
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

911
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:14,111
I hope you win big-time.

912
01:06:14,211 --> 01:06:17,527
You'll need it with all the shit
you've been packin' up your nostrils.

913
01:06:17,627 --> 01:06:20,465
So you noticed a tiny fraction
of your stash went missing?

914
01:06:20,765 --> 01:06:22,786
If you don't like it,
file for a divorce.

915
01:06:22,887 --> 01:06:26,470
I haven't ruled that out.
Don't forget about our prenup, loser.

916
01:06:26,704 --> 01:06:28,236
While you're at it
go play some blackjack.

917
01:06:28,336 --> 01:06:31,209
Could be your last best chance
at paying the rent.

918
01:06:31,309 --> 01:06:33,812
Can I get some dice over here?

919
01:06:37,348 --> 01:06:38,617
- Hands off.
- Excuse me.

920
01:07:12,885 --> 01:07:14,589
Anne?

921
01:07:16,256 --> 01:07:18,125
Anne?

922
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:22,876
We need to talk.

923
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:25,999
Yeah? About what?

924
01:07:26,099 --> 01:07:28,736
Your pal the architect.
He's playing with fire.

925
01:07:30,304 --> 01:07:32,774
I'd actually rather talk about Anne.

926
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:43,752
I'll pass along your message to Vincent,
but I'd like something too, Mr. Kotkin.

927
01:07:45,521 --> 01:07:47,823
I'd like for you to stop seeing Anne.

928
01:07:47,923 --> 01:07:51,160
- And why would I do that?
- Because I love her.

929
01:07:52,628 --> 01:07:54,630
Then we have more in common
than we thought.

930
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:56,766
I'd like you to stop paying her.
I want you to let her go.

931
01:07:56,866 --> 01:08:00,603
That's really not up to me.
Fact is, it's totally her choice.

932
01:08:00,803 --> 01:08:03,502
Except I never paid for her.

933
01:08:03,603 --> 01:08:05,322
Well, that's true.

934
01:08:05,422 --> 01:08:07,243
You never paid.

935
01:08:07,543 --> 01:08:09,600
Stop it, Joel.

936
01:08:13,182 --> 01:08:15,268
I'm going.

937
01:08:17,917 --> 01:08:20,066
What did he mean by that...
"You never paid"?

938
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:22,959
- I don't want to love you, Chris.
- Someone's paying you to be with me?

939
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:25,863
- You're the only one who can hurt me.
- Anne?

940
01:08:26,263 --> 01:08:28,232
Tell me it's a lie.

941
01:08:30,433 --> 01:08:33,420
The first time, it was paid for.

942
01:08:33,904 --> 01:08:35,973
Every other time,
that was real, that was me.

943
01:08:36,786 --> 01:08:39,810
- But who paid?
- I can't...

944
01:08:52,157 --> 01:08:54,993
- Excuse me. Come on, Zoe, let's go.
- I'm fine here.

945
01:08:55,193 --> 01:08:58,096
- I'm asking you to come with me.
- And I'm asking you to stop.

946
01:08:58,196 --> 01:08:59,897
- Did you not hear the lady?
- Mind your business.

947
01:09:00,198 --> 01:09:03,903
- Stop!
- What are you deaf or just a dick?

948
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:06,939
I don't know, man.
What does it say up here?

949
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:09,408
"Deaf" or "dick"? Help me out.

950
01:09:10,409 --> 01:09:13,060
Stop! Leave him alone! Don't! Don't!

951
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:18,318
Fuck! Come on!

952
01:09:18,418 --> 01:09:20,019
Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me.

953
01:09:20,617 --> 01:09:24,392
- Shut up!
- Somebody get this guy an ambulance.

954
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:28,094
I never want to see you again.

955
01:09:28,194 --> 01:09:32,132
Not in my home and not near
my daughter. Do you got that?

956
01:09:32,232 --> 01:09:34,702
Get him the hell out of here.

957
01:09:34,802 --> 01:09:37,772
Okay, folks! Let's get back
to the gaming tables, shall we?

958
01:09:41,269 --> 01:09:43,315
Hey. It's okay.

959
01:09:50,418 --> 01:09:52,921
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, it's okay.

960
01:10:00,161 --> 01:10:03,598
- It's not what you're thinking.
- And what am I thinking?

961
01:10:03,798 --> 01:10:05,834
She's my friend's sister. Okay?

962
01:10:06,034 --> 01:10:10,967
Are there more besides me, her
and your wife? What's the grand total?

963
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:15,410
Look, I can't have this conversation here.
Barbara's standing right over there.

964
01:10:16,124 --> 01:10:18,260
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

965
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,951
- I'm crazy about you.
- But would you choose me if you could?

966
01:10:23,204 --> 01:10:25,658
You know it's not that simple.

967
01:10:25,758 --> 01:10:29,727
Come meet me in the loft tomorrow,
okay, and we'll talk it through.

968
01:10:30,592 --> 01:10:33,230
You're right. It's not that simple.

969
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:36,700
- But maybe I can make it simple.
- What do you mean?

970
01:10:38,502 --> 01:10:40,771
Maybe I can help you make that choice.

971
01:10:41,344 --> 01:10:43,145
Sarah.

972
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:48,746
Sarah.

973
01:10:54,151 --> 01:10:56,280
Sarah.

974
01:10:58,556 --> 01:11:00,181
Sarah.

975
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:05,297
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

976
01:11:05,397 --> 01:11:07,866
Don't do it, Sarah. You'll regret it.

977
01:11:35,995 --> 01:11:38,510
They found out.

978
01:11:42,101 --> 01:11:44,838
Our wives, they... they set us up.

979
01:11:44,938 --> 01:11:46,440
Why, Vincent?

980
01:11:47,098 --> 01:11:49,377
They...

981
01:11:49,477 --> 01:11:52,612
They found out.
They found out about the loft.

982
01:11:52,712 --> 01:11:55,383
Why would you do it, Vincent?
We're your friends.

983
01:11:57,518 --> 01:12:00,597
- No.
- Why did you do it?

984
01:12:03,257 --> 01:12:04,225
No.

985
01:12:04,325 --> 01:12:07,361
It was... our wives.
They... They found out.

986
01:12:07,462 --> 01:12:10,899
No, it's your friends. We found out.

987
01:12:15,837 --> 01:12:19,127
- What's going on?
- You still don't get it.

988
01:12:26,549 --> 01:12:29,781
- All right, strip him.
- What are you doing?

989
01:12:29,881 --> 01:12:32,888
- You are a total fucking psychopath.
- I did what you told me.

990
01:12:32,988 --> 01:12:35,442
- I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open!
- That wasn't a part of the plan.

991
01:12:35,542 --> 01:12:38,260
And the Latin on the bed? Like the cops
are gonna believe that bullshit.

992
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,715
- Then you should've done it yourself.
- Come on. Let's do this.

993
01:12:41,664 --> 01:12:45,568
- What'd you give me?
- What you deserve.

994
01:12:51,852 --> 01:12:53,676
You...

995
01:12:54,077 --> 01:12:55,880
You killed Sarah?

996
01:12:57,147 --> 01:13:00,717
- No. We just found her.
- What?

997
01:13:01,018 --> 01:13:04,488
We were here this morning, Vincent,
before you arrived.

998
01:13:06,356 --> 01:13:08,393
No.

999
01:13:20,371 --> 01:13:22,424
Jesus Christ.

1000
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:25,577
At first I thought she was sleeping.

1001
01:13:25,677 --> 01:13:27,913
And Vincent knows her?

1002
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:32,885
She... She left him this.

1003
01:13:37,489 --> 01:13:39,525
"See you in the next life."

1004
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:44,597
Why did she have to do it here?
We gotta call the cops.

1005
01:13:44,897 --> 01:13:47,274
They investigate suicides.
This is all gonna come out.

1006
01:13:47,374 --> 01:13:52,004
Guys, wait. Can't we find out where
she lives and... and leave her there?

1007
01:13:52,104 --> 01:13:53,173
- Jesus.
- Philip.

1008
01:13:53,273 --> 01:13:55,341
- Come on, we have to help out Vince.
- Yes. Speaking of which,

1009
01:13:55,441 --> 01:13:58,111
where the fuck is Vince?
Isn't this his problem?

1010
01:14:01,147 --> 01:14:04,785
Vincent isn't here because...
because I didn't call him.

1011
01:14:04,885 --> 01:14:06,921
You didn't call him?
Why didn't you call him?

1012
01:14:08,522 --> 01:14:10,417
There's something I have to show you.

1013
01:14:14,261 --> 01:14:16,464
You've been taping us?
You fucking pervert!

1014
01:14:16,564 --> 01:14:18,298
You can beat the crap out of me later.

1015
01:14:18,799 --> 01:14:22,137
We don't have much time,
and you need to watch this.

1016
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:26,274
Maybe you'll get a new perspective
on what happened upstairs.

1017
01:14:26,374 --> 01:14:31,113
Maybe you'll agree we shouldn't
take the hit for Vincent's fuckup.

1018
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:35,249
You see, Vincent...

1019
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:38,915
Vincent hasn't always
been a good friend.

1020
01:14:58,374 --> 01:14:59,743
No.

1021
01:15:00,143 --> 01:15:01,683
Oh, God!

1022
01:15:03,146 --> 01:15:04,480
Hey, maybe I already got even.

1023
01:15:04,981 --> 01:15:08,985
Or maybe Vincent, the night you sent him
over for that tragic heart-to-heart.

1024
01:15:09,185 --> 01:15:11,588
They got here late,
the night he went to talk to her.

1025
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:16,661
She was drunk, Marty. He took advantage.

1026
01:15:31,609 --> 01:15:34,951
Wow. Your little sister's seriously hot.

1027
01:15:38,183 --> 01:15:39,417
Hey.

1028
01:15:39,817 --> 01:15:41,119
- How long has it been...
- Doesn't matter.

1029
01:15:41,219 --> 01:15:42,301
How long?

1030
01:15:45,057 --> 01:15:49,296
He started seeing her right after your
wedding. They met here on a regular basis.

1031
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:53,566
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.

1032
01:15:54,966 --> 01:15:56,836
Fuck!

1033
01:16:11,251 --> 01:16:12,696
Gorgeous?

1034
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:17,324
The people you love,
they're the only ones who can hurt you.

1035
01:16:26,667 --> 01:16:28,636
He paid Anne...

1036
01:16:29,036 --> 01:16:31,204
to let you seduce her,

1037
01:16:31,304 --> 01:16:34,107
put the hook in
so you'd want a share of the loft.

1038
01:16:34,207 --> 01:16:36,109
The first time, it was paid for.

1039
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:38,090
Have fun.

1040
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:41,957
Chris, please. You don't know
the half of it. All right? Just go home.

1041
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:47,222
He used her, Chris.
Just like he used everyone.

1042
01:16:48,824 --> 01:16:50,559
Everyone.

1043
01:17:07,877 --> 01:17:09,645
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

1044
01:17:09,745 --> 01:17:14,213
Vincent can't sense anything is up when he
walks in. We have to try and remain calm.

1045
01:17:14,313 --> 01:17:15,985
We're gonna get questioned by the cops.

1046
01:17:16,085 --> 01:17:18,889
That's why we can never admit
we're sharing this loft.

1047
01:17:18,989 --> 01:17:21,058
They'll try to turn us
against each other.

1048
01:17:22,793 --> 01:17:26,597
Okay. I think this can work
as long as we follow the plan.

1049
01:17:27,664 --> 01:17:29,467
Chris?

1050
01:17:31,501 --> 01:17:33,670
Okay. I'm in.

1051
01:17:33,971 --> 01:17:36,373
But only if we know for sure
that Vincent was here last night.

1052
01:17:36,473 --> 01:17:40,978
I wanna hear him say it.
And if he does, I'll go through with it.

1053
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:45,850
I'll give a signal...
break something, a glass.

1054
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:50,389
But nothing happens until we know
for sure. Understood?

1055
01:17:52,656 --> 01:17:55,860
We've got just under two hours
to set everything up and establish alibis.

1056
01:17:55,961 --> 01:18:01,033
I'll take care of it. You guys get out
of here. Make sure people see you.

1057
01:18:01,133 --> 01:18:03,769
- You have the suicide note, right?
- I've got it.

1058
01:18:03,869 --> 01:18:07,706
You knew what that prick was up to
and you never said anything.

1059
01:18:07,806 --> 01:18:09,835
You're just as sick as Vincent.

1060
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:27,707
They met here on a regular basis.

1061
01:18:40,574 --> 01:18:43,611
Vincent hasn't always
been a good friend.

1062
01:18:57,458 --> 01:19:00,195
He started seeing her
right after your wedding.

1063
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:23,153
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.

1064
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,296
You are a total fucking psychopath.

1065
01:19:33,396 --> 01:19:35,766
- I did what you told me.
- I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open!

1066
01:19:35,866 --> 01:19:37,602
That wasn't a part of the plan.
And the Latin on the bed?

1067
01:19:37,703 --> 01:19:39,421
Like the cops are gonna
believe that bullshit.

1068
01:19:44,374 --> 01:19:45,877
What happened here?

1069
01:19:47,344 --> 01:19:49,504
You're framing me!

1070
01:19:53,316 --> 01:19:56,653
Swallow it. Swallow. Swallow.

1071
01:19:57,454 --> 01:19:59,324
My own friends.

1072
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,063
My own friends!

1073
01:20:19,711 --> 01:20:22,348
- Am I gonna die?
- No, Vincent, you're not gonna die.

1074
01:20:23,349 --> 01:20:25,450
Sarah lured you here and drugged you.

1075
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:29,055
Then she killed herself, with you
by her side. "Fate will unite us."

1076
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:32,646
But you're gonna survive.

1077
01:20:33,893 --> 01:20:35,329
'Cause we're friends, aren't we?

1078
01:20:50,877 --> 01:20:52,680
So, you see, it was a setup.

1079
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:56,417
Sarah and I were set up.
The whole thing was staged.

1080
01:20:56,517 --> 01:20:58,519
Still sounds a little unbelievable.
Don't you think?

1081
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:00,521
- Unbelievable? But it's the truth.
- Yeah.

1082
01:21:00,621 --> 01:21:03,975
My line of work, you gotta prove the truth,
and you prove it with facts and findings.

1083
01:21:04,075 --> 01:21:07,328
Fact is, we only found your prints
and those of Sarah Deakins.

1084
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:09,997
Yeah, because they wiped
the place clean.

1085
01:21:10,197 --> 01:21:13,968
And we have the DVDs of all your sexual
exploits with your prints all over them.

1086
01:21:14,068 --> 01:21:16,805
Luke made those DVDs. I never even
saw 'em, let alone touched 'em.

1087
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:19,374
Yeah, but we got no DVDs
of your friends.

1088
01:21:19,475 --> 01:21:23,111
No DVDs of Marty's wife.
No DVDs of Philip's sister.

1089
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:27,082
No DVDs of Chris's girlfriend. All right?
Facts and findings, Mr. Stevens.

1090
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:30,920
And we got no evidence
that you were being set up.

1091
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:34,156
All right. Is there anything
we've forgotten?

1092
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:37,226
Yeah. To follow the fuckin' plan.
Why didn't you just handcuff her?

1093
01:21:37,326 --> 01:21:39,976
- She was already dead.
- That's still no reason to mutilate her.

1094
01:21:40,076 --> 01:21:42,698
She killed herself!
I just made it more dramatic.

1095
01:21:42,798 --> 01:21:45,402
Yeah, well, you better hope
your dramatics don't put us in jail.

1096
01:21:55,379 --> 01:21:59,449
Look, just... lean on 'em a little bit.
Marty will break. Maybe Luke too.

1097
01:21:59,549 --> 01:22:01,541
Look, don't tell me how to do my work.

1098
01:22:01,641 --> 01:22:04,354
We've questioned them all. I got no reason
to believe they've been lying.

1099
01:22:04,554 --> 01:22:08,275
- Plus, all your friends have alibis.
- Alibis? Not for this morning, they don't.

1100
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:11,879
We got Luke Seacord and Chris Vanowen
together at breakfast.

1101
01:22:11,979 --> 01:22:14,469
We got Marty Landry at his office.
All right?

1102
01:22:14,569 --> 01:22:19,571
At his office? Look, for at least an hour
this morning, we were all in the loft.

1103
01:22:19,671 --> 01:22:21,472
So was Phil. What about Phil?

1104
01:22:21,572 --> 01:22:24,375
Actually, he's downstairs right now
with his father-in-law.

1105
01:22:24,475 --> 01:22:26,577
Fry? What the fuck's Fry doing here?

1106
01:22:26,677 --> 01:22:29,847
He just gave a statement saying
that he was with his son-in-law all day.

1107
01:22:30,148 --> 01:22:32,184
That is bullshit!
That is a false statement!

1108
01:22:32,284 --> 01:22:35,243
And why would he lie?
Hiram Fry brings a lot of credibility.

1109
01:22:35,343 --> 01:22:40,359
Credibili... I saw Fry in San Diego
with some bimbo! Okay?

1110
01:22:40,459 --> 01:22:44,496
Phil knew that. He knew I pressured Fry
into giving me a waterfront contract.

1111
01:22:44,796 --> 01:22:46,966
So you tried to blackmail Hiram Fry?

1112
01:22:49,269 --> 01:22:50,903
Mr. Stevens, enough of this crap.

1113
01:22:51,003 --> 01:22:53,939
We got your prints all over the DVDs.
We got 'em all over the knife.

1114
01:22:54,039 --> 01:22:56,710
We got you chained next
to the dead girl on the bed. All right?

1115
01:22:56,810 --> 01:23:00,648
Call your lawyer, make a confession
and save your ass!

1116
01:23:12,192 --> 01:23:14,995
You're free to go. I want
to thank you for your cooperation.

1117
01:23:15,095 --> 01:23:17,665
You understand we had
to check out your friend's story.

1118
01:23:17,965 --> 01:23:20,435
Of course. It's your job.

1119
01:23:24,748 --> 01:23:26,747
There's just...

1120
01:23:27,241 --> 01:23:28,910
one thing that's bothering me.

1121
01:23:30,912 --> 01:23:34,149
Why does Vincent Stevens
keep accusing his best friends?

1122
01:23:37,018 --> 01:23:40,656
I... I don't know. It bothers me too.

1123
01:23:42,924 --> 01:23:46,494
Could it be... I just...
I just wonder...

1124
01:23:46,595 --> 01:23:48,163
Do you think he's trying
to hide something else?

1125
01:23:50,867 --> 01:23:54,503
- What would he be hiding?
- Sarah Deakins's murder.

1126
01:23:56,906 --> 01:23:57,941
Murder?

1127
01:24:00,176 --> 01:24:03,246
But the detective in the interrogation
called it a suicide.

1128
01:24:03,346 --> 01:24:04,658
Well, that's what it looked like.

1129
01:24:04,758 --> 01:24:08,105
But the autopsy report revealed
that sleeping pills didn't kill her.

1130
01:24:08,205 --> 01:24:11,154
And her wrist was cut, but not by Sarah.

1131
01:24:11,254 --> 01:24:14,124
Hesitation marks,
those tentative attempts...

1132
01:24:14,224 --> 01:24:16,692
the first ones before a suicide
actually slashes through an artery...

1133
01:24:16,793 --> 01:24:18,195
The coroner didn't find those on her.

1134
01:24:20,798 --> 01:24:24,168
- But Vincent, he... he would never...
- His prints are on the knife.

1135
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:30,175
We didn't find a suicide note.

1136
01:24:36,548 --> 01:24:37,864
Is there something wrong?

1137
01:25:32,773 --> 01:25:35,343
We didn't find a suicide note.

1138
01:25:35,943 --> 01:25:39,481
- You have the suicide note, right?
- I've got it.

1139
01:26:16,585 --> 01:26:18,354
Luke.

1140
01:26:19,255 --> 01:26:21,726
Chris. You scared me.

1141
01:26:24,494 --> 01:26:28,833
- You sure it's smart meeting here?
- I think we have a problem, Luke.

1142
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,570
- How so?
- Where's Sarah's suicide note?

1143
01:26:34,972 --> 01:26:35,873
You put it in your pocket.

1144
01:26:35,973 --> 01:26:39,097
Yeah, I could've sworn I did,
but it's not there anymore.

1145
01:26:39,197 --> 01:26:41,545
So when did you steal it from my coat?

1146
01:26:42,246 --> 01:26:44,957
When the doorbell rang this morning?

1147
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:47,411
Surprise visit from the Realtor?

1148
01:26:48,586 --> 01:26:50,821
Chris, it's...

1149
01:26:50,922 --> 01:26:54,758
it's unfortunate that you lost
Sarah's suicide note, but...

1150
01:26:54,858 --> 01:26:57,095
I had nothing to do with that.

1151
01:26:57,195 --> 01:27:01,233
I called the agency to ask
who put our loft up for sale.

1152
01:27:01,433 --> 01:27:03,903
All they could give me was a number.

1153
01:27:18,451 --> 01:27:21,459
I did call them. I wanted...

1154
01:27:21,954 --> 01:27:24,489
I thought maybe that...

1155
01:27:32,933 --> 01:27:37,003
It's over, Chris. We pulled it off.
We've got nothing to worry about now.

1156
01:27:37,204 --> 01:27:38,639
But why'd that note disappear?

1157
01:27:40,357 --> 01:27:42,310
The only real proof of her suicide.

1158
01:28:01,095 --> 01:28:02,097
Hello?

1159
01:28:02,197 --> 01:28:04,331
She says she's got an appointment
with someone named Sarah Deakins.

1160
01:28:04,432 --> 01:28:06,268
Who's Sarah Deakins?

1161
01:28:17,646 --> 01:28:20,850
Is it because maybe she didn't write it?
Maybe it's your handwriting.

1162
01:28:21,984 --> 01:28:23,886
Vincent fucked us all. You saw.

1163
01:28:23,986 --> 01:28:27,089
Yeah, I saw. All the DVDs
that made everybody crazy

1164
01:28:27,189 --> 01:28:29,726
went right along
with your grand plan, didn't it?

1165
01:28:29,826 --> 01:28:33,330
But why, Luke?
What'd you do to that girl?

1166
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:37,635
Did she get in your way,
between you and Vincent?

1167
01:28:39,569 --> 01:28:41,939
Actually, it was Vincent...

1168
01:28:42,105 --> 01:28:44,442
standing between us.

1169
01:28:56,653 --> 01:28:57,755
Is there someone else?

1170
01:29:01,325 --> 01:29:03,895
I'm not cheating on you, Ellie.

1171
01:29:12,237 --> 01:29:14,572
Sarah, wait!

1172
01:29:14,672 --> 01:29:17,613
Forget Vincent.
He is better at games than you.

1173
01:29:17,713 --> 01:29:20,246
Always was, always will be.

1174
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:22,615
He's hurting you.

1175
01:29:23,315 --> 01:29:26,585
- Using you.
- Why are you telling me this?

1176
01:29:26,685 --> 01:29:30,371
I'm telling you because...
because I'd never hurt you.

1177
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:34,486
If you'd just give me the chance...

1178
01:29:34,586 --> 01:29:36,196
to show I'd never hurt you.

1179
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:41,668
That's right. You'd never hurt me,
because I feel nothing for you, Luke.

1180
01:29:46,539 --> 01:29:48,637
I'm sorry.

1181
01:29:50,410 --> 01:29:52,758
Maybe in another life.

1182
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:13,938
You were here last night.

1183
01:30:14,635 --> 01:30:16,985
Barbara was off skiing.

1184
01:30:17,085 --> 01:30:20,241
So I figured I'd find
Vincent here, with Sarah.

1185
01:30:20,742 --> 01:30:23,054
I'm sorry.

1186
01:30:28,751 --> 01:30:30,854
I waited till he left.

1187
01:30:35,224 --> 01:30:36,993
She said I was right about Vincent.

1188
01:30:43,465 --> 01:30:46,704
Consoling. I've gotten so good at it.

1189
01:31:11,128 --> 01:31:15,867
I gave her an insulin OD.
It's... quick, painless...

1190
01:31:16,467 --> 01:31:18,502
leaves no trace.

1191
01:31:18,602 --> 01:31:20,305
Jesus, Luke.

1192
01:31:24,376 --> 01:31:27,779
I did it out of love. I swear.

1193
01:31:30,449 --> 01:31:33,499
And Vincent taking the fall for this...

1194
01:31:33,818 --> 01:31:35,394
That's okay with you?

1195
01:31:36,277 --> 01:31:39,358
Vincent used everyone and anyone!

1196
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:42,495
It's about time we turned the tables!

1197
01:31:42,902 --> 01:31:45,646
Well, he's being charged with murder.

1198
01:31:46,132 --> 01:31:49,802
Yeah. Sarah wasn't dead
when we left her with Philip.

1199
01:31:51,237 --> 01:31:53,783
No. No, you're lying.

1200
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:55,953
No.

1201
01:31:56,053 --> 01:31:57,411
That's not possible.

1202
01:32:07,587 --> 01:32:11,758
What Philip did to her... was sick!

1203
01:32:12,359 --> 01:32:13,561
You're sick, Luke.

1204
01:32:14,994 --> 01:32:18,265
But if I'm hearing you right,

1205
01:32:18,865 --> 01:32:22,103
it was your brother who killed Sarah.

1206
01:32:28,576 --> 01:32:32,413
Okay, Chris. Go home.

1207
01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:33,615
I'll clean up.

1208
01:32:34,816 --> 01:32:36,085
Like always.

1209
01:32:37,386 --> 01:32:39,221
No.

1210
01:32:40,456 --> 01:32:42,224
No more cleaning up, Luke.

1211
01:32:51,534 --> 01:32:53,035
- Step outside.
- No, Luke.

1212
01:32:53,335 --> 01:32:54,631
Now.

1213
01:32:57,574 --> 01:32:59,610
Jesus. Let me help you, Luke. Please!

1214
01:33:01,443 --> 01:33:04,314
- You're gonna kill me too?
- It's your own fault.

1215
01:33:06,883 --> 01:33:09,986
- What do you want me to do? Jump?
- Yes. If you don't mind.

1216
01:33:10,086 --> 01:33:11,621
Luke, you don't need to do this.

1217
01:33:11,722 --> 01:33:13,957
Jesus Christ, Luke! Would you stop it!

1218
01:33:14,557 --> 01:33:17,361
I don't want to hurt you, Chris.
I really don't.

1219
01:33:17,862 --> 01:33:20,932
So just do it. Now!

1220
01:33:25,602 --> 01:33:29,372
I called the cops before I came.
I told 'em everything.

1221
01:33:29,506 --> 01:33:33,195
- Bullshit. I know you better.
- I thought I knew you.

1222
01:33:39,084 --> 01:33:42,754
What about the note?
You want this to go down with me too?

1223
01:33:44,056 --> 01:33:45,908
Give me that note, Chris.

1224
01:33:46,008 --> 01:33:48,061
Give it to me!

1225
01:34:23,597 --> 01:34:24,731
It's over, Luke.

1226
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:31,706
You're right.

1227
01:34:32,506 --> 01:34:33,608
It is over.

1228
01:34:42,816 --> 01:34:45,353
Tell Ellie and the kids...

1229
01:34:46,487 --> 01:34:48,506
I'm sorry.

1230
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:51,600
Would you do that for me, Chris?

1231
01:34:52,127 --> 01:34:55,309
- No.
- Come on, Chris. Be a friend.

1232
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:58,600
Luke? Luke. Luke!

1233
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:01,483
Luke!

1234
01:35:50,188 --> 01:35:52,423
- They're married.
- Honey, no. They're having an affair.

1235
01:35:52,523 --> 01:35:54,226
Why? Because she's laughing
at his jokes?

1236
01:35:54,326 --> 01:35:56,895
No. I'm telling you,
they're having an affair.

1237
01:35:56,995 --> 01:35:59,697
Since when are you
the big expert on affairs?

1238
01:35:59,797 --> 01:36:01,299
Really?

1239
01:36:01,399 --> 01:36:04,236
- Thanks for taking me back, Meems.
- What was my alternative?

1240
01:36:04,336 --> 01:36:07,457
To leave you wailing at the front door,
with snot pouring out of your nose?

1241
01:36:09,241 --> 01:36:10,809
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you off.

1242
01:36:11,010 --> 01:36:12,911
I have the kids early tomorrow,
so I gotta go.

1243
01:36:13,012 --> 01:36:15,422
You're gonna leave me here
alone with my wife?

1244
01:36:15,522 --> 01:36:17,216
- Yes.
- We could at least have one more drink.

1245
01:36:17,616 --> 01:36:18,984
There'll be plenty more drinks.

1246
01:36:19,085 --> 01:36:22,090
- Good night, Meems.
- Good night, Chris.

1247
01:36:39,473 --> 01:36:41,488
Chris.

1248
01:36:43,643 --> 01:36:46,146
- Anne.
- Hi.

1249
01:36:46,747 --> 01:36:48,253
Hi.

1250
01:36:50,584 --> 01:36:54,155
- You look good.
- Thank you. You too.

1251
01:36:55,723 --> 01:36:59,661
Listen, I still have the key.
Do you want it back?

1252
01:37:01,729 --> 01:37:04,765
It wouldn't work anymore.
Vincent's living there alone now.

1253
01:37:04,965 --> 01:37:07,135
It's the only thing
his wife let him keep.

1254
01:37:08,904 --> 01:37:13,116
- And... And Philip?
- He's awaiting trial, so...

1255
01:37:13,717 --> 01:37:15,210
we'll see.

1256
01:37:15,944 --> 01:37:18,013
And you?

1257
01:37:18,714 --> 01:37:20,954
Are you doing okay?

1258
01:37:21,684 --> 01:37:25,454
- Yeah. Most of the time.
- And the rest of the time?

1259
01:37:28,290 --> 01:37:30,861
I heard you ditched the city councilman.

1260
01:37:32,428 --> 01:37:34,999
That's not all I've given up.

1261
01:37:37,074 --> 01:37:39,169
Do you wanna grab a cup of coffee, or...
