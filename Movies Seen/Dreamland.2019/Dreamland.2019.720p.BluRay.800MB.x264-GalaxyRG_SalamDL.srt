00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:54,804
<i>This is
my half-brother's story.</i>

3
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:58,009
<i>I tell it because
it's all I can do</i>

4
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:00,011
<i>with the way
things turned out.</i>

5
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,251
<i>Eugene left me with something more
important than any of the facts.</i>

6
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:12,223
<i>Now, first thing people
get wrong about his story</i>

7
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:14,158
<i>is the beginning.</i>

8
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,961
<i>It didn't start
with the Wells lady.</i>

9
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:21,198
<i>It started with the first
train full of homesteaders.</i>

10
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:27,637
<i>Amongst the heartbroken fearful
who arrived in Bismark on that day</i>

11
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:33,210
<i>were John, Olivia
and Eugene Baker.</i>

12
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,813
<i>The Bakers had moved
their lives West</i>

13
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:39,383
<i>into the Great Plains,
on a promise.</i>

14
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:44,754
<i>A promise that now looked as
rotten as the dirt they stood on.</i>

15
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:50,161
<i>They prayed for rain and began to
build a new life up from scratch.</i>

16
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,265
<i>But John wasn't convinced.</i>

17
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,203
<i>He believed there was something
cursed about this land.</i>

18
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:04,607
<i>Over the next years,
John's drinking worsened...</i>

19
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,743
<i>...and he became paranoid.</i>

20
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,913
<i>His mind filled with visions
of some other life...</i>

21
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:13,350
<i>where he could live
in God's grace again.</i>

22
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:17,887
<i>And just like that,
when Eugene was five years old,</i>

23
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:20,824
- <i>he lost his father.</i>
- You're just leaving?

24
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:27,231
<i>An absence was created that would
haunt him for the rest of his life.</i>

25
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:33,603
<i>Eugene only ever got
one postcard from his father.</i>

26
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:37,208
<i>In it, John claimed
he had found the eye of God</i>

27
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:39,776
<i>in the most beautiful place
on Earth,</i>

28
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:43,147
<i>the Gulf Coast of Mexico.</i>

29
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:48,185
<i>Olivia quickly tried to fill
that absence in Eugene's life,</i>

30
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,155
<i>and a year later
she married George Evans,</i>

31
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:55,392
<i>a county deputy, farmer
and my father.</i>

32
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:58,262
<i>But John Baker
and the world he wrote about</i>

33
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:00,930
<i>were never far
from my brother's mind.</i>

34
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:06,270
<i>He wondered what his father
had really found out there.</i>

35
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:12,842
<i>Then, when Eugene was 17,</i>

36
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:15,412
<i>something else
took his attention.</i>

37
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:21,018
<i>All of ours, for that matter.</i>

38
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,093
<i>Just like the curse John had spoken
of, the land turned on us.</i>

39
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:33,497
<i>My fellow Americans,
I have been on a journey to nine states.</i>

40
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:36,167
<i>Fourteen storms
hit Bismark in the first year.</i>

41
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,570
<i>I saw a group of families
who had lost their wheat crops,</i>

42
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:41,238
<i>lost their corn crops,</i>

43
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:43,407
<i>basically withered
without food.</i>

44
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,909
<i>The more we
tried to start over,</i>

45
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:47,710
<i>the worse they got.</i>

46
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:49,913
<i>And the banks came
for Bismark.</i>

47
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:57,288
<i>Crazy preachers would scream
about God and salvation,</i>

48
00:03:57,421 --> 00:04:00,357
<i>while families did the only
thing they still could...</i>

49
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:04,995
<i>...until they couldn't even
do that anymore.</i>

50
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,301
<i>Eugene hid away
in the abandoned family barn.</i>

51
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,504
<i>He would daydream
about his destiny,</i>

52
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:16,440
<i>fantasizing about a life
like his heroes...</i>

53
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:21,145
<i>...the outlaws and
adventurers he read about.</i>

54
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:26,183
Phoebe, come back here!

55
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:30,120
<i>I suppose no one
warned Eugene about what can happen</i>

56
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:32,456
<i>when you dream about
something so much.</i>

57
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,766
<i>That's how Allison Wells
entered this story...</i>

58
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:49,806
<i>...like a bat out of hell...</i>

59
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,142
<i>headed straight...</i>

60
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,579
<i>for my brother.</i>

61
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:13,830
Roadblock for me,
would you?

62
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,920
Look at this cold bastard.

63
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:40,890
I bet he'd be in bed with a different
broad every night if he were real.

64
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:45,763
I bet he knows exactly the right thing
to say to a girl to make her crazy.

65
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:48,299
That's all it takes really...
words.

66
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,634
Unless you live in a
dead old town like this.

67
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,902
Amen to that.

68
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,205
Hey, what's going on?

69
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:57,474
Harold,
he'll tell you all about it.

70
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,043
- Check it out?
- Mm-hmm.

71
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:02,012
All right, folks, we got
some things need to be said.

72
00:06:02,146 --> 00:06:04,782
So, y'all quiet down now
so that they can be heard.

73
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:06,016
Ma'am?

74
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,385
During their raid
on a Missouri bank,

75
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,189
the thief and murderer,
Allison Wells,

76
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:14,758
sent a nine-year-old
little girl to heaven.

77
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:17,361
Nine years old.

78
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:20,564
And that was just
one of five human souls

79
00:06:20,698 --> 00:06:22,899
that were taken on that day.

80
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,670
If you see this woman,

81
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,105
do not confront her.

82
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:32,242
She will not hesitate
to take another life.

83
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:34,478
Now, all and all,
she's just one little lady

84
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:38,115
with half the Texas law
enforcement trying to find her.

85
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,217
And find her we shall.

86
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:42,720
Is this real, this reward?

87
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:45,356
Ten thousand dollars
if we find her?

88
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,460
You're Deputy Evans' boy,
ain't you?

89
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:52,329
Yes, sir.
He's my stepfather.

90
00:06:52,463 --> 00:06:54,998
Well, I appreciate
your interest, son,

91
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:57,000
but we've already got
all the help we need

92
00:06:57,134 --> 00:07:00,170
from the Evans family,
so just run on home.

93
00:07:01,772 --> 00:07:04,907
Search party meeting
at church after the service.

94
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,644
God and coincidence

95
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:10,214
cannot occupy the same Earth.

96
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,149
We know this,
ladies and gentlemen,

97
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:16,153
for where there is a sign,
there is the hand of God.

98
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:19,957
And our community
is under his palm now.

99
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,592
And now we see why...

100
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,794
women like Allison Wells...

101
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,898
Eugene.

102
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:35,339
What a drag.

103
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:37,674
Ready to go?

104
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,611
Eugene?

105
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:43,013
Hey, Joe.

106
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:46,916
- I want you at home today.
- Why?

107
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,519
With that Wells lady
on the loose,

108
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:50,920
it's not safe
around these parts.

109
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,557
We're going with
the search party, Ma.

110
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,225
We'll be safe.

111
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,529
We'll look after
each other, all right?

112
00:07:58,662 --> 00:07:59,797
You have my word.

113
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,931
Mmm, home by dark.

114
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,933
- Yes, ma'am.
- And stick together.

115
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,369
Give me that.

116
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:07,638
- Can I come?
- No, you cannot.

117
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:09,440
- By dark.
- Yeah.

118
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:13,477
Can you even imagine
having that much money?

119
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,113
I sure as hell can.
Can't you?

120
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,881
No, not really.

121
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:20,717
I bet you actually
can't neither.

122
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:23,220
Fighting words, Evans.

123
00:08:23,353 --> 00:08:25,689
Hell, you best give me your
share so as I don't whup ya.

124
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:29,226
I will die of laughing
before you whip me, boy.

125
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,134
Think we'll
find her dead?

126
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,636
I don't know. Probably.

127
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,077
You okay?

128
00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:51,381
- Hey? What's the matter?
- Nothing.

129
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:53,984
Come on, tell me.
What's up?

130
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,722
We're going to California.

131
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:03,126
They told us this morning.

132
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,329
Said we are giving up
on Texas.

133
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:08,332
Shit, man.

134
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:10,367
How long you going for?

135
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:12,769
Well, forever.

136
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:16,540
I mean, when you think about
it, why would we come back?

137
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,448
Yeah.

138
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:31,221
Guess you'll have to find
someone else to bitch to.

139
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:35,259
Ain't no one I'd rather
bitch to than you, Garza.

140
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:38,997
- Can you handle that?
- Let go, you jackass!

141
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:40,965
No. I gotta
get it in before you go.

142
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:42,332
Yeah.

143
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:44,935
Come get me!
Come get me!

144
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:47,170
I'm gonna miss you, buddy.

145
00:09:47,304 --> 00:09:49,439
Come on! Come on!

146
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:50,707
Let's go!

147
00:09:57,147 --> 00:09:59,049
What you gonna do?

148
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,620
I'm faster than you, boy.

149
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:05,389
I always have been.

150
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,702
You really think we're going
to find her in all this?

151
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,271
It's worth a try.

152
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:42,225
I said "before dark."

153
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,228
George wants to talk to you.

154
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:47,798
You're in trouble.

155
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,268
His request.

156
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,748
You wanted to see me?

157
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:14,791
A mother's word... is law.

158
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:20,597
When a mother tells a son
to do something, he does it.

159
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:22,532
Always.

160
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,601
That's how families work.

161
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:26,803
Good times and bad.

162
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:33,176
We understand each other?

163
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:36,813
Yeah... Uh, yes, sir.

164
00:11:40,751 --> 00:11:42,185
What you got there?

165
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:44,254
Nothing.

166
00:11:44,388 --> 00:11:45,589
Do us both a favor.

167
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:48,525
Don't act like
you think I'm stupid.

168
00:11:56,533 --> 00:12:02,272
What money from what job
did you pay for that garbage?

169
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,878
See, your mother may
let you off easy, but I can't.

170
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:11,748
There's no room for boys
in this family anymore.

171
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,950
Think about that.

172
00:12:17,121 --> 00:12:18,355
Wash up.

173
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:36,206
Lights out.

174
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:39,736
Don't make a sound.

175
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,506
Don't!

176
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:03,961
It's yours if you want it.

177
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:16,506
What's your name?

178
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:23,480
- I'm Allison.
- I know who you are.

179
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:27,884
Well, then it's only fair
that I know who you are.

180
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:31,621
Uh... Eugene.

181
00:14:32,023 --> 00:14:33,456
Eugene.

182
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:37,661
That's a smart name.

183
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:44,101
Ain't that you? Huh?

184
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:48,772
- They said you was a killer.
- I'm not a killer.

185
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:56,346
Eugene...

186
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,616
I'm gonna be
real frank with you.

187
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:01,451
I'm trying
to maintain composure,

188
00:15:01,585 --> 00:15:05,022
but this hole in my leg is hurting
like a motherfucker right now.

189
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:10,127
So, if you help me,
I'll tell you everything. Listen to me.

190
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:11,895
Eugene, listen to me.

191
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:15,765
I'm not a killer.

192
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:22,073
You still wouldn't
believe my story.

193
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:30,014
Just like one of these books.

194
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:36,053
Except I'm the man
in the hat.

195
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:46,630
Wow. Not bad.

196
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:49,933
All right.

197
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:55,239
Oh, Jesus.

198
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:57,108
Looks worse than it is.

199
00:15:57,807 --> 00:15:59,910
All right.
Got steady hands, kid?

200
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:01,811
I think you should
see a doctor or something.

201
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:04,447
No, no, no.
You're my doctor now, okay?

202
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:05,715
Dr. Eugene.

203
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:09,220
- Okay?
- Okay.

204
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,956
Okay. Clean your hands
with that.

205
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:17,827
Okay.

206
00:16:17,962 --> 00:16:19,964
Everything's gonna
be fine, all right?

207
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:23,968
Okay. Get the tweezers.
Clean them.

208
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:27,972
Okay.

209
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:32,143
You sure you didn't
kill nobody?

210
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,614
No.

211
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:40,784
- Okay.
- All right.

212
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:43,287
Uh...

213
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:46,991
Get the, uh... Rinse the alcohol on...
right smack on it.

214
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:49,759
Just pour it all on.

215
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:56,733
Holy shit!

216
00:16:57,234 --> 00:16:58,902
Holy shit!

217
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:03,207
Okay.

218
00:17:03,341 --> 00:17:04,774
Give me the flashlight.

219
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:06,810
Okay.

220
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:08,845
Can you see the bullet?

221
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:12,350
Yeah, yeah. I think so.

222
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:13,850
Okay, take it out.

223
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:16,619
It's okay.

224
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:19,522
Okay.

225
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:22,059
Uh, think of something nice.

226
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,697
Okay. Okay.

227
00:17:40,577 --> 00:17:41,644
Okay.

228
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:50,187
Okay.

229
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:56,793
Okay. Bandage it up.

230
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:05,869
- Okay, I'll hold it on. Yeah.
- Hold it.

231
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:11,908
Okay.

232
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:19,116
You okay?

233
00:18:19,984 --> 00:18:21,152
Yeah.

234
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:23,387
It feels good.

235
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:24,955
That was amazing.

236
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:27,425
Uh, you thirsty?

237
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:29,826
And he's a mind reader too.

238
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:32,997
I'll be right back.

239
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,302
<i>As fate would have it,</i>

240
00:18:38,436 --> 00:18:40,804
<i>Allison had lost her
own family and farm</i>

241
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:43,807
<i>in Missouri one year previous.</i>

242
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,411
<i>Her mother and father had
both succumbed to pneumonia.</i>

243
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:51,614
<i>Now, I have no intention of
painting Allison Wells as a liar,</i>

244
00:18:51,748 --> 00:18:53,117
<i>as others have,</i>

245
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,486
<i>but I will say</i>

246
00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:58,255
<i>she understood
who her audience was</i>

247
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:00,924
<i>and told her story accordingly.</i>

248
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,328
How old are you?

249
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:08,132
Uh, 25.

250
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:12,103
Uh-huh.

251
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:18,976
You got a girlfriend, Mr. 25?

252
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:27,118
Well... park yourself.

253
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:30,121
I guess
I should explain things.

254
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:39,296
I appreciate
your caution, kid, but...

255
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,199
right now, if you wanted,
you could break me in two.

256
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:02,685
It's true I robbed that bank.

257
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:04,255
And it wasn't the first.

258
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:08,993
I never killed anybody.

259
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:16,367
Well, if you didn't,
then who did?

260
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,104
<i>According to the
story Allison told Eugene that night,</i>

261
00:20:20,237 --> 00:20:22,973
<i>she was the victim
of this whole affair.</i>

262
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:28,412
<i>After her land was taken and her
family passed, she became an outlaw.</i>

263
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:31,714
<i>It was her only way
of taking something back.</i>

264
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:33,651
<i>Which brought her</i>

265
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:36,987
<i>to the Guthrie Plains
bank robbery.</i>

266
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:39,190
<i>It had been
her fourth robbery that month,</i>

267
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:42,026
<i>but it was the first
with any loss of life.</i>

268
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,862
<i>The fact, she insisted,
was solely the police's fault.</i>

269
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,498
<i>Those cops, they got scared.</i>

270
00:20:47,631 --> 00:20:49,866
The second we came out of that
bank, they started firing.

271
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,802
Didn't matter that there was still
people on the street and in the sidewalk.

272
00:20:56,674 --> 00:20:59,909
<i>Her claim was
a stray bullet from the police</i>

273
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:02,912
<i>ended the life
of that innocent little girl.</i>

274
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,060
<i>It was straight
out of one of Eugene's stories.</i>

275
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:19,330
- They're hunting me.
- <i>Her...</i>

276
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:22,499
<i>stealing back the memory from a
world that had taken everything...</i>

277
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:25,436
<i>...and left her with nothing...</i>

278
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:27,271
<i>...and no one.</i>

279
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:30,507
That's why I need you,
'cause I don't have anyone else.

280
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:37,014
You can stay here
as long as you need a room.

281
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,150
- As long as you want.
- Thank you.

282
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:46,390
I'm sorry.

283
00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:48,891
It's okay.

284
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,465
Afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
for more than I know is fair.

285
00:21:57,501 --> 00:22:00,537
How much would it be worth to
you to help me get to Mexico?

286
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:03,873
Mexico?

287
00:22:04,475 --> 00:22:06,977
How does $20,000 sound?

288
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:09,513
That's double your bounty.

289
00:22:09,647 --> 00:22:11,015
That's the point.

290
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:12,949
You got that much on you?

291
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,652
I don't have a nickel.

292
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,288
But I know my way around a
bank, even a Mexican one.

293
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:20,857
And I can have you that money
before you even know I'm gone.

294
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,795
All you need to do
is get me a car.

295
00:22:27,364 --> 00:22:29,899
Well, that ain't an
easy thing to get around here.

296
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:31,535
Especially
with an empty wallet.

297
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:34,871
Maybe I'm wrong, but you seem
like a pretty capable fella.

298
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,508
I need a few days
to rest up.

299
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:41,111
And if you apply yourself to our
problem between now and then,

300
00:22:41,245 --> 00:22:43,913
well, then, I'd say we're
in business, wouldn't you?

301
00:22:50,054 --> 00:22:52,089
I've seen your fields, Eugene.

302
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:55,825
I know your family's in trouble,
same as mine was.

303
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,362
I mean, if there's a simpler
way to fix things for you,

304
00:22:58,495 --> 00:23:00,897
I don't have the faintest
what that would be.

305
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,302
I could turn you in.

306
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:19,616
Sure. You could.

307
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,658
But, Eugene, and I say this with
all seriousness and sincerity.

308
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:32,129
If that's the choice you make,
and it is your choice to make,

309
00:23:32,262 --> 00:23:35,532
have no illusions
of the consequences.

310
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,335
I won't be another victim
of their lies.

311
00:23:39,436 --> 00:23:41,572
I'd rather die by my own hand.

312
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:44,441
Or yours.

313
00:23:58,088 --> 00:24:00,624
This is
a land of burden, kid.

314
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:04,528
Right now,
you get to pick yours.

315
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:09,133
Makes you
one of the lucky ones.

316
00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:44,701
- Why are you naked?
- Shh!

317
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:47,337
Okay, but...
what the hell?

318
00:24:47,471 --> 00:24:49,973
Don't worry about it, okay?
And don't swear.

319
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:51,575
I ain't worried.
I'm curious.

320
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:52,942
Don't be.

321
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,546
All right, just go back
to sleep. Come on.

322
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:22,473
You're heading
into town today.

323
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,074
Look for some work.

324
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,576
Take your sister with you.

325
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:27,578
Yes, sir, okay.

326
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:30,113
And gear up.

327
00:25:30,247 --> 00:25:32,583
They're saying
it's a windy one.

328
00:26:03,714 --> 00:26:05,048
Hey.

329
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:09,186
- Hi.
- I thought you might want to change.

330
00:26:16,693 --> 00:26:18,362
It's perfect.

331
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,600
I hope it fits okay.
It's my mother's.

332
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:27,204
She don't wear it much, so
she shouldn't notice it's gone.

333
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:29,239
She'll notice.

334
00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:31,909
Maybe she'll come in here
looking for it.

335
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:34,478
What, in here? No, no.

336
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:37,748
They ain't got much use for
this since the drought started.

337
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:45,155
Okay. Thank you.

338
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,065
Oh, excuse me.

339
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:19,289
- What are you looking at?
- Uh, nothing.

340
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:20,657
You're supposed to
take me to town.

341
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,593
- Yeah, well, I'm busy.
- You ain't.

342
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,029
- I am.
- What were you looking at?

343
00:27:25,162 --> 00:27:27,564
Nothing. I was just seeing how
it looked in there, that's all.

344
00:27:27,698 --> 00:27:28,967
I ain't dumb.
What's in there?

345
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:31,535
Ain't nothing
in there. Christ!

346
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:36,573
Okay, I'll tell you
if you promise me

347
00:27:36,707 --> 00:27:38,842
you ain't gonna go in there
and look for yourself.

348
00:27:38,977 --> 00:27:42,212
I don't want Mama or George going
in there until I clean it up.

349
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:43,680
Clean up what?

350
00:27:43,814 --> 00:27:44,748
You promise?

351
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:46,550
Yeah, tell me.

352
00:27:51,188 --> 00:27:56,460
Two dead dogs. Lying there with their
blood and their guts all in the dirt.

353
00:27:56,961 --> 00:27:58,428
Flies all around.

354
00:27:59,063 --> 00:28:00,731
Dogs? Whose dogs?

355
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:02,933
Nobody's.

356
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:04,501
The blue yonder's.

357
00:28:05,302 --> 00:28:06,770
What killed 'em?

358
00:28:07,571 --> 00:28:09,306
Coyotes or something.
How should I know?

359
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,575
That's sad.

360
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:13,777
That's life.

361
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:16,146
Wait, where you going now?

362
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,748
Going to meet Joe Garza.

363
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:21,119
- What about? Can I come?
- Nothing and no.

364
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:24,755
Hey, Eugene

365
00:28:28,158 --> 00:28:30,761
Why the hell you drag me
out here, Evans?

366
00:28:36,566 --> 00:28:39,236
I got some private words
for you, Garza.

367
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:44,142
You know, I thought we was
gonna look for that woman today.

368
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:46,978
So I got up
butt-crack of dawn.

369
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:48,779
And then
you don't even show.

370
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:51,348
Now this.

371
00:28:54,184 --> 00:28:55,919
How long have I known you?

372
00:28:56,054 --> 00:28:59,489
- Years and years, by my count.
- You stand by me.

373
00:28:59,623 --> 00:29:02,225
And in those years,
I've gone and trusted you.

374
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:06,630
Okay? And that's why what I'm
about to ask might seem unfair,

375
00:29:06,763 --> 00:29:09,266
but it could save
both our necks.

376
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:13,770
Spit it out.

377
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:19,977
I need your family's truck...

378
00:29:20,111 --> 00:29:21,645
for good.

379
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:24,715
I'll send you the money
as soon as I get to Mexico.

380
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:29,453
You getting stupid
on me, Eugene?

381
00:29:29,586 --> 00:29:31,321
We are leaving in it
next week.

382
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:33,790
What the hell's going on?

383
00:29:33,924 --> 00:29:36,693
I can't tell you everything right
now, but I've met somebody.

384
00:29:36,827 --> 00:29:39,296
And they're gonna pay me
20,000 to get them to Mexico.

385
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:41,364
Twenty-thousand!
Do you believe it?

386
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:43,867
No, Evans, I don't.

387
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:47,471
And even if I did, shit,
I'd tell you to eat a toad.

388
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:52,409
If you're saying
what I think you're saying,

389
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,311
then me just saying it
could wind me dead.

390
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:55,879
No, no, no.
No one's gonna wind up dead.

391
00:29:56,013 --> 00:29:58,548
They're chasing me out
of town enough as it is.

392
00:29:59,117 --> 00:30:00,550
Imagine.

393
00:30:01,284 --> 00:30:03,253
A murdering
white lady too?

394
00:30:44,561 --> 00:30:47,430
Two dead dogs.

395
00:32:44,581 --> 00:32:45,815
Dinnertime.

396
00:32:52,422 --> 00:32:53,723
What's wrong?

397
00:32:55,926 --> 00:32:57,661
Any luck with
the automobile?

398
00:32:58,396 --> 00:32:59,930
No, not yet.
I'm still trying.

399
00:33:08,005 --> 00:33:09,606
Are you gonna tell me
what's eating you?

400
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:11,976
I need to get
out of here, Eugene!

401
00:33:12,475 --> 00:33:14,078
Yeah, I know that.

402
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:17,248
- Did something happen?
- No.

403
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:19,216
Something could.

404
00:33:20,051 --> 00:33:22,019
It's not safe, me being here.

405
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:24,021
It's not safe for anyone.

406
00:33:25,323 --> 00:33:26,623
Yeah, I know.

407
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:29,826
Just...

408
00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:32,729
- I'm going crazy in here.
- I'm cooped up.

409
00:33:32,862 --> 00:33:35,598
I'm hurt. I'm dirty.

410
00:33:35,732 --> 00:33:37,801
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, I didn't...

411
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:39,903
I didn't mean
to yell at you.

412
00:33:41,238 --> 00:33:42,706
Sorry.

413
00:33:48,912 --> 00:33:51,848
I may have just thought of
something that will cheer you up.

414
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:53,883
What's that?

415
00:34:06,563 --> 00:34:07,864
You can wash here.

416
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:10,734
This is a clean
swimming lake.

417
00:34:12,936 --> 00:34:15,905
Property's abandoned,
so, we're safe.

418
00:34:18,342 --> 00:34:22,213
We can clean your leg and then
dress it after. How about that?

419
00:34:25,782 --> 00:34:27,650
All right then.

420
00:34:54,045 --> 00:34:55,945
We're leaving
in five minutes.

421
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:01,651
Hey, that's for later.

422
00:35:01,785 --> 00:35:03,087
I couldn't resist.

423
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,554
Sit down.

424
00:35:06,556 --> 00:35:08,092
Where is Eugene?

425
00:35:08,225 --> 00:35:10,627
I'm missing my blue dress.
Have you seen it anywhere?

426
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,496
Um, no, Mama.

427
00:35:12,629 --> 00:35:14,065
Hello?

428
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:16,833
Anyone hear me?
I said, "Where is the boy"?

429
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:18,536
Him and Joe was out
looking for work.

430
00:35:18,668 --> 00:35:22,739
He said you told him to.
Said he's going to meet us there.

431
00:35:33,984 --> 00:35:35,486
Where are your shoes?

432
00:35:35,618 --> 00:35:37,288
Do I have to wear them?

433
00:35:37,421 --> 00:35:39,023
Yes. Come on.

434
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:45,096
Oh!

435
00:35:53,304 --> 00:35:54,371
Hello.

436
00:35:55,106 --> 00:35:56,273
Evening.

437
00:35:58,242 --> 00:36:00,544
What are you staring at?

438
00:36:00,677 --> 00:36:02,179
Oh, nothing. I was, uh...

439
00:36:03,613 --> 00:36:06,217
I was just thinking
about my father.

440
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:10,221
He took me swimming here once
when I was real little.

441
00:36:10,354 --> 00:36:12,689
I'd forgotten about it
until just now.

442
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:14,091
He ain't around anymore.

443
00:36:14,225 --> 00:36:16,560
You must miss him
pretty bad, huh?

444
00:36:16,693 --> 00:36:18,761
Yeah, I suppose so.

445
00:36:20,331 --> 00:36:24,001
When I wonder what I miss about
him, I can't think of nothin'.

446
00:36:25,169 --> 00:36:27,371
You know,
I just can't remember.

447
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:29,006
It's funny.

448
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,042
Do you ever get that?

449
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:38,915
You know what the worst
part of dying is, kid?

450
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:41,152
I didn't say he was dead.

451
00:36:43,154 --> 00:36:44,888
But...

452
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:48,192
when you quit it with all this "kid"
crap, you can tell me.

453
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,096
You don't like it
when I call you kid?

454
00:36:54,864 --> 00:36:56,967
No.

455
00:36:57,101 --> 00:36:58,801
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean it like that.

456
00:36:58,935 --> 00:37:00,171
I didn't mean it
like you're a kid.

457
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:03,940
I meant it like...
Billy the Kid.

458
00:37:04,575 --> 00:37:05,909
You know him?

459
00:37:06,043 --> 00:37:08,312
The outlaw. The myth.

460
00:37:08,445 --> 00:37:10,914
Yeah, I know him, but I...

461
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:12,749
I don't like it either way.

462
00:37:12,882 --> 00:37:14,451
And why is that?

463
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:16,920
Well, 'cause what's
the big hoopla about some dummy

464
00:37:17,054 --> 00:37:20,090
that got himself killed
before the age of 30, huh?

465
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:27,064
This ain't about
when he died.

466
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:32,002
It's about
how long he'll live.

467
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,775
You see,
the worst part of dying...

468
00:37:39,776 --> 00:37:41,744
is being forgotten.

469
00:37:48,818 --> 00:37:50,753
That's why I like Billy.

470
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:54,625
'Cause even though
he died before 30,

471
00:37:54,757 --> 00:37:57,494
every couple of years someone
claims to have seen him.

472
00:37:57,628 --> 00:38:01,798
You know, at the groceries
or riding a freight train.

473
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:05,069
He's like a ghost
out of time.

474
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:12,243
You see, you can't really die if
people still want you to live.

475
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:17,414
Not in any meaningful way,
at least.

476
00:38:21,751 --> 00:38:24,288
- Hey! You!
- I thought you said this place was safe.

477
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:26,457
- Damn it!
- He was supposed to be off this land by now.

478
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,326
This is still my land
until the first of next month!

479
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,893
Shit.

480
00:38:32,129 --> 00:38:33,863
Go, go, go. Go!

481
00:38:41,438 --> 00:38:43,507
I don't think he saw.
We got to...

482
00:39:41,532 --> 00:39:42,499
Hey.

483
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:43,967
Have you seen my brother?

484
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,508
Can I pinch a smoke,
please, sir?

485
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:55,612
- You got a light?
- Yeah.

486
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:58,248
Thank you, sir.

487
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,098
I'm telling you, they should
be sending out search parties still.

488
00:40:15,466 --> 00:40:19,036
Damn sure she's still here
with a wound like that.

489
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:20,704
I hope so.

490
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:23,240
A little excitement
never hurt no one.

491
00:40:23,374 --> 00:40:26,243
A little excitement
never hurt no one, huh?

492
00:40:26,377 --> 00:40:28,011
You seen the evidence,
Ernie?

493
00:40:28,145 --> 00:40:29,480
Nah, I'm just saying.

494
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:31,215
Well, I have.

495
00:40:31,782 --> 00:40:33,217
All of it.

496
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:35,352
And let me
tell you something.

497
00:40:35,486 --> 00:40:39,390
She don't tend
to leave no witnesses.

498
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:43,594
All kinds of horrors
in that evidence locker.

499
00:40:44,595 --> 00:40:47,030
You hear Hartwell
talking in there?

500
00:40:47,164 --> 00:40:49,199
He said he saw her
just a couple hours ago.

501
00:40:49,899 --> 00:40:52,002
Swimming in that lake of his.

502
00:40:52,136 --> 00:40:54,371
Everybody keeps
claiming they've seen her.

503
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:57,007
That's why we gotta get
all the farmers together,

504
00:40:57,141 --> 00:40:59,343
and we got to search.

505
00:40:59,476 --> 00:41:01,612
Splitting the bounty
won't save everyone,

506
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:03,913
but it will
some of us, Ernie.

507
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:08,886
I told Ethel I'd
dance with her to this one.

508
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,812
There's my girl.

509
00:41:34,944 --> 00:41:37,581
You gonna
dance with your pa?

510
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:40,350
Shall we, little lady?

511
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:43,687
Whoo-hoo!

512
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:17,521
You might be the worst damn
thief I think I've ever seen.

513
00:42:17,654 --> 00:42:20,457
Shit, Garza, you almost
gave me a coronary.

514
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:22,125
Run a block, would you?

515
00:42:22,259 --> 00:42:24,161
Hell you think I'm doing?

516
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:27,865
Your daddy would've beat your ass in
public already if it weren't for me.

517
00:42:27,998 --> 00:42:29,600
He ain't my daddy.

518
00:42:29,733 --> 00:42:31,502
Bingo.

519
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:33,937
You are up to some fishy
shit, Eugene Evans.

520
00:42:34,071 --> 00:42:36,306
Yeah, you have no idea.

521
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,278
Ride your bike here?

522
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:58,395
Sit down. Come on.

523
00:43:23,955 --> 00:43:25,088
Mm-hmm.

524
00:44:02,092 --> 00:44:03,460
- Yeah!
- Uh-huh!

525
00:44:07,966 --> 00:44:09,199
Ohh!

526
00:44:30,253 --> 00:44:31,421
Punch it!

527
00:45:15,399 --> 00:45:17,035
Whoa!

528
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:19,003
You ain't supposed
to be in here.

529
00:45:19,137 --> 00:45:20,470
I'm sorry, sir.

530
00:45:21,405 --> 00:45:24,307
I was just getting this
for my... for my old man.

531
00:45:24,441 --> 00:45:27,011
- He wanted to take a look at it at home.
- Who's your old man?

532
00:45:27,145 --> 00:45:28,545
Uh, Deputy Evans.

533
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:32,249
- I have his keys.
- You're Eugene Evans?

534
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:35,318
Uh, yeah, sir. Yeah.

535
00:45:35,886 --> 00:45:37,821
Well, George knows better,

536
00:45:37,955 --> 00:45:40,357
but, uh, I understand
he's got a bug up his ass

537
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,959
about this whole situation
we got here.

538
00:45:42,093 --> 00:45:43,727
Yeah, yeah. Sure has, yeah.

539
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,762
All right, well,
take him what he needs.

540
00:45:45,896 --> 00:45:48,432
- Yes, I will, sir. Thank you.
- All right.

541
00:45:48,565 --> 00:45:51,802
Hey.
Tell your ma I say hi.

542
00:45:52,235 --> 00:45:53,336
Yes, sir.

543
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:50,527
You found her, ain't ya?

544
00:46:51,328 --> 00:46:52,829
The Wells lady.

545
00:46:55,499 --> 00:46:58,935
I ain't going to tell nobody,
if that's what you're worried about.

546
00:47:00,537 --> 00:47:02,472
- You ain't?
- Not if you tell me why

547
00:47:02,606 --> 00:47:05,408
you've been such a creeping,
little toad lately.

548
00:47:06,576 --> 00:47:09,412
It's complicated. Complex.

549
00:47:14,584 --> 00:47:16,319
I'm scared.

550
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,036
I know.

551
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,671
It scares me too.

552
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:37,641
Everything's gonna be
all right.

553
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:39,043
I promise.

554
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:42,013
Show me that smile.

555
00:47:44,015 --> 00:47:46,017
- Come on. You want a ride back?
- Yeah.

556
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,251
Okay.

557
00:47:47,384 --> 00:47:49,486
Three, two, one.

558
00:47:52,123 --> 00:47:55,226
<i>I saw a change
in my brother that night.</i>

559
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:59,529
<i>There was a resolve in his eyes
I'd never seen before.</i>

560
00:47:59,663 --> 00:48:04,001
<i>Like something invisible that had
tied him to our world came undone</i>

561
00:48:04,768 --> 00:48:07,504
<i>and set off
a series of events</i>

562
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:10,707
<i>that would change the shape
of our family forever.</i>

563
00:48:18,149 --> 00:48:20,017
<i>Maybe if I'd known
his father,</i>

564
00:48:20,151 --> 00:48:22,253
<i>I would have
recognized that look.</i>

565
00:48:27,724 --> 00:48:29,559
Sheriff wants to see you
in his office.

566
00:48:29,693 --> 00:48:31,329
I'm looking
for him too, Janice.

567
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:33,097
- George.
- What's up?

568
00:48:33,697 --> 00:48:36,733
Sir, she is still here.

569
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:39,303
I found that on the edge
of the Hartwell property

570
00:48:39,436 --> 00:48:42,372
after he claimed
that he had seen her.

571
00:48:42,505 --> 00:48:44,941
And no one's safe
until we find her.

572
00:48:45,076 --> 00:48:48,712
Now, the way I see it,
is if we raise the bounty,

573
00:48:48,845 --> 00:48:52,382
we could get every farmer
and every farmhand

574
00:48:52,515 --> 00:48:55,418
in the county on her ass.

575
00:48:57,654 --> 00:49:00,924
What the fuck do you think
I brought you in here for?

576
00:49:03,361 --> 00:49:07,331
- Huh?
- You send your boy in here at night to steal evidence

577
00:49:07,464 --> 00:49:10,533
and expect me
not to fire your ass?

578
00:49:33,623 --> 00:49:35,558
Where you been, kid?

579
00:49:40,597 --> 00:49:42,766
I know about Perry Montroy.

580
00:49:51,441 --> 00:49:53,077
You lied about him.

581
00:49:55,112 --> 00:49:57,447
You could be lying
about everything.

582
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:11,128
I didn't... I didn't tell you about
him because it's hard to talk about.

583
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,465
Was you in love with him?

584
00:50:18,169 --> 00:50:19,903
Are you jealous?

585
00:50:25,508 --> 00:50:26,943
Yeah.

586
00:51:00,244 --> 00:51:02,679
I've never seen
anything like it.

587
00:51:06,217 --> 00:51:07,751
You're right.

588
00:51:08,486 --> 00:51:10,620
It ain't safe for you here.

589
00:51:12,822 --> 00:51:15,525
Or for any of us,
for that matter.

590
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:18,928
You said 20,000, right?

591
00:51:19,063 --> 00:51:21,165
Find me a car,
and I'm history.

592
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:25,202
Same as your family debt.

593
00:51:32,642 --> 00:51:34,911
Oh, shit.
George is back early.

594
00:51:49,659 --> 00:51:51,795
Sheriff cut me loose.

595
00:51:51,928 --> 00:51:53,464
You know why?

596
00:51:53,596 --> 00:51:55,266
The evidence you took,
where is it?

597
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:58,635
- It's gone.
- Gone where?

598
00:51:58,768 --> 00:52:00,337
I forget.

599
00:52:01,938 --> 00:52:04,375
Okay, all that stuff was
lies and made-up nonsense!

600
00:52:04,508 --> 00:52:07,044
Where in God's creation you get the
idea of calling that woman innocent?

601
00:52:07,178 --> 00:52:09,113
- Well, I know things.
- Oh, you "know things"!

602
00:52:09,246 --> 00:52:11,948
The apple don't fall far
from the tree, now, does it?

603
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:14,218
Full of foolish thoughts,
like your old man.

604
00:52:14,351 --> 00:52:15,585
Well, I may have raised you,

605
00:52:15,718 --> 00:52:17,555
but you sure as shit
ain't my son.

606
00:52:17,687 --> 00:52:19,356
Well, thank God for that.

607
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,026
Son of a...

608
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,530
Where is it, huh? Huh?

609
00:52:26,663 --> 00:52:29,599
You're gonna break your mama's heart
when you end up dead like John Baker.

610
00:52:29,732 --> 00:52:31,835
But he ain't dead.
He's in Mexico.

611
00:52:31,969 --> 00:52:33,870
I'm gonna find him
one day.

612
00:52:34,004 --> 00:52:35,439
Sure.

613
00:52:35,573 --> 00:52:36,974
Mexico.

614
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:43,047
And this door,
from here on out, stays open.

615
00:52:45,149 --> 00:52:46,183
Shit.

616
00:53:12,742 --> 00:53:15,312
Come on. Shit.

617
00:53:15,446 --> 00:53:16,880
Shit.

618
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:20,884
Come on.

619
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:41,704
Don't stop now.

620
00:53:44,941 --> 00:53:47,877
Oh, God. It's fine.
It's fine.

621
00:53:48,012 --> 00:53:50,047
I'm seeing stars, Allison.

622
00:53:50,514 --> 00:53:52,316
No. No!

623
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:54,884
No, no, you can make it.

624
00:53:55,019 --> 00:53:57,454
Come on. We can make it.
Come on.

625
00:53:57,588 --> 00:53:58,989
Keep running.

626
00:54:00,558 --> 00:54:02,892
No. No.

627
00:54:10,134 --> 00:54:12,069
I'll see you in Mexico.

628
00:54:55,812 --> 00:54:57,248
Jesus.

629
00:54:58,349 --> 00:54:59,916
Hey, Papa.

630
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:01,485
Glad you're home.

631
00:55:04,121 --> 00:55:05,888
What's wrong now?

632
00:55:17,834 --> 00:55:19,403
No, you ought
to stay inside.

633
00:55:19,536 --> 00:55:22,139
If he's hiding
it, it's in that barn.

634
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:23,741
Don't.

635
00:55:23,906 --> 00:55:25,808
That boy needs his mother.

636
00:55:27,278 --> 00:55:30,514
Maybe he'll tell you
what the hell is going on.

637
00:56:03,047 --> 00:56:05,416
George, he's sorry
what happened.

638
00:56:06,883 --> 00:56:09,320
But he told me
what you did.

639
00:56:12,523 --> 00:56:13,724
Just trying to help.

640
00:56:13,856 --> 00:56:15,693
Help who?

641
00:56:16,193 --> 00:56:18,329
George was dismissed.

642
00:56:19,997 --> 00:56:22,232
Eugene, look at me.

643
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:26,036
We're less than a month away
from being homeless.

644
00:56:30,374 --> 00:56:32,976
George said
John Baker was dead.

645
00:56:35,912 --> 00:56:37,815
And he was right.

646
00:56:38,881 --> 00:56:44,355
Do you remember that postcard
he wrote you when you were six?

647
00:56:45,022 --> 00:56:46,457
Of course, I do.

648
00:56:47,691 --> 00:56:49,460
Yeah, well, he sent more.

649
00:56:50,427 --> 00:56:53,297
But I burned every one of them
after the first.

650
00:56:55,299 --> 00:56:57,234
Every month, he'd write,
and every month,

651
00:56:57,368 --> 00:56:59,536
each card was worse
than the last.

652
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:03,307
They'd be full of talk
about God and people

653
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,710
and strange things he'd seen,
but it was all jumbled up.

654
00:57:06,844 --> 00:57:12,216
He was drinking himself to death,
and his mind was falling apart.

655
00:57:13,784 --> 00:57:17,454
I couldn't let a little boy
read what he wrote.

656
00:57:18,756 --> 00:57:20,524
I only lied
because I love you.

657
00:57:20,657 --> 00:57:24,261
- You're lying to me now, Mama.
- No, Eugene, I'm not.

658
00:57:24,395 --> 00:57:27,831
After five years,
the cards stopped.

659
00:57:27,965 --> 00:57:30,534
And I believe that was
'cause he died.

660
00:57:30,667 --> 00:57:33,771
No. No, you can't be sure
of that. You can't.

661
00:57:33,903 --> 00:57:35,105
Eugene!

662
00:57:36,073 --> 00:57:37,940
Eugene, I...

663
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:41,879
I'm sorry.

664
00:57:42,012 --> 00:57:43,480
Oh, God.

665
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:23,720
He shut that door?

666
00:58:24,822 --> 00:58:26,123
I did.

667
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:41,071
He say anything meaningful
about what he done?

668
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,942
No.

669
00:58:48,545 --> 00:58:52,449
I need your help with this, George.
He ain't going nowhere.

670
00:59:01,592 --> 00:59:04,995
<i>That day came
to be known as "Black Sunday."</i>

671
00:59:07,498 --> 00:59:11,034
<i>It was the worst storm
Childress County had ever seen.</i>

672
00:59:14,838 --> 00:59:16,173
<i>And for Eugene,</i>

673
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:18,442
<i>just the sign he needed.</i>

674
00:59:52,876 --> 00:59:56,480
Phoebe... I'm leaving.

675
00:59:56,613 --> 00:59:58,916
Okay, I'm going.
I'm here to say goodbye.

676
00:59:59,049 --> 01:00:01,184
Take me with you.

677
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:02,853
You don't even know
where we're going.

678
01:00:02,987 --> 01:00:04,022
That don't matter.

679
01:00:04,154 --> 01:00:06,490
Phoebe, we're going
to Mexico.

680
01:00:06,623 --> 01:00:09,760
Mexico. I'll learn
Spanish, okay?

681
01:00:09,893 --> 01:00:12,296
No. You gotta stay here.

682
01:00:13,764 --> 01:00:15,532
I'm gonna send money.
I'm gonna send lots of it.

683
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:18,502
- Where you getting money?
- Well, that don't matter, does it?

684
01:00:19,069 --> 01:00:20,304
This is a good thing.

685
01:00:20,437 --> 01:00:22,806
Why you doing this?

686
01:00:28,111 --> 01:00:29,546
I guess I'm in love.

687
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,915
You don't know
anything about love.

688
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:34,052
You don't neither.

689
01:00:34,184 --> 01:00:36,453
I know that if you loved us,
you'd stay.

690
01:00:36,587 --> 01:00:38,922
- If you loved me.
- Phoebe, I do love you.

691
01:00:39,057 --> 01:00:40,691
Well, then stay.

692
01:00:47,864 --> 01:00:49,366
I'll see you soon.

693
01:00:50,634 --> 01:00:51,668
I promise.

694
01:00:52,336 --> 01:00:55,639
Just go.
Quit drawing it out.

695
01:01:28,805 --> 01:01:31,575
<i>I held my
breath that whole night...</i>

696
01:01:32,509 --> 01:01:34,611
<i>and I imagined I was him...</i>

697
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:39,616
<i>laying in the same bed
after his father left.</i>

698
01:01:44,154 --> 01:01:49,393
<i>Once the storm passed,
George checked the barn.</i>

699
01:01:49,526 --> 01:01:52,596
<i>But to his disappointment,
he found nothing.</i>

700
01:01:52,729 --> 01:01:53,864
Food's ready.

701
01:01:55,866 --> 01:01:57,501
Can you wake the boy?

702
01:02:10,982 --> 01:02:12,783
Gene?

703
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,661
Oh, shit!

704
01:02:25,729 --> 01:02:27,397
Oh...

705
01:02:27,531 --> 01:02:29,433
He went away
with that lady.

706
01:02:29,566 --> 01:02:31,468
What lady?
What are you talking about?

707
01:02:31,601 --> 01:02:33,971
Allison Wells,
the fugitive.

708
01:02:34,105 --> 01:02:35,405
Why are you saying that?

709
01:02:35,539 --> 01:02:37,175
Because I'm
telling the truth.

710
01:02:37,307 --> 01:02:38,875
The damn truck's gone.

711
01:02:40,343 --> 01:02:44,347
Papa! Papa, Phoebe here's been saying
strange things about her brother.

712
01:02:44,481 --> 01:02:47,217
I want you to tell her
they isn't true.

713
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:49,786
What things
she been saying?

714
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,623
She says Eugene's been helping
Allison Wells, the fugitive?

715
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:55,726
But that just isn't possible.

716
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:58,261
It's just
a little girl's fantasy.

717
01:02:58,395 --> 01:03:01,398
- Isn't it?
- No, it ain't.

718
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:06,503
Phoebe, you best tell us
where he's gone.

719
01:03:09,207 --> 01:03:12,375
You don't want your brother
to get hurt, now, do you?

720
01:03:21,384 --> 01:03:24,454
I'm gonna miss you,
but I hate goodbyes.

721
01:03:24,588 --> 01:03:26,656
You should pull over soon.
We don't draw this one out.

722
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:29,026
No, no, no. There ain't
gonna be any goodbyes.

723
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,561
You don't gotta
fret about it.

724
01:03:34,865 --> 01:03:36,566
Oh, no. Kid, no.

725
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,503
I'm going to Mexico alone.

726
01:03:39,971 --> 01:03:40,972
Afraid not.

727
01:03:41,105 --> 01:03:43,473
Afraid so.

728
01:03:43,607 --> 01:03:45,876
What about your family?
You just gonna leave 'em?

729
01:03:47,111 --> 01:03:48,812
You know what, Allison?

730
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:52,482
I've got family
in Mexico too.

731
01:03:53,017 --> 01:03:54,252
Your father.

732
01:03:54,384 --> 01:03:55,552
Right.

733
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,654
John Baker.

734
01:03:58,588 --> 01:04:00,357
High damn time
I track him down.

735
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:03,894
I don't think you understand
what it entails to find somebody,

736
01:04:04,028 --> 01:04:05,529
let alone in Mexico.

737
01:04:05,662 --> 01:04:07,697
What does it matter to you if
I come to Mexico or not, huh?

738
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:12,402
- It matters 'cause you're in love with me, and you expect...
- No. No. No, I ain't.

739
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:19,110
You know what, Allison?

740
01:04:20,178 --> 01:04:23,014
Last night I said to myself,
there is no way in hell

741
01:04:23,147 --> 01:04:25,715
that you're going to Mexico
by yourself.

742
01:04:27,118 --> 01:04:28,919
There ain't.

743
01:04:29,053 --> 01:04:33,590
So, whether you love me back
or not is besides the point.

744
01:04:35,126 --> 01:04:36,827
I don't love you back.

745
01:04:38,795 --> 01:04:42,332
Well... it's a long drive.

746
01:04:49,406 --> 01:04:50,907
God, what did I do wrong?

747
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:53,010
How did they
come across one another?

748
01:04:53,144 --> 01:04:56,847
I don't know, but if word gets out
that that woman was hiding here,

749
01:04:56,981 --> 01:04:59,549
and I'm not the one
to bring her in...

750
01:04:59,683 --> 01:05:01,418
Makes me sick
to even think about.

751
01:05:01,551 --> 01:05:03,887
You think I care right now
about any of that?

752
01:05:04,021 --> 01:05:05,990
What's gonna happen
to my son, George?

753
01:05:06,123 --> 01:05:08,159
I'm calling Tade,
and I'm calling Lomax.

754
01:05:08,292 --> 01:05:11,062
We're gonna find him
before anyone else does.

755
01:05:12,263 --> 01:05:14,198
Tade? George Evans.

756
01:05:14,332 --> 01:05:15,765
Have you still got
that buck shooter?

757
01:05:15,899 --> 01:05:17,601
- Don't shoot my son, George!
- Hey!

758
01:05:17,734 --> 01:05:20,503
Ain't no one getting shot
until he's free and clear.

759
01:05:20,637 --> 01:05:22,139
All right, Tade,
bring the vehicle.

760
01:05:22,273 --> 01:05:23,506
Mine's on the fritz.

761
01:05:26,344 --> 01:05:29,113
We stand to get
a third of the bounty.

762
01:05:30,982 --> 01:05:33,351
- Then we can stay.
- Just bring my son back to me,

763
01:05:33,483 --> 01:05:36,553
or you don't bother
coming back.

764
01:05:49,333 --> 01:05:51,401
Goddamn it.

765
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:54,738
Turn back, you bastard.

766
01:05:57,507 --> 01:05:59,743
What do we do, Allison?

767
01:06:01,145 --> 01:06:02,980
Do you have the gun?

768
01:06:03,114 --> 01:06:06,083
- No, we ain't using...
- Please, tell me you have the gun.

769
01:06:07,751 --> 01:06:09,886
We ain't using it though,
right, Allison?

770
01:06:10,021 --> 01:06:13,657
Not if we don't have to,
but we do have to pull over.

771
01:06:14,524 --> 01:06:16,027
Shit.

772
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,096
I want to report
a car stolen.

773
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:20,264
Yeah.

774
01:06:20,398 --> 01:06:26,037
License plate number 3285M8.

775
01:06:48,259 --> 01:06:50,061
What's the problem, sir?

776
01:06:50,194 --> 01:06:54,165
Well, the problem is you ran
a clearly placed stop sign.

777
01:06:55,099 --> 01:06:57,168
You leave your good sense
at home, son?

778
01:06:57,301 --> 01:06:59,703
Oh, uh, no, sir.

779
01:06:59,836 --> 01:07:04,208
I'm sorry. I didn't see the stop sign
till it was too late, that's all.

780
01:07:05,542 --> 01:07:07,477
Where you headed and why?

781
01:07:08,346 --> 01:07:10,647
I'm going to Lubbock.

782
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:12,816
Gonna pick up a part
for my old man.

783
01:07:12,949 --> 01:07:15,019
His tiller's broke, so...

784
01:07:15,152 --> 01:07:16,187
Who's your old man?

785
01:07:17,421 --> 01:07:19,889
John Baker of Bismark.

786
01:07:21,392 --> 01:07:22,692
I don't know him.

787
01:07:24,828 --> 01:07:26,596
You know, there's
a fugitive about.

788
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:30,368
A lady. All armed
and ready to kill.

789
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,502
Yeah, I heard about that.

790
01:07:33,437 --> 01:07:34,704
Yeah, she ain't
the kind of folk

791
01:07:34,838 --> 01:07:37,375
that I associate with,
so I ain't seen her.

792
01:07:37,507 --> 01:07:41,345
If I do, I'll be sure
to let the authorities know.

793
01:07:41,479 --> 01:07:46,083
What's your name, son? I'm gonna write
you a citation, then you're free to go.

794
01:07:46,716 --> 01:07:48,585
Uh, Eugene Baker.

795
01:07:51,956 --> 01:07:52,822
Slow down.

796
01:07:52,957 --> 01:07:55,092
I will. Thank you, sir.

797
01:08:12,376 --> 01:08:14,577
You fucking did it!

798
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:16,414
That's right.

799
01:08:16,546 --> 01:08:17,982
Well, you may not be
the worst person

800
01:08:18,115 --> 01:08:20,051
to go on a trip with
after all.

801
01:08:30,294 --> 01:08:32,163
- Mama?
- Huh?

802
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:35,799
Eugene has to have someone
looking out for him.

803
01:08:35,932 --> 01:08:37,535
More than just Papa.

804
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:38,701
Hmm?

805
01:08:38,835 --> 01:08:40,770
What the hell
you saying?

806
01:08:42,306 --> 01:08:46,010
No, you're not setting foot outside
this house till this is over.

807
01:08:46,143 --> 01:08:49,013
Not another word on that.
Just go to your room.

808
01:08:49,146 --> 01:08:50,147
Close the door.

809
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,988
Morning, Mrs. Evans.

810
01:08:58,721 --> 01:09:01,125
Eugene's going
to be A-okay.

811
01:09:07,498 --> 01:09:08,898
Evans.

812
01:09:11,701 --> 01:09:13,104
Uh-huh.

813
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:15,672
Is that so?

814
01:09:15,805 --> 01:09:18,008
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It's just my boy.

815
01:09:18,142 --> 01:09:21,078
Sorry for the mix-up.
I'll handle it myself.

816
01:09:21,212 --> 01:09:22,745
I appreciate that.

817
01:09:23,847 --> 01:09:25,849
They're near Matador,
heading south.

818
01:09:25,983 --> 01:09:28,586
Someone must've reported
my truck stolen.

819
01:09:28,718 --> 01:09:30,254
Let's go, boys.

820
01:09:40,864 --> 01:09:44,201
Phoebe? Come here.

821
01:09:46,669 --> 01:09:48,372
Phoebe!

822
01:09:56,547 --> 01:09:58,315
Phoe... Phoebe.

823
01:09:58,449 --> 01:10:00,417
No, no, no, no. No!

824
01:10:00,551 --> 01:10:02,253
Come back!

825
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:17,834
You ain't gonna believe the green when
we get out of these forsaken parts.

826
01:10:17,968 --> 01:10:22,106
There's rivers of it,
just rolling and rolling.

827
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:26,676
I'm telling you, there's,
like, bright green orchards...

828
01:10:27,511 --> 01:10:28,912
bright blue waters.

829
01:10:29,046 --> 01:10:31,582
I've seen a tree before,
you know?

830
01:10:31,714 --> 01:10:34,118
Yeah, well, have you
seen the ocean?

831
01:10:34,985 --> 01:10:37,754
No. No, I haven't.

832
01:10:37,887 --> 01:10:40,823
I used to dream a lot
about it when I was a kid.

833
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:45,029
Not sure exactly what it's supposed
to look or feel like, though.

834
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:47,231
Have you seen it?

835
01:10:47,364 --> 01:10:50,833
No, but I used to
dream about it too.

836
01:10:52,303 --> 01:10:57,740
I plan on running into its big,
burly arms when we get to Mexico.

837
01:11:00,411 --> 01:11:02,079
Yeah, that sounds nice.

838
01:11:02,845 --> 01:11:04,415
Yeah.

839
01:11:19,029 --> 01:11:20,998
Phoebe.

840
01:11:22,299 --> 01:11:23,800
Hi, Papa.

841
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:45,788
No. No, you should
stay here.

842
01:11:45,922 --> 01:11:47,790
No, thank you.
I need to stretch my leg.

843
01:11:47,924 --> 01:11:49,593
Allison, the clerk
might recognize you.

844
01:11:49,727 --> 01:11:52,963
And once we're gone,
he'll tell everyone how pretty I was.

845
01:11:53,097 --> 01:11:54,965
Here, take this with you.

846
01:11:55,099 --> 01:11:57,501
Let's just see what
we're working with here.

847
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,823
- Evening.
- Evening yourself, handsome.

848
01:12:22,559 --> 01:12:24,561
How are you doing
on this lonesome night?

849
01:12:24,695 --> 01:12:26,263
Can't complain.

850
01:12:26,397 --> 01:12:27,998
Sign says
you have vacancies.

851
01:12:28,132 --> 01:12:30,501
That's right.
One room or two?

852
01:12:30,634 --> 01:12:31,901
One.

853
01:12:44,048 --> 01:12:45,783
You're Room 17.

854
01:12:45,915 --> 01:12:47,284
You're too kind.

855
01:12:47,418 --> 01:12:48,552
Thank you, sir.

856
01:12:50,853 --> 01:12:52,889
That was the last
of our money.

857
01:12:53,691 --> 01:12:55,092
Yep.

858
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,827
We'll get more.

859
01:13:13,477 --> 01:13:15,245
I'm gonna shower.

860
01:13:33,397 --> 01:13:34,631
Hey, kid.

861
01:13:36,734 --> 01:13:38,602
Why don't you come in here?

862
01:13:48,078 --> 01:13:50,947
Ah, God, feels like heaven.

863
01:13:55,719 --> 01:13:57,187
You want to shower?

864
01:14:03,527 --> 01:14:05,028
You afraid?

865
01:14:06,363 --> 01:14:07,564
No.

866
01:14:09,967 --> 01:14:11,668
Are you embarrassed?

867
01:14:13,971 --> 01:14:16,473
Why do you want me
in there with you?

868
01:14:19,209 --> 01:14:20,811
What do you mean "why"?

869
01:14:21,445 --> 01:14:23,347
That's a funny question.

870
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,682
Seems reasonable
enough to me.

871
01:14:25,816 --> 01:14:28,318
Jesus, you want me
to drag you in?

872
01:14:31,555 --> 01:14:34,191
Thinking too hard
about this, kid.

873
01:14:36,126 --> 01:14:38,061
There it is again.

874
01:14:38,195 --> 01:14:42,499
I'm "kid," but that dingbat
behind the desk, he's "handsome"?

875
01:14:45,502 --> 01:14:48,005
You need me
to call you handsome?

876
01:14:49,206 --> 01:14:51,341
No, I... I just...

877
01:14:51,475 --> 01:14:55,779
Did I ask the dingbat behind the
desk to get in the shower with me?

878
01:14:55,913 --> 01:14:58,315
Well, maybe if he
was here, you would.

879
01:15:00,751 --> 01:15:03,387
Wow. Fuck you.

880
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:09,393
All I'm saying...

881
01:15:10,961 --> 01:15:12,696
All I'm saying is,

882
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:16,200
I don't know if you
actually want me here or...

883
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:19,236
are you just saying that because
you're trying to get me to stick around

884
01:15:19,369 --> 01:15:21,638
'cause you're afraid
I'll turn you in.

885
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:36,086
You wouldn't be here
if I didn't want you here.

886
01:15:37,554 --> 01:15:40,123
You know that
as well as I do.

887
01:16:35,579 --> 01:16:37,347
I apologize.

888
01:16:37,481 --> 01:16:38,582
Thank you.

889
01:16:40,551 --> 01:16:44,154
But I need to make something
crystal-fucking-clear.

890
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:48,458
This was your choice.

891
01:16:50,193 --> 01:16:52,129
I didn't ask you to come.

892
01:16:53,163 --> 01:16:55,933
Okay? You insisted.

893
01:16:56,066 --> 01:16:57,534
And you talk a great game.

894
01:16:57,668 --> 01:17:00,370
And hell, I'm accustomed
to your company.

895
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:09,513
But if you have any doubts about being
here right now, you need to go home.

896
01:17:10,113 --> 01:17:12,549
Go home. Be a kid again.

897
01:17:14,885 --> 01:17:18,322
Okay? 'Cause every second
you spend here,

898
01:17:18,455 --> 01:17:20,058
that option gets slimmer
and slimmer.

899
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:22,259
You understand that,
right?

900
01:17:25,629 --> 01:17:28,098
This ain't a world
for kids.

901
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:33,437
It's ugly.

902
01:17:36,607 --> 01:17:37,841
Ugly.

903
01:17:52,322 --> 01:17:54,524
I ain't going nowhere.

904
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,829
I want to reach
the ocean with you.

905
01:18:09,873 --> 01:18:12,342
Your skin's so soft.

906
01:18:20,817 --> 01:18:22,285
Okay?

907
01:18:27,424 --> 01:18:29,926
I'm sorry.

908
01:18:34,065 --> 01:18:36,333
I think I need
some sleep.

909
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,976
Have you ever
done this before?

910
01:19:21,378 --> 01:19:23,313
- No.
- Lay down.

911
01:19:38,862 --> 01:19:40,397
You okay?

912
01:19:40,831 --> 01:19:42,299
Yeah.

913
01:19:42,432 --> 01:19:43,867
You sure?

914
01:19:51,075 --> 01:19:52,542
I just wanna...

915
01:19:54,311 --> 01:19:56,013
I want to be good.

916
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:02,285
Okay, I'll show you.

917
01:20:22,739 --> 01:20:25,977
I don't really know what's
gonna happen now, but...

918
01:20:27,778 --> 01:20:28,980
can you, um...

919
01:20:30,614 --> 01:20:32,415
Can you just
close your eyes?

920
01:20:34,484 --> 01:20:37,654
- Why?
- Just... close 'em.

921
01:20:48,132 --> 01:20:50,333
I think you should have it.

922
01:20:52,536 --> 01:20:54,005
You don't like it?

923
01:20:55,206 --> 01:20:56,974
Won't it remind you of him?

924
01:20:58,176 --> 01:21:00,343
You seeing me wearing it?

925
01:21:06,383 --> 01:21:10,320
Wherever Perry is,
the last thing he needs is a watch.

926
01:21:14,691 --> 01:21:17,928
Besides, I want it to
remind me of someone else.

927
01:21:33,610 --> 01:21:35,478
<i>I believe that Allison Wells</i>

928
01:21:35,612 --> 01:21:37,781
<i>did come to love
my brother back.</i>

929
01:21:37,914 --> 01:21:41,618
<i>And that she was truthful,
for the most part.</i>

930
01:21:43,321 --> 01:21:47,091
<i>Maybe it's on account
of how badly I miss Eugene...</i>

931
01:21:49,559 --> 01:21:51,329
<i>but I've always imagined</i>

932
01:21:51,461 --> 01:21:53,563
<i>that, for a moment,</i>

933
01:21:53,697 --> 01:21:55,699
<i>the world appeared
before him</i>

934
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:59,170
<i>the way he always
dreamed it would.</i>

935
01:21:59,303 --> 01:22:04,374
<i>In that moment, Eugene and Allison
were bound together by the dream.</i>

936
01:22:06,676 --> 01:22:09,046
<i>One they believed
they were in control of.</i>

937
01:22:11,748 --> 01:22:16,153
<i>I never been too concerned with
whose idea the next part was.</i>

938
01:22:18,189 --> 01:22:20,124
<i>It never really
mattered much to me.</i>

939
01:22:23,327 --> 01:22:27,098
<i>There are certain conditions
to the life Eugene dreamed of</i>

940
01:22:27,231 --> 01:22:31,534
<i>that I'm sure Allison wished she
could have kept secret from him.</i>

941
01:22:34,305 --> 01:22:38,042
<i>Prices she hoped to have paid
for the both of them.</i>

942
01:22:45,882 --> 01:22:49,653
There's no going back. Okay?
We're in and we're out.

943
01:22:49,786 --> 01:22:53,057
Two minutes is all it takes.
Keep an eye on that watch.

944
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:03,900
Kiss me.

945
01:23:10,473 --> 01:23:12,009
Count to five.

946
01:23:16,446 --> 01:23:19,216
Pardon me.
I'm going to need that.

947
01:23:20,151 --> 01:23:21,285
This is a holdup!

948
01:23:22,652 --> 01:23:24,654
Everybody kiss the ground!

949
01:23:24,788 --> 01:23:27,924
Shut up! Shut up!
Get on the goddamn floor!

950
01:23:28,059 --> 01:23:30,527
I don't need you back there,
ma'am. Get out.

951
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:32,263
- Everybody, calm down!
- You can stay.

952
01:23:32,396 --> 01:23:34,698
Please,
this is a family bank.

953
01:23:34,831 --> 01:23:36,766
- I'm not falling for that, lady.
- We ain't insured.

954
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:40,837
Everybody, calm down! Everybody!
Tell 'em! Tell 'em now!

955
01:23:40,972 --> 01:23:42,639
Do it.
Do as you're told.

956
01:23:42,772 --> 01:23:44,342
What now, Allison?

957
01:23:44,474 --> 01:23:45,709
You know what to do, ma'am.

958
01:23:45,842 --> 01:23:47,211
Faster you go,
the faster we leave.

959
01:23:47,345 --> 01:23:50,580
- Please, hear me. We are not...
- Oh, I hear you.

960
01:23:50,714 --> 01:23:51,948
Now, hear me.

961
01:23:52,083 --> 01:23:53,985
I want you to open
that little safe back there.

962
01:23:54,118 --> 01:23:56,120
Me and my partner
can get out of your hair.

963
01:23:56,253 --> 01:23:57,355
Come on!

964
01:23:57,487 --> 01:23:58,922
How's it going
over there, Allison?

965
01:23:59,056 --> 01:24:00,590
Tell him how good
it's going, lady.

966
01:24:00,724 --> 01:24:02,492
Good! Good!
It's going good!

967
01:24:02,625 --> 01:24:03,827
That's right.
Real good, kid.

968
01:24:03,961 --> 01:24:05,528
It's going well.
It's going okay.

969
01:24:05,662 --> 01:24:07,664
Everybody, just do
as you're told. Stay down.

970
01:24:07,797 --> 01:24:09,766
It's going to be over
before you know it, okay?

971
01:24:09,899 --> 01:24:11,969
Thank you.
That will be all, folks.

972
01:24:12,936 --> 01:24:14,271
Allison!

973
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,143
Eugene, come on.

974
01:24:27,617 --> 01:24:28,585
Go!

975
01:24:43,134 --> 01:24:46,470
Just breathe.
Come on, Eugene. We can't stop.

976
01:24:46,603 --> 01:24:49,373
- We can't... not till we get to Mexico.
- You gotta pull over.

977
01:24:49,507 --> 01:24:50,840
Pull over!

978
01:24:53,843 --> 01:24:56,013
Eugene, please.

979
01:24:57,114 --> 01:24:58,615
Eugene?

980
01:25:03,853 --> 01:25:06,390
Eugene, please,
we really gotta keep going.

981
01:25:09,393 --> 01:25:10,961
Kid, we gotta move.

982
01:25:14,631 --> 01:25:16,900
Kid, please, get in the car.

983
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:19,702
<i>One dead.
Citizens Pride Bank in Stanley.</i>

984
01:25:19,836 --> 01:25:24,241
<i>Two fugitives, including Allison
Wells, are heading south on 281.</i>

985
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:29,646
<i>South, black truck on 281.
License plate number 3285M8.</i>

986
01:25:29,779 --> 01:25:31,648
- <i>I repeat...</i>
- That's them.

987
01:25:32,649 --> 01:25:34,351
Goddamn!

988
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:40,857
I can imagine how
you're feeling right now,

989
01:25:40,991 --> 01:25:42,892
and I know that feeling
ain't about to go away,

990
01:25:43,027 --> 01:25:44,962
but you need to have
that feeling in the car,

991
01:25:45,096 --> 01:25:46,564
or we're gonna get
our asses killed.

992
01:25:46,696 --> 01:25:48,598
He should have
just stayed lying there.

993
01:25:48,731 --> 01:25:50,501
Yeah, he should've,

994
01:25:50,633 --> 01:25:52,702
but he got arrogant,
and he got stupid.

995
01:25:52,836 --> 01:25:55,072
I wasn't even thinking.
I just... I just did it.

996
01:25:55,206 --> 01:25:56,873
Because you had to.

997
01:25:57,007 --> 01:25:59,176
Eugene, it would have
been me otherwise.

998
01:25:59,843 --> 01:26:01,078
And if someone
had to die today,

999
01:26:01,212 --> 01:26:03,147
I'm sure glad
that choice was yours.

1000
01:26:03,746 --> 01:26:05,949
A man is dead because of me.

1001
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:08,718
I know.
I know how you feel.

1002
01:26:08,852 --> 01:26:10,854
I know how you feel,
but we need to move.

1003
01:26:10,988 --> 01:26:12,856
You need to get
in the car, Eugene.

1004
01:26:12,990 --> 01:26:14,924
Allison, I don't think
you understand.

1005
01:26:15,059 --> 01:26:16,659
I don't think I can do this.

1006
01:26:16,793 --> 01:26:18,229
- I do understand...
- You don't!

1007
01:26:18,362 --> 01:26:20,064
I understand! Maybe
"I understand" doesn't mean

1008
01:26:20,197 --> 01:26:23,067
I'm just gonna sit down
and wait to die myself.

1009
01:26:28,606 --> 01:26:30,241
How would you understand?

1010
01:26:33,277 --> 01:26:34,478
Eugene, please.

1011
01:26:34,612 --> 01:26:35,945
Please, get in
the goddamn car.

1012
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,814
Who did you kill, Allison?

1013
01:26:42,652 --> 01:26:45,389
You're everything
they said you was, ain't ya?

1014
01:26:50,561 --> 01:26:54,231
- I don't know if it was me who killed her.
- How could you not know?

1015
01:26:55,099 --> 01:26:56,766
Because it was happening
all at the same time.

1016
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,202
If you weren't there,

1017
01:26:58,335 --> 01:27:01,405
would that girl
still be alive today?

1018
01:27:09,246 --> 01:27:11,482
You made me into something
that I ain't.

1019
01:27:11,615 --> 01:27:15,452
I didn't make you into anything
you didn't already want to be.

1020
01:27:21,192 --> 01:27:24,361
Eugene.

1021
01:27:27,264 --> 01:27:28,731
Please.

1022
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:38,841
Eugene!

1023
01:27:41,979 --> 01:27:43,314
Ain't that your truck?

1024
01:27:45,915 --> 01:27:47,484
Eugene!

1025
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:54,824
Stay here with her.

1026
01:27:57,161 --> 01:28:00,598
Eugene, we can still
get to Mexico.

1027
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:01,999
Don't you want
to find your father?

1028
01:28:02,132 --> 01:28:05,336
He's gone, Allison!
He's dead.

1029
01:28:06,736 --> 01:28:08,938
I ain't gonna find nobody!

1030
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,858
This is goodbye.

1031
01:28:41,804 --> 01:28:43,340
Don't shoot me.

1032
01:28:58,389 --> 01:29:00,991
Phoebe,
get in the car!

1033
01:29:01,125 --> 01:29:02,393
Go.

1034
01:29:08,132 --> 01:29:11,201
If you want the bounty,
you can take me in and get it.

1035
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:15,439
Or we can stick to the plan.

1036
01:29:15,572 --> 01:29:18,042
I said, get in the car.

1037
01:29:18,642 --> 01:29:19,909
But Eugene's out there.

1038
01:29:20,044 --> 01:29:22,912
I won't let nothing happen
to him. I promise.

1039
01:29:23,047 --> 01:29:25,182
It's all right.
It's all right.

1040
01:29:26,317 --> 01:29:27,384
Stay here.

1041
01:29:33,057 --> 01:29:35,225
Either way,
I'm leaving it up to you.

1042
01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:48,505
I'll tell them
I made you do everything.

1043
01:29:50,341 --> 01:29:52,842
You can go on with your life.

1044
01:29:58,848 --> 01:30:01,085
You got to pick
your burden, kid.

1045
01:30:09,093 --> 01:30:10,927
Hey.

1046
01:30:12,262 --> 01:30:14,465
I never wanted to lie to you.

1047
01:30:15,632 --> 01:30:18,868
I told you all the truths
I knew how to.

1048
01:30:19,869 --> 01:30:22,206
And I am
who you thought I was.

1049
01:30:25,075 --> 01:30:27,177
It's a little more
complicated is all.

1050
01:30:34,118 --> 01:30:35,885
I'm scared, Allison.

1051
01:30:37,721 --> 01:30:39,223
Yeah, me too.

1052
01:30:40,457 --> 01:30:43,360
I'd rather be scared
with you than alone.

1053
01:30:46,463 --> 01:30:47,498
Please.

1054
01:30:49,066 --> 01:30:51,934
We can baptize ourselves
in the ocean.

1055
01:31:04,815 --> 01:31:06,049
Let's go.

1056
01:31:14,358 --> 01:31:16,160
Eugene!

1057
01:31:16,627 --> 01:31:17,694
Get out of the way!

1058
01:31:18,629 --> 01:31:19,663
We can make it.

1059
01:31:23,734 --> 01:31:25,469
Run, Eugene!

1060
01:31:39,949 --> 01:31:41,251
No!

1061
01:31:42,186 --> 01:31:43,620
No! Allison!

1062
01:31:44,621 --> 01:31:48,559
Oh! Oh!

1063
01:31:49,793 --> 01:31:50,994
Allison.

1064
01:31:52,196 --> 01:31:56,133
Oh, my God. No.

1065
01:31:58,469 --> 01:32:01,104
It's over, son.
Put your guns down.

1066
01:32:08,946 --> 01:32:10,214
Put 'em down!

1067
01:32:13,917 --> 01:32:15,352
It's all right, son.

1068
01:32:28,165 --> 01:32:29,633
Put your guns down!

1069
01:32:30,601 --> 01:32:31,235
Put it down!

1070
01:32:31,368 --> 01:32:34,605
I said put the gun down!

1071
01:32:36,106 --> 01:32:37,741
On the ground!

1072
01:32:37,875 --> 01:32:39,476
Run, Eugene!

1073
01:32:51,889 --> 01:32:55,125
<i>That was the
last time any of us saw Eugene.</i>

1074
01:32:55,259 --> 01:32:58,862
<i>We don't know where he went
or if he got there...</i>

1075
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:01,632
<i>but I never tried
to find him.</i>

1076
01:33:02,266 --> 01:33:04,601
<i>That was never my destiny.</i>

1077
01:33:04,735 --> 01:33:07,638
<i>Different fathers,
I suppose.</i>

1078
01:33:07,771 --> 01:33:12,643
<i>But I do what I can to keep the
legend of Eugene Baker alive.</i>

1079
01:33:12,776 --> 01:33:15,312
<i>And with the tools
left for me,</i>

1080
01:33:15,445 --> 01:33:18,749
<i>that true and honest absence
that John left him</i>

1081
01:33:18,882 --> 01:33:20,484
<i>and he gave to me,</i>

1082
01:33:21,184 --> 01:33:23,120
<i>I tell his story.</i>

1083
01:33:25,656 --> 01:33:29,092
<i>The last time I saw my
brother was 20 years ago</i>

1084
01:33:29,226 --> 01:33:32,462
<i>on April 16th, 1935...</i>

1085
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:48,745
<i>The first day it rained
in almost a year.</i>

1086
01:33:54,986 --> 01:33:58,855
<i>Maybe a sign that Eugene
found what he was looking for.</i>

1087
01:36:31,518 --> 01:36:36,518
