1
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,395
Listen to me.

2
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,356
OK, you win.

3
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:52,403
At least you could stop that song.
You know I hate it.

4
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,157
Why are you so quiet?

5
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,121
Say something!

6
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,493
You're there.

7
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,411
And you're looking at me.

8
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,790
Do you think you can fool me?

9
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,085
No, no, you can't fool me,

10
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,004
because I can feel your presence.

11
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,174
And your movements.

12
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,385
I can even smell you.

13
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,428
If you think...

14
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,014
If you think, son of a bitch,

15
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,850
that I'll hang myself
while you watch, you...

16
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,875
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

17
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,169
Julia, what's wrong?

18
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,381
Julia, can you hear me?
Bring some water.

19
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,258
Take it easy, Julia.

20
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,219
Julia, are you OK?

21
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,679
- What happened?
- She fell.

22
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,057
- Call a doctor, quick!
- No, I'm OK.

23
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,351
I'm OK.

24
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,360
This is Sara. I can't take your call
at the moment. Please...

25
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,325
Do you think it's a good idea
to show up after six months?

26
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,910
I just need to know
that she is all right.

27
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,414
Sara?

28
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,501
Sara?

29
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,881
Maybe they have gone out.

30
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,341
No...

31
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,718
I know something's happened to her.

32
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,481
The power is out.

33
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:21,695
- The fuses seem to be OK.
- I'll look upstairs.

34
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,951
Sara?

35
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,295
Sara?

36
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,114
Isaac, she's nowhere to be found.
We'll ask the neighbors.

37
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,616
- Don't come down.
- Why?

38
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,287
What's wrong?

39
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,960
Isaac, tell me what's wrong.

40
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,046
- What's wrong?
- Julia...

41
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,549
- What's wrong?
- Come with me.

42
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,521
Inspector...

43
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,190
I'm sorry about what happened.

44
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,109
No, thanks.

45
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:46,905
The forensics say Sara took her own life
last night, during the blackout.

46
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,158
But we need to find out why.

47
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,744
I have been informed that she suffered
a degenerative disease.

48
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:57,624
Yes, a progressive vision loss,
the same as my wife.

49
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:01,128
But Sara went blind a year ago.

50
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,464
And how did she cope with that?

51
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,676
My sister wasn't depressed,
if that's what you mean.

52
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,970
In fact, she was...

53
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,764
She was going to have surgery, right?

54
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:17,102
She was waiting for a donor,
but she hoped to get her vision back.

55
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,737
Maybe she got tired of waiting.

56
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,103
All right.

57
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,775
Yes, thank you.

58
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,533
Dr RomÃ¡n can't come to the funeral,
and he sends his condolences.

59
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,286
He also wants to check your eyes
before you go back home.

60
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,498
Isaac, the power is back.

61
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,086
Darling, are you listening?

62
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,172
And the CD started playing.
Did you hear it?

63
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,343
- Yes.
- Don't you think it's strange

64
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,596
that Sara was listening
to music before...?

65
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,057
Besides, she hated that song.

66
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,768
- Julia...
- What if she wasn't alone?

67
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,688
- What if she was with somebody?
- Julia, please.

68
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:47,067
We may never find out her reasons.
We hadn't heard from her in months.

69
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,695
It's strange.
I need to know what happened.

70
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,407
- It's not good for you to get upset.
- I'm not worried about myself.

71
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:57,953
Well, I am.
Stress can turn you blind.

72
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,956
It's only happened to me
twice in five years.

73
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,001
And you've lost 20% of your vision.

74
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,471
Oh, no... Again.

75
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,573
Did you find anything?

76
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,534
Nothing, not even a candle.

77
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,663
- It's time to meet the neighbors.
- OK, hurry up.

78
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,189
Isaac?

79
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,588
Julia.

80
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,456
Excuse me.

81
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,793
Excuse me.

82
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:17,968
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm Blasco, her next-door neighbor.

83
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,929
I didn't know your sister very well,

84
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:26,143
but Lia loved her very much
and she wanted me to bring you this.

85
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,019
Lia?

86
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:32,190
My daughter.
Sara used to lend her books.

87
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:37,487
The poor girl is so upset she didn't
want to come out of the car.

88
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,615
Anyway...

89
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:46,329
Sorry... Lia would like to know
if Sara left any note.

90
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,334
- We don't know.
- I understand.

91
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,130
Anyway, I won't bother you any longer.

92
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,096
Shall we continue?

93
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,557
Only a neighbor and his daughter?

94
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,479
I didn't know she was so lonely.

95
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,867
But I forgave her.

96
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,498
And I also forgave you.

97
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:38,215
Now I only need to forgive myself
for not being by her side.

98
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,477
But I did everything I could,
didn't I, Isaac?

99
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,621
The autopsy doesn't reveal
anything strange.

100
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:14,543
- Have you searched for fingerprints?
- We only found ours and hers.

101
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,545
OK, but...

102
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,630
That song...

103
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,216
And what about what happened
in the cemetery?

104
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:26,179
Julia, there's no evidence
of anyone being with your sister.

105
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,724
And nobody has seen or heard
anything suspicious.

106
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,063
You can speak with Soledad if you wish.

107
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,316
- With whom?
- An old lady who lives nearby.

108
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,654
Apparently, she helped your sister
when she went blind.

109
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,282
Don't be long.

110
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,956
Where does she live?

111
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:56,126
Follow the rope in the yard.

112
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,627
What rope?

113
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,309
I'm sure the old woman
doesn't know anything.

114
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,604
Nobody else knew apart from you.

115
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,567
But you have to speak with your wife.
She'll find out sooner or later.

116
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,279
I'll wait for the right moment.

117
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,560
Mrs Soledad?

118
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,777
Hello?

119
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,531
Who is it?

120
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,659
It's Julia, Sara's sister.

121
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,494
I'll be right out.

122
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:22,295
Sorry about the mess.
The house must be quite disgusting.

123
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,883
Hello...

124
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,097
- Are you there?
- Yes. Sorry, I didn't know you were...

125
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:37,268
I am sorry too. I wanted to come
to your sister's funeral, but...

126
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,480
it took me an hour to find
a pair of matching shoes.

127
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,148
It's OK.

128
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,193
Were you a good friend of Sara?

129
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:49,155
Well, when she started
losing her eyesight,

130
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:54,202
a year ago,
we used to have long conversations.

131
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,749
But lately she hardly spoke with me.

132
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,252
She had made new friends.

133
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,840
- What new friends?
- You know, younger people.

134
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:11,219
- From the Baumann Centre.
- Baumann Centre. What's that?

135
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,055
A centre for blind people,
not far from here.

136
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:20,437
One of those places where they make you
believe you can live a normal life.

137
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:25,275
If you can't hear, you are deaf.
If you lost an arm, you are a cripple.

138
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,236
And if you can't see, you are blind.

139
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,322
And nothing can ever be
how it used to be.

140
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,618
Mrs Soledad, where can I take a taxi?

141
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,454
Thank you.

142
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,795
Go straight ahead,
down the stairs and turn right.

143
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,027
Poor Sara.

144
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,530
- Why would she hang herself?
- Stop thinking about it.

145
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,492
- Shall we have a moment of silence?
- Don't be cruel.

146
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,369
None of us could stand her.

147
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,122
Don't you find it strange?

148
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,665
No.

149
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,876
We've all thought
of doing it at some time.

150
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,004
Dela...

151
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,633
Nora is right. I once thought
of slitting my wrists.

152
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,178
With candles and opera music.

153
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,972
Me too, I thought of jumping
out of the window.

154
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,184
Well, we thought about it
but didn't do it.

155
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:44,354
There's a reason to live.

156
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,315
Maybe Sara didn't find any.

157
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:51,903
And a boyfriend doesn't seem like
a good reason?

158
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,280
Sara had a boyfriend?

159
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,407
She told me she met a boy.

160
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,618
- Who?
- No idea.

161
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,330
They had been going out together
for a couple of months.

162
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,750
They even went to Bellavista
together for a week.

163
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,922
- What's in Bellavista?
- Rooms for sex.

164
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,717
Quiet!

165
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,937
How weird! Shit!

166
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,772
What is it?

167
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,400
There's someone here.

168
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:34,237
- I would say it's Sara.
- That's not funny!

169
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:38,950
- I can smell her too.
- Something is moving.

170
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,496
- I've got her! Call security!
- I'm Sara's sister.

171
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,248
Julia?

172
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,292
Yes.

173
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:51,504
- Why were you spying on us?
- I just didn't want to interrupt.

174
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,507
- And who is he?
- Who?

175
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,926
- The man who came with you.
- I came alone.

176
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,263
There's someone else here.

177
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,224
A man, and he's right behind you.

178
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,662
Wait!

179
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,336
Who are you?

180
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,047
Turn around.

181
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,009
Turn around.

182
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,719
I said turn around!

183
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,674
No, no!

184
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,946
Isaac?

185
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,829
Isaac?

186
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,973
Hotel Romeo, Bellavista.

187
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,144
What happened to you?

188
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,772
You are soaking wet.

189
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,691
It started raining
when I left Soledad's house.

190
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,861
Have you been with her all this time?

191
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,491
She invited me for tea.
I couldn't say no.

192
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:53,830
Julia, I went to look for you.
You left her place an hour ago.

193
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,541
Where have you been?

194
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,876
Why are you so controlling?

195
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,712
I could also ask you
what you're looking for.

196
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,509
Fine.

197
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,345
Fine.

198
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:13,182
Now I'm certain there was
something strange in Sara's suicide.

199
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:18,020
- There's someone watching us.
- Julia, Julia, please.

200
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,480
Who?

201
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,652
Her boyfriend.

202
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,863
- Sara had a boyfriend?
- Yes.

203
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,030
Who told you?

204
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,575
A group of blind girls told me
at the Baumann Centre

205
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,535
and someone was spying on us.

206
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,329
- How do you know?
- Because I ran after him.

207
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:38,541
- You ran after him?
- Yes, I did.

208
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,293
Isaac.

209
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,380
- Isaac! What are you doing?
- We're leaving this house.

210
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,134
Listen to me. If I have to be
a controlling husband, I will be.

211
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,511
And if I have to drag you out of here,
I will too.

212
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,473
But I won't let you have a seizure.

213
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,517
You know I would never
forgive myself.

214
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,604
Your sister's death has hurt us enough.

215
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,447
You're right.

216
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,034
But I don't feel like
going back home.

217
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:17,413
Why don't we go somewhere,
you and me, alone?

218
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,176
Where would you like to go?

219
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:59,038
- Are you sure you want to stay there?
- The guide says it's the coziest hotel.

220
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,174
Nice view, isn't it?

221
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,804
- Julia.
- Yes, yes. It's beautiful.

222
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,347
Thank you.

223
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,891
Julia...

224
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,311
- I'll park the car.
- Yes, OK.

225
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,526
You don't remember my sister,
a blind woman?

226
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,362
Yes, a colleague talked to me about her.

227
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,114
This may sound weird,

228
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:36,450
but could you find out
the name of the man who was with her?

229
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:41,330
- There's no name on the receipt.
- Sorry, but I don't remember any man.

230
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,665
The thing is...

231
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,751
my sister is dead,
and I need to find this man.

232
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,879
Let me see... I don't understand.

233
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,632
Her booking is not registered.

234
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,344
It's as if all the information
was deleted.

235
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:59,974
- Are you sure?
- Sorry. It must be a computer problem.

236
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:05,646
You could try El Arlequin. It's the
restaurant we recommend to our guests.

237
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,315
Thank you.

238
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,524
Thank you.

239
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,033
Thank you.

240
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,703
I don't understand how they can
recommend this restaurant.

241
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,788
I like it.

242
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,835
It's not your style at all.

243
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,967
And that waiter
won't stop staring at you.

244
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,844
Really?

245
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,686
- It's your imagination.
- Maybe.

246
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:54,028
- My reading glasses...
- In your coat? How weird.

247
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:58,699
I'll go and get them,
and I'll go to the toilet too.

248
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,412
If he hits on you, just yell.

249
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,133
What a change!

250
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:21,347
I like it. It highlights your eyes.
By the way, I knew they were green.

251
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:25,810
You're confusing me with my twin sister.
She was here last week.

252
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,937
With her boyfriend.

253
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,563
Her boyfriend?

254
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,108
She came with a man, didn't she?

255
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,194
Yes, I think so.

256
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,448
- Do you remember his name?
- No, no idea.

257
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,535
He was very quiet, very sad.

258
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,914
- Could you describe him?
- Sure, he was...

259
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,626
He was very plain,
like any other man.

260
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,963
But was he tall, short,
blond hair, dark hair?

261
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,176
I can't remember right now.

262
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,221
How can you remember my sister
but nothing about the man?

263
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:06,517
She drew a bit of attention
with that blindfold.

264
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,812
Blindfold?

265
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,107
She was bandaged after the operation.

266
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,822
- Did she have an operation?
- Of course.

267
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,991
Hence the bet over her eye color.

268
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,285
She said she'd come
once she'd recovered,

269
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,620
and if I guessed her eye color,
I could...

270
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,498
- Pablo, can you come for a second?
- Yes, sure.

271
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,917
Excuse me.
My greetings to her.

272
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,469
I couldn't find them.

273
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,681
Let's see how I manage.

274
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,355
Is something wrong?

275
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,363
Sara was here last week.

276
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,537
Julia... what are we doing here?

277
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:13,042
Isaac, the waiter told me
she had her eyes bandaged.

278
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,502
Do you realize?

279
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,882
If she had the operation and had
a chance to regain her sight,

280
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,093
why would she commit suicide?

281
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,055
Tell me why.

282
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,232
Because the operation didn't work.

283
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,985
What?

284
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,696
It didn't work.

285
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:47,535
Dr RomÃ¡n told me yesterday.

286
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,669
I was waiting for the right moment
to tell you.

287
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,275
That man exists.

288
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:22,152
Julia, Julia.

289
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,197
- Anything else I should know?
- I was only trying to protect you.

290
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,242
- From what?
- From the truth.

291
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,952
What's the truth?

292
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:35,249
Sara committed suicide because
she couldn't stand being blind.

293
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,634
Julia.

294
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,012
Julia.

295
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,893
Did you know she came here
with her boyfriend?

296
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,644
That doesn't prove anything.

297
00:30:55,812 --> 00:31:01,317
And why is he hiding?
Why didn't he show up at the funeral?

298
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,194
Maybe he wasn't with her by then.

299
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:10,200
Maybe he left her when he found out
she'd never recover her sight.

300
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,080
That easy?

301
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,957
That easy, right?

302
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,501
- Well...
- I can't believe you're a psychologist.

303
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,795
Julia!

304
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,674
God!

305
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,513
What are you doing?

306
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,057
Julia, Julia.

307
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,975
Didn't you see the car?

308
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,692
You didn't see it, did you?

309
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,951
How many seizures have you had?

310
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,202
Two.

311
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,496
Shit!

312
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,540
Shit.

313
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,883
If...

314
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:13,430
- If I go blind... When I go blind...
- No, no. That won't happen.

315
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,644
Not wanting it
doesn't mean it won't happen.

316
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,069
Isaac...

317
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,866
One time you told me that...

318
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:38,831
...when you looked into my eyes,
you could see the entire universe.

319
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:45,087
- I still can.
- What if the universe shuts down?

320
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,636
Close your eyes.

321
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,514
What?

322
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,683
Close your eyes.

323
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,650
Can you see me?

324
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,279
Of course I can't.

325
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,950
Then how do you know
I'm still here with you?

326
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,619
Because I can hear you.

327
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,374
What if I remain silent?

328
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,210
How do you know I'm still here?

329
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,144
I can touch you.

330
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,441
And you can smell me.

331
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,154
And kiss you.

332
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:19,306
Promise me that when the day comes,
we will go back to the desert.

333
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,975
What?

334
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,144
You know?

335
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,649
The last thing I'd like to see
is that sky, with you.

336
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,694
- Julia...
- Promise me.

337
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,405
Promise me.

338
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,867
I promise you.

339
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,621
But...

340
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,374
But you have to promise me...

341
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,920
...that you will stop chasing ghosts.

342
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,757
And that we will go and see Dr RomÃ¡n.

343
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,552
Tomorrow.

344
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,180
OK.

345
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:21,410
I'll bring the luggage to the car.
I'll wait for you outside.

346
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:22,911
In 15 minutes.

347
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,714
Ms Levin.

348
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,302
Ms Levin.

349
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,930
I'm really sorry for your loss.

350
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,684
My name is CrÃ©spulo.

351
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,313
I read about your sister
in the obituaries section of the newspaper.

352
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,023
Thank you.

353
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,442
I have something of hers.

354
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,864
A few hours after your sister left,

355
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:04,536
I found a key in her room,
under the bed.

356
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:08,457
I think I put it here somewhere.

357
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,301
Thank you.

358
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,482
Mr CrÃ©spulo.

359
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,651
I'm sorry.

360
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,655
Mr CrÃ©spulo...

361
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,241
My sister came here with a man,
didn't she?

362
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,826
The invisible man.

363
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,498
I beg your pardon?

364
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:56,046
Nobody remembers the man
who came with your sister, right?

365
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,842
Well...

366
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:03,303
That doesn't mean he is invisible.

367
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,098
There are people with no light.

368
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:10,560
Do you know what it's like to walk in
somewhere and not be noticed?

369
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:16,942
Or to walk on the street
and have people stumble against you?

370
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:24,199
Or to ask something for the third time
and have no one answer your question?

371
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,868
That's the man you're looking for.

372
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:30,455
A pause, a vacuum.

373
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,375
An absence.

374
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,170
That's why nobody remembers him.

375
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,048
Nobody except you.

376
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,346
In a way, I am also invisible.

377
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,685
It's been many years since the last time
someone remembered me.

378
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,564
This man...

379
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:58,567
do you know where I can find him?

380
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,114
What are you afraid of?

381
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:10,037
He parked his van in a car park
two blocks down the street.

382
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:16,084
There's a CCTV camera
recording 24 hours a day.

383
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,379
Thank you.

384
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,340
Wait!

385
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:22,883
Be careful.

386
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:28,472
The man who was with your sister
had very angry eyes.

387
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,391
He knows how to be a shadow.

388
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:35,937
If someone feels invisible
and is angry at the world,

389
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,106
he can be dangerous.

390
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,692
He has no light.
Nobody looks at him.

391
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:44,321
He could sneak up on you and...

392
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,099
- Where have you been?
- Did you see anyone?

393
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:15,977
- I've been waiting for 10 minutes.
- Wait a moment.

394
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:19,231
He's here.
And I know how to find him.

395
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,612
- No!
- What are you doing?

396
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,407
- Let me talk to the guard.
- Will you calm down?

397
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,034
- Calm down!
- Wait here.

398
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,328
Don't be so rude!

399
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,665
I remind you
that you made a promise last night.

400
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,375
- Enough.
- I can't take it anymore!

401
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,877
- I said don't yell at me!
- I've had it!

402
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,171
There's no mystery in Sara's death!

403
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,591
Do you want the footage?
You'll have it.

404
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,429
But this shit ends
right here, right now, all right?

405
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,036
You've reached...

406
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:41,938
Excuse me.

407
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,609
Has anyone been here
asking about security videos?

408
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,029
Look... I don't want any trouble, OK?

409
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:52,282
That guy came, gave me some money
and I promised to keep my mouth shut.

410
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,577
He is my husband.
I've been waiting for a while.

411
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,288
Do you know which way he went out?

412
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:03,585
He left as soon as my little friend
made the copies he wanted.

413
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,420
And...

414
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,589
Was there anyone else here?

415
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,674
- Are you sure?
- Nobody.

416
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:13,637
We can check the monitors
in case we see something.

417
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,223
What the hell?

418
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,272
I'll be right back.

419
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,071
Goddammit!

420
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,782
What's wrong?

421
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,541
Calm down. It's me.

422
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,751
Someone has switched off the power.

423
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,965
It's impossible.

424
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,801
It's impossible.

425
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,954
My husband has been kidnapped.
He's in danger.

426
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:24,833
OK, the only thing we know is that
someone stole some CCTV footage.

427
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:30,213
No, I've already told you.
It was the man who was with my sister.

428
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,341
You have to find him
before it's too late.

429
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:38,555
How can we find someone
that nobody has seen, not even you?

430
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,103
CrÃ©spulo.

431
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,279
- He killed him because he was...
- No evidence of violence.

432
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,282
...the only who could recognize
the invisible man.

433
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,369
- He's erasing his tracks.
- What do you mean?

434
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,871
My husband is in danger!

435
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,415
- Calm down, madam!
- Isaac!

436
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,918
Call a doctor, quick.

437
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,921
We need a doctor down here.

438
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,093
Isaac.

439
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,778
The process is irreversible.

440
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,655
How long do I have?

441
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:23,034
I don't know...
Perhaps a few hours, days.

442
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,121
Maybe a few weeks.
Definitely less than a month.

443
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:29,165
We have to find a donor
and operate as soon as possible.

444
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,126
Did you know Sara's boyfriend?

445
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,839
No, I didn't know him.

446
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,760
Julia, I know you're going through
a hard time,

447
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,888
but you have to think about yourself.

448
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:48,101
So, please,
try to avoid emotional stress.

449
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,688
And don't force your eyes. OK?

450
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,286
IvÃ¡n. IvÃ¡n.

451
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,844
A boyfriend?

452
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,306
Sara never told me
about any boyfriends.

453
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:29,100
She didn't trust men.

454
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,311
Unlike me.

455
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,272
- Or you.
- Isaac hasn't left me, I'm sure.

456
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,400
That's what all women think.

457
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,821
I also came up with a story
when my husband left me.

458
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,950
He couldn't stand my son Ã

459
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,537
And my son was more important
than anything else.

460
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:55,168
Then my eyes started to degenerate
and I went blind.

461
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:58,755
Luckily, Ã

462
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:02,801
until I woke up one morning...

463
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,011
and he was gone.

464
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,222
My son was gone.

465
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:12,018
What kind of son abandons
a blind mother?

466
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,396
I had to come up with a story.

467
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:18,233
And I still keep to it.

468
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,445
Such humiliation!
I'm sorry.

469
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,581
Hello?

470
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:37,085
The hotel is fully automated.
There are no staff.

471
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,921
Guests check in through a machine.

472
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:43,591
They called from the bank this morning
to inform me about a transaction

473
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,927
with your husband's credit card.

474
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:50,932
I searched the room
and found this on the bedside table.

475
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:55,270
Julia, there's things about your husband
you don't know.

476
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,733
- He kept Sara's surgery from you.
- To protect me. The doctor told me...

477
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,654
The doctor didn't talk to anybody
about the surgery.

478
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,783
How did your husband know?

479
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:15,081
Inspector, a patrol just drove by
Sara's house and saw light inside.

480
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,630
Isaac?

481
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,676
Wait here. Don't move.

482
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,501
Isaac?

483
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,523
Hello?

484
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,736
Isaac?

485
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,701
Isaac?

486
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,215
Julia!

487
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,302
Shit! I have to get out of here.

488
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,514
Where is it? Stay calm.

489
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:58,559
Where is the door? Stay calm.

490
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,522
Julia? Julia?

491
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,696
Inspector! There's somebody
down here. Inspector!

492
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,326
Julia, calm down. It's me.

493
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:20,873
There's somebody here.

494
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,419
There's somebody here.

495
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,806
What's wrong?

496
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,433
What's wrong?

497
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,271
Turn on the torch.
I hate darkness.

498
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:48,067
Please, say something.
Why aren't you saying anything?

499
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,752
Thank you.

500
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,465
Hi.

501
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,388
There's something
you should know, Julia.

502
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,808
Your husband left a letter.

503
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:25,813
We checked the handwriting
and there is no doubt it's his.

504
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,608
Listen...

505
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:33,529
Sara and Isaac
had been lovers for six months.

506
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,991
He apologizes in the letter.

507
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:43,498
That explains the numerous calls to her
we found on his mobile phone.

508
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,628
Did you know
they were in touch lately?

509
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,807
Think, Julia.

510
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:05,019
Did Isaac insist on getting the video?

511
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:09,690
Probably because he didn't want you
to see him on it.

512
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:16,697
Then he went back to the motel and
decided he couldn't live without Sara.

513
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:23,037
I'm sorry, but everything makes sense.

514
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,971
We found a donor.
We can operate tomorrow.

515
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,473
You just have to sign here.

516
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,190
Thank you.

517
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,046
Calm down, Julia!

518
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,509
Calm down. Sleep a bit more.

519
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:25,057
OK, Julia... Everything went well.

520
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,603
But we have to be careful now.

521
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:33,024
You eyes must be protected
from the light for two weeks.

522
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,776
And don't manipulate
the bandages yourself.

523
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:40,072
If you remove them too soon,
there won't be a solution.

524
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,743
But don't worry,
you will be taken care of.

525
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,703
No.

526
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,789
I'd rather go home.
I hate hospitals.

527
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,709
I know,
but I'm afraid that's impossible.

528
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:56,756
- You need supervision.
- I could... go to my sister's house.

529
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:59,634
I know my way around it very well.

530
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,472
Julia, honestly,
I don't think it's a good idea.

531
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,434
Right, but if I can't see, I can't feel.

532
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:15,566
All right, let's do this.
You can go to your sister's house.

533
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:19,946
But a care worker will visit you
every day, OK?

534
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:28,913
Julia, there's something else.

535
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:34,168
Your husband's body is still here.
I can take care of it if you want.

536
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,128
No.

537
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,841
I'd rather do it myself.

538
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:45,179
Could you keep the body
until I can see again?

539
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:48,182
I need to say goodbye to him.

540
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,362
Let's sit on the sofa. Slowly.

541
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,447
Keep walking...

542
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,617
- Here are your things.
- Thank you.

543
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:11,372
- Careful. Don't worry.
- No problem.

544
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,296
Shall we wait here
until the care worker arrives?

545
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:21,257
- Can you do me a favor?
- Sure. What is it?

546
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,926
I'd like to know what this key opens.

547
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:38,190
Whatever it is this key opens,
it's not here.

548
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,569
- Did you try every lock?
- I did.

549
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:44,071
Do you need anything else?

550
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,948
No, thank you.

551
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,743
- You can go.
- All right.

552
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,481
- Hello?
- Hi.

553
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:03,859
You must be Julia.
I'm IvÃ¡n, the care worker.

554
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,988
Sorry I'm late. The traffic was bad.
I phoned you, but it got cut off.

555
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:13,828
I would have preferred a woman.

556
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:18,874
If you want to call Dr RomÃ¡n...
What happened to your hand?

557
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:27,591
It's just a scratch. You won't
feel anything tomorrow morning.

558
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:33,013
I will make you dinner
and clean up a bit. You stay here.

559
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,641
By the way...

560
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:40,062
What should I do with the glasses?

561
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,814
Throw them out.

562
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:49,572
While you ate,
I familiarized myself with the house.

563
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,032
Julia.

564
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,997
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. I have to go.

565
00:56:58,165 --> 00:56:59,999
What time is it?

566
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,209
It's nine o'clock.

567
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,837
On the first days,
we lose track of time.

568
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,550
I'll give you a couple
of sleeping pills, just in case.

569
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:12,595
And also a pager.

570
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:16,557
If you want to contact me,
press this button. Give me your hand.

571
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,810
Look, here's the button.

572
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,612
Let's go.

573
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,573
- What are you doing?
- I have to put you to bed.

574
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,994
- Sorry, but I can do it myself.
- Are you sure?

575
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,755
Are you OK?

576
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,258
OK, you win.

577
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,511
Put me to bed and then you can go.

578
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,372
Who's there?

579
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:29,046
Calm down.
Calm down, darling.

580
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,715
It's me.

581
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,676
Isaac?

582
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,762
Isaac?

583
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:40,057
How can this be?

584
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,107
Don't say anything.

585
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,193
Thank you.

586
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:57,866
- What are you doing?
- Taking this dirty bandage off.

587
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,537
- So you can see me better.
- No!

588
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,374
That's it, that's it.

589
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:09,503
Leave me alone.
Get off me! Get off me!

590
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:15,759
Don't resist, little sister.
We're two against one.

591
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,266
Don't move.

592
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:24,435
No, stop!

593
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,022
Get off me!

594
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:06,727
IvÃ¡n. IvÃ¡n.

595
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,063
Julia, is everything OK?

596
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:12,900
- I think there's someone in the house.
- What?

597
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,319
In the room next door.

598
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:19,740
- Don't move. I'll call the police.
- No, IvÃ¡n, IvÃ¡n.

599
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,881
Are you still there?

600
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,928
You have to get me out of here
right now.

601
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:44,431
- Where are you?
- In the guest room.

602
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,351
That's good.
Find the door and get out of the room.

603
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,814
Find the door to your right.

604
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,484
- He's there.
- Calm down.

605
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,487
The handrail is in front of you.
Look for it.

606
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,155
OK, yes.

607
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,616
Hold onto the handrail.

608
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,786
Go down the six steps
to the first landing.

609
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:12,167
Then there's nine more.

610
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,171
Julia...

611
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:22,469
- I'm downstairs. What now?
- Follow the wall to the door.

612
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:31,687
Who are you?
Who are you?

613
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,647
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

614
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,483
Get out of the house! Quick!

615
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:56,503
There is no indication
that someone entered the house.

616
01:01:56,671 --> 01:02:00,340
There was someone there.
And he was looking for something.

617
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:04,011
Sorry, but there's nothing else
I can do.

618
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,100
- Do you want me to call the hospital?
- Why?

619
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:14,021
Maybe you shouldn't recover here,
considering what you've been through.

620
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:16,023
You don't believe me either.

621
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:21,653
I'm just saying that in your situation,
it's normal if your senses deceive you.

622
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:25,032
Don't open your eyes now.

623
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,952
You can let go now.

624
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,372
What's the matter?

625
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,251
My eyes could get damaged, right?

626
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:41,215
No, I only want to change the bandage,
and I took precautions.

627
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:44,468
I've done this a hundred times.
Don't worry.

628
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,642
You know, when I was 20 years old,

629
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:54,895
I had a car accident
and I was blind for two months.

630
01:02:56,898 --> 01:03:02,903
And like you now,
I imagined things and had nightmares.

631
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:05,531
And I rejected the care worker's help.

632
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,911
I couldn't stand the idea
of going blind.

633
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,586
In the end, I recovered my sight.

634
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,092
But during those months...

635
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:29,638
...I understood what it was like
to live in the dark.

636
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,103
That's why I became a care worker.

637
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:39,648
You made that up
to make me feel better.

638
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:43,360
No, no. Call the hospital
if you don't believe me.

639
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:49,533
Julia, I know you're scared,
but the only way to lose that fear

640
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:51,618
is to fight it.

641
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:00,210
What do you say?

642
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,631
Will you let me help you?

643
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,851
- What happened?
- You spilled it.

644
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:19,730
Try to get to the door.
Follow the wall with your hand...

645
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,485
And after the glass cabinet...

646
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:52,679
Well, I have my ups and downs.

647
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,098
But I slept very well
the last few nights.

648
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:58,518
IvÃ¡n has been
very patient with me all week.

649
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,729
Yes, he takes good care of me.

650
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:04,024
I will. I will, yes.

651
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:06,276
Thanks a lot for calling. Bye.

652
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:11,657
- Are you leaving?
- Yes. It's a little late.

653
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,867
Why don't stay a bit longer?

654
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,204
A little while.

655
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,623
- Are you still afraid?
- No.

656
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,541
No, it's not that.

657
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,169
Never mind.

658
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,757
OK, should I make
a special dinner for two?

659
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:33,971
- Go and watch TV. I'll cook.
- That's a little difficult.

660
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,662
Aren't you drinking too much?

661
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,415
I'm celebrating.

662
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:03,083
What?

663
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:06,920
That in four days,

664
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:10,340
I will have the bandages removed
and I will see again.

665
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:14,094
Everything will be all right, Julia.

666
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,514
You know,

667
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:21,852
if the operation doesn't work,
I couldn't complain.

668
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:25,605
I have seen everything I wanted to see.

669
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:30,444
What's the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

670
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,572
Funny!

671
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:36,158
How ironic that you ask me that.

672
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,993
Why?

673
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:44,499
Because I spent my whole life
looking for invisible planets.

674
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,878
My eyes have seen amazing things.

675
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:54,634
But nothing can compare
to the sky in the Sahara.

676
01:06:57,388 --> 01:07:00,140
That's where I met Isaac.

677
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:05,562
We were on the same excursion
and we spent the whole night...

678
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:09,232
...staring at the sky.

679
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:14,613
I asked him, "Is that not the most
beautiful thing you've ever seen?"

680
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,783
And he said, "Yes."

681
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,832
When I turned my head,

682
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,587
I realized that he'd been watching me
for a while and I got nervous.

683
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,673
And I asked him...

684
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:39,346
..."Why aren't you watching
the universe?"

685
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:45,143
And he said,
"I don't have to look up to do it."

686
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:49,815
"I can see the universe in your eyes."

687
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,944
And what happened?

688
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,657
I came close.

689
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:01,535
I touched him.

690
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:05,831
And I realized that he was nervous too.

691
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:10,585
In that moment it was as if
we became one person.

692
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:13,630
And I wanted to know
if he felt the same.

693
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:16,049
What did he say?

694
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,760
Nothing.

695
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,973
He replied with his gaze.

696
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:24,766
Why?

697
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:28,603
Why did he look at me that way? Why?

698
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:34,067
- Do you prefer I hadn't done it?
- I don't know.

699
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:40,240
When you had the affair with Sara,
I thought it was just an indiscretion,

700
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:43,702
but I swear I don't know
what to think any more.

701
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,788
I don't know what to think.

702
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:52,919
Everything will be all right, Julia.

703
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:56,923
You promise?

704
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:00,594
I promise.

705
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,405
No, I can't.

706
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,657
I can't do it.

707
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:25,285
It's not right.

708
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,460
- IvÃ¡n.
- Don't say anything.

709
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:37,088
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. Don't say anything.

710
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,633
I'll call the hospital
and ask to be replaced.

711
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,551
Is that what you want?

712
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:44,971
And you?

713
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,899
OK, I'll come back tomorrow and...

714
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:59,736
If not, just contact me on my pager.

715
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,746
Help! Help!

716
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:36,541
Help!

717
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:42,422
Calm down!
I'm Blasco, the neighbor! Lia's father!

718
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:45,050
Call the police, please!

719
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,803
Calm down!
You need a drink.

720
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:52,640
No, no.
Call the police, please.

721
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:56,853
Why do you want to call the police?
To tell another one of your nightmares?

722
01:11:57,021 --> 01:12:01,149
- The last time they didn't believe you.
- No. There was someone by my bed.

723
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,151
I swear, this time it's true.

724
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:06,112
And what did he want?
To rape you?

725
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:09,741
It's my daughter.
Don't be afraid.

726
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:12,077
I told you not to sneak up on people!

727
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:14,287
Go back to your bed!

728
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:17,123
And close the door!

729
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,459
Mr Blasco...

730
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:22,796
Can you call now, please?

731
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:29,677
Of course, of course.
Don't worry.

732
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:34,808
How strange.
There's no line.

733
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,312
Calm down.

734
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,606
I'll get the mobile phone.

735
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:23,189
The mobile is out of battery.
It will take a few minutes to charge.

736
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:29,446
Sit down, sit down.

737
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:31,823
Sit down.

738
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,908
What do you say?

739
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:39,914
Do you want something to drink
while we wait?

740
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:44,002
- What do you say?
- Could I have a glass of water?

741
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:49,132
- Water?
- Yes, my throat is a bit dry.

742
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:09,527
Julia, where are you going?

743
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:11,988
Hey!

744
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,324
Hey!

745
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:18,203
Madam!
Where are you, madam?

746
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,205
Madam!

747
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,083
Please, pick up.

748
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,544
IvÃ¡n.

749
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,630
Pick up, please.

750
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:29,839
Julia, what's wrong?

751
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:45,188
- Julia!
- IvÃ¡n!

752
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:48,733
- Let's go to your house.
- Not my house.

753
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:51,236
- Julia, calm down.
- No, my house is not safe.

754
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:54,072
Please. Take me to your place.

755
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,492
OK.

756
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:00,912
OK, thanks. Bye.

757
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,958
What did they say?

758
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:09,254
Inspector Dimas
won't be on duty until seven.

759
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:14,968
You should get some rest
and I'll go with you tomorrow morning.

760
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:19,055
Julia, I won't let anyone hurt you.

761
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:22,225
You can sleep in my bed.

762
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:25,186
- And you?
- I have a mattress. I'll be right back.

763
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:29,649
- No, no.
- I'll be right back. You're safe here.

764
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:31,526
I'll be back in a minute.

765
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:48,960
IvÃ¡n?

766
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:31,544
- Who are you?
- I'm Lia.

767
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,296
- Who are you?
- Lia Blasco.

768
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:35,340
Don't get close.
How did you find me?

769
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:38,801
- I followed you. I was Sara's friend.
- I said don't come close.

770
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:42,722
Listen, my father
has nothing to do with all this.

771
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:46,809
- Your father lied to me.
- My father is lonely, and you're hot.

772
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:48,227
I don't believe you.

773
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:51,981
I was the one who took the key
and have been spying on you.

774
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:54,025
- You?
- Do you have nightmares?

775
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:56,986
- What?
- Sara also had them.

776
01:16:57,154 --> 01:17:01,783
She dreamt of someone taking the bandage
off and piercing her eyes with needles.

777
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,409
There's a monster on the street,

778
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:06,162
but no one can see him
because he hides in the darkness.

779
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,539
He made Sara go blind
and will do the same with you.

780
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:10,249
- Stop!
- It's him.

781
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:14,087
I followed him and tried the key.
And today I saw the needles again.

782
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:17,423
- It's him, Julia. It's the care worker.
- No.

783
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:21,302
Listen to me!

784
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:25,890
Do you really think Isaac
killed himself? He loved you.

785
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:30,436
- He loved Sara more.
- They didn't want to worry you.

786
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:33,231
That's why they kept you in the dark.
Sara told me.

787
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:35,942
Isaac wrote a suicide note.
Leave me alone.

788
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:40,029
- The monster forced him to write it.
- Monsters don't exist. Enough!

789
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:41,989
This one does.

790
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:45,785
He collects pictures.

791
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:50,373
His wall is covered
with pictures of you and Sara.

792
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:54,711
- He removed your eyes.
- Lia, that's enough!

793
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:56,295
Leave me alone!

794
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,133
What are you doing?

795
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,388
Use the key if you don't believe me.

796
01:18:07,141 --> 01:18:09,600
The key. Where's the key?

797
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:11,936
- He took it.
- No, you took it.

798
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:15,898
- Why me?
- I don't know. To protect your father.

799
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:19,610
- It's him. Don't tell him I'm here.
- Lia. Lia.

800
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:24,824
IvÃ¡n?

801
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:27,577
Julia, what are you doing?

802
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:30,037
I'm really nervous.

803
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:33,499
I'll make you a cup of tea.

804
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:35,501
It will help you relax.

805
01:18:36,336 --> 01:18:38,838
- IvÃ¡n...
- Yes?

806
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:44,594
I can't find the key. It's the only
evidence to incriminate Blasco.

807
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,513
Did you take it?

808
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:03,112
- You must have dropped it.
- Please, give it to me.

809
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,490
I'll keep it for you.
You are very nervous.

810
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:09,243
I'll make you a cup of tea.
You sit down and relax.

811
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:20,797
He's lying. He had the key.

812
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:23,466
- We have to get out of here.
- I don't want to.

813
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:27,220
- You don't believe me now?
- It's impossible. He is a care worker.

814
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:32,600
Shit! It's locked.

815
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,812
- Julia!
- Yes?

816
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,649
- Do you want sugar?
- Two teaspoons, thanks.

817
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,905
He wants to drug you and make you blind.

818
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:47,198
What are you saying?

819
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,700
- Can you take this off?
- No. Why?

820
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:54,413
Then we can't get out of the window.
I need to get the key.

821
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:57,792
Get rid of him
and wait for me in the bathroom.

822
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:02,255
Here you go.

823
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:06,759
I'll take you to bed
and wait until you fall asleep.

824
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:14,392
I need to go to the bathroom.

825
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:17,520
OK.

826
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:23,025
Thank you.

827
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:04,066
- Julia, is everything all right?
- Yes. What was that noise?

828
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:06,319
I don't know. I heard it too.

829
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:08,905
I thought something had happened to you.

830
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:13,075
- Hurry up, or your tea will get cold.
- I'll be right out.

831
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:21,042
Lia, please.

832
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:26,005
Four days left. Only four days.

833
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:30,676
Four days, four days.

834
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:47,860
Julia, I have to go down again.
Are you OK?

835
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:50,571
Yes, I'll be right out.

836
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:12,862
Lia.

837
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:15,448
Lia.

838
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:49,982
What are you doing here?

839
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:55,196
Why are you crying?

840
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,909
Please, answer me.

841
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:05,623
A girl called Lia came to see me.

842
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:08,042
Blasco's daughter.

843
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,336
And she made me very nervous.

844
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:14,423
- Why did you take the bandage off?
- I couldn't see anything.

845
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:19,136
She told me horrible things about you
and I was afraid.

846
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,430
About me?

847
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:25,101
You would never hurt me, would you?

848
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:27,853
No.

849
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:30,356
I had to...

850
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:33,692
I had to see your face to know it.

851
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:37,363
And what did you see?

852
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:46,205
Nothing. I can't see anything.

853
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:12,857
Are you sure you can't see anything?

854
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,743
Sometimes the eyes
take time to adjust.

855
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:40,801
The operation didn't work.

856
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:50,769
I'm really sorry, Julia.

857
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:58,569
Probably the girl lied to you
in order to protect her father.

858
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:04,617
Tomorrow... we'll speak with
the inspector and all this will be over.

859
01:26:04,784 --> 01:26:07,786
No. No.

860
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:11,081
No, please.
Take me to the hospital now.

861
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:14,793
- Now, please.
- We'll call Dr RomÃ¡n.

862
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:19,006
- Now.
- Julia, listen to me.

863
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:22,968
Dr RomÃ¡n?

864
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:27,139
It's IvÃ¡n. Sorry to wake you
at this time of night.

865
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:29,975
I have a problem with Julia Levin.

866
01:26:31,811 --> 01:26:34,855
She took the bandage off by accident.

867
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:48,202
I understand. I will tell her right now.
Thanks, and sorry to bother you.

868
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:50,663
What did he say?

869
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,791
He's at a conference.
We can't do anything until next week.

870
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:58,170
- Then take me to a different hospital.
- No. RomÃ¡n said you have to rest.

871
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:03,717
- I need a second opinion.
- Julia, the damage is done.

872
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:06,887
But if you don't do as I say,
it will be irreversible.

873
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:16,689
OK.

874
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:51,140
Why did you get up?

875
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:56,186
- The kettle was whistling.
- I'll do it. You sit down.

876
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:58,605
Be careful.

877
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,901
Very good.

878
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:15,414
This is nearly ready.

879
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:33,766
Here you are.

880
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:36,143
Thank you.

881
01:28:52,952 --> 01:28:54,370
What's the matter?

882
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:01,585
Why are you doing all this, IvÃ¡n?

883
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:10,260
What do you mean?

884
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:12,846
Why all this attention?

885
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:18,018
What do you want from me?

886
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:22,106
Well, Julia...

887
01:29:25,985 --> 01:29:27,945
When...

888
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,280
When you kissed me...

889
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:35,994
I didn't expect it.

890
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:40,958
I didn't expect it, but don't think
I don't like you because...

891
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:42,418
because that's not true.

892
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:49,258
I only wanted to give you some time.
You've suffered a lot.

893
01:29:49,426 --> 01:29:53,303
And some wounds need to heal.

894
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:57,766
What I'm trying to say is...

895
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:01,437
...I want to be with you.

896
01:30:07,026 --> 01:30:08,944
Drink your tea.

897
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:27,880
Did you put sugar in it?

898
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:34,261
I'll bring some.

899
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,707
Two teaspoons, right?

900
01:31:04,918 --> 01:31:06,418
As usual.

901
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:14,885
Done?

902
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:31,735
Can you come with me, please?

903
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:38,575
- Why?
- I need your help with the freezer.

904
01:31:39,536 --> 01:31:43,121
Come. Let's go. Leave this here.

905
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:10,816
Open the freezer.

906
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:12,568
Why?

907
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,820
Just do it.

908
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:19,658
Open the freezer, I said.

909
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:51,732
Liar.

910
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:15,839
Are you afraid?

911
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:30,395
You don't know what fear is!

912
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:36,735
You have no idea what fear is!

913
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:38,195
Real fear.

914
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:40,656
Fear of being ignored and rejected.

915
01:33:40,823 --> 01:33:43,742
Look at me. Look at me!

916
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:47,454
You don't know what it's like to live
in the dark and hide in another world.

917
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:53,669
A world full of silence,
getting used to measuring your steps.

918
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:57,464
Always wearing
the appropriate clothes.

919
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,884
Making your voice one voice and none.

920
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:04,763
And your eyes, two eyes and none.

921
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:08,975
It takes so long that eventually
you become a shadow.

922
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:13,522
But one day you find out that
blind girls realize that you're there,

923
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:17,734
that you're breathing,
that you are still alive.

924
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:23,448
That you can offer them your eyes
for theirs, your hands for theirs...

925
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:26,910
That's why our relationship
is so perfect.

926
01:34:27,787 --> 01:34:28,870
That's why...

927
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:32,207
...we have to continue this way.

928
01:34:37,714 --> 01:34:40,257
If you are not IvÃ¡n, who are you?

929
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:43,093
Where are you taking me?

930
01:34:44,137 --> 01:34:46,722
My eyes hurt.
Something is wrong.

931
01:34:47,306 --> 01:34:50,058
Take the bandage off, please.

932
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:52,644
Please.

933
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:55,480
Please, take it off.

934
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:58,942
Please, my eyes hurt.
Take the bandage off.

935
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:00,986
Shut up!

936
01:35:03,322 --> 01:35:05,157
I beg you.

937
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:21,465
Let me see.

938
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:24,843
Let me see.

939
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:31,349
It's started again, right?

940
01:35:37,648 --> 01:35:39,649
This time...

941
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:42,861
...it will be more intense.

942
01:35:57,668 --> 01:36:00,712
Get out of the car.
You have to pack your bags.

943
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,216
Open the door, Julia.

944
01:36:09,222 --> 01:36:13,183
Open the fucking door!
Open the door!

945
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:16,311
Open the fucking door!

946
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:18,355
Julia!

947
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:20,106
Julia!

948
01:36:20,316 --> 01:36:22,067
Julia!

949
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:27,864
Julia!

950
01:37:45,651 --> 01:37:47,819
Who's there?

951
01:37:47,987 --> 01:37:50,322
Is the main door locked?

952
01:37:50,489 --> 01:37:53,491
- Is that you, Julia? You scared me.
- Is it locked?

953
01:37:53,659 --> 01:37:56,369
Yes, of course.
What's wrong?

954
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:59,247
- There's a murderer in the area.
- A murderer?

955
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:01,666
We have to call the police.
Where's the phone?

956
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:06,171
There, in the corner.
Under the painting.

957
01:38:06,339 --> 01:38:08,298
Don't move.

958
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:10,300
Be quiet.

959
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:12,552
- What's wrong?
- Don't move.

960
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:22,520
- It's him. He's here.
- Who?

961
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:25,690
Don't come any closer,
you son of a bitch.

962
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:29,569
- Who are you talking to?
- To a man who thinks he's invisible.

963
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:32,864
He made Sara go blind
and he wants to do the same to me.

964
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:36,660
- You're scaring me.
- Stay away.

965
01:38:36,827 --> 01:38:38,787
Soledad, call the police.

966
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:41,873
- Call the police, quick!
- Don't do it, Mum.

967
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:45,085
Ã

968
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:47,671
Is that you, son?

969
01:38:50,841 --> 01:38:52,384
Yes.

970
01:38:52,551 --> 01:38:54,135
I'm back home.

971
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:57,639
This woman says you're chasing her.

972
01:38:57,807 --> 01:38:59,724
This woman is crazy.

973
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:05,146
- Your son is a murderer.
- Shut up. Don't listen to her, Mum.

974
01:39:05,314 --> 01:39:07,065
- He killed my husband.
- She's lying.

975
01:39:07,233 --> 01:39:09,985
- He killed my husband and Sara too.
- Shut up.

976
01:39:10,152 --> 01:39:13,989
- It must have been easy to hang her.
- I loved Sara.

977
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:17,784
She killed herself because she wasn't
capable of living in darkness.

978
01:39:17,994 --> 01:39:19,786
Capable?

979
01:39:19,912 --> 01:39:23,915
No one is capable of getting used to it.
You made her go blind.

980
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:25,250
You killed her.

981
01:39:25,418 --> 01:39:29,754
- Is that true, son?
- Mum, mum. You know me.

982
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:32,799
I said don't move.

983
01:39:32,925 --> 01:39:36,219
Make the call. Make it.

984
01:40:02,872 --> 01:40:05,290
I knew you'd come back.

985
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:10,962
I knew you'd realize
that you can only be happy here.

986
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:14,632
I told you that without me,
you'd be nothing.

987
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,135
Less than nothing.

988
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:19,387
Invisible.

989
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:28,688
Since when can you see, Mum?

990
01:40:28,898 --> 01:40:33,985
But you're still my son, and I won't let
anybody take you away from me.

991
01:40:34,153 --> 01:40:37,072
Mum, I asked you a question.

992
01:40:38,365 --> 01:40:42,077
Since when can you see?

993
01:40:42,244 --> 01:40:45,830
Ã

994
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:49,876
What are you doing, son? No, no.

995
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:52,754
No, no.

996
01:40:54,006 --> 01:40:55,298
Calm down, Mum.

997
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:01,513
- It's me.
- Mum, calm down.

998
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:08,686
Look, Mum, this liquid attacks the optic
nerve without causing any pain.

999
01:41:08,854 --> 01:41:13,775
Don't worry.
And these needles are very useful too.

1000
01:41:13,943 --> 01:41:18,029
- Don't do it, please.
- Mum, I have to do it.

1001
01:41:18,531 --> 01:41:21,032
- Oh, my boy!
- Don't worry.

1002
01:41:52,815 --> 01:41:54,232
What are we doing here?

1003
01:41:57,695 --> 01:41:59,946
I won't use it on you.

1004
01:42:04,994 --> 01:42:09,998
Your optic nerve must be very damaged
by now. It won't take long.

1005
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:15,753
- This can't end like this.
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

1006
01:42:15,921 --> 01:42:21,968
Don't worry. When the darkness comes,
I'll be by your side.

1007
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:25,180
I've packed your bags.

1008
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:29,684
We will go far away
and nobody will find us.

1009
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:32,103
We will start from scratch.

1010
01:42:32,271 --> 01:42:33,855
Don't touch me!

1011
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:36,608
Don't touch me, son of a bitch.

1012
01:42:37,943 --> 01:42:40,403
I will never love you. Never.

1013
01:42:40,571 --> 01:42:42,280
I would die first.

1014
01:42:43,407 --> 01:42:45,116
- Don't touch me!
- Is that what you want?

1015
01:42:45,284 --> 01:42:48,203
Don't touch me!

1016
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:51,789
Let go of me!

1017
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:55,293
- Let go of me!
- Come on, do it!

1018
01:42:57,796 --> 01:42:59,631
Stay with me.

1019
01:43:31,163 --> 01:43:33,998
Do it. Do it.

1020
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:37,335
Do it! Do it!

1021
01:43:37,503 --> 01:43:40,505
- Do it.
- I can't! I can't!

1022
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:47,220
Of course you can't.

1023
01:43:47,388 --> 01:43:51,015
Although you don't know it...
you love me.

1024
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:55,311
Because you know that without me,
you are nothing.

1025
01:43:55,479 --> 01:43:57,981
And I am only a shadow without you.

1026
01:45:13,349 --> 01:45:15,892
Julia, why did you lock the door?

1027
01:45:20,064 --> 01:45:21,981
- Hello?
- Inspector. It's Julia.

1028
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:23,232
Julia, it's you.

1029
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:27,111
Listen to me, because this is
the last time I'll call you.

1030
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,948
- Calm down.
- He's locked me in my house.

1031
01:45:31,116 --> 01:45:33,284
- Calm down, Julia.
- He's going to kill me.

1032
01:45:33,452 --> 01:45:37,872
If you don't come, it will be too late.
You have to believe me. Please.

1033
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:40,458
- Julia, please, calm down.
- Are you listening to me?

1034
01:45:42,586 --> 01:45:44,045
Inspector?

1035
01:45:50,969 --> 01:45:52,345
Julia!

1036
01:47:57,429 --> 01:48:00,431
Julia, police!
Cover the stairs and the hallway.

1037
01:48:00,599 --> 01:48:02,433
Julia, are you there?

1038
01:48:02,601 --> 01:48:05,436
It's Dimas. Can you hear me?

1039
01:48:06,104 --> 01:48:08,147
- Julia, what are you doing?
- Shut up!

1040
01:48:08,357 --> 01:48:11,275
- What's going on?
- I said shut up!

1041
01:48:22,287 --> 01:48:24,789
Can you see him?
Can you see him, Inspector?

1042
01:48:24,957 --> 01:48:28,626
Police! Put the knife down!
Put your hands above your head!

1043
01:48:42,391 --> 01:48:44,475
Don't look at me.

1044
01:48:47,145 --> 01:48:50,314
Don't look at me, please.

1045
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:55,903
- Don't look at me!
- Put the knife down!

1046
01:48:58,657 --> 01:49:00,449
Put it down!

1047
01:49:01,159 --> 01:49:04,662
What are you doing?
Put the knife down!

1048
01:49:46,121 --> 01:49:48,372
I will go blind, won't I?

1049
01:49:53,629 --> 01:49:55,713
How long do I have?

1050
01:49:57,674 --> 01:50:00,009
You'll go blind before dawn.

1051
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:11,103
I need you to do me a favor.

1052
01:50:43,428 --> 01:50:45,262
Can we have a moment?

1053
01:50:55,107 --> 01:50:56,649
What happened to his eyes?

1054
01:50:59,194 --> 01:51:01,278
He donated them.

1055
01:51:07,786 --> 01:51:09,328
And where are they?

1056
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,373
Where he would have wanted.

1057
01:51:20,966 --> 01:51:23,509
Isaac, why?

1058
01:51:25,345 --> 01:51:28,639
My God, I miss you so much.

1059
01:51:33,562 --> 01:51:36,147
You promised me.

1060
01:51:36,314 --> 01:51:39,442
You promised me.

1061
01:52:22,611 --> 01:52:26,197
You told me
that when you looked into my eyes...

1062
01:52:27,032 --> 01:52:29,158
...you could see the entire universe.

1063
01:52:30,202 --> 01:52:32,203
I still can.

1064
01:53:28,134 --> 01:53:31,804
JULIA'S EYES
