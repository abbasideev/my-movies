00:01:35,414 --> 00:01:38,002
Welcome to Blackwood
Pharmaceuticals.

2
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,629
Thank you for your interest in
our Phase One clinical trials.

3
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:46,528
Blackwood are committed
to innovation,

4
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:51,188
pioneering research into hundreds
of new medicines each year.

5
00:01:51,326 --> 00:01:55,019
In Phase One, we use
healthy volunteers like you,

6
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:58,057
to help us better understand
how a drug affects the body

7
00:01:58,195 --> 00:02:01,647
before giving it to those
with a medical condition.

8
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:06,203
Without your help, none
of this would be possible.

9
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:11,346
Our facilities
are fully equipped

10
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:13,383
and state of the art.

11
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:15,730
We hope you enjoy your stay.

12
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:32,471
Hey!

13
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:36,337
You must be Claire. I'm Alison.

14
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:39,340
Looks like we're roommates!

15
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,412
Cool. Yeah, nice to meet you.

16
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:50,730
Hey... I'm Alison.

17
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:56,667
Us three are the only
girls, it seems like.

18
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,569
Wow... you sure brought
a lot for five days.

19
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:07,126
I've never done anything
like this before, have you?

20
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:09,093
I'm a little nervous.

21
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:11,095
It's silly I know,
we'll be fine.

22
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,546
This is probably the
worst part, the waiting...

23
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:16,446
Alison, sorry. I've had a pretty
rough night and I'm exhausted.

24
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:18,413
I just wanted to have
a nap before we start.

25
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:20,933
- Yeah, sorry, go ahead. I'll shut up.
- Thanks.

26
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:24,626
Good morning.

27
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:28,147
All participants please
convene in the Exam Room.

28
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:37,018
No Wi-Fi. No reception.
It's bullshit!

29
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:38,985
What do ya expect,
we're in a basement.

30
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:40,780
Nah, they're doing
it on purpose.

31
00:03:40,918 --> 00:03:42,793
So we can't tweet about the trial
while it's happening or whatever.

32
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:44,646
This is why I keep
saying we need a union.

33
00:03:44,784 --> 00:03:46,545
Every trial they try
pulling more shit.

34
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:50,100
Hello everyone. I'm Dr. Burke, and
I'll be supervising this trial.

35
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:52,861
I'm sure you've heard all of this
before, but just to reiterate.

36
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,968
This is a phase one safety
study for Abexetine BRN14.

37
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:57,728
Five days total.

38
00:03:57,866 --> 00:04:00,006
Dosage begins at 25mg,

39
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:03,286
and rises to 85mg by the end.

40
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:05,460
This is a double blind trial.

41
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,360
You'll be closely monitored for
any irregularities or side effects,

42
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,293
but it's a fairly minimal dose,

43
00:04:10,431 --> 00:04:12,329
so we expect it to
be smooth sailing.

44
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:14,504
If you do have any
questions, however,

45
00:04:14,642 --> 00:04:16,851
please speak to any of
the nurses... yes, Ray?

46
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:18,853
Are we going to get
to go outside at all?

47
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:22,235
Afraid not. Participants are confined
to this floor for the duration.

48
00:04:22,374 --> 00:04:24,203
Ah, you're joking, right?

49
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:26,205
I'm sorry, but I don't
make the rules here.

50
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:20,673
What's with all the trees?

51
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:22,503
Dunno.

52
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:27,715
Food's better than
on Belmont at least.

53
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:30,683
Yeah, fried dog shit would be
better than the food on Belmont.

54
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:32,892
Money's good too,
for what it is.

55
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,250
Did you hear about the off-the-books
trial they ran last year?

56
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:37,276
50 grand to stop your heart.

57
00:05:37,414 --> 00:05:39,278
- That's a myth.
- It's not, man!

58
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,453
A friend of mine was on it.

59
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:44,076
- Well, a friend of a friend.
- Yeah, right.

60
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,114
Haven't seen you before.

61
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:49,978
- First time?
- Yeah.

62
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,808
Let me guess.

63
00:05:51,946 --> 00:05:53,820
You heard about it from a friend,
and thought 'easy money', right?

64
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:55,674
Dunno about 'easy'.

65
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:58,849
But I needed the money and don't
have a lot of other options, so...

66
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:00,851
Young, broke and desperate.

67
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:02,888
The drug trial magic combo.

68
00:06:15,763 --> 00:06:18,490
That's Vanessa. We see
her a lot on these things.

69
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,284
A bit of an oddball.

70
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:22,063
One of those home-schooled
kids, you know?

71
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:24,081
Her parents were big
religious nutjobs.

72
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:26,152
Fire and brimstone and all that.

73
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,154
It's the quiet ones
you've got to watch.

74
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:31,986
Now take a deep
breath and hold it.

75
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:38,441
- Sorry...
- Fuck!

76
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:40,304
- Any dizziness?
- No.

77
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:42,410
- Nausea?
- No.

78
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:44,170
- Headache?
- No.

79
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:46,345
- Numbness, tingling?
- No.

80
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:49,313
- Abdominal pain? - No.
- Dry mouth. - No.

81
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,350
I'm tapped out, I
can't pee this much.

82
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:53,179
- Shortness of breath?
- No.

83
00:06:53,317 --> 00:06:55,250
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

84
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:05,537
Claire...

85
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:07,849
Claire...

86
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:10,265
Claire, are you sleeping?

87
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:12,923
- Claire...
- What!

88
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:15,408
Wanna see a photo of my cat?

89
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:18,273
Yeah, that's a cat alright.

90
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,759
- Do you have any tattoos?
- No.

91
00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:22,933
What about that
one on your ankle?

92
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:25,349
Why did you ask if you
know the answer already?

93
00:07:26,143 --> 00:07:28,525
Cos I like it.
What does it mean?

94
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:30,665
It's Chinese for
'please be quiet'.

95
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,426
I should get a tattoo.

96
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:35,705
Although I don't
know what I'd get!

97
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:38,570
I feel like whatever I'd get,

98
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,227
I'll think it's totally
stupid in 5 years' time.

99
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:43,747
Like when I was 15 I wanted to
get a Deathly Hallows tattoo.

100
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:45,749
So embarrassing to
even contemplate...

101
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:47,924
Alison, will you shut...!

102
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,872
Long day, huh?

103
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,459
Yeah.

104
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,153
Still, it's all for
a worthy cause right?

105
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,707
Is it? What's this drug
supposed to do again?

106
00:08:12,845 --> 00:08:14,744
Oh they're looking
at all kinds of uses.

107
00:08:14,882 --> 00:08:17,712
Weight loss, allergies,
treating motion sickness.

108
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,714
Yeah, we're really
doing the Lord's work.

109
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:24,270
You're a med student too?

110
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:26,376
- What?! No.
- Oh.

111
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,793
I thought there'd
be a few others.

112
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:32,106
Seems like I'm the only one.

113
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:34,522
I applied for the summer
internship with Blackwood.

114
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,490
Still waiting to hear, but they
approached me about this trial,

115
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:39,641
saying they were having
trouble making up the numbers.

116
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:41,667
So I thought it would be
a good chance to show them

117
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:44,463
I'm a team player, you know?

118
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:55,439
Now I'm kind of wondering
what I've gotten myself into.

119
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,611
I couldn't sleep.

120
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:41,062
Yeah, we know.

121
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,064
None of us could.

122
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:46,274
I thought this was meant
to be smooth sailing?

123
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,138
Yeah, they always say that.

124
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:50,382
Truth is, on half these
first-in-man trials

125
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,384
they have no idea
what's going to happen.

126
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:54,351
It's not like speed
anyway, it's...

127
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:56,629
It's way more than that.

128
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:59,771
It's... I can't
even describe it.

129
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,232
It's just a bit of insomnia,
it's not the end of the world.

130
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:04,292
You run enough of these tests,

131
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,432
nothing surprises you anymore.

132
00:11:07,986 --> 00:11:10,343
You're probably a bit short-handed
with no night staff, right?

133
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:12,956
If you need any help running
tests, or anything...

134
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:15,545
I mean... that would be
completely unethical,

135
00:11:15,683 --> 00:11:18,168
so you would
never... I know that.

136
00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:20,964
I know that. I was...
uhm... I was joking.

137
00:11:21,793 --> 00:11:23,380
Obviously.

138
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:26,107
We'll just see
how long it lasts.

139
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:55,930
30 hours now since I last slept.

140
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:59,175
It's a weird feeling.

141
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,522
Imagine it lasted though?

142
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,420
Like, forever.

143
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:05,698
Think what we could do
with all that extra time.

144
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:09,047
The days are long
enough as it is.

145
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:11,394
- Checkmate.
- What?

146
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:13,361
- No...
- Yeah.

147
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:16,261
Okay, we need a rematch.

148
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,090
One game you said.
I agreed to one.

149
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:20,334
I know, but I thought it
would take longer than that.

150
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:24,131
Come on, one more. There's
nothing else to do.

151
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:26,271
Okay, fine.

152
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,972
These all yours?

153
00:12:39,318 --> 00:12:40,975
They're really good.

154
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:45,083
- Lots here of Paul, I see.
- No, there's not.

155
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:47,085
I'm doing everybody.

156
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:50,191
You gonna go talk to him?

157
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:53,091
No, I couldn't.

158
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:55,863
I get like super shy talking to
guys, can't think of what to say...

159
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,509
- Hey, Paul!
- Claire, don't...

160
00:12:57,647 --> 00:12:59,718
- Do you want to come pose for a portrait?
- What?

161
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:01,696
- Do you want to post for a portrait?
- What do you mean?

162
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,515
Nothing.

163
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:07,726
It's not funny.

164
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:11,523
So clearly no one
is on a placebo.

165
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:13,387
Whatever this is,

166
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:15,485
it's going straight for
the central nervous system

167
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,529
and it's causing serious
brain inflammation.

168
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,843
Are you sure these
pills are only 25mg?

169
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:23,121
This is a double blind trial.

170
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:25,157
You know I can't give
you that information.

171
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:27,435
Yeah. Okay...

172
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,644
Have you seen the
scans that I sent?

173
00:13:29,782 --> 00:13:31,784
I'm looking at them right now.

174
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:35,754
For Subject 7, how many days
later was the second scan taken?

175
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:37,721
No, you don't understand.

176
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,759
Both of those images were
taken during the same scan.

177
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:43,382
All that growth occurred
during one scan.

178
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:46,730
Hello?

179
00:13:48,456 --> 00:13:50,734
Hi, this is George Bannon,
Senior VP for Research.

180
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,047
Can you repeat that?

181
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,125
Claire, look. There's
mice in there!

182
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:05,680
Look more like rats to me.

183
00:14:05,818 --> 00:14:07,855
No, they're cute little mice.

184
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:09,788
It's so sad seeing
them in those cages.

185
00:14:09,926 --> 00:14:11,479
Why?

186
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,768
What can they do anywhere else
that they can't do in there?

187
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,483
Lots of things.

188
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,830
You don't know what a
mouse is capable of, okay?

189
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:20,730
They could meet other mice,
they could have adventures...

190
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:22,732
They could fall in love!

191
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,010
Or get eaten or stepped on.

192
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:27,185
At least here they've got
a roof over their heads.

193
00:14:29,394 --> 00:14:31,396
Do you have a roof
over your head?

194
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,365
I'm between places.

195
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:37,481
Yeah, but you have someone
you can stay with after this,

196
00:14:37,505 --> 00:14:39,576
like, family or something?

197
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,685
Honestly, if I were a
mouse, I'd rather be

198
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:46,894
safe in a cage where I
get fed and looked after

199
00:14:47,032 --> 00:14:49,207
than outside fending for myself.

200
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:52,417
No... No, that's not true.

201
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:55,385
You'd be in there planning a
little mice jailbreak or something.

202
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:57,077
Oh, look at that guy.

203
00:14:57,215 --> 00:14:59,700
He's dying to get out.

204
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:03,221
Don't free the mice Alison,
you'd be in deep shit.

205
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,533
They're probably worth
more than we are.

206
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:15,647
So the parameters of
the trial have shifted.

207
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:17,407
What we're really
interested in now,

208
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:19,547
is how long you can stay awake.

209
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,515
So don't try to sleep,

210
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:23,803
and if you do start to feel
tired, please inform myself

211
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:25,726
or another member of
staff, immediately.

212
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:27,452
Doctor Burke...

213
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,730
Sorry, Doctor Burke.
I just wanted to...

214
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:32,146
Amir, go back with the others.

215
00:15:48,335 --> 00:15:50,509
Claire, you alright in there?

216
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:52,477
Claire?

217
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:55,135
Yeah, I'm just...
[breathes heavily[

218
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:57,240
I'm not great with
enclosed spaces.

219
00:15:57,378 --> 00:15:59,346
Just relax. It won't take long.

220
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:17,329
Claire, I can't deal with you
right now. Just stay in there.

221
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:24,302
Stop it, gimme a break.
Stay in there, be quiet.

222
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:28,892
You can cry all you want,
I'm not letting you out.

223
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,756
Please...

224
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:32,931
You're almost done.
Please, get me out!

225
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:35,244
Please, let me out!

226
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:37,660
Please, let me out!

227
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,504
It was bad, huh?

228
00:17:00,614 --> 00:17:02,443
I've a trick.

229
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:05,446
I used to see this youth counsellor
for a bit, when I was younger.

230
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:10,589
And one time he told me about how
playing Tetris could help with PTSD,

231
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:14,455
because it stops your brain from
making visual memories or something.

232
00:17:14,593 --> 00:17:18,494
So now whenever I feel
overwhelmed by negative thoughts,

233
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:21,324
I play a game of
Tetris in my head.

234
00:17:21,462 --> 00:17:23,671
Try it, it works. Honestly!
I do the music too.

235
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:30,195
Alison...?

236
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,336
You gotta really picture the
blocks as they come down.

237
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:36,305
Alison, stop...

238
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:41,689
- Alison, that's really annoying.
- Good! That means it's working.

239
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:51,216
Alison, oh my God! You are the most
annoying person I have ever met!

240
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,058
This can't be good for us.

241
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,785
We sleep for a reason, right?

242
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,134
We're meant to sleep.

243
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:16,690
You're upping the dose again?

244
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:18,657
I'm taking half of this.

245
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:21,222
I'm taking half of this and that's
probably still more than I agreed to.

246
00:18:21,246 --> 00:18:23,075
I thought it was
meant to be 85mg, max.

247
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:24,974
Yeah, I'm not taking these.

248
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:28,022
I understand there's some concern at
the new direction this trial is taking,

249
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:30,117
and I appreciate that.

250
00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:32,947
Of course you are welcome
to leave at any point.

251
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:36,434
But I have just been informed that
there is now a bonus payment on offer

252
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:38,574
for any participants who
do stay until the end.

253
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:40,645
30 thousand euro.

254
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,303
Each.

255
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:48,722
- You wha'? - No fuck in...
- 30 grand!

256
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,276
30 grand! - Each!

257
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:02,563
30 G's baby!

258
00:19:04,531 --> 00:19:06,716
Right, okay, this is the closest
thing they've got to champagne.

259
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:11,054
Give us a go of
that Paul, will ya?

260
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:15,058
We're rich, boys.
We're gonna be rich!

261
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:21,720
Come on, join the party.

262
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:26,829
You've clearly never
danced before in your life.

263
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:29,694
What are you talking
about? Look at these moves!

264
00:19:30,557 --> 00:19:33,594
Go on... why aren't you happy?

265
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:37,477
Do you not think it's weird, they're
just giving us all this money?

266
00:19:37,598 --> 00:19:39,807
Only you would be looking
at the downside of 30 grand.

267
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,258
Yeah, because there's
always a catch.

268
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:43,984
Not always.

269
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:45,986
It's not like a universal law.

270
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:48,471
- Well...
- Maybe we just got lucky.

271
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:50,439
Come on...

272
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:53,580
- Come on, come on...
- Fine!

273
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,169
Woah!

274
00:19:57,308 --> 00:19:59,862
Welcome to the party, pal!

275
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:03,773
This is weird. I don't think
I've ever danced with someone

276
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:05,350
who wasn't trying to fuck me.

277
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:08,940
Hey, the night is young...!

278
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:14,635
Are you feeling tired?

279
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,465
No...

280
00:20:16,603 --> 00:20:18,536
No, just uhm...

281
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,127
A bit, yeah. It just
came on all of a sudden.

282
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,095
I better go tell Dr. Burke.

283
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,875
'No, no. We need
to stop the trial!'

284
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,775
Their whole immune
systems have gone haywire.

285
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:54,054
We can't stop now.

286
00:20:54,192 --> 00:20:56,159
Keep upping the dose.

287
00:20:57,368 --> 00:20:59,749
Let's see what happens.

288
00:21:02,856 --> 00:21:05,583
I can finally afford to
move somewhere decent,

289
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:07,895
get out of the kip I'm in now.

290
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:11,865
Imagine having a flat you're not
sharing with four other people.

291
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,247
My own living room just for me,

292
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:17,111
that'd be insane.

293
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:19,804
I can really
disappear for a while.

294
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:23,635
There's parts of India where
30 grand can last you years.

295
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:27,708
No need to work,
just be by myself,

296
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:29,676
living free.

297
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:32,264
I'll be first in my
family to go to college.

298
00:21:33,852 --> 00:21:36,993
I've been saving up for years,
but this will pay for everything.

299
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:39,720
Youse are all thinking
way too small.

300
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,137
You gotta invest.

301
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:45,139
Put it into crypto.

302
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:48,419
Get in at the right moment,
you can make your fortune.

303
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:55,149
What about you?

304
00:21:55,978 --> 00:21:57,807
30 grand, you must
have some plans.

305
00:21:57,945 --> 00:21:59,637
Uhm...

306
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:02,709
Find somewhere to live, I guess.

307
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:06,885
Beyond that, I'd say I'll
blow through it pretty fast.

308
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,371
Easy come, easy go, you know.

309
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:11,442
We could find
somewhere together.

310
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,075
Because I'll need to find somewhere
for Uni, so we could be roommates.

311
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:18,310
No offence Alison, but I can't really see
us hanging out after all this is finished.

312
00:22:18,449 --> 00:22:20,382
Do you not have
any real friends?

313
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,699
Eh... I didn't
mean it like that.

314
00:22:27,837 --> 00:22:30,046
No, it's fine.
Honestly, it's fine.

315
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:33,705
Uhm...

316
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,537
I'm going to go and
stretch my legs.

317
00:22:44,336 --> 00:22:45,890
What?

318
00:22:48,548 --> 00:22:50,619
'You're making a big mistake.

319
00:22:50,757 --> 00:22:52,797
'From here on out, whatever
happens to these people,

320
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:54,864
I won't be held responsible.'

321
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,192
Ah, here.

322
00:23:49,643 --> 00:23:51,680
It's not there,
it's the top one.

323
00:23:51,818 --> 00:23:54,268
The top one? I already
tried the top one.

324
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,176
Alison look, I...

325
00:24:05,314 --> 00:24:07,143
I didn't mean what I said.

326
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:10,492
Wakey, wakey.

327
00:24:12,528 --> 00:24:14,496
Alison...

328
00:24:21,157 --> 00:24:23,366
Alison, wake up! Guys...

329
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,437
- What?
- Guys, help! Alison...

330
00:24:25,576 --> 00:24:27,370
HELP!

331
00:24:29,614 --> 00:24:31,513
Alison...

332
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:35,137
- Christ...
- Alison!

333
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:39,521
Alison!

334
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,116
Fuck!

335
00:25:13,658 --> 00:25:16,730
Security breach. Initiating
lockdown protocol.

336
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,530
30 seconds to lockdown.

337
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:27,361
Claire...

338
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:29,156
Claire, come on! We've gotta go.

339
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:33,264
20 seconds to lockdown.

340
00:25:40,754 --> 00:25:43,067
10 seconds to lockdown.

341
00:25:45,552 --> 00:25:46,760
Five...

342
00:25:46,898 --> 00:25:48,451
Four...

343
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,108
Three...

344
00:25:50,695 --> 00:25:52,110
Two.

345
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,561
Ahhhh...

346
00:25:56,114 --> 00:25:57,564
Get the door.

347
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:17,135
I'm sorry...

348
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,212
Lockdown complete.

349
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:45,854
We... we were trying
to get out, and then...

350
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:48,580
The door.

351
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:50,513
Alison, she's...

352
00:26:52,723 --> 00:26:54,517
No, no, no!

353
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:57,037
Stay awake.
Everyone, stay awake.

354
00:26:57,175 --> 00:27:00,144
Whatever you do, don't go to
sleep. Don't even close your eyes.

355
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:03,388
Listen to me...

356
00:27:03,526 --> 00:27:05,528
If you fall asleep, you'll die.

357
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:08,946
What?

358
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:12,294
I'm telling you... I
saw our scans. They...

359
00:27:12,432 --> 00:27:14,641
- You saw our scans?
- I snuck into Dr. Burke's office.

360
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:17,437
I... I knew something
wasn't right.

361
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:19,967
For the last four days, our brains
have been pushed into overdrive,

362
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:22,487
- and now they're shutting down.
- What do you mean, shutting down?

363
00:27:22,511 --> 00:27:24,558
- How does a brain go into overdrive?
- What do you mean?

364
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:26,446
When you're asleep your
brain is still active,

365
00:27:26,584 --> 00:27:29,667
what you're feeling now, is your brain
trying to shut itself down. The drug is...

366
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,693
- Are you telling us we're gonna die?
- No.

367
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,523
No. Not if we stay awake.

368
00:27:34,661 --> 00:27:36,570
We just need to stay awake
until we can get out of here

369
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:38,527
and get help.

370
00:27:50,228 --> 00:27:52,127
It looks like you're
in a lockdown.

371
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:56,200
At Blackwood, safety is
our number one priority.

372
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:06,693
It's an automated security
protocol at the newer facilities.

373
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:09,592
For containing threats,

374
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:12,941
whether it's infection,
security leaks,

375
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:15,150
bio terrorism, a million things.

376
00:28:16,565 --> 00:28:18,878
For 24 hours the
facility is sealed

377
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:21,397
and all lines of
communication are cut off.

378
00:28:23,054 --> 00:28:25,091
How did it happen?

379
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,921
I don't know...

380
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:30,372
Doctor Burke must have triggered
it by accident somehow.

381
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,546
There has to be some
way to override it.

382
00:28:32,684 --> 00:28:34,583
It can't be overridden,
it can't be disabled,

383
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:36,447
that's the whole point.

384
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:38,985
The head of the company could
be in here, it wouldn't matter.

385
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:42,660
That door won't open
until the clock runs down.

386
00:28:55,638 --> 00:28:58,780
I found some smelling salts. Should
be enough for five per person.

387
00:28:58,918 --> 00:29:00,954
Hey, go easy. Ray!

388
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,854
- Ugh...
- They've got to last us all night.

389
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,235
Only use one if it's
an emergency, okay?

390
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,482
We've all got five, yeah?

391
00:29:18,903 --> 00:29:21,319
What about these, some amphetamines,
give us a proper boost.

392
00:29:21,457 --> 00:29:22,976
No, no... hey.

393
00:29:26,428 --> 00:29:28,499
Whatever you do, do not
take any stimulants.

394
00:29:28,637 --> 00:29:30,466
I wouldn't even drink coffee.

395
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:32,123
It's like...

396
00:29:32,261 --> 00:29:36,438
Okay, imagine your brain is
a computer. And it's on fire.

397
00:29:37,957 --> 00:29:40,338
Okay, no, no...
that's a bad metaphor.

398
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:42,202
Uh...

399
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,480
Okay, okay... I've got it.

400
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:47,518
Imagine your brain is a
car, and it's on fire.

401
00:29:47,656 --> 00:29:50,590
But you can still steer and your
momentum will keep you moving.

402
00:29:50,728 --> 00:29:53,317
That's why so long as we
stay awake, we're alright.

403
00:29:53,455 --> 00:29:57,183
But taking uppers, anything like that,
you're just throwing petrol on the flames.

404
00:29:57,321 --> 00:29:59,254
So that's the bad news.

405
00:29:59,392 --> 00:30:02,119
But the good news is,
it's completely treatable.

406
00:30:02,257 --> 00:30:04,155
Once we're out of here,
all they need to do,

407
00:30:04,293 --> 00:30:06,399
is put us on immunosuppressants,
keep us monitored

408
00:30:06,537 --> 00:30:08,988
and maybe, worst case scenario,
a medically induced coma.

409
00:30:09,126 --> 00:30:10,437
What?

410
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,992
It sounds worse than it is.

411
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,442
Come on! We're
gonna be alright.

412
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,375
All we need to do is
last one more day.

413
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:19,791
Once those doors
open, we're saved.

414
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,142
We've now been awake
for over 100 hours.

415
00:30:26,764 --> 00:30:29,284
As you can see, not
looking so sexy,

416
00:30:29,422 --> 00:30:31,148
but... enduring.

417
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,670
You're gonna wear yourself out.

418
00:30:36,808 --> 00:30:39,087
Exercise is good, man.
Keeps the blood flowing.

419
00:30:41,054 --> 00:30:43,056
Still 20 hours to go.

420
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,370
Six survivors.

421
00:30:46,508 --> 00:30:49,269
Battered but not
broken. The mood is...

422
00:30:49,407 --> 00:30:51,375
Hey Attenborough, stop
narrating everything.

423
00:30:51,513 --> 00:30:53,308
You're doing my head in.

424
00:30:53,446 --> 00:30:55,493
Someone needs to make a record
of what's happening here.

425
00:30:55,517 --> 00:30:57,829
When this is all over people
need to be held accountable.

426
00:30:59,728 --> 00:31:01,695
Actually yeah, you're right.

427
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,525
Malpractice.

428
00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:05,527
Gross negligence.

429
00:31:05,665 --> 00:31:07,460
These are just words.

430
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:09,600
We're human beings,

431
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:11,602
and no six-figure
settlement could ever undo

432
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,776
the wrong that has
been done to us here.

433
00:31:15,088 --> 00:31:18,678
Can you put a price
on our suffering?

434
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:21,750
5 million? 10 million?

435
00:31:22,785 --> 00:31:25,857
Will 15 million
make me whole again?

436
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,068
Nice.

437
00:31:29,206 --> 00:31:30,552
Subtle.

438
00:31:39,526 --> 00:31:41,494
I'm just tracking our progress.

439
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:43,599
Keeping an eye on things.

440
00:31:44,324 --> 00:31:47,983
It'd be way too risky to try any
treatment with what we have in here.

441
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,987
There's still so much I don't know
about the drug and how it works.

442
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:54,610
So, for the moment,

443
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:57,268
our best bet is to hang tight.

444
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,858
And wait for help.

445
00:32:13,422 --> 00:32:15,942
I've still got her blood
under my fingernails.

446
00:32:16,908 --> 00:32:19,221
Can't seem to get it out.

447
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:25,158
I know it's hard, but we
need to stay positive.

448
00:32:25,296 --> 00:32:27,919
We're still here, and
we're going to be okay.

449
00:32:28,058 --> 00:32:30,094
- Are we?
- Of course we are.

450
00:32:30,232 --> 00:32:32,372
This is the worst part. Now
that we're off the drug,

451
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,719
the inflammation will be
starting to subside and...

452
00:32:42,865 --> 00:32:44,867
Okay, that's all I
need for the moment.

453
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:47,974
Thanks for your help.

454
00:33:41,027 --> 00:33:42,994
My name is Claire Brady.

455
00:33:43,892 --> 00:33:47,068
And if you're watching
this, it's because I'm dead.

456
00:33:48,552 --> 00:33:52,073
This is a message for
my Mum, Helen Brady.

457
00:33:52,211 --> 00:33:54,903
She's a patient in
St. James Hospital.

458
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,561
Palliative care ward.

459
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,842
So this is a twist, eh?

460
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:06,915
Turns out I had even
less time left than you.

461
00:34:08,744 --> 00:34:10,988
Took you 20 years
to ruin your liver.

462
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:13,715
I only needed four
days to fry my brain.

463
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:22,310
I guess it was cold of me
not to return your calls.

464
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:25,313
Cold and hard, that's me.

465
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:28,695
Where'd I learn that I wonder?

466
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:34,253
I know you just wanted to
tell me you're sorry, but

467
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:36,669
sorry won't fix this.

468
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:39,568
It's already too late.

469
00:35:10,565 --> 00:35:12,118
Ta-daa...

470
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,947
You're free.

471
00:35:14,603 --> 00:35:17,537
What will you do now?
So many possibilities.

472
00:35:24,993 --> 00:35:27,202
Yep, that's what I figured.

473
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:59,545
- How many salts you got?
- None of your business.

474
00:35:59,683 --> 00:36:01,478
C'mon man, don't
hold out on me now.

475
00:36:01,616 --> 00:36:04,239
- Jesus, get over it, Ray.
- Just give us one, will ya?

476
00:36:04,377 --> 00:36:05,792
Vanessa...

477
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,932
- Can you spare a salt?
- No.

478
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,900
What is it the
Bible always says?

479
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:11,729
Blessed art thou who shares.

480
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:14,215
Ah! That's not very God-like.

481
00:36:14,353 --> 00:36:16,872
Marcus! You have
salts, I know you do.

482
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,012
- Hey, just give me one, will you?
- No, I'm sorry.

483
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,670
Just give me a salt, I'm
just asking for one salt.

484
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:24,028
Leave him alone, Ray! We all
got the same amount of salts.

485
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:26,227
It's not our fault
you're a goddamn hoover.

486
00:36:26,365 --> 00:36:28,194
You were one of those
kids, weren't you?

487
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:30,127
Who always saved his
Easter eggs every year,

488
00:36:30,265 --> 00:36:32,267
so you'd have one left in May

489
00:36:32,405 --> 00:36:34,245
and could lord them over everyone
else. Act like Mister Bigshot...

490
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:37,168
- Hey! I don't believe in God.
- What?

491
00:36:37,307 --> 00:36:39,516
I said... I don't
believe in God.

492
00:36:39,654 --> 00:36:41,414
I told you this before.

493
00:36:41,552 --> 00:36:43,313
I left home to get
away from all that.

494
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,453
Look, do you have any
idea what it's like,

495
00:36:45,591 --> 00:36:48,110
growing up being told
everything you'd done was a sin.

496
00:36:49,146 --> 00:36:50,837
I hated him!

497
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,668
Jesus! Sorry... yeah.

498
00:37:00,295 --> 00:37:02,124
You're all cracking up.

499
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,232
Okay...

500
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,199
You can handle this, Amir.

501
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:10,788
It's a test. You've never
failed a test in your life.

502
00:37:10,926 --> 00:37:13,550
You just need to keep working.

503
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:15,414
Stay focused.

504
00:37:15,552 --> 00:37:17,554
Keep working. Stay focused.

505
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:31,499
Mild hallucinations.

506
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:34,640
To be expected
after so long awake.

507
00:37:35,779 --> 00:37:38,022
Just keep working. Stay focused.

508
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:41,923
Keep working, stay focused.

509
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:43,890
Keep working, stay focused...

510
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,380
Claire...

511
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:27,244
You okay?

512
00:38:31,593 --> 00:38:33,423
Come on.

513
00:38:34,976 --> 00:38:36,633
How are you dealing
with this so well?

514
00:38:36,771 --> 00:38:38,531
I dunno.

515
00:38:39,429 --> 00:38:41,500
I mean, it's tough. But...

516
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,019
I'm not scared, I guess.

517
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,436
I know I'm gonna be alright.

518
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,748
I wish I had your confidence.

519
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:53,615
See this? I was on a
hike in the Sierras.

520
00:38:53,753 --> 00:38:55,721
Fell. Shattered my ankle.

521
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:59,794
The pain was excruciating.

522
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:01,692
Thought for sure I
wouldn't be able to walk.

523
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,626
I was alone,

524
00:39:04,764 --> 00:39:07,318
a cold night was coming and I
didn't want to freeze to death.

525
00:39:07,457 --> 00:39:10,529
So... I walked.

526
00:39:12,323 --> 00:39:14,464
You'd be amazed what you
can do when you have to.

527
00:39:21,678 --> 00:39:23,404
Okay...

528
00:39:27,062 --> 00:39:28,961
Great plan. Barely
passed biology in school.

529
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,239
I'm sure I'll have this
cracked in no time.

530
00:39:34,898 --> 00:39:36,071
Oh...

531
00:40:31,402 --> 00:40:33,762
I'm trying to work up the courage
to put my hand down on it.

532
00:40:49,938 --> 00:40:51,802
I haven't had an easy life.

533
00:40:53,252 --> 00:40:55,047
Me neither.

534
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:58,395
But I'm still not ready
for it to be over.

535
00:41:00,121 --> 00:41:01,881
Me neither.

536
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,743
Okay, look. Nothing's changed.

537
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,746
There's only 15
more hours to go.

538
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,783
But we've made it this far.

539
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:16,041
Oh!

540
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:21,356
Ah!

541
00:44:58,221 --> 00:45:00,119
Hey!

542
00:45:00,257 --> 00:45:02,432
This is it, you realise that?

543
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,849
We've lost two already. Any
one of us could be next.

544
00:45:05,987 --> 00:45:08,610
Do you think Blackwood expect
us to walk out of here?

545
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:11,924
They have already written
us off, and they're right.

546
00:45:12,062 --> 00:45:14,202
Because if we carry on
like this, we're dead.

547
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,826
So we've got two options.

548
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,138
We can sit around
waiting to be rescued

549
00:45:19,276 --> 00:45:22,486
by the same fuckers who did
this to us in the first place.

550
00:45:22,624 --> 00:45:25,558
Or, we work together
and we find a way out.

551
00:45:27,008 --> 00:45:29,839
I don't know about you,
but I'm tired of waiting.

552
00:45:31,185 --> 00:45:33,601
Right. So this is the facility.

553
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:35,741
Did an 8 year old draw this?

554
00:45:35,879 --> 00:45:37,881
This is where they've
sealed us off.

555
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:39,814
This is the exit
and this is us here.

556
00:45:39,952 --> 00:45:43,128
All we need to do, is
break through that wall

557
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:44,854
and we're out.

558
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,166
- It won't work.
- How do you know?

559
00:45:47,304 --> 00:45:49,997
I just know. Trust me,
they build these places

560
00:45:50,135 --> 00:45:52,175
so when they lock them down,
there's no getting out.

561
00:45:52,275 --> 00:45:54,725
Great. So that's one
vote for don't try.

562
00:45:54,864 --> 00:45:56,935
What do the rest of you think?

563
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,102
I thought you looked cold.

564
00:47:04,692 --> 00:47:06,211
What?

565
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:07,902
Hey...

566
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:10,663
- I think this is it. I'm almost through.
- What?

567
00:47:11,388 --> 00:47:13,425
Yeah, yeah... pull it.

568
00:47:13,563 --> 00:47:14,978
Yeah... yeah.

569
00:47:15,116 --> 00:47:16,877
Now...

570
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,678
No, no, no, no!

571
00:47:25,816 --> 00:47:27,266
What?

572
00:47:27,404 --> 00:47:29,337
No, no...

573
00:47:29,475 --> 00:47:31,719
No... FUCK!

574
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,449
No!

575
00:47:38,968 --> 00:47:40,728
It's a bomb shelter job.

576
00:47:40,866 --> 00:47:42,879
It's the same as the door.
There's no getting through that.

577
00:47:42,903 --> 00:47:45,595
Okay look, that's not good.

578
00:47:47,355 --> 00:47:49,116
But look, it's one wall.

579
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:52,675
We can try another one. We can tear
the whole place down if we have to.

580
00:47:52,809 --> 00:47:54,569
Why would the next
wall be any different?

581
00:47:54,707 --> 00:47:56,571
We're just wasting energy.

582
00:47:56,709 --> 00:47:58,504
Alright, let's think.

583
00:47:58,642 --> 00:47:59,792
- We've gotta take those uppers.
- No!

584
00:47:59,816 --> 00:48:01,414
It's the only way
we'll get through this.

585
00:48:01,438 --> 00:48:02,829
- No, Amir said they'll only make us worse.
- Fuck Amir, man!

586
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:04,545
Why are we even
listening to him?

587
00:48:04,683 --> 00:48:06,823
Because he's the closest
thing we've got to a doctor.

588
00:48:06,961 --> 00:48:09,526
Well, I don't see him out here. I
don't see him coming up with new ideas.

589
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,897
Do you see him coming
up with new ideas?

590
00:48:12,035 --> 00:48:13,830
Alright, I'll go talk to him.

591
00:48:22,183 --> 00:48:24,082
How did he know?

592
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,775
How did... how did
you know, Amir?

593
00:48:28,465 --> 00:48:30,122
How did he know?

594
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,642
How did he know we'd never
get through that wall?

595
00:48:33,505 --> 00:48:35,369
I mean, he was right. So?

596
00:48:35,507 --> 00:48:37,474
Yeah, but how did he know?

597
00:48:39,545 --> 00:48:42,238
I've been on way more
trials than anyone,

598
00:48:42,376 --> 00:48:44,550
and I've never seen
any shit like this.

599
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,208
But somehow Amir knows everything
before it's about to happen.

600
00:48:47,726 --> 00:48:50,004
He knows Blackwood, I guess.

601
00:48:50,142 --> 00:48:52,213
Knows how they work.

602
00:48:52,938 --> 00:48:55,298
He's only here because he was
trying to get a job with them.

603
00:48:55,734 --> 00:48:57,770
Maybe he already has one.

604
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:02,396
Think about it. What are the
chances, this one guy on the trial

605
00:49:02,534 --> 00:49:05,813
who knows everything about the drug,
everything about the facility...

606
00:49:05,951 --> 00:49:08,781
One person who can run tests,

607
00:49:08,919 --> 00:49:11,370
take samples, keep
everyone in line.

608
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,580
He's not your typical lab rat.

609
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,342
No, it never made sense he was
on this in the first place.

610
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,689
This snotty med student
in with all the lab rats.

611
00:49:19,827 --> 00:49:21,829
Us fucking rejects, man.

612
00:49:24,418 --> 00:49:26,351
Okay...

613
00:49:28,111 --> 00:49:30,389
But how would Amir not
have fallen asleep already?

614
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,635
No one who is not on the drug
could have stayed awake this long.

615
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:39,640
Let's find out.

616
00:49:40,813 --> 00:49:42,608
Amir...

617
00:49:44,921 --> 00:49:46,957
We really need you in here.

618
00:49:49,512 --> 00:49:51,203
You were right about the wall,

619
00:49:51,341 --> 00:49:53,516
we're now just trying to
figure out what to do next.

620
00:49:55,311 --> 00:49:57,830
Look, whatever work
you're doing can wait.

621
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:00,074
Amir!

622
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,630
I'm sorry.

623
00:50:05,597 --> 00:50:07,219
I haven't been honest with you.

624
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:14,675
This is for you.

625
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,714
And the others.

626
00:50:19,852 --> 00:50:21,820
It explains everything.

627
00:50:29,897 --> 00:50:31,864
It's all my fault.

628
00:50:32,002 --> 00:50:33,832
I caused the lockdown.

629
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:37,525
I broke their security and tried
to make copies of our MRI scans.

630
00:50:42,151 --> 00:50:43,911
I was so stupid!

631
00:50:44,912 --> 00:50:47,087
I should have known
what would happen.

632
00:50:48,778 --> 00:50:50,504
Amir, no!

633
00:50:50,642 --> 00:50:52,402
Amir, get up!

634
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,302
Did you not hear me? It's
my fault we're trapped here.

635
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,752
So? All the more reason
to help us find a way out.

636
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:00,041
- I told you, there's no way out.
- There's no way out...

637
00:51:00,065 --> 00:51:01,929
So everyone keeps saying!

638
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:04,345
Well then, can you
fix us yourself?

639
00:51:04,483 --> 00:51:06,658
- No.
- Why not? You're smart.

640
00:51:06,796 --> 00:51:09,396
You're nearly a doctor. You've got
a whole lab full of stuff here.

641
00:51:10,627 --> 00:51:12,733
Our brain is a car, right?

642
00:51:12,871 --> 00:51:15,943
So if we're over-heating, can we

643
00:51:16,081 --> 00:51:18,635
open the hood? No,
that sounds painful.

644
00:51:18,773 --> 00:51:21,742
Can we... jump-start it,

645
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,951
or get out and push?

646
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:33,581
Wait, for real? I
just gave you an idea?

647
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:35,514
We could use our momentum.

648
00:51:35,652 --> 00:51:38,612
Methyl iodide poisoning basically mimics
the effects of an ischemic stroke.

649
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:41,186
A strong enough dose would stop blood
flow to our brain almost completely,

650
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,935
which would normally
cause brain death,

651
00:51:43,073 --> 00:51:45,283
but with these side effects

652
00:51:46,249 --> 00:51:48,493
there may be a grace period.

653
00:51:48,631 --> 00:51:50,426
We take a shot of tPA
right after the dose

654
00:51:50,564 --> 00:51:52,335
and there'd be just
enough time for the enzyme

655
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,638
to catalyse the clot to breakdown
before the effects are irreversible.

656
00:51:58,227 --> 00:52:00,653
- But is that a plan or just gibberish?
- I don't know, you tell me!

657
00:52:00,677 --> 00:52:02,997
I'm so tired, it's hard to tell
if this makes sense or not.

658
00:52:03,128 --> 00:52:05,924
Yes, yes! It sounds like a
winner. Let's catalyse the enzyme.

659
00:52:06,062 --> 00:52:08,098
I'm on board. Let's
catalyse that shit.

660
00:52:08,237 --> 00:52:10,342
- I'll go tell the others.
- Okay.

661
00:52:25,564 --> 00:52:27,601
- Claire...
- There you are.

662
00:52:27,739 --> 00:52:29,948
Listen, I was talking to
Amir and... What's wrong?

663
00:52:30,811 --> 00:52:33,986
- I don't think we can trust Amir.
- What... why?

664
00:52:38,543 --> 00:52:40,441
No, I don't... I don't buy it.

665
00:52:40,579 --> 00:52:42,695
That sounds like one of Ray's
guinea pig campfire tales.

666
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:44,756
I know, I thought so too.

667
00:52:44,894 --> 00:52:46,654
I wasn't sure.

668
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:49,278
So I went through Amir's
things and found these.

669
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,590
It's the uppers he
told us not to take.

670
00:52:57,803 --> 00:52:59,495
Did I just die?

671
00:53:00,668 --> 00:53:02,325
Paul!

672
00:53:02,463 --> 00:53:04,948
You're not dead!
The power went out.

673
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:08,065
Something must have tripped. I
think I saw the fuses before,

674
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:09,988
down by the MRI room.

675
00:53:12,128 --> 00:53:13,819
It's okay.

676
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,890
Come on.

677
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,554
Ah, shit! I'm almost
out of battery.

678
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:28,834
Oh... yes! Yes...
I'm not finding it.

679
00:53:29,904 --> 00:53:31,630
Fuck, my phone's dead.

680
00:53:33,667 --> 00:53:36,290
Shit, I think I'm hallucinating.

681
00:53:36,428 --> 00:53:38,879
Okay, keep calm.
Focus on my voice.

682
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:41,675
Close your eyes.

683
00:53:41,813 --> 00:53:43,918
- What did you say?
- I said, focus on my voice.

684
00:53:44,056 --> 00:53:46,093
Close your eyes.

685
00:53:46,231 --> 00:53:48,785
It's okay. Mummy's here.

686
00:53:48,923 --> 00:53:51,409
Just lie down.
Close your eyes...

687
00:53:51,547 --> 00:53:53,652
I'm not finding any fuses.

688
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,482
Paul! Oops! You lost him.

689
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,967
Why won't you go
to sleep! Paul!

690
00:53:58,105 --> 00:54:00,590
I'm so excited!

691
00:54:00,728 --> 00:54:03,386
He's dead. They're all
dead. You're all alone.

692
00:54:03,524 --> 00:54:05,595
Go to sleep! Give up!

693
00:54:05,733 --> 00:54:08,426
Bitch. Cunt. Die.

694
00:54:08,564 --> 00:54:10,359
Claire...

695
00:54:40,147 --> 00:54:41,735
Paul!

696
00:54:57,578 --> 00:54:59,200
That was close.

697
00:55:01,927 --> 00:55:04,551
Amir... where were ya?

698
00:55:05,103 --> 00:55:06,967
I was looking for the fuses.

699
00:55:12,628 --> 00:55:14,492
Vanessa... Thank
God you're alright.

700
00:55:19,531 --> 00:55:21,499
Guys, what...

701
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:25,330
- What's going on?
- Have you been taking the uppers?

702
00:55:26,331 --> 00:55:28,816
- What?
- We found the empty pill bottles.

703
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:32,199
That was... no, I
didn't take them!

704
00:55:32,337 --> 00:55:34,960
I poured them out.
As a precaution!

705
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:36,721
Why are you backing away?

706
00:55:36,859 --> 00:55:38,895
We're only asking questions.

707
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:45,177
No, please! Get
your hands off me!

708
00:55:45,315 --> 00:55:47,628
Ray... stop!

709
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,907
Paul, grab his other arm!

710
00:55:51,045 --> 00:55:52,978
Paul... don't!

711
00:55:53,772 --> 00:55:55,567
Ahhh!

712
00:55:56,326 --> 00:55:58,206
- Have you all lost your minds?
- Shut up!

713
00:55:58,294 --> 00:56:00,261
Shut up.

714
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,436
You cut the power. I told
you this would happen.

715
00:56:02,574 --> 00:56:04,725
I told you. He knew we were onto
him, so he tried to finish us off.

716
00:56:04,749 --> 00:56:07,037
I didn't touch the fuses. I
didn't even know where they were.

717
00:56:07,061 --> 00:56:09,592
- Yeah, who did it then?
- I don't know! They just blew. It happens.

718
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,825
You're working for
Blackwood. Admit it.

719
00:56:11,963 --> 00:56:14,137
I don't know what
you're talking about.

720
00:56:14,759 --> 00:56:16,450
Guys... guys, listen to me.

721
00:56:16,588 --> 00:56:19,557
You're tired. You're scared.
You're not thinking clearly.

722
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:22,318
Please just untie me,

723
00:56:22,456 --> 00:56:24,251
and I'll explain everything.

724
00:56:24,803 --> 00:56:27,392
You're acting crazy! You
don't know what you're doing.

725
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:32,121
Please, Claire...

726
00:56:32,259 --> 00:56:33,950
He's up to something.

727
00:56:34,088 --> 00:56:36,653
I know he knows something and we're
going to fucking figure it out, okay?

728
00:56:36,677 --> 00:56:38,921
Figure it out.

729
00:56:43,097 --> 00:56:45,272
- Do you think it's just him?
- Could be.

730
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,654
Could be others. They could
be watching us right now.

731
00:56:47,792 --> 00:56:49,794
There could be secret
rooms all over this place.

732
00:56:49,932 --> 00:56:53,142
Secret rooms! Will you
listen to yourselves?

733
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,637
We've gotta get the
truth out of him.

734
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,490
And how are you
going to do that?

735
00:56:56,628 --> 00:56:58,527
Take a guess.

736
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,609
This is life and death. Do you want to
play it nice and end up like Marcus?

737
00:57:01,633 --> 00:57:03,393
Ray's right.

738
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:07,259
If Amir's hiding something we
need to find out what it is.

739
00:57:07,397 --> 00:57:09,399
And I think he's
hiding something.

740
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:12,437
Listen to what you're saying.

741
00:57:12,575 --> 00:57:15,129
What you're talking about
doing to a human being.

742
00:57:16,234 --> 00:57:18,374
I'm already going to hell.

743
00:57:18,961 --> 00:57:22,136
We can't do this.
We can't... Paul!

744
00:57:23,448 --> 00:57:26,002
Paul, say something!
We can't do this.

745
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,797
No... no, she's right.

746
00:57:27,935 --> 00:57:29,834
We can't.

747
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:37,980
Fuck it, I'm doing it.

748
00:57:38,118 --> 00:57:39,671
Ray... no!

749
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:41,811
No!

750
00:57:41,949 --> 00:57:43,996
Here's what's gonna happen,
right? I'm gonna take this knife,

751
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:45,998
and every time you lie to me, you're
gonna get a little bit smaller.

752
00:57:46,022 --> 00:57:48,000
- Please... please stop. Please don't.
- Ray... no, no!

753
00:57:48,024 --> 00:57:50,209
- Are you working for Blackwood?
- Ray, you can't do this. He's...

754
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:51,925
Are you working for Blackwood.

755
00:57:52,063 --> 00:57:53,754
He's got a cure!

756
00:57:59,553 --> 00:58:01,279
I'm working on something.

757
00:58:01,417 --> 00:58:04,040
It's not a cure. It's
more of a stop-gap.

758
00:58:06,456 --> 00:58:08,389
I think I can help us.

759
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:10,495
Buy us some time, at least.

760
00:58:11,703 --> 00:58:13,602
Bullshit! No...

761
00:58:14,085 --> 00:58:16,408
Nah, it's just another lie. He'll
say anything to get out of this.

762
00:58:16,432 --> 00:58:18,952
- No, you don't know that.
- Amir...

763
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:20,781
What's the idea?

764
00:58:20,919 --> 00:58:22,990
It's a methyl iodide solution.

765
00:58:23,715 --> 00:58:25,648
It's simple to make, I
can talk you through it.

766
00:58:25,786 --> 00:58:29,169
No. I'm not taking anything he cooks
up. It'll probably kill us on the spot.

767
00:58:29,307 --> 00:58:31,136
I'll try it.

768
00:58:31,827 --> 00:58:33,760
We'll make it, I'll test it.

769
00:58:34,933 --> 00:58:37,039
What have we got to lose?

770
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:10,866
Okay, so it's at 75
degrees now, what's next?

771
00:59:13,282 --> 00:59:14,766
Amir?

772
00:59:15,698 --> 00:59:17,286
Amir...

773
00:59:20,738 --> 00:59:22,394
Start adding the iodine.

774
00:59:22,532 --> 00:59:24,707
Slowly. Don't let it overheat.

775
00:59:27,883 --> 00:59:29,919
We've only got one shot at this.

776
00:59:30,748 --> 00:59:32,612
That was a very
stupid thing you did.

777
00:59:34,475 --> 00:59:36,581
- You tripped the fuse.
- I didn't trip the fuse.

778
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:38,928
I saw you do it.

779
00:59:39,895 --> 00:59:41,517
I needed Amir to fall asleep.

780
00:59:41,655 --> 00:59:44,624
None of you believed me, I had
to prove he wasn't on the drug.

781
00:59:46,177 --> 00:59:48,179
Are you going to
tell the others?

782
00:59:51,492 --> 00:59:53,943
It's a sedative. Fast acting.

783
00:59:54,081 --> 00:59:55,911
I'm waiting for Claire
to be distracted.

784
00:59:56,049 --> 00:59:58,741
If you cover me, then
I can get to Amir.

785
00:59:59,569 --> 01:00:01,641
Then we'll find out
if he's lying or not.

786
01:00:01,779 --> 01:00:03,712
Damn, that's a lot
better than my plan.

787
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,610
I'm too fucking tired.

788
01:00:07,232 --> 01:00:10,201
Okay... you're almost there.

789
01:00:10,339 --> 01:00:12,652
Now add the last of the sulphate
and keep it at 70 degrees

790
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,584
until it's all distilled.

791
01:00:20,452 --> 01:00:22,351
- Does that not hurt?
- No.

792
01:00:23,283 --> 01:00:25,043
I mean, yeah. But...

793
01:00:25,181 --> 01:00:27,321
It's good. It keeps me sharp.

794
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,567
So walk me through again
what's about to happen.

795
01:00:33,431 --> 01:00:35,882
You take the formula,
it makes you stroke out.

796
01:00:36,468 --> 01:00:38,781
Shot of tPA treats the
stroke, brings you back.

797
01:00:39,644 --> 01:00:42,751
You should know though, if it doesn't
work, it'll kill you instantly.

798
01:00:43,475 --> 01:00:45,408
Yeah, I figured.

799
01:00:46,513 --> 01:00:48,446
You know, I've been thinking.

800
01:00:48,584 --> 01:00:51,621
Considering what we've been
through, if we had to do this again.

801
01:00:52,622 --> 01:00:54,970
I probably wouldn't
sign up for this trial.

802
01:01:00,872 --> 01:01:04,186
You know Blackwood get hundreds of
applicants for their internship.

803
01:01:04,842 --> 01:01:06,775
So when they asked me
to come on this trial,

804
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,363
I thought they saw
someone focused,

805
01:01:09,501 --> 01:01:11,124
determined,

806
01:01:11,262 --> 01:01:13,298
willing to put everything
into their career.

807
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:17,613
But maybe what they saw
was someone with no family,

808
01:01:17,751 --> 01:01:20,340
no friends, no
connections to anyone.

809
01:01:20,478 --> 01:01:22,342
Someone nobody would miss.

810
01:01:24,551 --> 01:01:26,864
I feel like I've lived
my whole life wrong.

811
01:01:27,554 --> 01:01:30,315
We get out of here, we
get a second chance.

812
01:01:31,282 --> 01:01:33,422
I don't know what I'd
do with a second chance.

813
01:01:34,561 --> 01:01:36,528
I don't even know
what I want anymore.

814
01:01:37,495 --> 01:01:39,428
I just want to
see the sun again.

815
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:44,191
We've been in this basement so long,
it's become like a distant memory.

816
01:01:45,675 --> 01:01:47,608
That's not much of a goal.

817
01:01:48,264 --> 01:01:49,887
It's a start.

818
01:01:52,303 --> 01:01:53,683
Okay..

819
01:01:53,822 --> 01:01:55,824
I think...

820
01:01:56,928 --> 01:01:58,861
I think it's ready.

821
01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:10,908
After the shot, wait 30 seconds
before you give her the TPA.

822
01:02:43,354 --> 01:02:44,907
Vanessa!

823
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,747
- Vanessa!
- Vanessa...

824
01:02:46,771 --> 01:02:48,531
Get her up. Vanessa!

825
01:02:52,363 --> 01:02:54,227
Vanessa... Vanessa!

826
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:57,817
Vanessa...

827
01:03:15,662 --> 01:03:17,595
Get the shot!

828
01:03:58,394 --> 01:04:00,086
Amir, stop.

829
01:04:01,708 --> 01:04:03,330
Amir, stop!

830
01:04:07,645 --> 01:04:09,129
Go on...

831
01:04:10,475 --> 01:04:11,994
Do it...

832
01:04:15,032 --> 01:04:16,965
What do you want to know?

833
01:04:18,345 --> 01:04:20,175
I'm the one with
all the info, right?

834
01:04:20,313 --> 01:04:23,419
Want me to tell you that
we're all gonna die here?

835
01:04:23,557 --> 01:04:27,561
That our lives are just data
points on a spreadsheet?

836
01:04:27,699 --> 01:04:29,563
That's it!

837
01:04:30,564 --> 01:04:32,704
That's the big secret.

838
01:04:36,087 --> 01:04:38,607
Claire... you alright?

839
01:04:41,748 --> 01:04:43,474
- Claire...
- I'm fine.

840
01:04:45,614 --> 01:04:49,307
I'm just gonna go and see
how much time we've got left.

841
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:13,460
My name is Claire Brady.

842
01:06:14,875 --> 01:06:16,981
This is a message for my Mum.

843
01:06:18,362 --> 01:06:21,503
What was that song you used
to sing to me as a kid?

844
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:27,612
I always wondered
if you made it up.

845
01:06:28,889 --> 01:06:31,927
Anyway, it's been stuck
in my head all night.

846
01:06:34,205 --> 01:06:36,552
It's funny the things
that come back to you.

847
01:06:37,657 --> 01:06:40,108
You were a real demon
when you'd been drinking.

848
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:46,114
But the rest of the
time, you were my Mum.

849
01:06:49,738 --> 01:06:51,843
And I get it now.

850
01:06:53,569 --> 01:06:56,193
How hard it must have been, why

851
01:06:56,331 --> 01:06:58,540
you couldn't stop.

852
01:07:01,819 --> 01:07:03,407
Because

853
01:07:04,373 --> 01:07:08,205
even though every part of
me is fighting against it,

854
01:07:08,343 --> 01:07:10,345
I just...

855
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:13,313
I just really want
to go to sleep.

856
01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:03,941
Goddamn secret rooms...

857
01:09:05,184 --> 01:09:06,909
Guys, you've gotta
come and see this.

858
01:09:07,047 --> 01:09:08,842
We're on to something.

859
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:10,534
Claire...

860
01:09:13,295 --> 01:09:15,366
Just hold on,
okay? I'll be back.

861
01:09:15,987 --> 01:09:18,783
Listen to me. You are not
just a stat in a spreadsheet.

862
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,614
They think we're nobodies, wait
till we're on every news channel

863
01:09:21,752 --> 01:09:23,512
telling our story.

864
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:25,411
We'll bring the whole
fucking company down.

865
01:09:50,884 --> 01:09:52,576
It's an autopsy room.

866
01:10:16,807 --> 01:10:18,257
Paul!

867
01:10:40,244 --> 01:10:42,246
I'm not listening to you.

868
01:10:43,074 --> 01:10:44,835
You're only in my head.

869
01:10:45,456 --> 01:10:47,734
But you're the smartest
one here, Amir.

870
01:10:48,804 --> 01:10:51,531
Who else should you listen
to, if not your own head?

871
01:10:53,775 --> 01:10:55,259
Claire?

872
01:10:55,397 --> 01:10:58,814
You're relying on that
girl to come and save you?

873
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,886
She's left you here, hasn't she?

874
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:03,888
Tied up,

875
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:05,752
all by yourself.

876
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:07,754
Even if they did find a way out,

877
01:11:07,892 --> 01:11:09,653
do you think they'd
let you come with them?

878
01:11:09,791 --> 01:11:13,208
The only way you're walking
out of here is alone.

879
01:11:17,143 --> 01:11:19,835
Hey! Time is not
on your side here.

880
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,493
You need to take control
of the situation.

881
01:11:24,495 --> 01:11:26,532
So that's it then, is it?

882
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:29,017
You're just giving up.

883
01:11:29,155 --> 01:11:31,847
Frankly, I am disappointed.

884
01:11:31,985 --> 01:11:34,402
You had so much promise.

885
01:11:35,092 --> 01:11:38,854
This was a test
Amir, and you failed.

886
01:11:38,992 --> 01:11:40,994
You can't control the group.

887
01:11:41,132 --> 01:11:43,480
You can't handle the
sleep deprivation.

888
01:11:43,618 --> 01:11:46,275
Didn't even notice the knife.

889
01:11:57,148 --> 01:11:59,358
Thanks for being on my side.

890
01:12:00,876 --> 01:12:02,602
I'm sorry I...

891
01:12:05,536 --> 01:12:07,469
Sorry I couldn't...

892
01:12:40,433 --> 01:12:42,746
They must use it to send up
the bodies after autopsy.

893
01:12:44,057 --> 01:12:45,852
It's a way out.

894
01:12:47,682 --> 01:12:49,753
It's a fucking way out!

895
01:12:49,891 --> 01:12:52,065
- I'll go get the others...
- No, wait.

896
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,276
We can just go.

897
01:12:56,415 --> 01:12:58,244
Right now...

898
01:12:58,382 --> 01:13:00,280
You and me.

899
01:13:13,121 --> 01:13:15,157
Read your note.

900
01:13:17,539 --> 01:13:19,265
HELP!

901
01:13:19,403 --> 01:13:21,405
Ray and Amir are
both liabilities.

902
01:13:21,543 --> 01:13:24,270
You know they are. We're
safer without them.

903
01:13:24,408 --> 01:13:27,111
We have to start thinking about ourselves.
It's the only way we'll survive.

904
01:13:31,588 --> 01:13:33,279
Claire...

905
01:13:35,419 --> 01:13:37,041
This is it.

906
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:39,354
I'm going, I can feel it.

907
01:13:41,425 --> 01:13:43,185
But you're going first.

908
01:13:48,225 --> 01:13:50,020
I'm gonna make it hurt.

909
01:13:59,443 --> 01:14:01,376
What was I doing?

910
01:14:08,072 --> 01:14:09,729
Oh yeah.

911
01:14:23,812 --> 01:14:25,745
I'll start with the eyes.

912
01:14:30,923 --> 01:14:32,545
Unghh!

913
01:14:51,288 --> 01:14:52,910
Ahhh!

914
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:19,109
Amir...

915
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:22,906
Amir, it's me. Put
down the knife.

916
01:15:23,838 --> 01:15:25,391
Come on, now.

917
01:15:25,529 --> 01:15:27,566
Just two more to go.

918
01:15:30,672 --> 01:15:32,225
Amir...

919
01:15:47,137 --> 01:15:48,587
Come on...

920
01:15:49,484 --> 01:15:50,727
Come on!

921
01:15:54,627 --> 01:15:56,353
No! Paul!

922
01:16:19,203 --> 01:16:20,757
Ahhh!

923
01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:36,876
This is Paul Murray,
making my final recording.

924
01:16:38,222 --> 01:16:42,537
I am the last survivor of
Blackwood Labs trial BRN14.

925
01:16:44,608 --> 01:16:46,886
If I don't... if
I don't survive,

926
01:16:47,784 --> 01:16:50,096
on this phone, is the only...

927
01:16:51,753 --> 01:16:54,100
On this phone is the
only true record...

928
01:16:55,964 --> 01:16:58,484
The only true record
of what happened here.

929
01:17:16,502 --> 01:17:18,538
Ahhhh!

930
01:18:29,886 --> 01:18:33,061
Thank you for your patience.
The lockdown has now ended.

931
01:19:30,878 --> 01:19:32,845
Is this real?

932
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:02,185
Clear.

933
01:20:03,289 --> 01:20:04,843
Clear.

934
01:20:05,774 --> 01:20:07,293
Clear.

935
01:20:22,619 --> 01:20:24,138
Clear.

936
01:20:45,711 --> 01:20:47,540
Facility is clear.

937
01:20:47,678 --> 01:20:50,060
All team, regroup by the door.

938
01:20:50,198 --> 01:20:52,028
Okay, let's go.

939
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:00,811
Christ, watch out...

940
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:29,909
Ah!

941
01:24:30,763 --> 01:24:32,800
After a four month
investigation,

942
01:24:32,938 --> 01:24:35,389
Blackwood Pharmaceuticals
were today cleared

943
01:24:35,527 --> 01:24:38,806
of any wrongdoing, in the
incident at a Research Facility,

944
01:24:38,944 --> 01:24:41,360
which left six dead,
and one in a coma

945
01:24:41,498 --> 01:24:43,535
with little chance of recovery.

946
01:24:44,777 --> 01:24:46,814
The investigation concluded

947
01:24:46,952 --> 01:24:49,679
that Doctor Ellen Burke had
been running a rogue trial,

948
01:24:49,817 --> 01:24:52,440
and Blackwood had no
knowledge of her actions.

949
01:24:52,578 --> 01:24:55,443
Blackwood released the
following statement.

950
01:24:55,581 --> 01:24:57,445
We feel vindicated,

951
01:24:57,583 --> 01:24:59,965
but still mourn the
great loss of life

952
01:25:00,103 --> 01:25:02,519
in this senseless tragedy.

953
01:25:03,279 --> 01:25:05,419
Hopefully, this puts an end

954
01:25:05,557 --> 01:25:08,491
to any conspiracy
theories circulating,

955
01:25:08,629 --> 01:25:11,252
which are an insult
to both the victims

956
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:13,323
and their families.

957
01:25:13,461 --> 01:25:16,257
Blackwood remain
committed to our vision

958
01:25:16,395 --> 01:25:19,950
of a brighter future,
through better medicine.

959
01:25:20,088 --> 01:25:22,367
Nothing will stand in our way.
