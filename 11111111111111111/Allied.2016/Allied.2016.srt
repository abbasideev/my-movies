Max has three days off. Isn't that great?

563
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,833
She just woke up.

We won't be long.

Because V Section, they never say

590
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,111
what they mean
and they never mean what they say.

591

And they never say anything
on the phone.

You have to listen to him, Max.

He outranks both of us.

616
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,669
Over the past seven days,

617
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,275
V Section has intercepted
coded messages

618
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:12,035
being sent from London to Berlin
on a WT transceiver.

619
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,350
We haven't traced the signal
to an address yet,

620
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,035
but it's coming from the Highgate region
of North London,

621
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,519
and the information

622
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,952
concerns the activities
of SOE circuits in France.

623
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,712
In one transcript,
the agent refers to his source as,

624
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,872
"Fräulein." So it's a woman.

625
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,429
Okay, okay, Frank, can we speak alone
for a moment?

626
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,794
Wing Commander Vatan,

627
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:41,156
do you ever speak to your wife
about your work?

628
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,709
Okay.

629
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,998
Uh, sir, before this
thing gets out of hand,

630
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,756
may I speak? Hmm?

631
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,239
May I speak?

632
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,398
- FRANK: Yes.
- Yes?

633
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,989
My wife is Marianne Beauséjour.

634
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,673
Marianne Beauséjour ran the most
effective resistance circuit in Paris

635
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,914
until V Section fucked it up
for her in '41.

636
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,999
We met in Casablanca,

637
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,991
where together we assassinated
the German Ambassador.

638
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,911
She's the mother of my child.

639
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,351
She gave birth to my child,
for Chrissake.

640
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,674
This is a translated transcript
of an interrogation

641
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,433
of a German Abwehr officer
captured in Tobruk.

642
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,559
Amongst many other things,
he claims that Marianne Beauséjour

643
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,877
was arrested and executed in May 1941

644
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,315
when the rest of her circuit
was captured in Paris.

645
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,675
Marianne Beauséjour's identity

646
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,355
was then given to a German agent
of similar build and coloring.

647
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:48,110
She was flown to Casablanca,
where no one knew the real Marianne.

648
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,835
And it was subsequently discovered

649
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,388
that the German Ambassador

650
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,190
who you assassinated in Casablanca
was a dissident.

651
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,919
Hitler wanted him killed.

652
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,878
This is insane.

653
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,788
All the information
in the intercepted communications

654
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,993
had crossed your desk.

655
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,915
Yes, everything crosses
my fucking desk.

656
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,675
Max, this is now an operational mission.

657
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,993
If Marianne is indeed a German spy...

658
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,311
- My wife is not a spy!
- FRANK: If she is,

659
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,672
we need to keep her in place
for 72 hours

660
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:31,953
so that we can identify her handler
and clean out the rest of her circuit.

662

No.

663
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,118
Now we've got that out of the way,
perhaps we could discuss

664
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:03,119
the operational details
of the next 72 hours?

665
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,559
So, this is gonna be a standard
"blue-dye" procedure, blue dye being...

666
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,278
I know what a "blue-dye" is.

667
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,800
Tonight,

668
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,236
you will receive a telephone call
at exactly 2307.

669
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,958
Repeat the time, Wing Commander.

670
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,994
2307, sir.

671
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,056
You will take the call
and you will write down a message

672
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,559
somewhere your wife can read it.

673
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,710
It'll be false information,
only you will have it.

674
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,634
But it'll appear to be of a high grade,
so she will have to pass it on quickly.

675
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,558
By midday on Monday,

676
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,838
our agents will have decoded
enemy traffic from the weekend.

677
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:41,870
So if the false information
is among the batches sent from London,

678
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,116
we shall know for sure.

679
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,674
If you are right, Max,

680
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,832
the information won't appear
on the transcripts,

681
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,991
and all this will be forgotten.

682
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,474
But if it is proven that
your wife is a spy,

683
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,957
routine procedures in cases
of intimate betrayal

684
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,151
will apply.

685
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,115
You will execute her
with your own hand,

686
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,590
and if we discover
that you are an accomplice in any way,

687
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,716
you will be hanged for high treason.

688
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,474
Wing Commander Vatan,
do you understand?

689
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,830
He needs to confirm
that he understands

FRANK: Max, it is vital
you do nothing differently.

694
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,318
You are not to investigate
or take matters into your own hands,

695
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,719
do you understand?

01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,911
I apologize for behaving
unprofessionally just then.

But I know for a fact
you'll be proven wrong.

700
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,398
Now, Wing Commander,
you will go home

701
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,715
and carry on as if nothing's happened.

702
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,593
You're dismissed.

01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,469

704
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,474
You know how it is.

I definitely have the weekend off.

714
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,469
Nope.

for tomorrow night.

Mmm-hmm.

1261
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:56,120
Je t'aime, mon Québécois.

1262
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:01,799
I love you.

1263
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,791
Take good care of her.

1264
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:08,960
(GUN COCKS)

1265
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,468
(GUNSHOT)

1266
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,513
Stand down.

1267
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:27,838
Wing Commander Vatan executed
the enemy agent with his own hand.

1268
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,516
That is how you will report it.

1269
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:35,352
That is an order.

1270
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:20,878
MARIANNE: My dearest, darling Anna.

1271
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:30,996
I'm writing this
on a Sunday night in London.

1272
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:36,071
If you're reading this,

1273
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,311
then you barely knew me

1274
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:41,229
and may have no memory of who I am.

1275
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:45,231
I am your mother.

1276
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:49,911
You were born in an air raid
in the middle of a war

1277
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:53,673
to two people who loved each other.

1278
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:59,318
Our year together
in the house in Hampstead

1279
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:01,630
has been the happiest time of my life.

1280
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:11,509
Today you took your first steps.

1281
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:18,952
I am so grateful that I saw you walk
for the first time

1282
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:21,110
with your father by my side.

1283
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,631
Max, my love,

1284
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:30,471
you are my world.

1285
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:39,392
I hope you will be able to forgive me.

1286
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:43,880
And I hope you make it to Medicine Hat.

1287
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:50,628
I have a picture of it in my mind,

1288
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:54,552
and I pray Anna's eyes will see it.

1289
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:00,671
My beautiful daughter,

1290
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:04,469
I love you with all my heart.

1291
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,833
I hope you will live your life in peace.

1292
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:17,676
I rest knowing your father
will take good care of you.

1293
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:25,235
I remain your loving mother,

1294
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:29,232
Marianne Vatan.
