1
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:27,549
Eddie and Jean met
and fell in love.

2
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:33,346
Eddie and Jean got married
and bought a house.

3
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:37,225
Eddie and Jean
were gonna have a kid

4
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:39,519
but didn't.

5
00:00:39,603 --> 00:00:43,523
So, every morning,
Eddie kisses Jean,

6
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:46,526
Eddie leaves the house,

7
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,112
and Jean's alone.

8
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:36,428
Fucking Eddie, come on.

9
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:45,145
Eddie, have you seen
the scissors? I...

10
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,611
You're wearing it.
Looks real good on you.

11
00:02:58,783 --> 00:03:00,410
Who's that?

12
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,998
He's our baby.

13
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,002
There were still some tags.

14
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:14,049
Aren't you gonna say something?

15
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:18,053
This some kind of
sick joke, Eddie?

16
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:19,679
'Cause I'm not really
in the mood.

17
00:03:19,763 --> 00:03:20,889
No.

18
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:25,602
It's a baby, Jean.

19
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:27,896
I can see that.

20
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:30,357
It's all worked out.

21
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,442
He's our baby.

22
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:18,530
Come here, look.

23
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:25,996
Here, you can...

24
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:29,624
Where did you...?

25
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:33,211
Uh, not now, Jean.

26
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:42,762
It's your baby.

27
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:48,977
What's his name?

28
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,687
That's up to you.

29
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:29,184
Yeah?

30
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,585
Something burning?

31
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:39,420
Yes.

32
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,602
Where's the other egg?

33
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:56,271
On the floor.

34
00:07:02,193 --> 00:07:03,319
Mmm.

35
00:07:04,654 --> 00:07:06,656
I'll get it.
I'll get it.

36
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:12,370
Hey, I'm not
gonna be home tonight.

37
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:13,872
You'll be all right?

38
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:18,001
That's my little firecracker.

39
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:22,213
Eddie, I...

40
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:29,470
What?

41
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:34,392
Nothing.

42
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:40,064
Hey.

43
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:44,861
Don't worry about it so much.

44
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:47,071
Your eggs are terrible anyway.

45
00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:53,912
Hey, Singh. Come on in.

46
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:55,121
Nice to see you.

47
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:56,956
Rowe, thanks for being here.

48
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,208
Oh.

49
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,959
Come on, come on.

50
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:01,669
- My boy.
- I'm so fucking enjoying it here.

51
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:03,254
Hey, hey, watch your mouth.
I got a kid.

52
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:05,673
All right, all right.
I know.

53
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:07,383
Hold on one second.

54
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,868
Jimmy.

55
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,330
You're okay?

56
00:09:19,414 --> 00:09:20,623
Yeah. Why?

57
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:25,420
What are you doing?

58
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,921
No one's here?

59
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:31,384
What are you talking about?

60
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:33,761
Something happened tonight.
We have to go.

61
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:35,596
Now, Jean.

62
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,225
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on. Let's go.

63
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:40,435
Jimmy, what are you doing here?

64
00:09:40,518 --> 00:09:42,186
Go ahead, down the hall.

65
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:45,815
Why are you in Eddie's closet?

66
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:47,483
You don't have time to pack.

67
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:49,902
- You can get stuff on the way.
- You got to slow down.

68
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:52,238
I-I don't know what's happening.

69
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:54,866
You'll work out with Cal
where you're gonna go.

70
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:57,327
Who the hell is Cal?
Where is Eddie?

71
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,038
This is 200 grand.

72
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,707
Cal will manage how the money
is spent, but you hold onto it.

73
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,043
- Is Eddie okay?
- You give him ten grand right away,

74
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,045
and you can work it out from
there if he stays with you.

75
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:09,213
Who told you to tell me
all of this?

76
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:10,882
What...

77
00:10:10,965 --> 00:10:12,050
Jimmy.

78
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,177
Jimmy, Jimmy, hey, hey.
Stop, stop, stop.

79
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,347
Jimmy, it's me. It's Jean.

80
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,224
Please tell me what's happening.

81
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:22,310
Just take the bag, sweetheart.

82
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:27,940
Go wake up the kid.

83
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:10,942
I'm Cal.

84
00:11:48,563 --> 00:11:50,606
All Eddie said is
he wouldn't be home tonight,

85
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,942
but he says that all the time,
and then I wake up

86
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:55,820
in the middle of the night and
he's right there next to me.

87
00:11:55,903 --> 00:11:57,363
I don't know what's going on

88
00:11:57,447 --> 00:12:00,825
or who you are or why
any of this is happening.

89
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,120
He's never like this.

90
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:07,123
It's like he knows
something isn't right.

91
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:11,085
I mean, he cries when
he's hungry, but he just ate.

92
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:14,505
Don't they say that
about babies?

93
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:17,508
They can feel an energy, like...

94
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:19,135
like, even if
you're trying to hide it,

95
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:21,137
they know how you really feel.

96
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:36,444
You have your own?

97
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:41,407
No.

98
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:20,655
I get kicked out of my house
in the middle of the night,

99
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:22,365
and we're sent with you,
a complete stranger...

100
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:24,492
- You know what Eddie is, right?
- That he's a thief?

101
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:26,244
- That he steals for a living?
- Jean.

102
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:28,746
- Yes, I know what Eddie is.
- Then you know what's going on.

103
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:30,623
Look, I don't know who you are,
but I don't like the way

104
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:33,501
- you're talking...
- I'm how you and the baby stay safe.

105
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:37,797
Harry.

106
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,382
Sorry?

107
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:41,259
The baby.

108
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:42,343
You said "the baby."

109
00:13:42,426 --> 00:13:43,886
I thought you might like
to know his name.

110
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,934
Is he okay?

111
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:53,145
I don't know.

112
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:54,730
You work with him?

113
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:56,899
I used to.

114
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:01,571
Jimmy said we'd figure out
where I'm going.

115
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,573
I have a sister
who I can call...

116
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:05,992
- No sisters, no people.
- How long are we gonna be away?

117
00:14:06,075 --> 00:14:07,952
I don't know.

118
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:10,246
So, I'm supposed to live
you don't know where

119
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:11,706
for you don't know how long,

120
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,666
and also you don't know
if Eddie's okay.

121
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:14,917
Just let me call him.

122
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:16,419
Let him be the one
to explain it.

123
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:18,045
You can't.

124
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:19,255
You're talking about my husband.

125
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:21,215
No one knows where he is.

126
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,386
You can't call him, because
no one knows where he is.

127
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:29,682
Is anybody looking?

128
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:31,392
Everyone's looking.

129
00:14:32,977 --> 00:14:35,354
And they're looking
for you, too.

130
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:41,444
A nice house.

131
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:43,154
Near a park.

132
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:47,033
I like to take walks
with a stroller.

133
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:56,644
Why isn't it lit?

134
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,608
I've been told
it isn't good for me.

135
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:08,197
So, what's the point?

136
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:14,370
It helps.

137
00:16:26,882 --> 00:16:28,884
Oh, thank God.

138
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:39,186
He seemed like...

139
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,105
He's fine now.

140
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:44,066
Good thing he's drinking.

141
00:16:51,365 --> 00:16:55,828
If it's easier to feed him,
you know, without...

142
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:57,246
I can step out.

143
00:16:57,329 --> 00:16:59,331
What do you mean?

144
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,960
Uh...

145
00:17:03,043 --> 00:17:04,962
Oh.

146
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:06,547
It's fine.

147
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,300
He's fine. See?

148
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:27,359
- Cal?
- What? What is it?

149
00:17:27,443 --> 00:17:29,779
It's Harry.
Something's wrong.

150
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:32,114
He's burning up. Feel.

151
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:34,742
I think we need to go
to a hospital.

152
00:17:34,825 --> 00:17:36,243
No.

153
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:38,120
No people.
People ask questions.

154
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:40,122
Hospitals need information.

155
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:42,833
What part of "everyone's looking
for you" don't you understand?

156
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:45,127
We can't, Jean.

157
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:53,385
The, um, uh, star's partner

158
00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:55,346
of the team that wins, uh,

159
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:57,473
two out of three rounds
gets to stay on.

160
00:17:57,556 --> 00:17:59,475
If you understand that,
you're better than I.

161
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:00,810
Now, they, uh,
what-what they really mean

162
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:02,520
is that you
and the star's partner,

163
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:04,647
and you, Patty,
and the star's partner,

164
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,817
you get to stay on
if you win the next round.

165
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,401
He stays, and you stay, too.

166
00:18:09,485 --> 00:18:11,111
You like that arrangement,
I can tell.

167
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:14,114
Uh, see, but if you don't win,

168
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:16,116
you go, she stays.

169
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:02,454
Jean.

170
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:50,711
- Shh.
- Sir?

171
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:52,880
Ma'am?

172
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:55,674
Sir?

173
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:06,518
Excuse me. Sorry.

174
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:12,232
Don't look back.

175
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:56,193
Ma'am, are you all right?

176
00:20:56,276 --> 00:20:57,486
What?

177
00:21:00,197 --> 00:21:01,615
Feel.

178
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:05,452
It broke.

179
00:21:05,536 --> 00:21:06,704
Excuse me?

180
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:11,250
The baby... he had a fever,
but he's feeling much cool...

181
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,794
- Get out of the car.
- What's the problem?

182
00:21:13,877 --> 00:21:14,962
Get out of the car.

183
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:17,047
But, sir, the baby's sleeping.

184
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:21,260
Wait. Cal.

185
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:22,761
Cal.

186
00:21:27,975 --> 00:21:29,226
I don't understand
what's happening.

187
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:30,728
Just do what he says.

188
00:21:30,811 --> 00:21:32,312
Are you sure you're all right?

189
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:33,939
Yes.

190
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:36,275
This man isn't bothering you?

191
00:21:38,318 --> 00:21:41,196
Ma'am, why are you
with this man?

192
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,656
He's my husband.

193
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,874
Is there a problem?

194
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:56,253
Why were you sleeping
in your car?

195
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:57,671
We're sorry, Officer.
We had just...

196
00:21:57,755 --> 00:21:59,757
I'm asking her.

197
00:22:06,096 --> 00:22:08,057
We're moving to a new house,

198
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,726
and we were so excited,

199
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:13,812
we wanted to drive all night
and sleep there.

200
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:15,522
But then, around...

201
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:18,901
I don't know, around...

202
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,944
What time was it again, dear?

203
00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:24,323
Uh, a-around 1:00 or 2:00?

204
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:25,407
That's right.

205
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:28,202
Around 1:00 or 2:00,
he started to get tired,

206
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:31,371
and I was so worried with the
baby and everything, his fever,

207
00:22:31,455 --> 00:22:33,373
so I made him pull over
right away.

208
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:35,834
I didn't even want him
driving to a motel.

209
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:37,920
It's my fault, Officer.

210
00:22:40,756 --> 00:22:42,758
Do you have kids?

211
00:22:45,511 --> 00:22:48,722
Well, then you know
how mothers can be.

212
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:53,519
It won't happen again,
I promise.

213
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:01,902
Make sure it doesn't.

214
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:38,188
I didn't know
that I could lie like that.

215
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:45,362
What?

216
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:49,533
What?

217
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,455
I made a white baby.

218
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,647
Kitchen's stocked.

219
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,651
There's, uh, milk.

220
00:25:07,236 --> 00:25:09,279
Eggs.

221
00:25:09,363 --> 00:25:10,989
Bread.

222
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:14,076
Some bananas.

223
00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:16,912
Crackers.

224
00:25:18,747 --> 00:25:20,374
And pasta.

225
00:25:24,836 --> 00:25:26,838
And a dining room.

226
00:25:38,392 --> 00:25:40,018
And television.

227
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:47,526
Your room and the baby's room
are all set upstairs.

228
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:49,945
The formula you asked for,
diapers,

229
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:52,030
and some medicine
if he gets sick again.

230
00:25:53,949 --> 00:25:55,284
There's a telephone
in the drawer

231
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:57,119
of your nightstand upstairs.

232
00:25:57,202 --> 00:25:58,537
In an emergency,

233
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,499
you take it out, plug it in,

234
00:26:02,582 --> 00:26:04,209
And call this number.

235
00:26:07,296 --> 00:26:08,922
Okay?

236
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:13,635
And you're not to talk
to anyone.

237
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:15,470
No friends, no acquaintances.

238
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:17,764
And make sure
and keep the door locked.

239
00:26:17,848 --> 00:26:19,391
Why are you telling me
everything like...

240
00:26:19,474 --> 00:26:21,393
I'll be back when I can.

241
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:22,769
When you can?

242
00:26:22,853 --> 00:26:23,937
When do we get to go home?

243
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:25,314
I need you to be patient,
all right?

244
00:26:25,397 --> 00:26:27,316
- But Jimmy said you were gonna help us get set up.
- Jean.

245
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:29,526
And I've never been on my own.

246
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:31,361
I-I just need a minute to...

247
00:26:31,445 --> 00:26:33,447
This is the way
things have to be.

248
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:38,994
But Eddie would want you
to stay with us.

249
00:26:39,077 --> 00:26:41,079
I'm doing the best I can!

250
00:26:49,421 --> 00:26:52,215
Let's both just do
the best we can.

251
00:27:07,731 --> 00:27:09,566
Who did all this?

252
00:27:10,817 --> 00:27:13,028
Eddie still has friends,
I guess.

253
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:15,739
What do you mean "still"?

254
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:22,120
Cal.

255
00:27:40,972 --> 00:27:42,974
What about the park?

256
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,186
There is no park.

257
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:11,159
Hello?

258
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,288
Hello?

259
00:32:15,372 --> 00:32:17,040
It's your neighbor.

260
00:32:22,337 --> 00:32:23,755
Hi.

261
00:32:25,757 --> 00:32:27,926
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

262
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:29,010
Of course.

263
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:30,720
Oh, no, I...

264
00:32:30,804 --> 00:32:32,681
I didn't mean to frighten you.

265
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:36,142
M-My friends lived
in this house for years.

266
00:32:36,226 --> 00:32:38,895
It's nice to see
someone new here.

267
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,942
I'm Evelyn.

268
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:49,322
Mary.

269
00:32:49,406 --> 00:32:51,908
Nice to meet you, Mary.

270
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:54,035
Um, I live, uh, two doors down.

271
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:58,289
My husband passed
a few years ago.

272
00:32:58,373 --> 00:33:02,544
Uh, but if you ever need
any help or anything...

273
00:33:05,171 --> 00:33:07,090
Oh.

274
00:33:07,173 --> 00:33:08,675
Thank you.

275
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:16,349
All right.

276
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:19,728
Goodbye.

277
00:33:19,811 --> 00:33:21,312
Oh, what's your baby's name?

278
00:33:21,396 --> 00:33:24,607
- Harry.
- Harry.

279
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:27,610
Oh.

280
00:33:27,694 --> 00:33:29,279
Harry and Mary.

281
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:04,684
Candygram.

282
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,944
But when my daughter moved away,
it was hard again.

283
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:18,406
Hmm.

284
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:22,577
When the television's on,
I forget I'm alone.

285
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:31,044
This was delicious.

286
00:36:31,127 --> 00:36:32,629
Oh, it's easy.

287
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:35,214
I'll give you the recipe.

288
00:36:35,298 --> 00:36:37,133
I'm a terrible cook.

289
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:48,978
Do you mind me asking...

290
00:36:49,062 --> 00:36:51,606
Is Harry sleeping
through the night?

291
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:54,150
I'm sorry.

292
00:36:54,233 --> 00:36:56,152
D-Do you hear him crying?
I'm-I'm trying to keep him...

293
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:58,154
Oh, no, no, dear.

294
00:36:58,237 --> 00:37:00,239
It's just...

295
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:05,703
You seem exhausted.

296
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:13,461
I'm so tired.

297
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:18,508
I'm so tired all the time.

298
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:24,472
I swear I hear him crying
when he's asleep.

299
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:34,190
What happened to your husband?

300
00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:46,494
Uh...

301
00:37:46,577 --> 00:37:47,662
I'm prying.

302
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:50,331
I just...

303
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:54,335
Where's your bathroom?

304
00:37:54,419 --> 00:37:57,380
Upstairs at the end of the hall.

305
00:38:02,385 --> 00:38:04,762
Didn't you say your friends
used to live here?

306
00:38:04,846 --> 00:38:06,931
Pardon?

307
00:38:07,015 --> 00:38:08,933
You said
your friends lived here.

308
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:11,019
- The bathroom.
- Gosh, no.

309
00:38:11,102 --> 00:38:12,687
You're right.

310
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:19,694
I guess I'm getting old
faster than I thought.

311
00:38:53,603 --> 00:38:55,605
Evelyn?

312
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,402
Evel...

313
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,032
Are you all right?

314
00:39:12,747 --> 00:39:14,373
Good night.

315
00:42:51,382 --> 00:42:53,384
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

316
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,512
Hello.

317
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:03,311
Hello?

318
00:43:15,823 --> 00:43:17,241
Shit.

319
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:58,157
Evelyn?

320
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,541
Evelyn?

321
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:09,794
- Evelyn, I know that this is...
- Jean.

322
00:44:10,836 --> 00:44:11,879
Sit down.

323
00:44:16,175 --> 00:44:18,511
Ah, tut-tut-tut-tut.

324
00:44:52,461 --> 00:44:54,713
Where's Eddie?

325
00:44:57,758 --> 00:44:59,427
We know you know.

326
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,387
I don't know anything.

327
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,099
Shut the kid up.

328
00:45:06,684 --> 00:45:08,727
- What the fuck is wrong with it?
- I have to stand up.

329
00:45:08,811 --> 00:45:10,646
- No, you stay the fuck down.
- I-I have to rock him.

330
00:45:10,729 --> 00:45:12,440
- Please just let me stand up.
- No, absol...

331
00:45:33,085 --> 00:45:34,170
It's okay.

332
00:45:34,253 --> 00:45:35,629
Cover his ears.

333
00:45:35,713 --> 00:45:36,714
Wait.

334
00:45:46,056 --> 00:45:48,142
- You can't just kill someone.
- Someone who what, Jean?

335
00:45:48,225 --> 00:45:49,602
I didn't, I didn't want
to do that.

336
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:51,353
- We could've explained...
- I didn't want to do any of that.

337
00:45:51,437 --> 00:45:53,189
- We could have told her...
- She saw me kill those men!

338
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:54,648
- She was innocent.
- How do you know?

339
00:45:54,732 --> 00:45:56,150
She was an innocent...
How do I know what?

340
00:45:56,233 --> 00:45:57,401
God, she might have
worked for them.

341
00:45:57,485 --> 00:45:58,861
- She might have tipped them off.
- It's not possible.

342
00:45:58,944 --> 00:46:01,280
Are you really gonna tell me the
thought didn't cross your mind?

343
00:46:03,574 --> 00:46:05,284
- But what if she was innocent?
- She-she was dead.

344
00:46:05,367 --> 00:46:07,620
She was dead the moment
you invited her in.

345
00:46:07,703 --> 00:46:10,623
I told you, no people.

346
00:46:10,706 --> 00:46:12,458
- Try the finger.
- It won't work.

347
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,668
- It always works.
- Not if he's hungry.

348
00:46:14,752 --> 00:46:16,170
- He's hungry?
- Yeah.

349
00:46:16,253 --> 00:46:18,297
- Then fucking feed him!
- I can't!

350
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,757
What? Are-are you serious, Jean?

351
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,259
- It's nothing I haven't seen before.
- I can't.

352
00:47:21,277 --> 00:47:23,362
I can't have children.

353
00:47:25,531 --> 00:47:27,491
Eddie said he didn't care.

354
00:47:27,575 --> 00:47:30,244
That wasn't why he wanted me.

355
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:33,664
He said he loved me
and we would figure it out.

356
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:39,420
But we couldn't adopt
'cause of his record.

357
00:47:41,422 --> 00:47:43,048
Obviously.

358
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:50,431
And then, one day,
he walks in with a baby.

359
00:47:54,184 --> 00:47:56,186
I said, "Who is that?"

360
00:47:59,189 --> 00:48:02,526
Eddie smiles and says,

361
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,612
"He's our baby."

362
00:48:13,662 --> 00:48:16,290
This girl was in trouble.

363
00:48:16,373 --> 00:48:18,500
Eddie paid for everything.

364
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:20,210
Best doctors, all of it.

365
00:48:20,294 --> 00:48:24,632
Her father was gonna disown her,
but Eddie put it right.

366
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,888
Eddie said everybody's life
got saved that day.

367
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,317
I think about his mother.

368
00:48:47,446 --> 00:48:49,448
I think about her all the time.

369
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:57,539
Do you have anyone?

370
00:48:57,623 --> 00:48:59,249
What?

371
00:49:02,169 --> 00:49:04,171
You wouldn't tell me anyway.

372
00:49:08,258 --> 00:49:10,386
Once I found out
I couldn't have a kid,

373
00:49:10,469 --> 00:49:13,305
I stopped wanting it.

374
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:14,973
Thought maybe
it would be better.

375
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:20,896
I shouldn't bring a baby
into a life like this.

376
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:23,941
Eddie's a criminal.

377
00:49:26,026 --> 00:49:29,488
I told myself
that's why I kept losing them.

378
00:49:31,073 --> 00:49:33,492
That's why they wouldn't
stay with me.

379
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:43,252
But I really did want it.

380
00:49:45,754 --> 00:49:47,756
More than anything.

381
00:49:51,051 --> 00:49:53,929
I just had to keep living,
you know?

382
00:49:54,012 --> 00:49:56,724
So I burned it all up.

383
00:49:58,475 --> 00:50:02,062
I burned it up till there was
nothing left but the fire.

384
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:09,778
And then in walked Eddie
with a baby.

385
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:20,664
This is no place for a child.

386
00:50:27,421 --> 00:50:29,214
D-Does he laugh?

387
00:50:29,298 --> 00:50:31,341
What?

388
00:50:31,425 --> 00:50:33,010
Do you make him laugh?

389
00:50:33,093 --> 00:50:35,471
What the hell
are you talking about?

390
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:37,473
If you've heard him laugh.

391
00:50:37,556 --> 00:50:39,558
You know.

392
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:42,060
Course I've heard him laugh.

393
00:50:42,144 --> 00:50:43,979
Well, then you know.

394
00:50:49,485 --> 00:50:51,111
He laughs.

395
00:50:54,573 --> 00:50:56,575
Especially when I...

396
00:50:58,702 --> 00:51:00,370
What?

397
00:51:01,747 --> 00:51:03,248
When what?

398
00:51:10,672 --> 00:51:13,967
I do this thing
when I'm singing.

399
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:16,053
I don't know... he likes it.

400
00:51:16,136 --> 00:51:18,847
It happened and it worked,
so I kept doing it.

401
00:51:18,931 --> 00:51:21,517
It's not even
a song about babies.

402
00:51:24,394 --> 00:51:26,146
And now that
I'm talking about it,

403
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,941
I'm realizing
it's actually pretty weird.

404
00:51:29,024 --> 00:51:31,318
Do it.

405
00:51:31,401 --> 00:51:33,445
He's asleep.

406
00:51:33,529 --> 00:51:34,905
I'll get the idea.

407
00:51:34,988 --> 00:51:36,198
Absolutely not.

408
00:51:36,281 --> 00:51:38,575
Fine.

409
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:39,952

There's a first time
for everything.

429
00:54:22,197 --> 00:54:26,702
There's, uh, some more cans in
the pantry once this runs out.

430
00:54:29,621 --> 00:54:31,540
Some old clothes
in the wardrobe.

431
00:54:31,623 --> 00:54:33,166
There's a water pump out there,

432
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:36,378
enough wood out on
the side of the house for now.

433
00:54:36,461 --> 00:54:38,380
There's no phone.

434
00:54:38,463 --> 00:54:41,591
There's never been any trouble,
but just in case...

435
00:54:41,675 --> 00:54:43,677
Move that chair.

436
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:51,435
Move that one back.

437
00:54:54,104 --> 00:54:56,314
Grab the table,
move it that way.

438
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:22,466
It was my hiding place.

439
00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:24,593
When I was a kid.

440
00:55:27,596 --> 00:55:29,473
This was your family's.

441
00:55:32,517 --> 00:55:34,853
I'll be back soon.

442
00:55:34,936 --> 00:55:37,647
- You're not gonna leave me.
- Do you have a better idea?

443
00:55:37,731 --> 00:55:40,650
What about the money
at the house?

444
00:55:40,734 --> 00:55:42,402
That money's gone, Jean.

445
00:55:42,486 --> 00:55:44,321
Don't you have money?

446
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:46,448
Like Eddie?

447
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:49,201
I worked for Eddie.

448
00:55:49,284 --> 00:55:50,911
I'm not Eddie.

449
00:55:50,994 --> 00:55:52,829
So, what am I, a chore?

450
00:55:52,913 --> 00:55:54,748
Shh.

451
00:56:09,346 --> 00:56:11,348
This isn't about you, Jean.

452
00:56:18,271 --> 00:56:20,023
Eddie killed the boss.

453
00:56:20,107 --> 00:56:21,900
Marvin.

454
00:56:21,983 --> 00:56:24,194
The night we left.

455
00:56:24,277 --> 00:56:28,782
Then Marvin's guys went over
to your place, killed Jimmy.

456
00:56:28,865 --> 00:56:30,992
Now no one knows what's what.

457
00:56:31,076 --> 00:56:32,494
It's just...

458
00:56:32,577 --> 00:56:34,412
The city's chaos.

459
00:56:36,456 --> 00:56:38,333
That's all I know.

460
00:56:42,963 --> 00:56:44,965
Eddie would never kill anyone.

461
00:56:52,222 --> 00:56:54,224
Eddie's a killer, Jean.

462
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:57,978
He has been for a long time.

463
00:57:11,324 --> 00:57:14,035
Where is he now?

464
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:15,745
I don't know.

465
00:57:18,748 --> 00:57:20,375
You swear?

466
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:26,882
I-I really don't know.

467
00:57:51,865 --> 00:57:53,867
You do have someone.

468
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:00,999
The someone who told you
those weren't good for you.

469
00:58:02,834 --> 00:58:05,837
And they told you that
because they love you.

470
00:58:23,813 --> 00:58:26,024
He didn't have a name.

471
00:58:29,277 --> 00:58:30,904
Harry.

472
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,282
I named him Harry.

473
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,455
No reason.
I-I just liked the name.

474
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:47,045
When I was pregnant the longest,
I named the baby Harry.

475
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:53,802
I never told anyone.

476
00:59:12,279 --> 00:59:14,698
How long do you think
it's gonna be until...

477
01:01:24,202 --> 01:01:26,663
Fire.

478
01:01:26,746 --> 01:01:29,207
Hot.

479
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:31,543
Yeah.

480
01:01:31,626 --> 01:01:33,586
Fire.

481
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:36,172
F... F...

482
01:01:36,256 --> 01:01:38,508
Fire.

483
01:01:40,009 --> 01:01:41,428
Hot.

484
01:01:46,558 --> 01:01:48,726
I did that.

485
01:01:51,563 --> 01:01:53,398
I did it.

486
01:01:57,318 --> 01:01:59,320

487
01:02:03,867 --> 01:02:05,702

491
01:03:23,947 --> 01:03:26,658
She found my hiding place.

492
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,453
She sure did.

493
01:03:30,537 --> 01:03:31,663
I'm Teri.

494
01:03:31,746 --> 01:03:33,331
This is Paul.

495
01:03:33,414 --> 01:03:34,541
And that's Art.

496
01:03:42,757 --> 01:03:44,509
I'm sorry. Who...

497
01:03:45,593 --> 01:03:47,303
Teri.

498
01:03:47,387 --> 01:03:48,888
Cal's wife.

499
01:03:52,225 --> 01:03:54,561
Why don't you get out of
that hole, help us unpack.

500
01:03:54,644 --> 01:03:56,646
Hey. Come on, give me a hand.

501
01:04:02,151 --> 01:04:05,071
And that's...?

502
01:04:05,154 --> 01:04:06,573
Cal's dad.

503
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:10,201
You're Eddie's wife.

504
01:04:11,411 --> 01:04:13,413
You know Eddie?

505
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,667
Yeah, I know Eddie.

506
01:04:19,085 --> 01:04:21,004
Paul?

507
01:04:21,087 --> 01:04:23,673
You run and go check
the wood, baby?

508
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,222
And...

509
01:04:31,306 --> 01:04:33,099
Eddie used to work with Cal?

510
01:04:34,225 --> 01:04:35,810
He wouldn't tell me much.

511
01:04:35,893 --> 01:04:37,520
Cal's a smart man.

512
01:04:37,604 --> 01:04:40,273
- Is Cal...
- He'll be here.

513
01:04:40,356 --> 01:04:43,192
- Is he...
- Don't worry about Cal.

514
01:04:45,236 --> 01:04:47,113
Almost out!

515
01:06:00,353 --> 01:06:02,772
I just want
to get back to sleep.

516
01:06:04,148 --> 01:06:07,235
Now I know where Cal gets it.

517
01:06:11,322 --> 01:06:13,324
He's good with the baby?

518
01:06:17,245 --> 01:06:21,457
Teri said her first husband
was no good.

519
01:06:27,755 --> 01:06:29,590
Oh, I was gonna feed him.

520
01:06:29,674 --> 01:06:31,008
No.

521
01:06:31,092 --> 01:06:34,095
We don't eat
in the middle of the night.

522
01:06:35,304 --> 01:06:37,682
It's best he learns that.

523
01:06:41,394 --> 01:06:42,478
Everything all right?

524
01:06:42,562 --> 01:06:44,439
Everything's fine.

525
01:06:44,522 --> 01:06:46,482
Go back to sleep.

526
01:06:56,576 --> 01:06:58,494
When Paul was little,

527
01:06:58,578 --> 01:07:03,541
we had to live in this old hotel
in the city for a while.

528
01:07:03,624 --> 01:07:05,585
The Saint Francis.

529
01:07:05,668 --> 01:07:07,253
I remember that.

530
01:07:07,336 --> 01:07:09,338
Why?

531
01:07:09,422 --> 01:07:11,382
It was safe for us.

532
01:07:11,466 --> 01:07:14,260
It's Black-owned,
Black-operated.

533
01:07:14,343 --> 01:07:16,888
Place where people could go
to fix their lives.

534
01:07:18,598 --> 01:07:21,851
I mean, it was
kind of a in-between place.

535
01:07:23,352 --> 01:07:25,229
Not quite there yet,

536
01:07:25,313 --> 01:07:27,523
but better than
where they'd been.

537
01:07:29,525 --> 01:07:32,445
"Where there is despair,
I may bring hope."

538
01:07:32,528 --> 01:07:35,531
You know
the Prayer of Saint Francis.

539
01:07:35,615 --> 01:07:38,534
The one good thing I kept
from Catholic school.

540
01:07:39,952 --> 01:07:41,287
Everything smelled old.

541
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:44,081
Sometimes the toilets
wouldn't flush.

542
01:07:44,165 --> 01:07:45,917
But Paul loved it.

543
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,585
There was a phone in the hall.

544
01:07:47,668 --> 01:07:50,338
He'd run to it
every time it rang.

545
01:07:50,421 --> 01:07:52,965
A little answering service,
up on his tippy-toes.

546
01:07:59,972 --> 01:08:01,849
You were hiding.

547
01:08:01,933 --> 01:08:04,310
Paul, eat your peas.

548
01:08:17,323 --> 01:08:19,200
What did you do to the peas?

549
01:08:19,283 --> 01:08:21,577
Something wrong?

550
01:08:21,661 --> 01:08:23,996
They're the ones from the can?

551
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,164
Yeah.

552
01:08:27,917 --> 01:08:29,335
They're delicious.

553
01:08:29,418 --> 01:08:30,920
Oh.

554
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:35,675
Salt, pepper, some butter.

555
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:38,511
Some love.

556
01:08:38,594 --> 01:08:41,055
You just heat them up
out of the can?

557
01:08:41,138 --> 01:08:44,100
I'm a terrible cook.

558
01:08:44,183 --> 01:08:45,560
You feed your family, yeah?

559
01:08:45,643 --> 01:08:46,978
Yeah, but...

560
01:08:47,061 --> 01:08:49,063
Then you're
the world's greatest chef.

561
01:08:55,361 --> 01:08:57,697
I got the place
when Cal was five.

562
01:08:59,407 --> 01:09:01,701
Are you married?

563
01:09:01,784 --> 01:09:03,035
I was.

564
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:06,122
My wife passed
about four years ago.

565
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:11,043
Cal wouldn't
talk about anything.

566
01:09:11,127 --> 01:09:14,171
His family or anything.

567
01:09:14,255 --> 01:09:16,257
Occupational hazard.

568
01:09:21,304 --> 01:09:23,514
I'm about to take out a gun.

569
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:32,857
It's empty.

570
01:09:34,567 --> 01:09:36,402
You ever use one?

571
01:09:39,405 --> 01:09:42,742
All these men
and all their guns.

572
01:09:42,825 --> 01:09:45,661
My husband wouldn't even
let me drive the car.

573
01:09:48,956 --> 01:09:53,085
Listen, anyone can
learn to shoot.

574
01:09:53,169 --> 01:09:57,381
But the hard part is what you
actually do when the time comes.

575
01:09:58,382 --> 01:10:00,635
Now, when you practice,

576
01:10:00,718 --> 01:10:02,261
you pull the trigger...

577
01:10:04,096 --> 01:10:07,725
...and you think about pressure
and alignment.

578
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:12,229
But what you really need
to figure out is

579
01:10:12,313 --> 01:10:14,732
what you'll do when it's real.

580
01:10:19,028 --> 01:10:20,446
Here.

581
01:10:21,781 --> 01:10:23,407
Get used to the weight.

582
01:10:42,301 --> 01:10:45,304
Why did Art show me
how to use a gun?

583
01:10:47,223 --> 01:10:50,142
Paul, can you go outside
and find Grandpa?

584
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,946
There were some guys
outside our apartment.

585
01:11:02,029 --> 01:11:04,365
You live in the city?

586
01:11:04,448 --> 01:11:05,658
Yeah.

587
01:11:05,741 --> 01:11:07,451
First, I thought
Cal was just paranoid,

588
01:11:07,535 --> 01:11:11,455
but after two more nights of it,
he packed up and sent us away.

589
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:13,416
Said he'd be right behind us.

590
01:11:13,499 --> 01:11:17,545
I just thought you should be
prepared for what comes next.

591
01:11:19,213 --> 01:11:20,965
What comes next?

592
01:11:21,048 --> 01:11:23,259
I don't know yet.

593
01:11:23,342 --> 01:11:25,761
But I've been
through this before.

594
01:11:47,658 --> 01:11:50,661
Art said something
the other night.

595
01:11:52,663 --> 01:11:54,248
What?

596
01:11:56,292 --> 01:11:58,753
Eddie was your first husband.

597
01:12:04,341 --> 01:12:05,968
Art told you that?

598
01:12:08,429 --> 01:12:10,431
I put it together.

599
01:12:14,393 --> 01:12:16,604
Eddie did the same thing to you?

600
01:12:16,687 --> 01:12:18,105
Before Cal?

601
01:12:19,774 --> 01:12:21,942
Except it's worse
'cause we have a kid.

602
01:12:22,026 --> 01:12:24,111
Nothing's worse for you.

603
01:12:24,195 --> 01:12:26,322
You don't know that.

604
01:12:27,406 --> 01:12:29,033
Yeah, I do.

605
01:12:47,343 --> 01:12:50,346
Eddie never told me
he had another wife.

606
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:56,685
He never told me
a lot of things.

607
01:12:58,312 --> 01:13:00,314
That's what they do.

608
01:15:21,497 --> 01:15:22,915
Teri.

609
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,502
Are you awake?

610
01:15:28,587 --> 01:15:31,006
Something's not right.

611
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:32,591
We should go find Cal.

612
01:15:32,675 --> 01:15:34,218
We need to find Cal and Eddie.

613
01:15:34,301 --> 01:15:35,678
You need to stop
worrying about...

614
01:15:35,761 --> 01:15:38,889
I am so sick of everyone
telling me what to do.

615
01:15:44,603 --> 01:15:46,021
What?

616
01:15:47,564 --> 01:15:48,607
What?

617
01:15:48,691 --> 01:15:50,609
I was gonna leave.

618
01:15:50,693 --> 01:15:53,487
I was gonna leave when
I was sure you were all asleep.

619
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:56,448
Of course I know
Cal's in trouble.

620
01:15:56,532 --> 01:15:58,867
Sorry.

621
01:15:58,951 --> 01:16:00,953
Art was gonna tell you
in the morning.

622
01:16:02,955 --> 01:16:04,331
I'm going with you.

623
01:16:04,415 --> 01:16:05,958
And you can't stop me.

624
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:07,751
No one can give me
a straight answer

625
01:16:07,835 --> 01:16:10,337
about what I'm supposed to do
or where I'm supposed to be,

626
01:16:10,421 --> 01:16:12,381
and it's because
there is no answer.

627
01:16:12,464 --> 01:16:14,758
No one knows anything.

628
01:16:14,842 --> 01:16:17,094
So I'm doing this.
I'm coming.

629
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:20,097
I'm coming.

630
01:16:22,933 --> 01:16:24,560
Are you done?

631
01:16:26,145 --> 01:16:27,896
- Yes.
- All right.

632
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,315
All right, I'm coming?

633
01:16:29,398 --> 01:16:31,400
You already told me you were.

634
01:16:33,736 --> 01:16:35,946
Okay.

635
01:18:31,186 --> 01:18:35,023
Those two dark windows...
That's our apartment.

636
01:18:36,066 --> 01:18:38,652
We usually leave a light on.

637
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:54,877
Put this in your pocket.

638
01:18:56,128 --> 01:18:58,130
So you always know it's there.

639
01:19:00,549 --> 01:19:03,177
We have to go somewhere.

640
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:06,263
And when we're there, I need you
to listen to me, okay?

641
01:19:09,266 --> 01:19:11,435
You can't tell anyone
who you are.

642
01:19:11,518 --> 01:19:13,770
It's not a safe place for us.

643
01:19:17,691 --> 01:19:19,401
And we're gonna need
some different clothes.

644
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,596
Hello there, gorgeous.

645
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:51,725
Want?

646
01:19:54,603 --> 01:19:55,604
No.

647
01:19:58,524 --> 01:20:00,442
Thank you.

648
01:20:36,687 --> 01:20:39,147
See that guy
over there? That's Mike.

649
01:20:39,231 --> 01:20:41,191
Stay here, okay?

650
01:20:41,275 --> 01:20:43,026
And keep to yourself.

651
01:20:53,245 --> 01:20:55,163
If it isn't Old Firecracker.

652
01:20:55,247 --> 01:20:57,207
Don't call me old, asshole.

653
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:59,001
Come here.

654
01:20:59,084 --> 01:21:00,460
How are you?

655
01:21:02,337 --> 01:21:04,464
Never thought I'd see her again.

656
01:21:06,091 --> 01:21:07,718
How do you know her?

657
01:21:07,801 --> 01:21:10,220
She used to be married
to a guy I know.

658
01:21:12,222 --> 01:21:14,141
Eddie?

659
01:21:14,224 --> 01:21:15,726
You know Eddie?

660
01:21:17,728 --> 01:21:19,688
She just told me about him.

661
01:21:19,771 --> 01:21:23,191
Man, that was some shit.

662
01:21:25,027 --> 01:21:26,153
What?

663
01:21:26,236 --> 01:21:29,156
Oh, you don't know?

664
01:21:29,239 --> 01:21:31,241
Watch yourself with her.

665
01:21:34,244 --> 01:21:36,288
She took everything from him.

666
01:21:36,371 --> 01:21:38,665
And I mean everything.

667
01:21:38,749 --> 01:21:43,170
But he started a whole new life
and a new family.

668
01:21:44,254 --> 01:21:47,174
Kept it far away
from this shithole.

669
01:21:47,257 --> 01:21:50,552
It's like I said, just never
thought I'd see her again.

670
01:21:50,636 --> 01:21:52,387
Something's going down.
We need to leave.

671
01:21:52,471 --> 01:21:54,473
Paul is Eddie's son.

672
01:21:57,392 --> 01:21:59,019
Not now, Jean.

673
01:22:01,647 --> 01:22:04,399
Why didn't you tell me?

674
01:22:04,483 --> 01:22:06,234
Eddie would keep me in the dark.

675
01:22:06,318 --> 01:22:08,654
Told me it was to protect me,
just like you, just like Cal,

676
01:22:08,737 --> 01:22:10,447
but I don't believe it anymore.

677
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:13,325
Is any of this real, or are you
just like the rest of them?

678
01:22:19,956 --> 01:22:21,291
Shit, it's locked.

679
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:23,502
Mike!

680
01:22:23,585 --> 01:22:25,420
Come on. Come on.

681
01:22:31,468 --> 01:22:32,469
What are you doing?

682
01:22:32,552 --> 01:22:34,012
Stay here.

683
01:26:08,184 --> 01:26:10,186
You all right?

684
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:48,516
It's okay.

685
01:26:52,103 --> 01:26:53,730
You're okay.

686
01:26:58,318 --> 01:27:00,236
It's okay.

687
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,947
You're okay.

688
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:08,161
You're okay.

689
01:27:09,496 --> 01:27:11,122
You're okay.

690
01:27:11,206 --> 01:27:13,124
Thank you.

691
01:27:39,401 --> 01:27:41,069
Room 12.

692
01:28:23,194 --> 01:28:25,447
I came back for you.

693
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:27,532
But you were gone.

694
01:28:29,367 --> 01:28:30,618
Hi.

695
01:28:31,870 --> 01:28:35,832
Eddie and I had Paul
the year we got married.

696
01:28:35,915 --> 01:28:38,752
Soon after that, I found out
what he really did.

697
01:28:40,754 --> 01:28:42,547
I wanted to leave,

698
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:47,052
but Eddie promised me that
his next job would be his last.

699
01:28:48,261 --> 01:28:50,889
It wasn't. And it never was.

700
01:28:52,932 --> 01:28:54,851
Cal was Eddie's guy.

701
01:28:54,934 --> 01:28:58,313
But he didn't want it,
not the way Eddie did.

702
01:28:58,396 --> 01:29:00,398
I think it even
scared him a little.

703
01:29:02,609 --> 01:29:04,611
But he was always there.

704
01:29:04,694 --> 01:29:07,906
Always... even.

705
01:29:10,116 --> 01:29:11,910
We started
confiding in each other,

706
01:29:11,993 --> 01:29:16,623
and eventually we fell in love.

707
01:29:20,001 --> 01:29:22,962
It was Eddie
you were hiding from.

708
01:29:23,046 --> 01:29:24,631
When you were here.

709
01:29:28,468 --> 01:29:30,470
We came without a plan.

710
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:35,350
We got restless, and we left.

711
01:29:35,433 --> 01:29:38,353
That's when Eddie found us.

712
01:29:38,436 --> 01:29:41,439
He loved us too much to hurt us,
but he wasn't gonna let us go

713
01:29:41,523 --> 01:29:44,275
without getting
something in return.

714
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:47,320
So we made a deal.

715
01:29:47,403 --> 01:29:50,490
We would get to be together.

716
01:29:50,573 --> 01:29:52,784
We could get out.

717
01:29:55,161 --> 01:29:58,331
But one day Eddie would call,

718
01:29:58,414 --> 01:30:01,668
and Cal wouldn't be able
to say no.

719
01:30:04,671 --> 01:30:06,297
That was me.

720
01:30:08,299 --> 01:30:09,926
That was you.

721
01:30:16,683 --> 01:30:21,020
I work at the university,
and Cal's at a moving company.

722
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,732
Paul thinks he's his dad.

723
01:30:24,816 --> 01:30:27,819
And a really good one.

724
01:30:34,951 --> 01:30:37,912
As time went on, we thought
it might really be over.

725
01:30:37,996 --> 01:30:42,125
That we might really have...
gotten out.

726
01:30:43,209 --> 01:30:44,836
We put the past in a box,

727
01:30:44,919 --> 01:30:48,715
and we put that box
in a secret drawer.

728
01:30:50,341 --> 01:30:52,886
And we thought
that maybe it would just...

729
01:30:54,929 --> 01:30:56,347
...disappear.

730
01:31:00,476 --> 01:31:02,228
I'm so sorry.

731
01:31:10,028 --> 01:31:11,571
That guy Mike at the club...

732
01:31:11,654 --> 01:31:14,115
He's a real piece of shit,
always has been.

733
01:31:14,199 --> 01:31:16,117
And I knew it would be
dangerous there.

734
01:31:16,201 --> 01:31:19,454
Things have been like that
since Eddie killed Marvin.

735
01:31:19,537 --> 01:31:22,874
But going there was
the best option we had.

736
01:31:22,957 --> 01:31:25,210
What do you mean?

737
01:31:25,293 --> 01:31:28,630
If I'm right, word will
get to Cal that I'm in the city,

738
01:31:28,713 --> 01:31:31,466
and once Cal knows that,
he'll find us.

739
01:31:36,471 --> 01:31:38,640
Mike works with Eddie?

740
01:31:38,723 --> 01:31:41,267
They did some jobs together.

741
01:31:41,351 --> 01:31:43,353
Then Eddie shot his ear off.

742
01:31:51,569 --> 01:31:53,988
Mike called you "Firecracker."

743
01:31:56,908 --> 01:31:58,034
Was that...?

744
01:31:58,117 --> 01:32:00,453
Don't tell me...

745
01:32:13,508 --> 01:32:15,593
So, what do we do now?

746
01:32:15,677 --> 01:32:18,054
We wait.

747
01:33:28,207 --> 01:33:29,375
Hello?

748
01:33:29,459 --> 01:33:30,835
Thank you.

749
01:33:32,462 --> 01:33:36,007
Teri, there's some men
out front.

750
01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:38,092
We can go out the back.

751
01:33:47,935 --> 01:33:49,354
Thank you.

752
01:33:50,563 --> 01:33:52,565
I'll meet you there.

753
01:34:00,365 --> 01:34:03,493
Jean, no matter what you hear,

754
01:34:03,576 --> 01:34:05,203
keep walking.

755
01:34:16,214 --> 01:34:17,757
Hey, Teri.

756
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,550
Came to talk to you, huh?

757
01:34:19,634 --> 01:34:20,843
Teri, where you going?

758
01:34:42,532 --> 01:34:45,201
Where's Teri?

759
01:34:45,284 --> 01:34:47,036
She said she'll meet us here.

760
01:34:48,121 --> 01:34:49,247
Paul and Harry?

761
01:34:49,330 --> 01:34:51,874
With your dad at the cabin.

762
01:34:54,502 --> 01:34:56,712
So, can I get you anything?

763
01:34:58,381 --> 01:34:59,674
Coffee.

764
01:34:59,757 --> 01:35:01,175
Two.

765
01:35:07,432 --> 01:35:09,600
Are you okay?

766
01:35:09,684 --> 01:35:11,436
Eddie's dead.

767
01:35:11,519 --> 01:35:13,020
Here you go.

768
01:35:16,274 --> 01:35:18,276
At least it stopped
raining, right?

769
01:35:20,778 --> 01:35:22,071
Anything else?

770
01:35:22,155 --> 01:35:23,990
No, thank you.

771
01:35:43,551 --> 01:35:45,887
I'll get a job.

772
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:47,388
What?

773
01:35:49,056 --> 01:35:51,058
An apartment, maybe.

774
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:55,062
Some place far away.

775
01:35:57,273 --> 01:35:59,275
Harry can grow up there.

776
01:36:03,321 --> 01:36:06,240
He won't remember any of this.

777
01:36:06,324 --> 01:36:08,951
I know everything, Cal.

778
01:36:23,174 --> 01:36:25,468
Do you need help?

779
01:36:28,513 --> 01:36:29,847
I'm all right.

780
01:36:36,437 --> 01:36:38,022
Where is she?

781
01:36:40,149 --> 01:36:42,527
She'll be here.

782
01:36:46,572 --> 01:36:48,574
Did Eddie do that?

783
01:36:51,661 --> 01:36:53,996
He was dead before I got there.

784
01:38:12,742 --> 01:38:14,952
Take the Wilson Street Bridge.

785
01:38:15,036 --> 01:38:16,203
But it'll take longer.

786
01:38:16,287 --> 01:38:17,538
Just stay off Central.

787
01:38:17,622 --> 01:38:18,956
Why? We ditched the truck.

788
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,667
- Teri.
- We have to get back to the kids.

789
01:38:21,751 --> 01:38:22,877
You're the one who said

790
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,003
Mike's guys were
outside the hotel.

791
01:38:24,086 --> 01:38:25,212
I-I don't trust them.

792
01:38:25,296 --> 01:38:27,131
Can't believe
that asshole's still alive.

793
01:38:27,214 --> 01:38:28,591
But Eddie's dead.

794
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:31,802
I don't think he knows.

795
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:37,391
Someone's following us.

796
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:40,496
Whoa.

797
01:39:46,252 --> 01:39:48,212
He's gone. He's gone.

798
01:41:11,462 --> 01:41:13,005
Cal.

799
01:41:15,633 --> 01:41:17,635
Teri.

800
01:41:21,263 --> 01:41:22,681
Teri.

801
01:41:24,016 --> 01:41:25,559
No, no. No, no, no, no.

802
01:41:25,643 --> 01:41:27,186
Teri.

803
01:41:27,269 --> 01:41:29,271
Teri! Cal!

804
01:41:29,355 --> 01:41:31,732
No. No.

805
01:41:31,816 --> 01:41:33,234
Teri!

806
01:41:38,656 --> 01:41:40,074
Cal!

807
01:41:59,552 --> 01:42:00,678
Is this her?

808
01:42:00,761 --> 01:42:02,763
Shut the fuck up.

809
01:42:13,899 --> 01:42:15,234
What's happening?

810
01:42:15,317 --> 01:42:17,152
Shut the fuck up!

811
01:42:18,696 --> 01:42:21,574
- This is Jean?
- Yes!

812
01:42:21,657 --> 01:42:22,783
Eddie's wife?

813
01:42:22,867 --> 01:42:24,577
Jesus Christ!

814
01:42:33,252 --> 01:42:36,213
Did I not tell this asshole
to shut the fuck up?

815
01:42:44,221 --> 01:42:46,640
It's nice to finally
meet you, Jean.

816
01:42:49,143 --> 01:42:52,146
I'm sorry I didn't know
that was you in my club.

817
01:43:05,701 --> 01:43:07,077
Where's Eddie?

818
01:43:08,162 --> 01:43:09,830
Eddie's dead.

819
01:43:10,873 --> 01:43:13,375
Jean, Jean, Jean.

820
01:43:13,459 --> 01:43:15,002
Don't do that.

821
01:43:17,421 --> 01:43:18,714
Don't lie to me.

822
01:43:18,797 --> 01:43:21,842
Don't you know
this is the moment

823
01:43:21,926 --> 01:43:24,345
this can all be over?

824
01:43:24,428 --> 01:43:25,846
All's you have to...

825
01:44:52,307 --> 01:44:53,726
Teri?

826
01:45:01,692 --> 01:45:02,901
Teri.

827
01:45:03,944 --> 01:45:05,362
Teri.

828
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:10,117
Okay. Okay.

829
01:46:22,648 --> 01:46:25,234
I'm okay. I'm okay.

830
01:46:46,588 --> 01:46:48,006
Okay.

831
01:48:02,623 --> 01:48:04,041
Go.

832
01:48:06,501 --> 01:48:08,128
I killed Mike.

833
01:49:16,655 --> 01:49:18,073
Jean.

834
01:49:19,074 --> 01:49:21,118
I don't think I can move.

835
01:49:23,245 --> 01:49:25,664
I don't think I can move.

836
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:46,578
Art.

837
01:51:44,553 --> 01:51:46,763
It's all right now.

838
01:51:46,847 --> 01:51:48,849
Your mom and dad are outside.

839
01:51:55,647 --> 01:51:58,191
It's okay, baby.

840
01:51:58,275 --> 01:51:59,693
Your mama's here.

841
01:52:00,777 --> 01:52:02,904
Your mama's here.

842
01:52:07,284 --> 01:52:09,953
Okay. Okay.

843
01:52:10,036 --> 01:52:12,706
We're gonna play a game. Okay?

844
01:52:13,748 --> 01:52:15,375
You have to close your eyes,

845
01:52:15,459 --> 01:52:17,377
and you can't open them
till I say so.

846
01:52:17,461 --> 01:52:19,212
Okay?

847
01:52:19,296 --> 01:52:23,341
And when I tell you to
open them, you can't look back.

848
01:52:23,425 --> 01:52:24,801
Got it?

849
01:52:28,805 --> 01:52:30,557
All right, Paul.

850
01:52:32,434 --> 01:52:34,186
Close your eyes.

851
01:52:44,946 --> 01:52:46,740
There's a big one coming up.

852
01:52:46,823 --> 01:52:48,825
Step. Step again.

853
01:52:51,786 --> 01:52:53,288
Okay, Paul.

854
01:52:53,371 --> 01:52:54,998
Keep them closed.

855
01:53:03,965 --> 01:53:06,510
Okay, Paul, open your eyes.

856
01:53:32,702 --> 01:53:34,120
Okay.

857
01:54:00,063 --> 01:54:02,399
You're not
supposed to look back.
