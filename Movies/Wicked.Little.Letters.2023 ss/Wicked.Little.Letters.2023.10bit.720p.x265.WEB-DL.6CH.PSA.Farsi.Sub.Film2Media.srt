1
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,917
What sort of person does this?

2
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,667
- I think we know.
- We don't know for sure, Father.

3
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,792
- How bad?
- As bad as the others.

4
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,458
But there are benefits to suffering,
don't forget.

5
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:28,250
We worship a messiah who suffered,

6
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,458
so, by my suffering,
do I not move closer to heaven?

7
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,083
No!

8
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,667
Don't think so.

9
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:35,417
Oh, Edith...

10
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:40,750
Go and get the constable, please!
This'll be the death of me!

11
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,708
Don't need to tell me when to go and get
the bozzler. I was going anyway.

12
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,333
That woman will be off this street
as quick as a wink!

13
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,583
- You alright?
- I am. Are you?

14
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,833
Over my dead body
are you gonna be a cleaner.

15
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,292
- Fuck! The feckin' milk!

16
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:05,250
Oh! Actuary!
Nance, I thought you could be an actuary!

17
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:09,167
- What's an actuary?
- Well... Haven't a bloody clue.

18
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:12,375
Rich is what it is.
Rich and clever.

19
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,500
And they probably give you a quill.
Now, we won't be back late, love...

20
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,875
Actually, we might be back a wee bit late,
because Mammy's itching for a big one.

21
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,458
Oi! That's Bill's!
Nice girls don't play guitar.

22
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,458
- I don't care.
- Right, no...

23
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,375
Do you know what I was doing
when I was your age?

24
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,958
Helping Grandpa steal?

25
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,792
Well... yes, I was helping him
burgle houses off old people.

26
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:36,542
But I promise you now, Nancy Gooding,
you'll not be doing the same,

27
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:40,167
because you... are a queen.

28
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:46,167
And if you don't do your homework,
as sure as God made gooseberries,

29
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,667
I'll slit you from ear to ear.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,208
And not a peep out of that guitar!

31
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:01,125
Get off that!

32
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:08,375
Morning.

33
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,083
One of them, please.

34
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,667
- I can take your complaint, sir.
- One of them.

35
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,792
Smart as ever, Mr Swan.

36
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:37,292
Some values might survive the trenches,
Constable.

37
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:39,875
- Another letter?
- It's wicked abuse, this!

38
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,708
Edith's not sleeping.
She's grizzling all the night, bless her.

39
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,333
In and out of bed.

40
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,250
Now, I know my law.
This is a prison offence.

41
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,583
So, you better do something about it
sharp-like,

42
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,625
before there's a hurleyberloo.

43
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:09,625
- This is all of them.
- Right.

44
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,000
"Dear Edith.
You foxy-ass old whore."

45
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,500
- Holy heavens!
- No. Carry on.

46
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,667
Don't worry about me, Constable.
I rise above it.

47
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,458
"You really are a tricksy old fucker.

48
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,167
"You belong in hell probably,

49
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:40,125
"and you're a sad, stinky bitch as well."

50
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:43,042
In the end, I think it's just jealousy.

51
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,375
- What are you gonna do about it?
- I'll note it. I'll surely note it.

52
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,208
- You'll what?
- Note it.

53
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,125
As in, write it down on some paper there,
on a form.

54
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,875
Which we have.
In the station yonder.

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You'll write it down on a form?

56
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:02,333
- A form?
- Yeah, alright...

57
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,875
Edith, do you feel certain-sure
Rose Gooding's guilty?

58
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,875
- Yes, hugely.
- Er, Edith?

59
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,625
Yes! I just said she does,
butter my wig!

60
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,375
It's not my place to judge anyone.
There's only one judge.

61
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:21,833
- We all await judgement equally.
- Especially that old strumpet!

62
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:25,875
- Well, no, that's not the point...
- Shh! Let the man speak.

63
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,000
Thank you.

64
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,125
- Well, we at the station...
- Alright, carry on.

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,167
We at the station think
it's Miss Gooding, too.

66
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,583
But is there enough for a court summons?
She'll be away to jail for these.

67
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,667
Easily enough!
She has it in for Edith.

68
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:45,958
A misunderstanding.

69
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:50,083
That woman curses like a fish.
She's got straggly hair all the time.

70
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:54,083
And she marches around on the Sabbath
with feet as bare as goose eggs!

71
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,500
- But, even so...
- Right!

72
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,583
"Her Majesty, Miss Swan,
sucks ten cocks a week minimum."

73
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:08,583
"Edith Swan takes it up the Swanee,
and she loves it more than Christmas Day."

74
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,292
- Edward!
- Only words, Mother.

75
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:15,250
"You foxy-arse old fucking mare, you want
spiking in the nose, you big smelly bitch!"

76
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,958
- Alright...
- "You great big fucking onion!"

77
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,750
Alright, man.

78
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:24,583
Edith would need to come in and personally
make the claim in an interview with me.

79
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,917
Which I know you'd struggle with, Edith,
cos of your moral misgivings in the area.

80
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,625
I should not cast the first stone.

81
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,542
- If I were without sin...
- She'll do it!

82
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:46,042
Edith, love, if you behave right,
as I know you will,

83
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,542
you could be an example to people.

84
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:52,542
You could be known in Littlehampton
for your virtue and your sacrifice.

85
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,542
Perhaps.

86
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,792
Yes, if I could be of use to people...

87
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:03,958
- But is it not prideful?
- It's not prideful. I hate her!

88
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:09,917
God travels through the just.

89
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,875
Alright.

90
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:22,833
We'll need a statement, then.
All the facts you have.

91
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,375
- Where are you going now?
- To arrest Miss Gooding.

92
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,292
Don't be nervous, Den.
I'll get you in the ball sack!

93
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:40,000
- Now, I have done this before!
- Have you actually?

94
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,542
Yes! It was different circumstances,
obviously.

95
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:46,375
- Like how?
- Well, there wasn't a person underneath!

96
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,958
- Or a potato, nothing! Let's go!

97
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,000
Miss Gooding?
Can you come with me, please?

98
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,750
Can you give me five minutes?
I'm on the verge of making history here!

99
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,042
I don't know what you're doing, yoystering
in the pub at this hour, Miss Gooding,

100
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,375
but that's a pint rather than a half.

101
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,833
And it's time you owned up
to these letters to Miss Swan!

102
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:10,625
Are you fucking joking me?

103
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,083
You're gonna feel like
a right daft old twat.

104
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,958
- Why would I be doing that?
- So you know...

105
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,000
We knocked on your house
and woke up your girl,

106
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,708
but Mabel Alford's in with her now.

107
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,708
Nancy? Don't tell her what's happening,
Bill, please.

108
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,542
- No, course I won't.
- Yeah, I had to tell her.

109
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,708
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing bad.

110
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,833
Just that I was arresting her mother,

111
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,667
and it was great shame on the family
and the street as a whole.

112
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:35,958
Hey, Rose! Rose!

113
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,083
Just make sure Nancy's okay.
I'll be back in the morning.

114
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,000
This is a fucking joke!

115
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:51,833
Check her in, Gladys.
I'll, er... go tell Spedding.

116
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
- Name?
- Rose Gooding.

117
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,458
Are you the night cleaner?

118
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,750
Woman Police Officer Moss.

119
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,000
- Address?
- Fuck!

120
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,375
I've heard of them.

121
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,875
Undercover in the sewing circle, is it?

122
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:20,167
67, Western Road.

123
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,958
- Next of kin?
- What counts as next of kin?

124
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,583
- Closest adult blood relative.
- I haven't got anything for that one.

125
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,458
- You can put someone back home.

126
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,208
You don't even get handcuffs, do you?

127
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,125
Actually, that is at the discretion
of my superior.

128
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,708
And has your superior
exercised his discretion

129
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,417
hitherto in this particular circumstance?

130
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:50,958
- Come with me.
- Fuck!

131
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,917
Why would I send anonymous letters to
someone I've torn strips off in the street?

132
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:56,875
Do I look like the anonymous type to you?

133
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,500
You're not the first to say
they didn't do it.

134
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:03,333
Look, woman to woman,
I've got a daughter at home.

135
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,875
Do you?

136
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,042
Then perhaps you should avoid
breaking the law.

137
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,625
Fucker!

138
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,250
- Does it always smell like this?
- Like what?

139
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,542
Sorry, I'm just not used to the police.

140
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,250
Just tell us about Rose.

141
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:20,167
Woman Officer Moss joins in female ones
in case of hysteria and general tears.

142
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:21,500
So...

143
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,500
What's she like?

144
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,333
Well, we're all God's creatures,
we're all deserving of his grace.

145
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,542
- Miss Swan?
- She's heinous.

146
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:32,042
And she's what we feared would come
after the war.

147
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,833
Love thy neighbour,
and I tried, but...

148
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:42,042
Well, back in the spring, when she first
moved here from the Emerald Isle,

149
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:45,042
it was clear that
she didn't rightly fit in.

150
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,292
Her husband died early in the war,
Nancy's father,

151
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:51,250
and Bill, her latest, well, he wasn't
the same after he came back either,

152
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:55,000
and they say he wasn't the first,
she'd had a few.

153
00:12:55,125 --> 00:13:00,917
And, well, I can well imagine,
she seemed enthusiastic in that, er...

154
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:05,125
...particular area of expertise.

155
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,625
But she wanted a fresh start, she wanted
to become a respectable woman, so...

156
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:13,292
...I think I saw myself as a missionary,

157
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,958
helping someone to find a new path.

158
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,583
Oh, if I could just say two words to you:
floor crumbs.

159
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,667
Keep them in order,
and everything else follows.

160
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:25,792
My Auntie had a little ditty: "A woman
whose floors are messy and foul...

161
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,958
"Er... dee-dum, dee-dum, dee-dum..."

162
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:33,167
- Anyway, the point is, she was a whore.
- Right, I'll remember that.

163
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:36,583
Say, we should get you along
to the Christian Women's Whist Drive.

164
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,375
What the fuck is that?

165
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,333
- Applejack!
- Oh, shit!

166
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,375
- The language you just used out loud.
- Fuck me!

167
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,750
- Indoors, on a Wednesday.
- Jesus!

168
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,875
So, you got to know her, then?

169
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,917
A little. Erm...

170
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:57,542
Likable in many ways.

171
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,708
'We became friends.'

172
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,917
- Have you got a fella yourself?
- Ah, well...

173
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:07,333
- No. I was engaged, but...
- Oh.

174
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,958
- Christ, was he on the front?
- Oh, no, Sidney didn't die.

175
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,458
He just... went.

176
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,333
What?

177
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,500
What a fucking bastard!

178
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:22,125
I bet he was pale.
Sidney's a pale, mangy, pitiful name.

179
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,083
Crikey.

180
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:28,042
- A bit pallid.

181
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,292
My father says I'm better off,
that he was un-Christian.

182
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,458
Well, I'll find you
a great big horse of a man,

183
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,167
who wakes you up with a fright,
if you know what I mean!

184
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,667
Sure, you deserve a good 'un.
You do, Edith.

185
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:45,458
So, what brought you here
after your husband...?

186
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,750
A fair breeze, Edie love.

187
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,833
I know you're not supposed to say it,
but sometimes it's just good

188
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,417
to get away from your fucking family.

189
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,542
Of course, she, er...
ruffled a few feathers.

190
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:06,000
I mean, not much goes unnoticed
in Western Road, as you know.

191
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,542
For instance...

192
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:11,292
- Oh, fuck!

193
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:14,708
Oh, Jesus! Oh!

194
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,583
- Oh! Oh!

195
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,292
Ah! Oh!

196
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,250
Er... for instance, we shared
a wash house and a bath,

197
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:30,292
and let's just say, neither were left
in the pristinest of conditions.

198
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,625
- Oh, God!
- Oh Jesus!

199
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,375
- Aargh! Oh, God! Oh, God!

200
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,667
Then it was my father's birthday
at St John Methodist's.

201
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,875
No, no, no, I'm joking.
Only hymns.

202
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
A few dirty jokes and hymns!

203
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,708
Might have to ask the vicar first.

204
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,458
Come on, Edith,
get the birthday boy some cake.

205
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,333
She's in the middle of a conversation.
She'll be with you when she's done.

206
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,458
No. I'd like it now.

207
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,958
Two moments.

208
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:14,833
- Good job her husband's not here.
- What did you say, Ray?

209
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,458
- Huh?
- Go on, tell us what you said.

210
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, leave it!
It's my birthday party.

211
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:24,500
It's your birthday party?

212
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,333
Who cares?
What, are you eight years old?

213
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,792
You won't speak to me
like I'm a nancy-boy.

214
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:32,458
I was saying,
what would your fucking husband think?

215
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:36,000
My husband isn't alive, Ray,
so he's not thinking a great deal.

216
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:40,167
He's probably thinking it's a shame
we're missing these shitty pasties.

217
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,750
Looks like he got away lightly!

218
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,750
Oh!

219
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:50,458
Cake.

220
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:54,417
Couldn't have that at Women's Whist.

221
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,958
I saw her the next day.

222
00:16:58,667 --> 00:16:59,875
Oh!

223
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,417
Oh... if you've come to apologise,
my father's inside.

224
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,375
I haven't come to apologise.

225
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,416
Sure, why would I apologise
outside a toilet?

226
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,458
- But, Rose, your behaviour last night.
- Oh, fucking Ray was a gobshite.

227
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,791
And your father needs
to loosen his chain, too.

228
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,125
In my opinion, that's not
how a proper lady behaves.

229
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,833
Oh, I'll know better than cosy up
to school ma'am next time.

230
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,541
Fucking mardy old clod!
I was just trying to be your friend!

231
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:32,292
Actually, I do really need to go!
Can you give me a second?

232
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:35,750
- And close your ears! Oh, shit!

233
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,667
And the next day,
the child protection services turned up.

234
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,667
- 'But, truly, I don't know why they came.'

235
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:53,958
We've been alerted
to some domestic disturbances.

236
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,667
Nancy, get over here.
Who told you that?

237
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,625
I don't think nice little girls play those,
do they, petal?

238
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,167
- Who says I'm fucking nice?
- Right, no. Inside now.

239
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,917
Gimme that. It's Bill's, anyway.

240
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:12,625
To have your household questioned like that
in public... there's no greater shame.

241
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,042
I didn't... Rose! No!

242
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,333
Rose! Rose, I didn't report you!

243
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,750
- And when did the letters start?
- Straight after that.

244
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:37,000
- We haven't spoken since.
- Well, when you put it like that...

245
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,042
All out of nothing.

246
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:44,250
- What's gonna happen to her?

247
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,458
Thank you, Miss Swan.

248
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:58,917
All pointing to Rose Gooding, sir,
as suspected.

249
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:00,458
Good job.

250
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,792
Well, it's hardly surprising.
Saw it ten miles off.

251
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,792
Sir?

252
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:24,958
- You're charging her?
- Under libel. Not a small offence.

253
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,458
No, it isn't.
But what's the evidence?

254
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,625
Motive. Timeline.

255
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,917
You let me out of this fucking cell,
you aging fucking soft-cock streak of piss!

256
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,458
- Similarities in the language.
- Mm-hmm...

257
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:45,542
Everyone knows it's her, love. Ever since
she got off that boat, she's a thorn.

258
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:48,083
Rememer when she tried to climb
up the side of the pub on her birthday?

259
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,542
Fell on top of Ron Flowers.

260
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,708
Says he can still feel it in his neck
when he turns to the left,

261
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,917
which he says he does all the time,
as do we all.

262
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:56,292
Look, I'm doing it now.

263
00:19:56,417 --> 00:20:00,042
Yeah, no, that is... very... compelling.

264
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:03,833
I know you're finding your feet,
and your father was a good copper,

265
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,750
but there's a hierarchy
in the police, love.

266
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,458
Yes, sir.

267
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,292
Rose Gooding,
you are charged

268
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:22,792
with writing these wicked little letters
to Edith Swan.

269
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,458
You had clear motive to do this,

270
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,167
and there's more than sufficient evidence
to believe that it was you.

271
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:31,375
You allegedly harassed
a pretty, young, Christian woman,

272
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,167
who suffered greatly at the abuse.

273
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:39,500
And therefore, you will be remanded
on a three-pound bail while you await trial.

274
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,625
Can you afford this?

275
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:45,875
No.

276
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,542
Well, then, you will away to Portsmouth
Prison for two and a half months.

277
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,083
Next!

278
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:05,208
Hey, keep your chin up now, Nance.
They'll figure it out in the end, alright?

279
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,917
- How can you know that for sure?
- Cos Mammy's done nothing wrong.

280
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:09,458
Exactly.

281
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,625
Just do your homework
and keep off Bill's guitar.

282
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,667
You got anything saved?

283
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,500
If I need to work, I'll work.
I don't mind.

284
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,625
Yeah, I have. I've got a week's wage
due from Mrs Mills. You'll be grand.

285
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,417
A week? Rose, they wanna send you down.
What if you never come back?

286
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:26,833
Are you fucking thick, man?
Just look after her.

287
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:31,000
Do you want me to write
to your folks at home?

288
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,625
- No.
- Is it a nice prison, Mammy?

289
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,417
I bet it's darling.

290
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:43,708
- You fucking wankers!

291
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:57,083
- Shh, shh!

292
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
- Break it up! Break it up!

293
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,750
Move!

294
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:33,000
...it's after the game, and he's fucking her
on the floor quick as he can,

295
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,500
cos her uncle's upstairs,
and he says she's a saucy bitch,

296
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,292
knows all the tricks and...

297
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:41,750
- Miss Moss?
- Carry on. Sounds like a good one.

298
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,750
Well... don't think so.

299
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
It's not exactly a Sunday sermon,
not entirely.

300
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,125
- How can I help?
- Firstly, I need your signature, sir.

301
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,375
What is it?

302
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,125
Lad riding a motorcycle sidecar
on the esplanade without a helmet.

303
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,042
- Contrary to local byelaws.
- Are you alright? Must be shaken up.

304
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:04,667
Yes, it's a relief to be back here with you,
Constable Papperwick.

305
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:06,583
Oi! That's good police work.

306
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,542
Secondly, having examined
the letters to Edith Swan,

307
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,750
I believe we may have charged
an innocent.

308
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,208
- I've been looking at the handwriting...
- You're not on that case.

309
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,208
It does appear to be
a different person, sir.

310
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,417
University-educated chicken swill.

311
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:24,167
Oh, look at the curl on the 'F',
the dot on the...

312
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,375
- 'I'?
- Yeah. Exactly, 'I'.

313
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,375
Or 'J' as well. Lower case.

314
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,917
- So, two options.
- Your alphabet's really coming on.

315
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:37,542
Judges don't go for handwriting.

316
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,083
Follow orders
or the whole thing falls apart.

317
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,625
Yeah, women officers don't sleuth, love.

318
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:46,417
Sir.

319
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:48,375
Where are you off to?

320
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,500
To check on the emotional wellbeing
of local woman affected by crime.

321
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,917
Which falls within my purview,
I believe.

322
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:12,833
Well... hope you weren't like them.

323
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,042
Woman Police Officer Moss.

324
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:37,458
Woman Police Officer Moss.

325
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,042
I'm Woman Police Officer Moss.

326
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,333
The whole thing's been a trial.

327
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:51,208
Trial is the word.
Of my strength, of my conscience.

328
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:54,792
And the press! It's been a whirlwind.

329
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:58,375
I don't want to be seen as a martyr,
Woman Officer Moss.

330
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,917
Oh, I don't think you'll be seen
as a martyr.

331
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:03,417
They're calling me
"The Upstanding Miss Swan".

332
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:06,583
It's a direct quote. But what do I know?
Do you want to read it?

333
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:08,375
Oh, I'm alright.

334
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,750
Well, you can take a copy with you
when you go, cos we've got spares.

335
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:14,208
Miss Gooding will have made it
to Portsmouth Prison by now.

336
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:18,583
- Yes, the idea haunts me.
- Why? Are you having doubts it's her?

337
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:20,417
Oh, if only. No.

338
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,875
I'm only haunted that
I didn't help her more. I liked her.

339
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:30,125
The only saving grace is that,
owing to Rose's character and way,

340
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,167
in prison Rose may find
some kindred spirits.

341
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:36,125
- In Portsmouth Prison?
- No, no, not the murderers or the rapists.

342
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,167
I'm thinking more the drunks
and the queers, maybe.

343
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:41,125
Just trying to find a bright side.

344
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,917
How about you, Mrs Swan?

345
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:48,042
Who else could've done this?
What do you think?

346
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:50,000
What do I think?

347
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:54,125
No, nothing.

348
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:02,125
- She's just here to check on Edith.

349
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,917
A woman police officer?

350
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,208
Oh, look, a flying pig!

351
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,167
- Ha-ha!

352
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:14,333
He's larking around. We just find
woman police officers quite funny.

353
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,917
I understand. It's an adjustment.

354
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:21,458
- I see you did well at school, Edith.
- The world's going to hell.

355
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:27,292
Oh, not really. You know, some prizes here,
the odd soprano solo there.

356
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,292
She was a modern-day genius.

357
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:33,292
The things she used to say at tea.
She had to be perfect.

358
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:37,583
And that comes from being
the eldest of eleven siblings, I reckon.

359
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:39,708
They've all gone now, but...

360
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:43,250
There's always one chick stays behind.

361
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:46,958
Not in nature, I don't think,
but in our family.

362
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,667
So, did you stay on at school
after you were twelve, then?

363
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:58,583
- What do you make of this, hmm?
- Do you mean equal suffrage?

364
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:03,667
Two of my boys, still in France.
What did they die for?

365
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,500
Why?

366
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:13,542
- I must get to Women's Whist.
- Oh, yes. Mind if I join?

367
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,125
Oh!

368
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,667
Hello, girls.

369
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:20,208
This is Gladys.
Gladys, this is Kate and Mabel.

370
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,750
We played whist through the war,
it kept us all going.

371
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,458
Officer.

372
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:27,125
- Got you a lardy-john.
- Oh!

373
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,583
I've read everything in the papers.
Congratulations... on your tragedy.

374
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:34,667
Thank you.
It's been a trial, it really has.

375
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:38,250
- Have you read everything, Mabel?
- Haven't had a chance yet, love.

376
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:40,458
I've been weeding.

377
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:43,917
I've offered to take in her uniform.
I could take the cuffs up for you at least.

378
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:46,000
- Thanks, Edie, I'm alright.
- Oh.

379
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:48,125
It was her husband's.
He was a postman, too.

380
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,625
He drowned in the Channel, so...
Her choice.

381
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:56,833
Mabel, it's just some newspaper stories.
Nothing really.

382
00:27:56,958 --> 00:28:02,208
Just this outpouring of sympathy for me,
it seems... and love.

383
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:06,542
Waves and waves of love.
It's quite a humbling experience.

384
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:10,417
I think it's just an acknowledgement
that, yes, I've been through hell,

385
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:13,458
but I've survived
with my head held high.

386
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:16,000
I don't know, it's not for me to say,
but I think so, yes.

387
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:21,125
- Well, at least she's behind bars.
- Oh, hold on, dear, she's got a daughter.

388
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,917
Well, we've all got daughters,
it's not...

389
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:27,250
I mean, I don't, I've got a parakeet,
but she's a lot of work.

390
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:31,417
We don't know it was her for sure.
Doesn't strike me as Rose, really.

391
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,708
She was charged on my testimony, Mabel.

392
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:37,292
- Don't you think it was her?
- Well... no.

393
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,083
Are there other people who would do this
to Edith, do you think?

394
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,292
- Any other people with grudges?
- I shouldn't think so.

395
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:47,250
- No.
- Sorry I'm late. Andrew ran away.

396
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,875
- Who's Andrew?
- A pig.

397
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,833
- Oh. Right.
- Grudges? Oh-ho, God, yeah!

398
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:54,542
Against Edith?
I got four, just off the bat.

399
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:59,042
- Yes, I mean Marjorie Stones!
- Oh, five, then. Hadn't thought about her.

400
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,708
From the dairy?
I thought we had a good back-and-forth.

401
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:04,375
- Oh, no, dear.
- She says you got "a gloating air".

402
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,208
- Oh, what a lot I'm learning.
- I wouldn't bother about it.

403
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:10,792
- Interesting to find that out now...

404
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,875
Sorry, can everyone just stop
for a moment?

405
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,833
- Can everyone just stop?
- We have done.

406
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:18,917
Right.

407
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:23,917
Police woman, forget your name,
are you telling me it isn't Rose?

408
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,625
I'm not involved in the investigation,

409
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,958
but we have to examine everything
before sending a woman to jail.

410
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,875
Hark at you, ma'am.

411
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,292
And what next? Set her free?

412
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:38,958
If she hasn't done it,
let her roam the land at leisure?

413
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:42,042
Well... yes.

414
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:46,042
- The woman's a spider on legs!
- Spiders already have legs.

415
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:50,667
- As in a monster, is what I'm saying.
- Rose is a one, but she's not cruel.

416
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:52,375
Really?

417
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,417
Calling Edith a frigid, ugly old spinster,
who still lives at home,

418
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,458
with no life, is not cruel?

419
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:01,375
I don't think the letters have said
those particular things.

420
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,917
- Well, where have I got them from, then?
- Your brain, I think.

421
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,083
Right. Well...

422
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:11,375
Apologies, Edith. In that case.

423
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:17,250
We're friends with Edie, but we got
to know Rose, too, and we like her.

424
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:19,417
- Sorry, Edith.
- No need to say sorry.

425
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:21,625
Any kindness shown to anyone
gives me joy.

426
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,875
And if it isn't her, she's awaiting trial
in that wretched prison,

427
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,583
and her kin haven't even got a shilling,
let alone three pounds to bail her out.

428
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,500
What on God's earth can be done?

429
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:58,708
'Officer Moss, I'm not so stupid
I don't know my own reputation.

430
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:02,917
'A tart on the run from Ireland,
is what it boils down to.

431
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:05,333
'So your man there assumes it's me.

432
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:10,667
'But I didn't leave Ireland for my sake.
I left for Nancy.

433
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:16,083
'I mean, why would I risk it all
to write some letters to Edith Swan?

434
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,542
'You must know it wasn't me.

435
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:22,208
'You may not like me much,
but can't you help me?

436
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:25,250
'Yours, Rose Gooding.'

437
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,125
'Dear Miss Gooding.
I absolutely cannot help you.

438
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:38,000
'I'm a police officer,
and you are a suspect.

439
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:41,875
'To do so would be to violate
the most basic codes of service.

440
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,625
'It is beyond question.

441
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,708
'Yours, Woman Police Officer Moss.'

442
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,833
- Come on, then.
- What?

443
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:04,750
You're bailed until trial. Hurry up!

444
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:08,875
I'm not? Am I?

445
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,583
By who?

446
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:22,625
What? Why the fuck
have you done that?

447
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,875
I didn't need your help, I was fine.
I was enjoying myself.

448
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,083
How could you afford three pounds?

449
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,500
She sold one of her pigs.

450
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:36,208
- Did you really?
- Well, he was quite ill, so no loss.

451
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,250
Well, I can't believe you've done that.

452
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:44,500
No, honestly, don't tell anyone,
but he's dying from rot.

453
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,875
- Rot?
- Pig rot.

454
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,000
Jesus.

455
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:55,167
- What are you gonna do?
- Nothing.

456
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,833
I'm just gonna lie low until the trial.

457
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:03,167
I mean, I can't see
why they think it's me.

458
00:33:03,292 --> 00:33:05,250
I was a bit roisterous once or twice.

459
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,542
That won't stand up in court, though.

460
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:10,042
I mean, people have to-dos all the time.

461
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:13,417
Why you and not anyone else?

462
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:17,417
- I mean, why not Sidney?
- Why Sidney?

463
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:21,167
Oh, Edith led him along something rotten,
and then dropped him.

464
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:24,375
What, she dropped him?
I thought it was the other way round.

465
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,375
Hmm... not how I remember it.

466
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,208
Why ain't anyone pointing
a finger at him?

467
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,083
He's decent, I'm not.

468
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,042
Well, nobody's perfect.

469
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:35,167
I'm a lovely lady,
but my hygiene habits are medieval.

470
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:38,375
They're alarming even to me.
Does that make me a criminal?

471
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,292
No, it doesn't.

472
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:43,208
And decent didn't matter
when we were working in their factories,

473
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,167
and driving their tractors.

474
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:48,292
Oh, we have to go back
to being decent, do we?

475
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,958
Well... fuck 'em!

476
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,917
I've got some rum.
Fuck 'em up the arse!

477
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,500
- ♪...with your cheeks alight

478
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:09,542
- ♪ Why you keep me waiting...
- Is that... is that Nance?

479
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:13,208
♪ I'm hot and I'm steamy

480
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:18,000

481
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:21,833
Nancy! What did I say
about playing guitar while I'm away?

482
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:26,250
Get in! And you're bloody smoking!
Do you want your lungs turn black?

483
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:37,458
I'm getting better! I'm sorry.

484
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:41,583
It's not good enough! I've been away
for a few months, and you already play...

485
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:50,625
Didn't I tell you I'd be back, hmm?

486
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,833
See?

487
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:03,458
Don't let them fuck you up, hmm?

488
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:36,208
You shaved specially for me, admit it.

489
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:41,042
Ow! Fuck, are you trying
to boil me, man?

490
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:49,375
- How's Nance really been?
- She's been fine.

491
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,333
She loves you, you know.

492
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:53,833
I know. You both do.

493
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,083
- Hello, there. Daily Mail.
- No!

494
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:08,208
No, no, no... I'm not going to grill you
about the letters.

495
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,750
What, then?

496
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:13,167
No, that is what I'm going to do.

497
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:15,458
Why do they even care?

498
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:17,625
Cos people like to pick a side.

499
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,750
- And them letters are filth.
- They're fucking funny.

500
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:24,208
"Peculiar case of...

501
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:30,458
"...the Littlehampton letter victim,
Miss Edith Swan, speaks

502
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:33,625
"of her faith and forbearance
with grace and dignity..."

503
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,792
Give me fucking strength!

504
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:46,333
These houses are going to the dogs.

505
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:49,500
- Sorry, Father, I was onto that next.

506
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,792
Dazzled by the limelight, are you?

507
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:55,917
Head turned
by Madame and Monsieur Fame?

508
00:36:57,417 --> 00:37:00,583
- Don't you get carried away.
- Oh, no, Father, I've sat down two seconds.

509
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:03,083
- Remember your place.
- Course.

510
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,708
Yes, Father.

511
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,625
Rose?

512
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:45,792
What timing.

513
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:49,458
I've thought and prayed about what
I'd say to you the first time I saw you.

514
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:55,625
Oh, well... no hard feelings.
It was good to get away.

515
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:02,375
- I forgive you, Rose.
- Edith... I didn't do it.

516
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,542
Who's that?

517
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:10,250
Er... that's me. I'm sorry.

518
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,792
I thought this was
more of a private situation.

519
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:17,417
But also, I... didn't want to leave
in case of problems,

520
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,625
so I held position.

521
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:23,958
The Father and I have been discussing
a sermon I might give at St Catherine's.

522
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:27,375
We're all positively fizzing with the idea.

523
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,792
And I had a passage
I wanted to read to you, too.

524
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:32,833
- That's what I mean by "good timing".
- Twist of fate.

525
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:35,792
- No, thank you.
- No... thank you?

526
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:39,875
- It's very short, quite energising.
- You don't want me any more energised.

527
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,875
- Not unless you want a good bannicking.
- A physical threat?

528
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,792
It's like a trapdoor to hell opens up
everywhere you tread.

529
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:50,750
- I'm not actually evil, you know?
- No, but you've got evil in you.

530
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,875
No, no, it's not your fault,
but you were born with it...

531
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,542
I like you, Rose, and I'd like to bring you
to the light. For Nancy's sake.

532
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:03,208
You can keep your fucking light.

533
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:14,958
What are you doing?
What's all this for?

534
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,625
Nothing.
I'm just making the house nice.

535
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:21,625
- Like nice mothers do.
- Well, you're already a nice mother.

536
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,250
I just want it all to be
a bit better for Nancy.

537
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:29,333
It's too late for me, but I just wanted it
to be a bit... better, you know...

538
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:30,875
- Fuck!
- Hey, hey.

539
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,583
I'm fine!

540
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:39,292
If I just prove to people that I don't have
a demon residing inside my fucking abdomen,

541
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,625
- then maybe I wouldn't...

542
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:50,208
Explain this what just came
with the postman!

543
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:54,417
- Explain it! Soon as you're back!
- I didn't! I promise I...

544
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,875
- This'll be the death of me!
- "Dear Miss Swan.

545
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,708
"You bloody fucking old saggy sack
of chicken piss.

546
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:03,875
"You want fucking in the nose holes,
you old beetle!"

547
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,583
Beetle?

548
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:07,708
Edith, you honestly don't think
I've been doing this.

549
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:09,292
I don't know anymore.

550
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:11,292
Father, it mightn't be her.
It could be all kinds of people.

551
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:15,333
- She was my friend.
- No! She wasn't your friend.

552
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:18,875
- She's a lying slut!
- Hey, what did you just say?

553
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,583
You know she is.
Be a man, son!

554
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:24,083
Don't front up to me, old boy.
I used to box in bars for cash!

555
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:26,000
Don't tell people that, obviously.

556
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,750
- And you stink out the wash house, too.
- Bill!

557
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,750
Well, he does. I think you're ill, mate.

558
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,833
- My God, please!

559
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,583
Bill! Get inside! Get inside!

560
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:38,208
Get inside!

561
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:41,875
- No, I just want this to stop!
- Oi, oi, oi! Where is she?

562
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,333
Lizzie, what's the matter?

563
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:46,083
I've just had this,
saying I'm a middling hooker,

564
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:49,167
and my fella's having it off
with a tall governess!

565
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:51,333
Sending them to everyone now, are you?

566
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:55,375
What? No... Are you a fucking eejit?
Why would I...?

567
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:03,542
- More letters. Lizzie Bailey's just...
- We know. She's been fined a ha'penny.

568
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:05,917
Ha'penny? She could've killed her
with that shovel!

569
00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:10,583
- How many have you got? Shut them blinds.
- Six just this morning on my rounds.

570
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:13,333
- All to people connected with Gooding?
- Yep.

571
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:15,333
- There or thereabout.
- I've filed four.

572
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:19,583
Two of mine alluded in a roundabout way
to sodomy, beg pardon there, Gladys.

573
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:21,958
One of them used a word
I've never even seen before.

574
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:24,125
Yeah. I actually think
it's Greek in origin.

575
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,375
- Really? How do you know that?
- Fascinating how language travels.

576
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,542
- It's horrific.
- So, that is eleven...

577
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,792
Doesn't it seem a bit queer to you
Rose would do that,

578
00:41:33,917 --> 00:41:35,542
knowing she'd lose everything?

579
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,583
Gone soft for her. Christ!

580
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:40,125
She's just this moment out,
and here they all are.

581
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,000
She boozes, then she curses.

582
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,333
- So do you.
- Huh?

583
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,458
- Why's worse when she does it?
- Well...

584
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:50,208
- Yeah, go on, say it again...
- It's obvious she didn't do it.

585
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,708
Can you at least admit
there's a chance she didn't do it?

586
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:56,542
Definitely not. Christ, Glad,
that Gooding wench is done!

587
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:59,333
I've had one now,
calling my wife's voice too deep,

588
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:01,375
which she already knows,
thank you.

589
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
And it aches when she tries
to pitch-up anyway.

590
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:07,500
Gladys, can you get some tea on, please?

591
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:10,333
Gladys?

592
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,792
Milk and two sugars.

that's my letter-writing arm!

I asked you for help!

614
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:50,375
I'm an officer.
Why would I help a suspect?

615
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,250
Because the police are horseshit!

616
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:56,708
If you want help, Rose, there are better ways
to go about it than cursing and fighting.

617
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:59,917
I don't need your fucking help.
I don't trust your fucking help!

618
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,792

- You don't need it, apparently.

- No. Are you offering?
- No, I'm not.

one more time.

00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:28,458
Two hundred times.

655
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:32,083
Do I have to count to three?

656
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:43,667
Apologies for the language.

657
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:49,542
I don't like the way you speak
or the way you act.

658
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:52,042
Rose, I should be clear,
this isn't about being friends.

659
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:56,333
Uh, good God, no, Gladys.
You got your career to think about.

660
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:58,417
Woman Police Officer Moss, please.

661
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:01,000
I'm not saying all that.
I will say Officer Moss.

662
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:05,250
- Woman Police Officer Moss!
- I can see you're a woman. Jesus!

663
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:15,958
I don't think you wrote these letters,
Miss Gooding.

664
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:20,250
Cos look.
This is a formal, educated hand.

665
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:22,500
Whereas yours is... I mean...

666
00:47:23,292 --> 00:47:26,708
- Did you go to school?
- Yes, thank you!

667
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:29,875
- Because you capitalise your 'Fs'.
- Yeah, it looks better.

668
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,333
Is there some rule book that says
which letters you capitalise

669
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:34,375
and which ones you don't,
and when?

670
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,417
Yes, there is.

671
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:41,500
The writing in the letters is quite florid.
The 'S', the 'F', the 'G'...

672
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:44,250
Who's got time to write
fucking 'Gs' like that?

673
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,750
Up to them, I suppose.

674
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:50,833
The scope of the crime has widened
since we last spoke.

675
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:54,333
Now, the sentence could easily be
a year's hard labour, by my reckoning.

676
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:57,667
During which you would presumably
lose custody of your child.

677
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:03,208
There are ten days until the trial,
so let's get down to it.

678
00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:06,708
Thank you for this.

679
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:15,625
Have you got a fella?

680
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:19,625
Lady police are forbidden marrying
or having children.

681
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:23,500
Fucking Jesus shat on the cross!

682
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:25,333
Then, why?

683
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:28,667
My dad did it.
Twenty-two years.

684
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:35,083
I think you've been set up, Rose.

685
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:38,875
Is there anyone who'd want to do
such a thing?

686
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,000
Have you got a pen and paper?

687
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:46,333
"My son, despise not..."

688
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:51,625
"...the chastening of the Lord.

689
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:57,458
"Neither be weary of his correction.

690
00:48:57,583 --> 00:49:01,000
"Even as a father...

691
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:08,083
"...the son in whom he delighteth.

692
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,042
"My... son...

693
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,292
"...despise...

694
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:27,458
"Neither be weary of..."

695
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:37,250
"For whom the Lord... loveth."

696
00:51:29,042 --> 00:51:30,542
"Dear...

697
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:34,042
"...Edith.

698
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:43,583
"You big...

699
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:46,375
"...fucking...

700
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:49,792
"...arsehole."

701
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:48,583
- Oh...
- Edith!

702
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:51,042
Edith... Edith!

703
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,417
- Oh, oh...

704
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:59,250
- Edith!
- Oh! What's happened? Oh!

705
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:02,792
- Mother...
- Go and get a doctor.

706
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:08,042
Alright, love?

707
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:17,542
Go and get a doctor, quick!

708
00:53:17,667 --> 00:53:19,083
Quick!

709
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:54,417
Are you alright there, Edith?

710
00:53:56,292 --> 00:53:59,333
Oh, yes, yes.
What do I do again?

711
00:53:59,917 --> 00:54:02,375
It's just a small amount of paperwork.

712
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,792
Someone will have to formally confirm
that it's her. I have to witness.

713
00:54:08,417 --> 00:54:10,667
Right. My father's upstairs, so...

714
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:33,333
Righty-ho.
Let's, er... please.

715
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:38,167
It's just your name.

716
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,375
And then the signature.

717
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:52,375
She was so good.
She was good.

718
00:54:53,542 --> 00:54:57,458
So sorry. Sorry.
I seem quite overcome.

719
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:59,917
We'll find who wrote these letters,
Miss Swan.

720
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:02,750
What do you mean?
I thought the police knew it was Rose.

721
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:05,750
That does appear to be the case, yes.

722
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:31,208
On behalf of the Swan family,

723
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:34,625
I would like to pay tribute
to Victoria Swan.

724
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,792
In a time when our morality
is threatened,

725
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:41,000
and women everywhere
are losing their decorum,

726
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:43,708
she was a woman who knew her role.

727
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:48,208
These recent crimes
must not cause despair.

728
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:50,917
Rather we must remember
that in God's eyes,

729
00:55:51,042 --> 00:55:56,958
the guilty inform on themselves
with their own souls,

730
00:55:57,083 --> 00:56:00,667
and the pure of heart...
are set free.

731
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:03,208
Amen.

732
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:07,833
Let us pray
for Edward and Edith,

733
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:10,792
and all that Victoria leaves behind her.

734
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:20,917
- You're a bright button, aren't you?
- I just want to be a part of it, sir.

735
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:25,083
- I don't want anything special.
- Sir?

736
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,375
- Something major.
- Wait.

737
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,542
Everyone wants a part of it,
we got hacks from France,

738
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:36,000
a private investigator from Sweden,
all got theories.

739
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:41,542
Problem is, you've been asking
questions behind my back, ain't you?

740
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:45,167
- Well, not really.
- You don't have to lie. People talk.

741
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:47,542
You got a policeman's nose.

742
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,458
Maybe I asked
the odd innocent question, sir.

743
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:52,833
- Sir, could I quickly...?
- Not now.

744
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:58,208
Problem is, I asked you not to.

745
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,542
Do you think you're the first person
to suspect Edith?

746
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:05,375
I told you,
handwriting won't cut it in trial.

747
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,000
Especially coming from you.

748
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,417
- I'm a police officer...
- Woman Police Officer.

749
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:13,000
Don't have to say that every time,
people can see I'm a woman.

750
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:15,458
Home Secretary's in Parliament,
saying we need to catch the letter-writer,

751
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:17,875
so I fucking will, my God!

752
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:21,708
You'd need to catch her red-handed.
And how are you gonna do that?

753
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:27,417
Yes?

754
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:29,875
We got a psychic.
From Toronto, Canada.

755
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,917
- Yes?
- Says he's got an amethyst.

756
00:57:32,042 --> 00:57:35,083
- Sounds like a pretty powerful one.
- Get out of my office.

757
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:36,708
Will do.

758
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:43,167
You know I have to suspend you.

759
00:57:45,917 --> 00:57:47,750
You know that.

760
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:50,667
Please, sir, I, er...
I think...

761
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,542
Please, sir.

762
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:55,958
You know what was good
about your father?

763
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:59,375
He knew the hierarchy,
and he did what he was told.

764
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:05,125
Look at these. Handcuffs.

765
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:08,500
They could be yours.

766
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:13,292
But if you meddle in my case again,
they'll be on your fucking wrists.

767
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:03,917
What are you doing?

768
01:00:04,625 --> 01:00:06,083
Nothing.

769
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:24,292
"Dear Mrs Pagwell.
You arse sucker.

770
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:27,375
"Call that a chin?
There's nothing fucking there."

771
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:32,125
That wily higgler.
I don't believe it.

772
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,125
I think it's a kind of mania.

773
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,292
Well, Rose will kill her.
She's got the red mist.

774
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:41,375
She won't, because we won't tell her.
Not till we've proved it.

775
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:45,292
- We have a week.
- Police know you're doing this?

776
01:00:45,417 --> 01:00:48,250
I'm not currently working
at the police, no.

777
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:50,083
Oh!

778
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:52,417
You're got some plums.

779
01:00:52,542 --> 01:00:54,875
Keep this between us.

780
01:00:55,833 --> 01:01:00,375
Why me? I don't like secrets.
They actually give me a churny tum.

781
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,417
Cos your shed overlooks
their house, doesn't it?

782
01:01:03,542 --> 01:01:05,208
Oh...

783
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:08,625
- I'm gonna need some bran.

784
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,750
I'll take that as a yes.

785
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:27,583
Sorry for your troubles.

786
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:31,583
I mean it.
She was a good lady, your mother.

787
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:34,708
How have you been getting on?

788
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:37,333
Oh, I've been feeling grand,
thank you.

789
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:41,792
- How about you?
- I'm a wee bit preoccupied.

790
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:45,167
Yes. I see they trumpet me
in Parliament.

791
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:47,375
Well, there's a range of opinions.

792
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:52,167
- Where did you learn to read?
- A local priest taught me.

793
01:01:53,542 --> 01:01:56,792
At least he said he was a priest.
Asked me to elope to Morocco in the end.

794
01:01:57,875 --> 01:02:01,625
He was a fine tutor of letters.
How about yourself?

795
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:06,625
I used to help my father
with the signwriting from a very early age.

796
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:09,500
I did all the ones for Glimson's Dairy
when I was only eight.

797
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:17,958
Oh, would you return my patty pans
before the trial next week?

798
01:02:19,833 --> 01:02:23,458
Just in case I don't see you
for a long while afterwards. Ta.

799
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:28,083
"Ta."

800
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:30,917
Fucking mardy old bitch!

801
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:32,708
What is the nature
of their conversation?

802
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:35,250
- Nature of the conversation is...
- Angry?

803
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,875
- Hostile.
- Where is Edith now?

804
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,833
- Edith's heading up the road.
- Heading up the road in which direction?

805
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:42,833
- North-by-northwest.
- North-by-northwest.

806
01:02:43,417 --> 01:02:48,250
She has disappeared
around the corner at 9:26 and a half.

807
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:50,042
This way round...

808
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:53,667
- Oh, alright.
- Mr Francis Hill.

809
01:02:53,792 --> 01:02:57,042
- 52, Sussex Terrace. That is...
- Mark there.

810
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:09,417
- 62, Windsor Street...
- That's all the way here.

811
01:03:09,542 --> 01:03:12,917
- That's out of town, really, innit?
- Did she go all the way to 62, Windsor St.

812
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:16,583
Put that chicken down.
Come on, then, let's get an early start.

813
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:19,875
Now, my girls, you be good.

814
01:03:31,292 --> 01:03:35,958
"Dear Gladys. Thank God
your dad got shot. You smelly bitch.

815
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:39,125
"You think you're so clever,
but you're fucking not."

816
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:44,500
Right, back to work.

817
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:48,250
'"You rank, foxy-arse measle.
You'll soon find yourselves in the dock.'

818
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:51,000
"The lot of you bloody fucking buggers."

819
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:55,208
- Linden Drive as well.
- Oh, what, two in Linden Drive? No?

820
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,875
"You foxy-arse, beetle-headed slut."

821
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,792
"You piss country whore."

822
01:04:02,917 --> 01:04:07,000
'"To the old bastard Mitchells.
You elf-skinned country whores.'

823
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:10,250
"You belong in a cave."
"You foxy-arse rabbit-fuckers."

824
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:15,708
"You mouldy old tart."
"You belong in hell."

825
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:19,750
- Do we get the timings on how she goes...
- I've got all the timings.

826
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:22,750
"You dirty fucking sods."
Hmm...

827
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:42,208
9:04.

828
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,292
Wait...

829
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:53,542
We've got her!

830
01:04:55,417 --> 01:04:56,875
Let's get the postie.

831
01:04:57,708 --> 01:05:00,042
No. To her aunty in Worthing.

832
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,333
Saying she's very sorry she's ill.
Also correcting her spelling of "diabetes".

833
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:07,125
Thank you.

834
01:05:27,042 --> 01:05:29,458
Oh! That's rude.

835
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:34,083
We're out of time.

836
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:38,167
'Trial's tomorrow.
Rose is gonna go down.'

837
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:40,375
Aye, we'll have one of them, please.

838
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:42,208
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

839
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:43,750
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

840
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:46,292
- Is it nice?
- Mm-hmm.

841
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:24,833
Please don't do anything, Rose.

842
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:29,417
If the game's voided, we share the points,
and my winning streak's in tatters.

843
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:33,167
I'm civil.

844
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:37,500
Just never got my invite
to the whist, did I?

845
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:41,500
I don't even know who the fuck she is.

846
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:43,625
Dorothea.

847
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:47,333
Would you like a game, then?

848
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:53,125
Your hands, ladies.

849
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:58,542
What was it?

850
01:07:00,167 --> 01:07:01,750
Edith.

851
01:07:02,917 --> 01:07:04,125
Why?

852
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,125
Rose, you've turned up to Christian
Women's Whist without invitation,

853
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:12,250
carrying liquor, and I might add
with a general attitude of Ireland.

854
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:14,417
Isn't that terrible?

855
01:07:14,542 --> 01:07:17,792
Isn't that just so damnably
fucking wicked of me?

856
01:07:22,458 --> 01:07:26,917
Everyone is going to know...
what I know.

857
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:30,333
I'll pray for you.

858
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:32,125
Oh!

859
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:36,792
I'll see you in court!

860
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,833
Step back!

861
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:51,833
- Order!
- Step back!

862
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,333
Please be seated
for Judge Maccleston.

863
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:07,083
Miss Gooding,
you know why you're here, I suppose.

864
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:11,208
- Is it the letters, by any chance?

865
01:08:11,917 --> 01:08:14,042
Order!

866
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:17,250
Will you take a look
at this list of people,

867
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:20,250
and pick out any names
that you don't know?

868
01:08:32,167 --> 01:08:34,707
I know all of them,
one way or another.

869
01:08:34,832 --> 01:08:37,542
Did you know that
that is the list of all the people

870
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:40,457
- who've been sent poison-pen letters?
- It occurred to me, yes.

871
01:08:40,582 --> 01:08:45,125
Isn't it an extraordinary coincidence
that you know them all?

872
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:48,750
- It would appear that way, yes.
- Thank you, m'lud.

873
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:53,167
You're a mother
to a darling daughter Nancy.

874
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:56,417
- Darling? Some of the time.

875
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:04,667
Erm... and your husband gave his life
for this nation in the war?

876
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:08,582
- Well, he wasn't the only one.
- That must've been unimaginably hard.

877
01:09:08,707 --> 01:09:12,875
It was, yes. But you keep going,
and she's worth it, just about, anyway.

878
01:09:16,707 --> 01:09:21,125
I suppose you'd miss your daughter,
if you went to jail.

879
01:09:24,207 --> 01:09:25,500
So much.

880
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:29,707
So why would you send so many letters
that are so easily traceable back to you?

881
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,957
I wouldn't. That'd be insanity.

882
01:09:32,082 --> 01:09:34,582
After all, you're known
for being somewhat direct.

883
01:09:34,707 --> 01:09:36,707
Why would I send a letter,
when I can just say it?

884
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:39,625
Thank you, m'lud.

885
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:44,875
Thank you for joining us, Miss Swan,

886
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,750
at a time that must be filled
with grief and dismay.

887
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:55,500
Your mother was the treasurer
of the Christian Wives, wasn't she?

888
01:09:55,625 --> 01:10:00,583
Yes, we're all humble servants to the CW
in our family, by the grace of God.

889
01:10:03,417 --> 01:10:06,708
Can you please read this out,
Miss Swan?

890
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,500
No? Alright.

891
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,417
I'll do it.

892
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:30,667
"You fucking old steaming bag
of wet leaking shit!

893
01:10:30,792 --> 01:10:34,292
"Your fucking arse is bigger
than the moon,

894
01:10:34,417 --> 01:10:39,042
"and your cat wants
a good fucking burning, too,

895
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:43,458
- "I reckon, you stupid big stinker!"

896
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:48,375
- "You mangy old titler's turnip..."
- Order!

897
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,875
- Silence in the court!
- Thank you, m'lud.

898
01:10:52,667 --> 01:10:55,292
- "You salty old sod."

899
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,292
Erm...

900
01:10:58,583 --> 01:11:01,500
How does this make you feel,
Miss Swan?

901
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:04,875
I don't know.
Not good, not good at all.

902
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:09,167
M'lud...

903
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:15,625
Is this your handwriting, Miss Swan?

904
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:18,417
It is.

905
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:23,708
And can you confirm that
that is the 'G' you normally write with?

906
01:11:25,042 --> 01:11:26,500
I think so.

907
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:29,333
Not many people write 'Gs' like that,
do they?

908
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:33,000
I suppose not. I like to make an effort
in all my endeavours.

909
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:39,000
And can you examine the 'G'
in exhibit 4-C here?

910
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,333
Is that the same?

911
01:11:45,292 --> 01:11:46,833
- Yes.
- Yes.

912
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:52,125
And can you examine the 'G'
in exhibit 4-D?

913
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:54,000
Is that the same?

914
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:55,750
No.

915
01:11:55,875 --> 01:12:01,542
No. 4-D is Rose Gooding's handwriting

916
01:12:01,667 --> 01:12:04,167
from a letter to the bank.

917
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:10,292
And what would you say if I said
that the 'G' in 4-C,

918
01:12:10,417 --> 01:12:14,708
the same as your 'G',
was in fact the 'G' that appears...

919
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,458
...in the Littlehampton letters?

920
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:22,375
Objection, m'lud! Handwriting
analysis is completely spurious!

921
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,500
- Please! Please!

922
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:26,417
- You...
- Silence!

923
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:29,708
Miss Swan?

924
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:31,500
No.

925
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:34,625
I object, Your Honour.
Who is on trial here?

926
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,750
Trying to establish reasonable
doubt in the accusation of my client.

927
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:43,708
And the 'G' in this letter
is the same. Isn't it?

928
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:47,125
Isn't it?

929
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,958
Yes, but lots of people
probably do those 'Gs'.

930
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:51,625
You just said you didn't think
people would use...

931
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:54,583
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Why is it the same 'G', Miss Swan?

932
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:56,708
I can't explain it,
I can't explain any of it.

933
01:12:56,833 --> 01:13:00,750
- M'lud, Miss Swan is recently bereaved...
- I never meant it to go to trial.

934
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:03,667
Really, I didn't. My father taught me
to do those 'Gs'...

935
01:13:03,792 --> 01:13:05,750
Did you write the letters?

936
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:09,667
- My lord, this is harassing!
- Please don't... don't... don't worry.

937
01:13:10,667 --> 01:13:14,208
Don't worry.
Cos none of it matters really.

938
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:17,042
- I beg your pardon?
- God's is the only justice.

939
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:20,875
All that happens, he makes it so.
All is well. All is well...

940
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,708
Oh!

941
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:29,625
Right, er...
let us convene there... shall we?

942
01:13:31,042 --> 01:13:33,875
Enough of this.
Just expose everything...

943
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:43,583
We would like to recall Miss... Gooding.

944
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:55,042
Miss Gooding... would you say that
the death of your husband at war...

945
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:58,583
...has affected your mind or sanity?

946
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:01,208
- We object!
- We will allow it.

947
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,792
No. I've always been like this.

948
01:14:09,542 --> 01:14:14,292
Do get on to the line of enquiry,
Mr Treading.

949
01:14:17,042 --> 01:14:21,417
Erm... Miss Gooding,
what was your late husband's name?

950
01:14:21,542 --> 01:14:23,458
My husband?
What's that got to do with this?

951
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:27,125
- Just making sure we have all the facts.
- Why does it matter?

952
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:30,542
You... don't know his name?

953
01:14:33,333 --> 01:14:36,500
- Of course I know his name.
- M'lud!

954
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,708
Er... go on.

955
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:43,833
Did your husband die in the war?

956
01:14:49,042 --> 01:14:50,667
Yes.

957
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:55,792
Then why, Miss Gooding,
is there no record whatever

958
01:14:55,917 --> 01:14:58,958
of any marriage of you to anyone

959
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:02,292
in any record that we can find here,

960
01:15:02,417 --> 01:15:05,042
or where you purport
to have come from?

961
01:15:14,542 --> 01:15:17,208
- I don't know.
- Did you lie about this marriage?

962
01:15:17,333 --> 01:15:19,708
- No.
- Did you lie to cover up...

963
01:15:19,833 --> 01:15:21,667
...the illegitimate birth
of your daughter Nancy?

964
01:15:21,792 --> 01:15:23,583
Don't you dare talk about Nancy
that way?

965
01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:25,500
- Is that why you came to Littlehampton?
- No!

966
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:28,917
To cover up the sin
of a child born out of wedlock?

967
01:15:29,042 --> 01:15:30,042
No!

968
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:35,000
To fabricate a sympathetic story
of a fictitious husband

969
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:37,042
who happened to die in the Great War?

970
01:15:37,167 --> 01:15:41,542
To trade off other people's heroism,
off their death?

971
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,958
- What would you do?
- Oh!

972
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:52,042
- Order!

973
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:54,000
Order!

974
01:15:57,958 --> 01:16:00,917
I put it to you
that you are a serial liar.

975
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:05,750
A serial creator of falsehoods
and personas.

976
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:08,250
One: the upright mother.

977
01:16:08,375 --> 01:16:09,792
One: the tart.

978
01:16:09,917 --> 01:16:13,250
And one: the writer
of the Littlehampton letters!

979
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:15,000
What say you?

980
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:22,750
- Silence!

981
01:16:24,208 --> 01:16:25,625
M'lud.

982
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:29,792
We will reconvene on Monday
for the giving of verdict by jury.

983
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:32,958
Good day.

984
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:10,208
Nancy's asleep upstairs.

985
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:17,125
I told you, it was for her sake, Bill.

986
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:20,167
You told my mother.

987
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:25,542
Told her about the moment
you got the news. You told everyone.

988
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:28,500
I had no choice, Bill.
You know I didn't. I had to say...

989
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:31,042
But you didn't have to say it to me!

990
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:34,458
I'm going...

991
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:38,542
I'm going to lose her, Bill.

992
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:41,625
Who's her father?

993
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:46,958
Don't... don't do that.

994
01:17:47,917 --> 01:17:50,333
- Who's her father?
- He was no good to me.

995
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:52,833
I didn't want her seeing that.
I had to leave.

996
01:17:54,167 --> 01:17:56,625
No, Bill, don't go! Please!

997
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,625
Fuck!

998
01:18:01,917 --> 01:18:03,500
No... Nancy!

999
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:07,417
Nancy! What are you doing?
Give it here!

1000
01:18:07,542 --> 01:18:11,833
I don't want you! They all think
you're a loon! Look, just fuck off!

1001
01:18:11,958 --> 01:18:14,125
- What did you say?
- It's your fault, you're a freak!

1002
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:16,875
You're a slut, and you're living in sin!
You belong in jail!

1003
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,875
Nancy, no! I'm sorry!

1004
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,625
I'm sorry.

1005
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:36,125
Nearly there.

1006
01:18:37,042 --> 01:18:39,208
She won't survive all this.

1007
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:44,250
You have to stay calm.
And then things'll get back to normal.

1008
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:47,750
Well...

1009
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:51,875
...almost, eh?

1010
01:18:54,667 --> 01:18:57,292
You don't like the idea
of me leaving this house, do you?

1011
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:04,958
That's why you sent Sidney away,
isn't it?

1012
01:19:08,792 --> 01:19:11,083
I bet you called the CPS on Rose, and all.

1013
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:20,458
I liked him.

1014
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:25,875
I liked them both.

1015
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:30,208
No...

1016
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:34,583
You don't know what you like.

1017
01:19:37,667 --> 01:19:39,458
Now, tidy up...

1018
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:43,458
...and no more of this shit.

1019
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:19,875
Turn around.

1020
01:20:21,458 --> 01:20:25,208
Alright, Dad... what would you do?

1021
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:38,958
No, no, the other way.
Winnie, stay still.

1022
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:44,458
- What?
- Are you busy?

1023
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:47,125
- I'm just boiling an egg.
- Right, come on, then!

1024
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:50,042
What? No, as in, "Yes, I'm busy,
I'm boiling an egg."

1025
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:52,542
Hurry up! I've had an idea.

1026
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:55,375
- Shh!

1027
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:57,458
Yes?

1028
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:59,625
You don't still think
Rose is guilty, do you?

1029
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:01,500
Were you at the trial?

1030
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,125
Come on over to mine, then. Now.

1031
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,958
We'll be boiling eggs.

1032
01:21:07,083 --> 01:21:08,500
Oh.

1033
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:11,917
- I'm not standing for it.
- I should think not.

1034
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:15,208
Come on, then.

1035
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:18,208
Rose is about to go down
for something she didn't do.

1036
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:21,625
- Now, I have a plan...
- No, sorry. Fuck you, no.

1037
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,708
I won't listen to another word
till my egg.

1038
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:26,750
Can you really not wait?
You're such an energetic person usually.

1039
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,875
That's the fucking eggs!

1040
01:21:31,667 --> 01:21:34,000
Hmm. Worth its weight in gold.

1041
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:35,708
'Preciated.

1042
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,208
Apologies.

1043
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:39,750
- Where were we?
- As I was saying...

1044
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:44,708
I have a plan. And the first things
we need are salt...

1045
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:48,292
'Red cabbage, ammonia,
lemon, vinegar.'

1046
01:21:48,417 --> 01:21:50,542
And baking soda.

1047
01:21:50,667 --> 01:21:53,042
I need to dissolve this.
Can I have some of yours?

1048
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:55,542
Yeah, gimme a sec.

1049
01:21:55,667 --> 01:21:58,042
- There's a hair in there.
- That'll dissolve.

1050
01:21:58,167 --> 01:22:00,083
Shall I remove the hair
or keep it in?

1051
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:02,333
- No, leave it in.
- Does that look alright?

1052
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:03,708
Hmm...

1053
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:06,042
While the judge
considers the sentence,

1054
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:08,375
Edith has one more chance
of sending a letter,

1055
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,167
and we'll catch her in the act.

1056
01:22:11,292 --> 01:22:14,042
"You foxy-arse rabbit-fucker.

1057
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:17,958
"God will punish you,
you bloody, fucking, buggered fucks."

1058
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:21,375
The letter must be incontrovertibly hers,
or it won't stick.

1059
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,750
- Jesus, pass the dictionary.
- It means definitely.

1060
01:22:24,875 --> 01:22:26,875
Well, say "definitely" then, Gladys.

1061
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,917
'Hence... the invisible ink.'

1062
01:22:31,042 --> 01:22:33,458
Oh...

1063
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:37,667
"Judge Maccleston,
22, Sea Street, Lewes."

1064
01:23:29,542 --> 01:23:33,042
I'd like to send this
to Lewes, please.

1065
01:23:33,167 --> 01:23:35,583
- Oh! Sorry, guys!
- Oh, really?

1066
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:38,917
Sorry, sorry. I'll take over.

1067
01:23:39,042 --> 01:23:40,708
Thanks so much.

1068
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:03,292
Where am I going, eh?

1069
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:13,208
Shh!

1070
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:24,958
She's going in.

1071
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,958
Oh, Edith!
What a nice surprise.

1072
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:33,542
Hello, Kate.
One two-penny, please.

1073
01:24:37,625 --> 01:24:39,792
The offer still stands with those cuffs.

1074
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:42,917
I think you should stop
asking me that now.

1075
01:24:57,667 --> 01:25:00,083
- Hey!
- Hmm?

1076
01:25:02,083 --> 01:25:04,500
Police are coming.
Go out the back.

1077
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:07,458
- Go on, get out the back.
- Fuck it!

1078
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:12,833
- Ready?
- Ready. You ready?

1079
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:14,708
- I'm ready.
- Ready.

1080
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:16,500
- Knock.
- Knock.

1081
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:19,208
No, do the knock.

1082
01:25:20,167 --> 01:25:22,042
Yeah, I'll do the knock.

1083
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,500
Miss Gooding's been judged
a risk of flight.

1084
01:25:32,625 --> 01:25:35,458
Spedding wants her in a cell
before the trial.

1085
01:25:36,458 --> 01:25:39,792
- Where is she?
- No idea, sir. Sorry.

1086
01:25:40,542 --> 01:25:42,792
She must be in there.

1087
01:25:44,042 --> 01:25:46,208
- Whoo!
- Oi!

1088
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:49,208
- Well, get after her!
- You get after her, Papperwick!

1089
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:51,333
And you! Get after her!

1090
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:54,500
Get her now!

1091
01:26:19,292 --> 01:26:22,333
- Have you seen her?
- That way.

1092
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:24,917
- Come on, keep up!
- Yes, sir!

1093
01:26:25,042 --> 01:26:26,875
Right behind you, sir!

1094
01:26:42,917 --> 01:26:44,583
Oh, fuck!

1095
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:19,625
Go on, Edie.
Post it, won't you?

1096
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,583
Oi! You gonna post that,
you daft old fucker?

1097
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:32,458
- You fucking slippery old fucking dodger!
- What are you doing?

1098
01:27:32,583 --> 01:27:35,083
- I'm just teaching you how to swear proper.
- What are you gonna do?

1099
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,250
Nothing. I just wanted to talk to you.

1100
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:40,000
- I notice you say "foxy-arse" a lot.
- Yeah?

1101
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:42,125
And "piss country whore".
What is that?

1102
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:44,083
I thought you didn't mind
a bit of blue language.

1103
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:46,500
- Bit too rough for you suddenly, is it?
- Nobody swears like that.

1104
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:49,125
- Yes, they do.
- "Foxy-arse, piss country whore"?

1105
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:51,250
- That's really peculiar.
- Well, what would you say?

1106
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:53,125
I dunno, I'd have to sit down
and actually write it,

1107
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:56,083
but to you, I'd probably say that you look
like fucking Queen Victoria shoved

1108
01:27:56,208 --> 01:27:58,833
a fucking nettle up her fucking pussy,
I don't know.

1109
01:27:58,958 --> 01:28:01,042
Well, I think you're a fucking foxy-arse...

1110
01:28:01,167 --> 01:28:04,792
- Does it always have to be foxy-arse?
- You stink of cum and shit!

1111
01:28:04,917 --> 01:28:07,875
And the cakes you make look like they've
fallen out of some sheep's fucking arsehole!

1112
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,167
Better!

1113
01:28:09,292 --> 01:28:12,625
The baking didn't insult me, but...

1114
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:14,208
You've had so many cocks
up your fanny

1115
01:28:14,333 --> 01:28:18,458
that they've set up a fucking stall
and they're selling iced fucking buns!

1116
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:21,708
It's better to be a slut
than a lie, though, Edith.

1117
01:28:24,542 --> 01:28:27,083
No, cos I could post this letter right now,

1118
01:28:27,208 --> 01:28:29,958
and not a single person
in the entire British Empire

1119
01:28:30,083 --> 01:28:32,667
would believe someone like you over me.

1120
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:37,167
- I doubt that very much.
- Do you?

1121
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:43,500
Oh, fuck it.
I was actually beginning to enjoy that.

1122
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:51,167
- Oh!
- Miss Gooding, you're coming with us!

1123
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:53,625
- What's all this now, Woman Officer Moss?
- Oh, Mr Spedding!

1124
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:56,708
- Thank goodness you're here.
- Wait! Did you get that, Winnie?

1125
01:28:56,833 --> 01:28:59,167
Yes, Aunty Gladys!

1126
01:29:00,667 --> 01:29:02,500
- Caught it as it came in.
- Well done.

1127
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:06,167
- What the fuck?
- Could've been either of them.

1128
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:11,833
Watch, as I develop the private mark
on this stamp.

1129
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:38,250
We have a handful of witnesses
of Edith buying this stamp, sir.

1130
01:29:38,375 --> 01:29:41,167
- It is incontrovertibly hers.
- Means definitely.

1131
01:29:48,708 --> 01:29:51,875
I said if you meddled,
I'd be putting you in a cell myself.

1132
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,583
You said we had to find the culprit,
catch her in the act.

1133
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:16,208
Miss Swan...

1134
01:30:18,583 --> 01:30:21,667
I am Police Officer Moss.

1135
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:25,167
I must caution you that anything you say
will be taken down in writing.

1136
01:30:34,958 --> 01:30:38,458
'How do you find
the defendant Rose Gooding?'

1137
01:30:38,583 --> 01:30:41,958
'Our verdict is "not guilty".'

1138
01:30:58,167 --> 01:31:01,333
- Silence!

1139
01:31:01,458 --> 01:31:03,458
Order! Quiet!

1140
01:31:05,542 --> 01:31:09,083
- Order in court!
- Justice! Justice!

1141
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:13,417
Tell you what, come this way,
the crowds...

1142
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,958
Can you tell me why now, Edith?

1143
01:31:24,208 --> 01:31:26,000
Don't think I can, no.

1144
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:38,125
I wish it hadn't been you.

1145
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:41,333
Once they started, I just couldn't stop.

1146
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:50,042
And I thought if I could only be like you,
I'd be alright.

1147
01:31:55,625 --> 01:31:59,208
Good day to you, Rose.
I'll write to you.

1148
01:32:00,792 --> 01:32:03,000
I'll brace myself.

1149
01:32:25,333 --> 01:32:28,292
Oi! Come here.

1150
01:32:29,917 --> 01:32:32,542
- Not you, you feck!

1151
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:48,792
- You alright?
- Yeah.

1152
01:32:51,458 --> 01:32:53,500
Close your eyes.

1153
01:32:57,375 --> 01:32:59,292
Open them.

1154
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,292
You've got your own now,
Nancy Gooding.

1155
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,500
Stand back!

1156
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:21,875
Well, that was a knotty one,
but we got her in the end.

1157
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,542
We did, we did.

1158
01:33:24,417 --> 01:33:26,208
Always had an inkling
it was her, actually.

1159
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:29,292
Me, too. Me, too.
Suspected quite early.

1160
01:33:29,417 --> 01:33:34,667
I actually think I said on day dot...
thereabout.

1161
01:33:34,792 --> 01:33:38,083
Here she comes!
Miss Swan!

1162
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,792
Edith! Edie! Edie!

1163
01:33:43,917 --> 01:33:46,792
- Edie!

1164
01:33:46,917 --> 01:33:49,125
- I know you didn't do it.
- Yes, I did.

1165
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:51,167
- We'll get you bail.
- I did it, Father!

1166
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:52,833
- When you get back...
- I'm not coming back.

1167
01:33:52,958 --> 01:33:55,500
- No, don't say that.
- I'm not coming back home to you ever!

1168
01:33:55,625 --> 01:33:56,875
- Where else are you gonna go?
- Anywhere!

1169
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
- Edie, shut up, shut up.
- Anywhere! Anywhere!

1170
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:03,000
Oh, fuck off, you pasty old shrivelled
old piss bastard fucking old cunt!

1171
01:34:03,125 --> 01:34:04,958
Ooh!
