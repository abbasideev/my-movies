00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,375
How many times
has Mom told you to stay put?

4
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:32,500
What happened?

5
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,375
Just mind your p's and rest.

6
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,250
Her fever is back.
Meg, go down and get a towel for her.

7
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,458
I saw smoke.

8
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,750
I saw black smoke.

9
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,916
A ferry caught fire as it came to dock.

10
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,041
They say hundreds dead.

11
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,333
Mostly women.

12
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:06,791
Why women?

13
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,791
Thirty feet from shore,
and they wouldn't jump.

14
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,458
- They stayed on the boat.
- Why?

15
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,875
I don't understand.
Why did they stay on the boat?

16
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,000
They can't swim.

17
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,875
They're charging the German butchers
more for meat.

18
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,166
Thirty cents a pound west of the 17th.

19
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,000
They're running us off with the Irish.

20
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,583
Dr. Weiss is upstairs with Trudy.

21
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,916
Meg, take Henry across the street
to your Uncle Jan.

22
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:26,500
- We're staying.
- Yeah, we're staying.

23
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,208
Some water, Meg. Fresh water, please.

24
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,291
The measles have taken hold of her.

25
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:40,958
The fever won't break.

26
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,375
Trudy fought hard. A strong girl.

27
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,666
But she can't fight the measles.

28
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,583
How long?

29
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,791
Tonight, Meg.

30
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,000
I'll stay with her.

31
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,500
But the next time I come down the stairs,
she will be gone.

32
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:54,041
I went down to the docks, Henry.
Watched them count the body bags.

34
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:56,291
The women from that ship
were from this neighborhood.

35
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:58,999
A church group.

36
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,125
This is not the time.

37
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,500
This is the time.

38
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,208
I've decided
the children will learn to swim.

39
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:07,416
You decided, Gertie? You decided?

40
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:09,625
They could've walked to shore.

41
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,458
Henry Jr., yes, we will teach him.

42
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,625
But not Meg.

43
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,978
It's indecent for a girl.
What will people say?

44
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,916
They will say she didn't stand
on a burning ship.

45
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:53,708
Dr. Weiss fell asleep upstairs.
Is he okay?

46
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:59,041
His snoring woke me. Is there any cheese?

47
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,375
Oh, I'm starving.

48
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,166
Trudy.

49
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,208
Trudy, you're okay.

50
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:36,375
Head up! Paddle faster! Like a dog!

51
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,208
{\an8}If Meg swims, I swim.

52
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,249
{\an8}Why do you need to swim so badly?

53
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,375
You won't let me play stickball.
You won't let me box.

54
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:55,416
Box! Keep your voice down.

55
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,583
If you swim around the pier,
you get a free hot dog at Nathan's.

56
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:02,624
But little girls don't swim around things.

57
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,666
The doctor said water will hurt your ears.

58
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,250
So find another hobby.

59
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,791
Here.

60
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,208
Five cents for the hot dog.

61
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,458
I don't wanna buy it. I wanna win it.

62
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,708
I will swim!

93
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,458
Of course. My father sold trout.

00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,916
Okay. Good.

95
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,125

There's no reason to be scared. I got you.

97
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,833
Nice and slow.

What are you waiting for?

99
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,624
No! Trudy, wait!

100
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,458

No, wait!

Trudy! Wait!

103
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,624
- Trudy!
- Meg!

104
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,916
- Race you 'round the pier!
- Get ready to lose!

105
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,749
You want another?

106
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,291
I can't eat four hot dogs.

107
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,000
Suit yourself.

108
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:37,291
I'll be right back.

109
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,874
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

110
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:47,708
these boys represent the best of America,
athletes of the highest order,

111
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:50,833
who will compete in six races today.

112
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,645
Some will go to the Olympics in Paris.
Getting going in just a moment.

113
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:59,791
- Meg, that boy is staring at you.
- Quiet. You don't know your onions.

114
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:01,791
I know my onions. I love onions.

115
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:02,916
On your marks!

116
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,416
Stop looking at him.

117
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:10,916
Ready!

118
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,541
Meg, you should join the next race.
They don't look that fast.

119
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:20,999
I think you could win.

120
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,250
Sorry, girls. Boys only.
Women's pool's over there.

121
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:25,332
She could beat them.

122
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:29,208
I've seen her dog paddle.
Maybe she could race a German shepherd.

123
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,625
I've decided Meg and Trudy
will join a swim team.

124
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,040
A what?

125
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,541
They will join a team
to race with other girls.

126
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:51,665
You mean Henry will join.

127
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:55,875
No, not Henry.
He hates to swim. The girls.

128
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,666
Yes. Wonderful.

129
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,958
A swim team for Meg and Trudy.
You go ahead.

130
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,999
What's so funny?

131
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,583
For girls? There's no such thing.

132
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,208
That's right. Strong arms.

133
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:35,083
Come on, Ruth. Kick those feet.

134
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,582
Good.

135
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:42,708
Arms and legs kick together
at 28 beats per minute. Not 26, not 27.

136
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,666
- What are they doing?
- I have no idea.

137
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,250
Twenty-eight beat American crawl,

138
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,791
a stroke invented by Louis J. Handley,
fastest stroke there is.

139
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:58,125
Is Mr. Handley here?

140
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,957
I wish to speak to him about my girls.

141
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,958
Ah, you wanna speak to the boss?
The man in charge?

142
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,165
Yes.

143
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,500
You know most men believe that
women who exercise will harm themselves?

144
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:10,958
That we're too weak to run, swim, compete?

145
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,124
That our hearts will explode?

146
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,437
And yet in nature,
it's the lioness who hunts,

147
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,750
while the lions sit around
on their big asses.

148
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:23,291
And it's the queen bee who rules the hive.

149
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,833
See my point?

150
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,375
I'm Charlotte Epstein. This is my team.

151
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,500
Call me Eppy.

152
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:38,083
And this is Meg and Trudy.
They won a free hot dog.

153
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,758
I can take the older one.
She's got potential.

154
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,624
And Trudy?

155
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,958
She swims like a horse
with two broken legs.

156
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,624
Quite possibly three.

157
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,874
You see the way she fights the water?

158
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,333
We call that drowning.

159
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,457
Trudy is very strong and has no fear.

160
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,791
She swims alone in the ocean,
goes as far as the boys.

161
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,958
Feet! Kick your feet, child.

162
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,708
She's a good girl,
will do exactly what you say.

163
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:16,625
She wants to be like her sister.

164
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,624
Part of my agreement here
is to feed the boiler.

165
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:26,250
You have to keep it running all day.
Bring in coal for the stoker.

166
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,082
Sixty-pound bags.

167
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:32,125
If Trudy helps out,
she can practice in the pool after hours.

168
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,125
Trudy will help with the furnace.

169
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:40,083
Congratulations, your girls just joined
the Women's Swimming Association.

170
00:15:40,084 --> 00:15:42,833
That'll be two dollars a week.
Will that be a problem?

171
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:44,416
No.

172
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,250
Absolutely not.

173
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:51,291
Two dollars to swim? Swimming is free.

174
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,583
I am saving money to buy a telephone.

175
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,125
- A telephone?
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:15:57,126 --> 00:15:58,208
For what reason?

177
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,875
I'm not sure, but I want one.

178
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:02,875
I see.

179
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,166
What are you doing?

180
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:14,333
If you won't pay, I will.

181
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,750
What about dinner?

182
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,333
I'm not hungry. Thank you.

183
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,708
<i>- Herr</i> Daniel.
- Gertrude!

184
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,760
All right. Let's go. Let's keep it up!

185
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,208
Reach, Meg. Keep reaching.

186
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,375
- Well done, Meg.
- Okay, ladies. Over here.

187
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,208
Trudy. Oh, you got
a little dirt on your chin.

188
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,625
Why don't you run to the corner
and buy us a sinker?

189
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,791
We said, go to the corner, and get us
a doughnut. You hear us, boiler girl?

190
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:34,124
Hey!

191
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,457
Leave her alone.

192
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,957
What? She needs you to fight?

193
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:40,000
Trudy beat measles.
You goons wouldn't stand a chance.

194
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:41,791
Back in the water, girls.

195
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,790
You had measles?

196
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,832
It went to my ears, but I hear just fine.

197
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,916
They tell you not to go in the water?
That you could go deaf?

198
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:55,666
Oh, yeah.
They told me. But it won't stop me.

199
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,125
Go home, Trudy.
The other girls laugh at you.

200
00:17:59,126 --> 00:18:00,562
Why don't you fight back?

201
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:02,000
You won't let me in the pool.

202
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,207
All right. Listen up.

203
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,499
We're gonna start something new.

204
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,791
Every day, you'll race each other.

205
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:22,416
Last place feeds the boiler.

206
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,750
Starting now.

207
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:42,916
Twenty-eight beats a minute, Trudy.
Like music.

208
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:51,000
<i>♪ All around the water tank

209
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:58,208

213
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,458
Boiler duty.

214
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,291
Come on, Trudy!

215
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,916
- Go, Trudy! Go!
- Keep it up, ladies!

216
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,645
Sandy, come on!

217
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:45,374
Strong arms!

218
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:49,791
Trudy! Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

219
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,375
Yes!

220
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,833
Ruth, feed the boiler.

221
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:06,083
Learn to kick your feet,
and you'll never leave the pool again.

222
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,750
Hey, look what I drew in the sand!

223
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,875
"Burgess spent 22 hours
and 35 minutes in the water."

224
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:57,833
Twenty-two hours in that water?
It's not possible.

225
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,125
Meg!
Meg, there's gonna be a race next week.

226
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:08,541
The best swimmers
are coming from Australia.

227
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:10,374
There's a race every week.

228
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,208
Not the boys, Meg. Us.

229
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,833
Ladies and gentlemen,
the American Olympic Union

230
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:23,124
welcomes the champion swimming girls
from Australia.

231
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:27,687
Here to compete in today's exhibition
against our four brave American girls.

232
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:32,250
Now, remember, these graceful birds
have all been trained by professionals,

233
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:35,500
which is why we are allowing them
in the men's pool.

234
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:37,395
Coming through, boys. Clear the way.

235
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,655
All eyes on the Australian dolls!

236
00:21:39,656 --> 00:21:41,916
Meg! You have the speed
to stay with Kellerman.

237
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:43,540
When she breaks, you break with her.

238
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,041
- What should I do, Mrs. Epstein?
- Stay out of their way.

239
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:51,083
Ladies, there are lifeguards on both ends
for your safety,

240
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:53,916
and a medical doctor is standing by.

241
00:21:56,583 --> 00:22:00,375
The girls will race four laps, 200 meters.

242
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,083
On your marks. Ready.

243
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,874
Come on! Strong arms!

244
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:24,625
The Australians take the lead
in front of Meg Ederle.

245
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,375
These birds are going very fast.

246
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,541
Whoo-hoo!

247
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:46,625
Three laps to go.

248
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,458
You can do it! Keep going!

249
00:22:51,459 --> 00:22:52,833
Strong arms, Meg!

250
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:59,500
And it appears to be neck and neck between
Annette Kellerman and Meg Ederle.

251
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,666
Head down!

252
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,791
Kick! Kick, kick, kick, kick, kick.

253
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:39,291
There is one girl gaining.
An American in the center lane.

254
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,791
Kick those feet!

255
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,208
Whoo!

256
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,207
Go, go!

257
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,458
The final lap.

258
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,040
Trudy?

259
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,125
Who's she?

260
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:10,333
The American, Trudy Ederle,
has moved into second place.

261
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,083
Kick! Kick those feet!

262
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,540
Trudy!

263
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:40,083
The winner is Trudy Ederle!

264
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:46,666
You did it!

265
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,000
<i>♪ Yes, we have no bananas today ♪</i>

266
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:59,333
Trudy's name's in the paper.

267
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,500
<i>♪ We have string beans and onions ♪</i>

268
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,041
Yes. Next to the dead people.

269
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:13,291
Trudy Ederle
now holds the state record for 100 meters!

270
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:28,250
And the winner is... Trudy Ederle!

271
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:43,000
<i>A new national record
for the unstoppable Trudy Ederle!</i>

272
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:47,583
<i>Ederle wins again!</i>

273
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:58,375
Come on!

274
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,291
- Whoo!
- 4:28!

275
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:11,500
Your daughter Trudy
has the record in 200 meters swimming.

276
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:13,000
What record?

277
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,541
World.

278
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:28,500
She won a blue ribbon.

279
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:32,083
- What, like a cow?
- Get back to work.

280
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:46,749
Trudy is a very gifted athlete...

281
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,958
Does she bake? We'd like
to get a photo of her with a pie.

282
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,082
Do Germans eat pie?

283
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:54,041
She holds four world records.
Nobody has ever done this before.

284
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:56,082
She'd probably do really well
in a dance marathon.

285
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:58,915
Oh, has she considered that?
Does she have a boyfriend?

286
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:03,708
I had to kick them out.
In front of the store.

287
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,540
Ah, where have you been, girls?

288
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,540
Come here, Trudy. Come. Come here.

289
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:11,500
This is Horst.
Just arrived from Heidelberg.

290
00:27:11,501 --> 00:27:14,083
His father is cousins with Rolfe's wife.

291
00:27:14,084 --> 00:27:15,833
Rolfe's cart in front of the store.

292
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:16,957
The nut peddler.

293
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:20,708
Ah, it's very delicious nuts. His English
is not so good, but he's learning.

294
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,540
Nuts.

295
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:26,541
Horst is going to stay for supper.

296
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:28,166
Nuts.

297
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:34,457
<i>Mutter,</i> you have to stop this.

298
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,040
What's happening?

299
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,001
- They're trying to arrange a marriage.
- For who?

300
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:39,749
You and Horst.

301
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,291
- What?
- Shh!

302
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,291
But Meg is the oldest.
Why has he never brought a boy for her?

303
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:49,208
- Because Meg's arrangement has been made.
- What?

304
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,124
That boy from the Durshley family
<i>aus</i> Hamburg.

305
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:55,666
His name is Karl.
He'll arrive as a butcher's apprentice.

306
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,750
You think I'd marry a butcher?

307
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:04,166
Your father only knows the old ways.

308
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,291
Like how I was taught to gut a chicken.

309
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:12,583
You cut off the neck at the backbone,
then get rid of the head.

310
00:28:12,584 --> 00:28:15,208
You see? All gone.

311
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:19,166
Meg, what's happening?
Is she telling us to kill him?

312
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:23,000
She's telling us to gut the chicken.

313
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:37,958
I'll wait by the end of the pier,
Trudy, okay?

314
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:39,333
Got it.

315
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,083
Trudy.

316
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:52,166
I... am... Horst.

317
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,749
Yes. Horst.

318
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,290
Horst. Trudy.

319
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:03,457
- Trudy! Trudy! Help me!
- Meg?

320
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:07,416
- I slipped, Trudy. Don't let me fall!
- What are you doing? Take my hand!

321
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:10,541
I can't hold on much longer.
I don't wanna die.

322
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:26,875
Nuts. Nuts! Nuts!

323
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,749
Nuts!

324
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,374
Nuts!

325
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:35,125
Nuts!

326
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:38,750
Nuts!

327
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:42,165
That's it. Okay.

328
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:45,708
That's it. No swimming for both of you.
One month!

329
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:51,666
Two days! No swimming for two days!

330
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,082
Horst is a good boy.

331
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,166
Who do you think will marry
a girl like Trudy?

332
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,895
She left school because she was sick,
she has trouble hearing.

333
00:29:58,896 --> 00:30:01,541
What kind of future does she have?
Who will take care of her?

334
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:06,083
What's wrong?

335
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:08,750
Nothing.

336
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,458
We'll always be together, Trudy.

337
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,041
Promise?

338
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:18,958
Promise.

339
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:26,250
Nuts! Nuts!

340
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:27,333
Get your nuts!

341
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:32,708
Peanuts! Walnuts! Nuts!

342
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,541
- Henry Ederle?
- Yes.

343
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,333
James Sullivan, AOU.

344
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:51,499
After months of, uh, consideration,

345
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,666
I have decided to send six female swimmers
to the Olympic Games in Paris, France.

346
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,540
Congratulations.

347
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:01,415
Okay, why?
Their place is here at the butcher shop.

348
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:05,291
Sir, we will show the world that America
is not afraid to let women compete.

349
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:08,416
As long as it's not archery.
Archery is inherently dangerous...

350
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:09,958
And when it's over? Then what?

351
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,500
She'll win us four gold medals.

352
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Trudy, we're expecting
great things from you in Paris.

353
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,926
- Have you ever had mousse?
- What about Meg?

354
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:24,333
There were only a few spots. I'm sorry.

355
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:33,000
Trudy, win four gold medals,
and the world will be your oyster.

356
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,333
Where were you?

357
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:54,790
I was with Trudy.

358
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,875
She's been home for hours.

359
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,541
You think I don't know what's happening?

360
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:03,958
What whiskey smells like? Who is he?

361
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,041
I don't know what you're talking about.

362
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,750
- What's wrong?
- Please stay out of this, Trudy.

363
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:13,957
Drinking, home past midnight.

364
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:16,750
Do you know what people will say
about my daughter?

365
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,208
- What's his name?
- Chip.

366
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:23,208
His name is Chip Anderson.

367
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:28,915
He wants to marry me.

368
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:31,125
You think a boy named Anderson
will marry you?

369
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:34,291
The daughter of a German butcher?

370
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:36,249
You will not see him again.

371
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,687
It's my job to protect this family,
my children.

372
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:41,125
I'm not Trudy.
You can't tell me what to do.

373
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,500
Meg.

374
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:49,333
Meg. Meg!

375
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,166
Meg!

376
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:56,208
- Tell them you're sorry!
- I'm not sorry!

377
00:32:56,833 --> 00:33:00,375
We'll talk to the men at the Olympics.
You and I can go to Paris together!

378
00:33:00,376 --> 00:33:02,250
You still don't understand.

379
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,083
They don't want me.

380
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,375
I'm not good enough.

381
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:11,791
Wait. Wait.

382
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,000
I can't do it alone.

383
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,916
You have nothing to worry about.

384
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:22,416
- You're the fastest woman in the world.
- And you're my sister.

385
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,208
Said we'd always be together.

386
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:26,958
Please. Come with me.

387
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:29,458
I'm not going anywhere.

388
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:33,791
I'm sorry, Trudy.

389
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:44,374
Ladies, this is Jabez Wolffe.

390
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:46,707
He'll be coaching the women's swim team.

391
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,583
- The floor is yours, Mr. Wolffe.
- Thank you.

392
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:51,124
Right.

393
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:54,083
It's my job to protect you
on the ship to France.

394
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:57,833
To make sure there is no contact
with the male athletes.

395
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,625
To that end, you won't leave your rooms
without alerting your escorts.

396
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:04,541
- Escorts?
- Nuns.

397
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,083
They'll be standing guard
outside your cabins.

398
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:13,375
I expect all of you to memorize
the US Olympic Decorum Pamphlet,

399
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,166
specifically chapter two.

400
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,500
"What to Do if You're Approached
by a Frenchman."

401
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,875
Also, women should only swim
the breaststroke.

402
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:27,916
The stroke I used
to swim the English Channel 21 times.

403
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:30,000
Did you ever make it across, Mr. Wolffe?

404
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:35,875
One day I will.

405
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:16,791
Come on! Let's go! Go! Fifty more!

406
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:18,791
Got 20 more seconds to go!

407
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,041
- Mr. Wolffe, it's been over a week.
- Oh, geez.

408
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,333
We need to train.

409
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,332
Back to your rooms, girls.
I'm not feeling well.

410
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:53,291
The men swim in the tub all day.
They run laps on deck, lift dumbbells.

411
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:56,665
My responsibility to keep you safe.

412
00:35:56,666 --> 00:36:00,333
There are 300 men on this ship,
another 50 on the crew.

413
00:36:00,334 --> 00:36:02,415
And some of them are Norwegian.

414
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:05,645
Our cabins are
next to the engine rooms. We can't sleep.

415
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:08,874
And they bring us nothing
but bread and cheese twice a day.

416
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,708
I'll let you walk the deck a few times
when the men are eating in the ballroom.

417
00:36:12,709 --> 00:36:15,333
What about Paris?
Do we get to train there?

418
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:17,958
You'll get your chance
when the gun sounds.

419
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,270
Concentrate!

420
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:59,750
Gold medal for Bauer.
Silver, Kellerman. Bronze for Ederle.

421
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:10,375
Gold medal for Kurtz. Silver medal
for Stromburg. Bronze for Gilmore.

422
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:25,708
<i>This is Harry Horlick with
a report from the Olympic Games in Paris.</i>

423
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:27,749
<i>American champion Johnny Weissmuller</i>

424
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,332
<i>won his third gold medal
for the United States</i>

425
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,250
<i>- on the last day of competition.</i>
- What about Trudy?

426
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,583
<i>A hero for the ages is coming home.</i>

427
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:58,375
Camera rolling, please.
Ready for when Johnny comes out.

428
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:02,916
Johnny!

429
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:04,165
Johnny!

430
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:06,966
- Give us a wave!
- Big smile for the camera!

431
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:33,666
Mom made <i>Berliner</i> with jam for you.

432
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,707
When will you race again?

433
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,875
They say they won't let women swim again.

434
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:45,790
No more funding. No more trainers.

435
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:50,166
It's over. From now on, I work downstairs.

436
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:53,166
So you'll be here for Meg's wedding?

437
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,208
What did you say?

438
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,625
How could you get engaged and not tell me?

439
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:14,583
You were gone. It happened so fast.

440
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:19,000
I want you to be my maid of honor, Trudy.

441
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,582
How did you convince them?

442
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:24,708
Suddenly nobody cares that
you're about to be Meg Anderson?

443
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,416
Anderson?

444
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:31,791
They didn't tell you?

445
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:36,208
It's not Anderson. It's Durshley.

446
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,083
I'm marrying Karl Durshley.

447
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:40,791
The butcher?

448
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,750
You need to call it off.
Tell them you changed your mind.

449
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,874
I have to marry Karl.

450
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,291
That was part of the deal.

451
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:50,540
Part of the deal?

452
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:52,416
It's the reason he came to America.

453
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:53,790
You're not part of any deal.

454
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,250
What do you think happens
to girls around here?

455
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,083
What do you think will happen to you?

456
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:03,833
Your future, it's already been decided.

457
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:09,541
Dad put all of my trophies in a box.

458
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:12,500
You'll be okay.

459
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,708
- I promise...
- Maybe if I'd have won...

460
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:17,625
None of it matters, Trudy.

461
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,666
Do you think people around here
care if you win or lose?

462
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:26,750
Two girls from the butcher's shop?
We can't win.

463
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:28,915
People, th...

464
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:31,000
They don't want us to be heroes.

465
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,750
They don't want us to be anything.

466
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:39,375
I'm sorry, Trudy. I tried.

467
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:44,291
My hero was you.

468
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,416
Bare legs are not allowed, ladies.

469
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:20,500
Let's go.

470
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:21,666
Let's go.

471
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:56,375
Look, it's Trudy. It's her.

472
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:00,375
Excuse me, miss? Are you Trudy?

473
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:01,999
Yes.

474
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,458
I just wanted to say that
because of you, they let me swim.

475
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:13,040
Are you fast?

476
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:17,791
I once beat my brother in a race,
but he says it never happened.

477
00:42:17,792 --> 00:42:18,916
That it's impossible.

478
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:22,541
But it did happen, didn't it?
The impossible.

479
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,540
Sure did.

480
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:26,916
One day, I wanna be just like you.

481
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:32,000
- You really got to speak to her!
- She's my hero.

482
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:47,207
Today, the Coney Island
Vaudeville Extravaganza

483
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:52,250
presents a swimming exhibition
from Englishman Bill Burgess!

484
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:55,916
- Get off me!
- Only the second man to conquer

485
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:59,291
the treacherous waters
of the English Channel.

486
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:02,749
That water of the Channel
is close to frozen,

487
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,375
currents strong enough
to throw a steamer against the rocks!

488
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:10,291
So welcome a true living legend
as he comes to shore!

489
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:16,708
For only a penny, you can shake the hand
of the greatest swimmer on Earth,

490
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:20,791
Bill Burgess!

491
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:23,291
Hey, Bill!

492
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,624
That man is naked.

493
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:33,625
Uh, nobody panic! Nobody panic!

494
00:43:33,626 --> 00:43:38,708
Ladies and gentlemen of America!

495
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:44,624
I swim in the buff.

496
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,791
- Stay back, stay back.
- Thank you. Thank you.

497
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,750
Get down!
You're under arrest for indecency.

498
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:58,957
Get him. Get him up.

499
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:01,707
- All right, that's it. Let's go.
- No! Hey!

500
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:04,458
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, I want me bloody money!

501
00:44:04,459 --> 00:44:06,125
I'm not going... I want me money!

502
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:10,500
Give me me money!
I've... I've signed a contract!

503
00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:24,208
You look so beautiful.

504
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:28,290
How far is it across?

505
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:30,208
Meg, it's your wedding day.

506
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:32,624
How far is it from France to England?

507
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:34,208
You don't know your onions.

508
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:36,416
I know you've thought about it.

509
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:38,625
Doesn't matter. We can't win.

510
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:42,250
Well, we won free hot dogs.

511
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:45,291
And in case you forgot...
...there were onions.

512
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:52,708
It's 21 miles across.

513
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:55,541
Sounds like fun.

514
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:58,291
Do you think I could do it?

515
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,041
Do you think I can?

516
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,749
You bet your ass.

517
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:07,041
- Did you just curse?
- No.

518
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:08,708
You said ass.

519
00:46:09,916 --> 00:46:10,916
Hmm.

520
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:15,083
Well, I'm going to dance with my husband.

521
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:19,000
Where are you going, Trudy?

526
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:41,540
Yeah, you got it!

527
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:43,583
Twenty-eight strokes, Vera.

528
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:47,583
Do you think it's possible?

529
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,000
I asked to coach the women's Olympic team.
They told me I could be chaperone.

530
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:57,083
- They're not ready for us.
- What if I'm ready?

531
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:02,041
You know what'll happen when you fail?
When you get hurt?

532
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:07,500
They'll use that failure to shut us down,
to kick every girl out of my pool.

533
00:47:07,501 --> 00:47:10,208
And what if I make it? What then?

534
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,833
Then they got a serious problem.

535
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:23,125
...nobody has ever called.

536
00:47:23,126 --> 00:47:24,833
I will be ready.

537
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:35,791
I've decided to swim the English Channel.

538
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:57,832
What do you mean?

539
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:01,250
I'm going to swim the English Channel.
Please pass the bread.

540
00:48:01,251 --> 00:48:03,833
- No, I'm saying...
- I wasn't asking.

541
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,750
I've fought against
female athletics most of my life.

542
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:15,124
I voted against women
competing in the Olympics.

543
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,750
Yes, Mr. Sullivan. I'm aware
of the fact that you're a <i>Temper Kop.</i>

544
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:22,874
What is that?

545
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:24,708
Yiddish for "imbecile."

546
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:29,083
And yet you come here and ask me to pay
for Trudy to swim the Channel,

547
00:48:29,084 --> 00:48:30,749
after she embarrassed us in Paris.

548
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:34,583
She didn't train for three weeks
because of you. You failed her.

549
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:38,166
You need Trudy, Mr. Sullivan.
Think of the publicity.

550
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,999
The Channel is 21 miles across.

551
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,790
Currents changing every few hours.

552
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:48,375
To fight those currents,
she'd have to swim close to 50 miles.

553
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:51,666
The water is freezing.

554
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:56,625
Storms blow in without warning
and bring waves 20 feet high.

555
00:48:56,626 --> 00:48:58,749
There's jellyfish and sharks,

556
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,541
even the occasional unexploded mine
left over from the war.

557
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:06,166
I honestly believe she'll die
in that water.

558
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:08,290
I don't need that publicity.

559
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:09,915
Now, if you'll excuse me,

560
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:12,500
I have to meet my mother for dinner
in the Jersey Highlands.

561
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:15,540
It's her 88th birthday.

562
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:20,208
She's requested Penner's for lobster,
a table on the water.

563
00:49:20,209 --> 00:49:22,625
What if I meet you there, Mr. Sullivan?

564
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:25,207
I don't understand.

565
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:29,333
You drive your car,
and I'll swim from New York to New Jersey.

566
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:32,165
You wanna swim to Jersey?

567
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:35,832
It's about seven miles across
the lower bay from Rockaway Point.

568
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:39,500
We'll make a deal. If I make it,
the AOU pays my way to the Channel.

569
00:49:39,501 --> 00:49:43,000
Passage, trainer, guide boat, everything.

570
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:47,937
Seven miles. In how many hours?

571
00:49:47,938 --> 00:49:50,000
- Five.
- I'll do it in four.

572
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:52,875
Three.

573
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:57,750
Do it in three, and we'll sponsor you.

574
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,708
And dinner will be on me.

575
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:14,083
Right now, it's 6:30.
Ride the evening tide. Don't fight it.

576
00:50:14,084 --> 00:50:15,958
Keep the sunset on your right shoulder.

577
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:18,833
We don't have a guide boat.
You need to watch for barges.

578
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:21,208
Use the Highlands lighthouse
as your guide.

579
00:50:21,209 --> 00:50:22,957
If you get lost, follow the buoys.

580
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:25,290
There's moorings all the way to Jersey.

581
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:27,916
- What's the name of the restaurant?
- Penner's.

582
00:50:27,917 --> 00:50:29,416
That way. Go!

583
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:32,500
Come on. Let's go.

584
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,583
Thank you.

585
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:56,375
You're not too cold, are you, Mom?

586
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,250
Come on.

587
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:45,625
Oh, darling. Thank you.

588
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:57,791
Sorry, Mrs. Epstein. A deal's a deal.

589
00:51:58,291 --> 00:52:02,166
It's 9:30. Her time is up.

590
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:05,875
How was dinner, Mr. Sullivan?

591
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:12,750
Two hours and 56 minutes.
Your men will verify the time.

592
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:22,041
- Mmm.
- Mmm!

593
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:29,125
Where were you?

594
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:33,541
If your father finds out
you're home this late...

595
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:34,916
I was swimming.

596
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:38,541
Swimming? At night?

597
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:40,499
To New Jersey.

598
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,666
I swam from New York to Jersey.

599
00:52:44,125 --> 00:52:45,750
Did you say New Jersey?

600
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:50,083
I leave for the Channel next week.

601
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:57,833
You are my child.
And the thing you love most, it...

602
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:01,083
it terrifies me.

603
00:53:06,791 --> 00:53:09,625
I... I... I can't stay here.

604
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:12,333
I look at Meg, the other girls...

605
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:15,208
I don't know how to be like them.

606
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:27,791
I had a twin sister.

607
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:32,208
She drowned when we were seven.

608
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,250
What was her name?

609
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:39,416
Pearl.

610
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:49,458
I won't be there
if something happens to you.

611
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:54,500
I can't imagine where you get the courage.

612
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,250
From you.

613
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:15,250
Tell me what it's like
out there in the dark.

614
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:20,711
Well, tonight, while I was swimming,
a harbor seal followed me.

615
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:22,541
A seal followed you?

616
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:26,290
I'm pretty sure.

617
00:54:26,291 --> 00:54:29,833
Not followed, Trudy. Chased.

618
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:44,875
Thank you. One day, I will.

619
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:51,125
Trudy, I'd like you to meet the man
I've selected to train you.

620
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:55,458
Charlotte Epstein is going to train me.

621
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:58,624
A woman training a woman? Ha.

622
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:01,625
Like a lion taming a lion. Bad idea.

623
00:55:01,626 --> 00:55:02,707
She's my coach.

624
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:04,916
Mr. Wolffe is your coach, Trudy.

625
00:55:07,541 --> 00:55:08,958
Or we don't sponsor.

626
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:13,666
Don't worry, darling.
I'll take care of you in that big ocean.

627
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:29,458
Trudy!

628
00:55:40,958 --> 00:55:42,708
Wait here. I'll get your key.

629
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:57,666
We're drinking
to our friend Rudolph Vittali.

630
00:55:57,667 --> 00:55:59,749
He died this week trying to cross.

631
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,875
He got lost in the darkness
of the shallows.

632
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:08,750
See, this is a place
where men come to risk everything.

633
00:56:08,751 --> 00:56:09,958
So...

634
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:19,250
What gives a woman
the right to come to such a place?

635
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:28,875
To Vittali! A great swimmer.

636
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:35,750
Trudy.

637
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:41,041
Hmm.

638
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:50,916
Trudy! Breaststroke, right?

639
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:54,791
It's not a race.

640
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:08,853
Slow and steady.

641
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:26,624
<i>News coming from Europe,</i>

642
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:29,707
<i>where Trudy Ederle
trains to swim the English Channel.</i>

643
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:33,790
<i>The odds of her making it have been
set by Lloyd's of London at 100-to-1.</i>

644
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:38,000
<i>Babe Ruth predicted today that this is
one long shot that will not come in.</i>

645
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:40,500
Babe Ruth is as German as we are.

646
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,540
He can suck an egg.

647
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:45,141
<i>...whether this type of swim should be
considered sport for women.</i>

648
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:55,791
How many times have you tried?

649
00:57:58,208 --> 00:57:59,915
Twelve.

650
00:57:59,916 --> 00:58:02,165
Once I came within a few miles,

651
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:05,541
but the tide from the Atlantic
came in sideways, oof.

652
00:58:06,458 --> 00:58:08,374
Pushed me toward the shallows.

653
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:10,291
The last obstacle before England.

654
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:13,082
They saved me, you know,

655
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:17,458
before I went into that, that
hell on earth, where the current, it just...

656
00:58:17,459 --> 00:58:19,916
holds you like the hand of God.

657
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:22,833
It's impossible to break.

658
00:58:24,916 --> 00:58:26,583
They're rooting against us, Trudy.

659
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:29,375
They want the water to win.

660
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,666
I'm rooting for you, Benji.

661
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:34,833
And I you.

662
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,458
I swam three hours this morning.
I'm starving.

663
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:11,666
You've got to look good for the papers.
Eat like a lady.

664
00:59:11,667 --> 00:59:13,291
Eppy told me I need more than this!

665
00:59:13,292 --> 00:59:14,833
Lower your voice.

666
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:19,375
I'll get you more fruit.

667
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:35,208
And here it is!

668
00:59:35,209 --> 00:59:37,665
Benji, take a look outside.

669
00:59:37,666 --> 00:59:41,083
Looks like you might have some company
for your swim tomorrow.

670
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:47,083
I'm guessing that's just the baby.

671
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:54,249
Fruit.

672
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:55,415
You didn't have to do that.

673
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:58,125
He won't make a fool of me,
and neither will you.

Yeah?

689
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:23,250
She's making a fool of me, Mr. Sullivan.
Laughing, singing in my face.

690
01:01:23,251 --> 01:01:24,374
I won't stand for it.

691
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:27,770
People are betting on your girl.
The odds have come way down.

692
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:31,166
She's not my girl. She's yours.
This charade is your doing.

693
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:35,415
I've spent years
defending the purity of sport,

694
01:01:35,416 --> 01:01:40,833
watched them give women the vote,
but nobody can give them this.

695
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:42,582
Am I right?

696
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:44,916
A-A woman? Out there?

697
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:49,166
She won't get past the seventh mile.
Bet on it.

698
01:01:56,041 --> 01:01:57,207
Benji?

699
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:59,458
Get the doctor! He's frozen stiff!

700
01:01:59,459 --> 01:02:01,583
We lost him ten miles out!

701
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:02,957
Benji!

702
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:04,916
Lucky we found him at all.

703
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:06,915
Benji. Benji!

704
01:02:06,916 --> 01:02:09,083
Benji, Benji.

705
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:12,875
You're okay.

706
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:15,291
Wasn't my time.

707
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:18,958
Hand of God, Trudy.

708
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:23,125
You have to break it for me, hmm?
You will make it.

709
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:26,343
One, two, three!

710
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,625
Get him in quickly!

711
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:31,750
Hurry!

712
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,000
Take that and give it to Christopher.

713
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:14,541
Over here, Trudy!
Big smile. Let's see your teeth!

714
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:17,125
You got beautiful hair
under that cap, Trudy?

715
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,208
Ever get worried about the cold, Trudy?

716
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:27,750
The rules of the swim dictate
that no swimmer can be touched

717
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:29,875
at any point while in the water.

718
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:33,625
Once a swimmer is touched,
even in the white water,

719
01:03:33,626 --> 01:03:36,083
it is an immediate disqualification.

720
01:03:44,166 --> 01:03:46,249
- That as loud as it can go?
- Yes.

721
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:49,166
<i>It's the most
wonderful feeling in the world.</i>

722
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:51,415
<i>- I'm your host and bandleader...</i>
- Shh!

723
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:54,333
<i>...Harry Horlick,
and this is the</i> A&P Liberty Hour.

724
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:56,790
<i>Before we begin, some news from Europe.</i>

725
01:03:56,791 --> 01:04:00,874
<i>Trudy Ederle will attempt to swim
the English Channel at sunrise today</i>

726
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:04,958
{\an8}<i>as the world waits to see
if a woman can survive the hardest test</i>

727
01:04:04,959 --> 01:04:06,374
{\an8}<i>in all of sports.</i>

728
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:39,583
You promised me some music, Mr. Wolffe!

729
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:55,353
You're the best, Trudy!

730
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:58,000
Lucky I don't hear so good.

731
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:26,125
Trudy! Breaststroke!

732
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,500
Trudy!

733
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:30,583
Breaststroke!

734
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:45,958
We got it!

735
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:13,499
7:15 a.m., air is 48 degrees,
water is 61 degrees.

736
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,791
Trudy Ederle is in the water
swimming the American crawl.

737
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:19,625
- Send that to New York!
- Let's go!

738
01:06:19,626 --> 01:06:21,332
NBC.

739
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:24,458
- Coming through.
- Sixty-one. Send it now.

740
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:30,999
<i>Reports from the frigid waters
of the English Channel.</i>

741
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,250
<i>Trudy Ederle is now two miles
into her swim and is looking strong.</i>

742
01:06:35,251 --> 01:06:37,499
<i>Trudy is not swimming the breaststroke.</i>

743
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,457
<i>She is swimming
the 28-beat American crawl.</i>

744
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:43,250
<i>- And now a message from our sponsor.</i>
- Come on. Come on, girl.

745
01:06:43,251 --> 01:06:44,708
Kick your feet!

746
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,000
Trudy! Slow down.

747
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,250
Trudy!

748
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,500
Slow down!

749
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,250
She's not listening to him.

750
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:18,708
Four miles in
and showing no signs of fatigue.

751
01:07:18,709 --> 01:07:20,791
Trudy Ederle is swimming faster.

752
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Trudy!

753
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:54,083
Fruit! You need to eat!

754
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:00,041
Get me closer.

755
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:01,541
Closer!

756
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,249
Grab it!

757
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:37,083
Trudy! Take it!

758
01:08:37,084 --> 01:08:38,708
Take it!

759
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:44,665
He almost touched her!

760
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,906
- He almost touched her!
- Did he touch her?

761
01:09:05,083 --> 01:09:06,250
Shut up!

762
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:20,291
Don't worry, old boy. Only 16 miles to go.

763
01:10:25,291 --> 01:10:26,458
Trudy!

764
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:28,291
Halt! Tea!

765
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:38,791
Here. Take it.

766
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,250
Got it!

767
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:50,250
That's good.

768
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:00,500
Thank you!

769
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:21,666
Six miles in. She's slowing down.

770
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:24,791
Here you go, fellow.
Take this. Take it. It's yours.

771
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:45,541
You all right?

772
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:53,791
Trudy, hey!

773
01:11:57,541 --> 01:11:58,625
Trudy!

774
01:11:59,791 --> 01:12:01,666
You're swimming the wrong way.

775
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:04,541
Wrong way. This way.

776
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:25,833
Well, look at her. Not even seven miles.

777
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:28,499
We've all be suckered.

778
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,375
Wasted everyone's time.

779
01:12:30,376 --> 01:12:31,458
Trudy!

780
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:34,416
- Trudy!
<i>- Trudy!</i>

781
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:36,124
Trudy!

782
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:37,665
Trudy, look here.

783
01:12:37,666 --> 01:12:39,166
Trudy!

784
01:12:40,708 --> 01:12:41,708
It's over.

785
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:43,333
That's it.

786
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:06,770
Trudy is saved by her coach, Jabez Wolffe,

787
01:13:06,771 --> 01:13:09,416
who dives in
as she sinks beneath the waves.

788
01:13:09,417 --> 01:13:10,499
Excuse me.

789
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:21,208
<i>It is now clear
that Trudy Ederle simply did not possess</i>

790
01:13:21,209 --> 01:13:23,333
<i>the necessary strength or endurance.</i>

791
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:27,083
<i>But courage alone was not enough
to tame those waters.</i>

792
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:30,332
<i>Only five men have succeeded to date.</i>

793
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:34,458
<i>Captain Webb being the first to cross
in 21 hours and 45 minutes.</i>

794
01:13:34,459 --> 01:13:36,541
<i>Over a dozen brave men have died...</i>

795
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:51,291
<i>The world reacts to the news</i>

796
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:52,999
<i>that Trudy Ederle has collapsed at sea.</i>

797
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,332
{\an8}<i>After the results at the Olympics
and now in the Channel,</i>

798
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:59,999
{\an8}<i>it will be a rallying cry for those
to oppose female athletics.</i>

799
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,791
<i>As predicted, the English Channel
was too great a force for any woman.</i>

800
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:18,833
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Trudy Ederle was pulled from the water</i>

801
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:20,750
<i>after only six miles.</i>

802
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:23,415
<i>The swim is over.</i>

803
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:26,291
<i>And it is safe to say
that if Trudy Ederle can only get</i>

804
01:14:26,292 --> 01:14:28,665
<i>a few miles from the French shore,</i>

805
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:32,291
<i>no woman will ever swim
the English Channel.</i>

806
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:45,958
What happened?

807
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,875
You went too fast.

808
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:14,895
All the nurses think you're very brave.

809
01:15:14,896 --> 01:15:17,458
How far did I get? Nobody will tell me.

810
01:15:17,459 --> 01:15:18,541
It's okay, Trudy.

811
01:15:19,083 --> 01:15:20,416
Been here for two weeks.

812
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,083
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home right now.

813
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:26,500
Home came to you.

814
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:39,457
What are you doing here?

815
01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:43,625
I came to say it's not right.
They should let women be butchers.

816
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:45,207
I will teach you.

817
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,250
I don't wanna be a butcher.

818
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:51,458
I'm sorry. But while I was listening
to you on the radio...

819
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:56,416
My daughter on the radio?
And you were alone.

820
01:15:57,125 --> 01:16:00,416
And I was ashamed of myself.
Ashamed I was not here.

821
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:03,125
You're here now.

822
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,166
Yeah. We came to take you home.

823
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:07,833
We?

824
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:11,291
You didn't think
I'd let him come without me?

825
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,500
Meg. Meg!

826
01:16:16,666 --> 01:16:18,853
I've been dreaming about you.

827
01:16:18,854 --> 01:16:21,041
And cheese. I'm starving.

828
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:26,625
There's a ship leaving tomorrow.
You think you're strong enough?

829
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:29,957
Trudy Ederle, where is she?

830
01:16:29,958 --> 01:16:32,083
Sir,
you must leave the hospital immediately.

831
01:16:32,084 --> 01:16:33,375
Mr. Burgess?

832
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:37,750
You were swimming 12-and-a-half minute
miles across every tide.

833
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:39,541
Who is this man?

834
01:16:39,542 --> 01:16:40,625
What happened?

835
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:45,500
Twenty-eight strokes per minute,
12-and-a-half minute miles.

836
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:47,041
Outstanding.

837
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:50,041
You will leave my daughter alone, sir.

838
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:53,875
The captain of the <i>Alsace</i>
is a friend of mine.

839
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:57,125
He said Mr. Wolffe almost touched you
in the water.

840
01:16:57,708 --> 01:16:58,708
He slipped.

841
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:01,125
Well, he's a Channel swimmer,
he didn't slip.

842
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:05,458
You were swimming two knots
against every chop.

843
01:17:05,459 --> 01:17:08,041
And then suddenly you were drowning.

844
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:10,416
So what happened?

845
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:14,458
Wolffe gave me tea.
I was sick after I drank it.

846
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:17,291
First my stomach, then my head.

847
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:20,958
I couldn't stay awake.

848
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:22,583
Tea?

849
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:29,208
He carries pills to put himself to sleep.

850
01:17:30,416 --> 01:17:31,583
Seasick pills.

851
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:35,583
No wonder he left so fast.

852
01:17:38,291 --> 01:17:39,583
He poisoned my daughter?

853
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:42,875
Take it as a compliment, Mr. Ederle.

854
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:47,208
Women must be making progress
if their coaches are trying to kill 'em.

855
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:49,124
Uh, we'll go to the press.

856
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:52,875
No. They'll never believe some biscuit
who almost drowned.

857
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:55,291
Not until she's touched the sand
on the other side.

858
01:17:57,583 --> 01:17:59,625
It'd be my honor to show you the way.

859
01:17:59,626 --> 01:18:01,125
For another swim?

860
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:05,958
Please. If your mother finds out,
she will kill me.

861
01:18:06,541 --> 01:18:08,625
Trudy, what do you wanna do?

862
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:25,958
I came all this way.
Might as well see England.

863
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:32,291
Ladies and gentleman,
not all experiments succeed.

864
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:35,520
At this moment,
Trudy's health is all we care about.

865
01:18:35,521 --> 01:18:38,750
I will personally make sure she recovers
on that ship.

866
01:18:38,751 --> 01:18:40,249
- Right here!
- Yes.

867
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,958
I will answer another question.
One at a time.

868
01:18:42,959 --> 01:18:44,678
What will be your next venture?

869
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:47,833
Get some rest in your cabin, Trudy.

870
01:18:47,834 --> 01:18:49,165
Ah.

871
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:53,750
In a few days, you'll be home
and all of this will be forgotten.

872
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:55,875
As if it never happened.

873
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:57,666
Yeah.

874
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:29,875
Whoo!

875
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:37,833
We have three days
until that ship arrives in New York,

876
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:41,208
until the world finds out
you're still in France.

877
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:44,666
But what if she's not strong enough
in three days?

878
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:49,541
Well, there's a storm coming.
The water temperature's 56 and dropping.

879
01:19:49,542 --> 01:19:51,583
Any lower and she won't survive.

880
01:19:51,584 --> 01:19:52,708
Look, we can't wait.

881
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:54,916
I go in three days.

882
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:58,625
No press. No crowds. Nobody to stop me.

883
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:12,291
Everyone thinks
it's a straight line to England.

884
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:15,541
But it's the current
that dictates the line.

885
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:19,000
Now, you know where the North Sea
and the Atlantic are gonna surge,

886
01:20:19,001 --> 01:20:21,541
then you can follow that current
like a map.

887
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:25,291
I need you to promise me something,
Mr. Burgess.

888
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:28,666
Don't let anyone take me out of the water
no matter what.

889
01:20:33,333 --> 01:20:34,665
It's not right what you're asking.

890
01:20:34,666 --> 01:20:38,083
I decide what's right. I go on my terms.

891
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:39,875
Promise me.

892
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:43,333
What about your father or your family?

893
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:48,583
They could never understand, but you do.

894
01:20:49,375 --> 01:20:51,707
So promise me you won't pull me out.

895
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:54,458
I've broken every promise I've ever made
to a woman.

896
01:20:54,958 --> 01:20:57,666
You know, back in England, they...
they bought me a thousand whiskeys.

897
01:20:57,667 --> 01:20:59,250
Dragged me before the Queen.

898
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,916
But I let them all down.
I couldn't be what they wanted me to be.

899
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:06,541
- And what's that?
- A bloody hero.

900
01:21:07,458 --> 01:21:08,818
Well, you're asking the wrong man.

901
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:12,833
I'm asking for your word, Mr. Burgess.

902
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:16,125
We go to England or die trying.

Trudy, you're cut to pieces.

907
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:58,291
I'm used to it.
Every bathing gown cuts the same.

908
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:01,541
This needs to be tighter.

909
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:04,375
We need to remove
the drag across the shoulders,

910
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:06,875
and we should get rid of everything else.

911
01:22:06,876 --> 01:22:08,291
What are you talking about?

912
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:12,374
Most swimmers avoid the moon.

913
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:14,750
Fear of the neap tide
when the slack water's high.

914
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:19,125
This is the route Trudy'll take
to defeat the tide.

915
01:22:19,875 --> 01:22:22,666
Look, she'll make two 90 degree turns
during the swim.

916
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:26,666
Add about 20 miles.

917
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:28,332
Add 20 miles?

918
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:31,708
My only concern is
the weather slowing her down,

919
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:34,708
which could push her south
of the Goodwin Sands.

920
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:36,665
What the hell are you talking about?

921
01:22:36,666 --> 01:22:40,708
The shallows. Look, she gets caught there
and we can't follow.

922
01:22:40,709 --> 01:22:42,499
But the darkness is our enemy.

923
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,041
If Trudy loses her way,
then a current can take her.

924
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:48,833
Not even Trudy is strong enough
to swim perpendicular to that tide.

925
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:50,663
She'll be swept out to sea.

926
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,500
Okay.

927
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:56,250
It's done. Here she is.

928
01:22:58,333 --> 01:22:59,832
- What do you think?
- No, no, no, no, no.

929
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:02,958
She's not going out in that.
Even the French will lock her up.

930
01:23:02,959 --> 01:23:05,082
I'll be covered in porpoise fat
and lanolin.

931
01:23:05,083 --> 01:23:07,375
Nobody'll ever know
the emperor's got no clothes.

932
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:11,291
All of you are crazy!

933
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Trudy?

934
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:19,125
Some reporters upstairs
wish to speak with you.

935
01:23:19,126 --> 01:23:21,041
You need to come out of your room.

936
01:23:34,208 --> 01:23:39,375
I need to send a telegram to the owner
of the Gray Nose Hotel in France.

937
01:23:39,376 --> 01:23:40,583

938
01:23:41,666 --> 01:23:43,750

I don't know.

945
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:32,666
Seems like a nice day for a swim.

I'll pay £20 for a spot

American Trudy Ederle never went home.

1038
01:36:04,708 --> 01:36:06,125
halfway to Dover.

1039
01:36:48,083 --> 01:36:50,166
It's been over an hour,
and she barely moved.

1040
01:36:50,833 --> 01:36:52,208
She's exhausted.

1041
01:36:53,583 --> 01:36:55,125
The current is too strong.

1042
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:10,291
Hey, get me in front of her!

1043
01:37:10,292 --> 01:37:11,978
Meg, what are you doing?

1044
01:37:11,979 --> 01:37:13,666
Trudy hates to lose a race.

1045
01:37:16,666 --> 01:37:18,125
Meg!

1046
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:28,416
Race you around the pier!

1047
01:37:33,041 --> 01:37:34,790
Meg! No!

1048
01:37:42,875 --> 01:37:44,666
- Meg!
- Come on, Trudy!

1049
01:37:45,791 --> 01:37:48,208
<i>Mile 13
and Miss Trudy Ederle</i>

1050
01:37:48,209 --> 01:37:49,874
<i>continues to maintain an even stroke.</i>

1051
01:37:49,875 --> 01:37:52,166
Looks like she's coming our way,
Mr. Wolffe.

1052
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:55,250
You must be rooting against her.

1053
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:57,375
Why would I do that?

1054
01:37:58,541 --> 01:38:01,083
If she makes it,
you'll go down in history.

1055
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:03,416
The man who couldn't swim it.

1056
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:05,250
And couldn't coach it.

1057
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:08,916
<i>We no longer ask
if she belongs in the Channel.</i>

1058
01:38:08,917 --> 01:38:10,916
<i>We now ask, "Can she defeat it?"</i>

1059
01:38:18,416 --> 01:38:19,416
Trudy.

1060
01:38:20,833 --> 01:38:22,833
I'm sorry, but I can't swim anymore.

1061
01:38:23,416 --> 01:38:24,915
Get back on the boat.

1062
01:38:24,916 --> 01:38:26,291
Tell Burgess I'm starving.

1063
01:38:27,041 --> 01:38:28,040
What do you want?

1064
01:38:28,041 --> 01:38:31,041
Anything but tea!

1065
01:38:52,625 --> 01:38:54,166
I can't feel my hands or feet.

1066
01:38:54,167 --> 01:38:55,624
What?

1067
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:57,333
I don't know how she's still out there.

1068
01:38:57,334 --> 01:38:58,416
Another!

1069
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Ah.

1070
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Mmm.

1071
01:39:07,708 --> 01:39:09,457
Another!

1072
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:11,666
We'll bring another update
in 30 minutes.

1073
01:39:15,208 --> 01:39:17,832
What? What's wrong?

1074
01:39:17,833 --> 01:39:19,875
She's six miles from England.

1075
01:39:25,041 --> 01:39:26,166
Stop smiling.

1076
01:39:26,958 --> 01:39:28,666
It's a long way to go.

1077
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:33,458
<i>She now faces
the most treacherous part of the Channel</i>

1078
01:39:33,459 --> 01:39:36,250
<i>that has taken so many lives already.</i>

1079
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:39,207
<i>How much more does Trudy Ederle have
in the tank</i>

1080
01:39:39,208 --> 01:39:42,708
<i>as she faces
the ultimate long-distance challenge?</i>

1081
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:07,333
Shallows! We're in the shallows!

1082
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:08,916
Hold on!

1083
01:40:27,208 --> 01:40:28,250
What's happening?

1084
01:40:28,791 --> 01:40:30,591
The currents pushed us
into the Goodwin Sands.

1085
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:39,958
She'll come through the mouth
of Dover onto the Kingsdown Beach.

1086
01:40:39,959 --> 01:40:43,208
She'll have to swim across the
shallows for the last five miles alone.

1087
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:47,708
What if she gets lost in the dark?
What if she gets sucked out to the sea?

1088
01:40:47,709 --> 01:40:48,791
She can do it.

1089
01:40:49,541 --> 01:40:53,208
Take her out of the water now,
Mr. Burgess. Get my daughter out!

1090
01:40:54,375 --> 01:40:55,875
Get my daughter out!

1091
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,707
I will not take her out.

1092
01:41:00,708 --> 01:41:01,915
Take my daughter out!

1093
01:41:01,916 --> 01:41:04,666
As long as she wants to swim, she swims!

1094
01:41:06,791 --> 01:41:08,831
- She'll make it.
- No, we are losing light.

1095
01:41:09,333 --> 01:41:11,499
She's frozen stiff. She's slowing down.

1096
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:14,083
She will be alone in the dark
without a ship to guide her!

1097
01:41:14,084 --> 01:41:17,375
- Hey! Hey!
- I want her out of the water!

1098
01:41:18,708 --> 01:41:19,708
Trudy!

1099
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:25,333
Trudy, we can't follow you
through the shallows.

1100
01:41:25,334 --> 01:41:27,166
Without us, you will be lost.

1101
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,708
Get out now. The swim is over.

1102
01:41:38,083 --> 01:41:39,083
It's not over.

1103
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:46,875
I love you.

1104
01:42:00,458 --> 01:42:01,750
We'll meet her on the beach.

1105
01:43:05,208 --> 01:43:08,291
<i>Having achieved
more than so many men before her,</i>

1106
01:43:08,292 --> 01:43:11,375
<i>Trudy Ederle now attempts
the final stretch of the swim.</i>

1107
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:15,041
<i>Trudy Ederle has entered
the shallows alone.</i>

1108
01:43:15,042 --> 01:43:18,207
<i>A sandbank
that guards the shores of England.</i>

1109
01:43:18,208 --> 01:43:21,458
<i>Mademoiselle Trudy Ederle
has spent almost 13 hours in the water</i>

1110
01:43:21,459 --> 01:43:24,708
<i>in freezing temperatures
in the most perilous part of the swim.</i>

1111
01:44:31,416 --> 01:44:32,416
No.

1112
01:44:56,625 --> 01:44:58,333
No, no, no!

1113
01:44:59,333 --> 01:45:01,958
No, no!

1114
01:45:02,583 --> 01:45:05,083
No!

1115
01:45:20,291 --> 01:45:22,166
She's lost in the shallows.

1116
01:45:23,291 --> 01:45:25,082
They can't find her.

1117
01:45:33,291 --> 01:45:37,583
We have reports that
Trudy Ederle is lost in the Goodwin Sands,

1118
01:45:37,584 --> 01:45:39,750
only five miles from England.

1119
01:45:42,708 --> 01:45:47,125
We pray she finds her way to Dover
and the beach at Kingsdown.

1120
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:48,416
We have to go back on that boat
and find her.

1121
01:46:49,041 --> 01:46:51,666
There's no going back.
This is where it ends.

1122
01:46:52,458 --> 01:46:53,708
It's been hours!

1123
01:46:55,041 --> 01:46:57,208
How is she supposed to find her way?

1124
01:47:04,125 --> 01:47:05,125
Look.

1125
01:47:30,916 --> 01:47:32,125
Please.

1126
01:47:55,541 --> 01:47:58,208
<i>There's fires burning
on the cliffs of Dover</i>

1127
01:47:58,209 --> 01:48:01,041
as the world stops now and waits.

1128
01:48:02,958 --> 01:48:05,291
We are all with her
in that freezing water.

1129
01:48:05,292 --> 01:48:08,000
Tonight, we're all with Trudy.

1130
01:49:38,666 --> 01:49:39,666
There!

1131
01:49:40,375 --> 01:49:41,416
- Where?
- There!

1132
01:49:49,458 --> 01:49:50,500
- It's...
- Trudy!

1133
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:51,583
Trudy!

1134
01:50:02,458 --> 01:50:04,958
She's been out there for hours!

1135
01:50:05,666 --> 01:50:07,166
You made it! Come on!

1136
01:50:09,125 --> 01:50:10,333
Nobody touches her!

1137
01:51:34,375 --> 01:51:36,625
Come on, Trudy. Just a few more steps.

1138
01:51:41,791 --> 01:51:43,436
B-Bloody hero.

1139
01:51:57,375 --> 01:51:59,000
Welcome to England.

1140
01:52:00,583 --> 01:52:03,208
Yeah!

1141
01:52:11,416 --> 01:52:12,790
My daughter!

1142
01:52:12,791 --> 01:52:15,083
I taught her to swim! I taught her!

1143
01:52:18,333 --> 01:52:20,666
- This way, Trudy!
- Big smile!

1144
01:52:20,667 --> 01:52:22,083
Look, you're freezing. Here.

1145
01:52:23,541 --> 01:52:25,208
- Here, take this.
- Okay.

1146
01:52:33,333 --> 01:52:35,916
We love you, Trudy!

1147
01:52:35,917 --> 01:52:38,500
Hooray! Bravo!

1148
01:52:39,083 --> 01:52:41,923
- Bravo, Trudy! Bravo!
- We love you, Trudy!

1149
01:52:44,833 --> 01:52:46,833
Whoo!

1150
01:53:00,291 --> 01:53:01,750
Your daughter is in England!

1151
01:53:14,625 --> 01:53:17,000
Come on. Let's go. It's time for school.

1152
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:18,833
School?

1153
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:21,666
Trudy just swam the Channel.

1154
01:53:21,667 --> 01:53:23,583
Yes, she did, but you did not.

1155
01:53:34,166 --> 01:53:39,083
Ladies and gentlemen, today I can report
that the greatest athlete in the world

1156
01:53:39,084 --> 01:53:41,791
<i>is not Babe Ruth or Jack Dempsey.</i>

1157
01:53:42,958 --> 01:53:49,000
<i>The greatest athlete in the world is
a young woman from New York City.</i>

1158
01:53:50,583 --> 01:53:51,791
<i>Trudy Ederle.</i>

1159
01:53:54,958 --> 01:53:59,208
Yes! You did it, Trudy!

1160
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:18,970
Uh, I'm sorry. I-I can't let you
into the country without a passport.

1161
01:54:21,958 --> 01:54:24,083
You... You're gonna have to call someone.

1162
01:55:07,083 --> 01:55:08,791
Welcome back, Trudy!

1163
01:55:21,479 --> 01:55:22,625
You did it.

1164
01:55:23,916 --> 01:55:25,040
Yes!

1165
01:55:25,041 --> 01:55:26,999
Benji!

1166
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,166
It's your time, Trudy. This is your time.

1167
01:55:30,708 --> 01:55:32,548
- Trudy, we have to go.
- Go on, Trudy!

1168
01:55:34,166 --> 01:55:35,541
My coach rides with me.

1169
01:55:58,291 --> 01:56:00,000
Yeah, Trudy!

1170
01:56:13,208 --> 01:56:14,666
The Yankees!

1171
01:56:15,208 --> 01:56:17,125
Yeah!

1172
01:56:18,083 --> 01:56:19,375
Babe Ruth!
