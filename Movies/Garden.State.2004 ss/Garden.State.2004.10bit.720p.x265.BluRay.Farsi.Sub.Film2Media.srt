1
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,649
Los Angeles Tower,
this is Transworld 22 Heavy.

2
00:00:52,774 --> 00:00:56,318
We are going down.!
Repeat, engines two and...

3
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:58,404
L.A. Tower, this is...

4
00:00:58,529 --> 00:01:00,614
Mayday.! Mayday.!

5
00:01:00,698 --> 00:01:02,825
22 Heavy, pull up.! Pull up.!

6
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:09,888
Andrew,
this is your father.

7
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,931
Hello?

8
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,604
Look, you don't call me back,
so I don't know how to do this.

9
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:21,899
If you're not gonna
return my calls...

10
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:24,735
then there's no way
for us to communicate...

11
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,905
Look, I don't know
how to do this...

12
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,950
but you're gonna need
to come home now.

13
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:34,745
Last night...

14
00:02:34,828 --> 00:02:36,747
Your mother died
last night, Andrew.

15
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,415
She drowned.

16
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,961
Last night,
she drowned in the bath.

17
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:45,353
Ten résumés just today.

18
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:48,147
They come in every day
from Idaho or Milwaukee or Florida.

19
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:51,900
And you know what they want even more than
a guest spot on Everybody Loves Raymond?

20
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:55,070
They want your job. This cannot happen again.
This will never happen again.

21
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:57,322
You have two tables.
You are 30 minutes late.

22
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:59,992
And if I ever say this again,
your job will go to...

23
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:02,494
Todd Slauson
from Duluth, Minnesota.

24
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:12,670
Sparkling or flat?

25
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:15,339
Waiter 10,
do you have your earpiece in?

26
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,467
You forget the order 41
for Table 101.

27
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,844
What the fuck, man?
What, are you on break?

28
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,804
Nah, I'm just
messin'with you.

29
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,517
Uh, we'll have four
Ketel Red Bulls and...

30
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:30,228
And I'll have a Ketel cosmo
with a Red Bull and some bread ASAP.

31
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,314
We don't have bread.

32
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,026
What do you mean?
How can you not have bread?

33
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,695
Uh, we're a Vietnamese restaurant.
We just don't have bread.

34
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,822
But you're
not Vietnamese.

35
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,742
No, I'm not.

36
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:49,579
Can I have something to chew on?
Fuck. Bamboo, whatever.

37
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,706
I'll see what I can find.

38
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:56,878
Waiter number 12...

39
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:59,339
Flight Number 121
with nonstop service...

40
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:02,551
to Newark International
will be departing from Gate 32.

41
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:27,240
#Thanks for the time
that you've given me #

42
00:05:27,324 --> 00:05:33,288
#The memories are all
in my mind #

43
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:36,165
#And now that
we've come #

44
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:40,044
#To the end
of our rainbow #

45
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:46,092
#There's something
I must say out loud #

46
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:50,136
#Yes, you're once, twice #

47
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:54,140
#Three times a lady #

48
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:59,437
- #I love you

49
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,648
#Yes, you're once, twice #

50
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:03,774
#Three times a lady #

51
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:07,319
#Three times a lady #

52
00:06:07,445 --> 00:06:11,991
#I love you

53
00:06:12,116 --> 00:06:17,412
#I love you

54
00:06:24,252 --> 00:06:26,963
Shit, yo.

55
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:29,007
Holy shit.

56
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,425
What's up, man?

57
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,427
Largeman, what are you
doing here?

58
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:36,847
Uh, that's my mom.

59
00:06:36,972 --> 00:06:39,850
- Fuck.
- Oh, fuck.

60
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:41,852
Sorry.

61
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:44,312
Yeah.

62
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:47,816
So, welcome back home.

63
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,651
Thanks.

64
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:52,069
So what have you
been doing?

65
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:54,364
You still, uh,
acting and shit, right?

66
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:56,824
- Yeah.
- l-In L.A., right?

67
00:06:56,908 --> 00:06:58,826
- Yeah.
- That's cool.

68
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,828
I hear that place
is, like, fucking crazy.

69
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:03,998
My cousin's a writer out there.
Says that place is mad crazy.

70
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:07,168
He's, like, writing a movie
about snowboarders or some shit.

71
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:09,211
I don't...
I don't know.

72
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,381
Um, but I should
introduce you to him, Largeman.

73
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:14,382
Maybe you two
could do something together.

74
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:16,509
Yeah, definitely.

75
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:19,054
What are you
doing tonight, man?

76
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:22,932
Uh, nothing.
No real plans.

77
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:25,310
I'm just in town
for a couple days, so...

78
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:27,312
You should
come out with us.

79
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:31,607
We're gonna go over the Gleasons' house.
They're having some...

80
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:33,734
fucking huge party
or something.

81
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:36,528
- Supposedly.
- Well, yeah. Supposedly.

82
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:39,198
- Really?
- He lives up on the hill.

83
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:41,491
We'll probably go over there
after we bury your mom.

84
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:43,660
- Well, I got to shower.
- Same.

85
00:07:46,037 --> 00:07:49,415
Do you know your mother
redid the hallway bathroom?

86
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,460
What?
I'm sorry. What?

87
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:55,463
Since I met her,
she never showed an interest in anything.

88
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:57,881
All of a sudden,
a month ago, she wakes up...

89
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:00,468
she wants to redecorate
a bathroom.

90
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:02,845
I helped her.

91
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:06,223
- Oh, must have been fun.
- Well, I sew.

92
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:08,225
I made you something.

93
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:10,185
It's a shirt.

94
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:13,771
That's... That's good.
Thank you.

95
00:08:15,607 --> 00:08:17,692
Will you try it on now?

96
00:08:19,318 --> 00:08:21,237
Now?

97
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,948
In case I have to fix it
before you leave again...

98
00:08:24,073 --> 00:08:26,742
and we don't see you
for another nine years.

99
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:28,785
I wanna make sure it fits.

100
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:31,580
Oh. Okay.

101
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:34,625
You're gonna
love the material.

102
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,754
I used the leftovers from
your mother's design. Gorgeous.

103
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,271
Hi.

104
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:02,817
- Hello.
- How you doing?

105
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,780
"Well, besides that,
Mrs. Lincoln, how was the show?"

106
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:10,449
You know, I'm not really sure what
to say here, Dad, so I'm sorry.

107
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:12,994
Mm.

108
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:15,329
How are you?

109
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:19,500
I'm okay.

110
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,002
I've been getting these
really bad headaches though.

111
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:24,797
Um, they're really quick.

112
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,383
It's like a... just a little
lightning storm in my head.

113
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:30,593
Just for a second,
and then it's gone.

114
00:09:30,677 --> 00:09:34,514
I just thought maybe you could help me
get that checked out while I'm home.

115
00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:36,808
Go see Dr. Cohen
first thing in the morning.

116
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:39,269
He's a neurologist in my building.
l-I'll call him.

117
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:42,146
He'll fit you in. I'm sure it's
nothing to worry about.

118
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:48,694
Place looks good.

119
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:52,489
Oh, that's nice. Yeah, we've been
doing a lot of work on it.

120
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:54,616
Really?

121
00:09:57,202 --> 00:10:00,371
Actually, no.
I don't know why I just said that.

122
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:02,999
Someone redid the, uh,
hallway bathroom. I saw that.

123
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,376
Yeah. That's new.

124
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:12,132
I'm glad you're here.

125
00:10:14,677 --> 00:10:17,096
Saying good-bye
is important.

126
00:10:20,557 --> 00:10:22,684
I'm glad you could
fit it in.

127
00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:38,923
- Put your hands on your head, please.
- What?

128
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:43,928
I said put your motherfucking hands
on your head! Please.

129
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:45,929
Eighty-two in a 25.

130
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:48,474
What are you gonna tell me,
you're late or just tired?

131
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,476
- I was...
- Shut the fuck up!

132
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:58,483
- Largeman.
- Kenny?

133
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:00,610
Holy shit!

134
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:02,653
Oh, man.
How you doing?

135
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:04,655
I'm... I'm great.

136
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,157
- Your mom just died!
- I know.

137
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:10,160
- I mean, that's why you're home.
- Yeah. Yup.

138
00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:12,454
You're a cop, Kenny?

139
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:16,166
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- Why?

140
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,336
I don't know. Couldn't think of
anything better to do.

141
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:21,338
No, but it's really cool
though, man.

142
00:12:21,463 --> 00:12:23,757
People really
listen to you. I mean...

143
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,759
they have to!

144
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:28,762
- Yo, and check this shit out. That's the safety.
- Oh, cool.

145
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:31,514
And plus, the benefits, man.
If I get shot, I'm like...

146
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,516
rich!

147
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:37,145
But, Kenny, the last time I saw you,
you were doing coke lines off a urinal.

148
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,730
# La, la, la, la ##
No, I had to grow up, man.

149
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:43,275
It's time to grow up. Plus, I wasn't
making shit in that fish market.

150
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:45,736
No one knew who I was,
couldn't get laid.

151
00:12:45,861 --> 00:12:47,905
It's a much better
situation for me, man.

152
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:53,660
Speaking of which,
um, how'd I do?

153
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:55,453
What do you mean?

154
00:12:55,537 --> 00:12:57,664
I don't know.
You know, just the whole...

155
00:12:57,789 --> 00:12:59,999
You mean, like, as a cop?

156
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:02,626
Yeah. The whole,
"Shut the fuck up!"

157
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,963
Well, I thought you were a dick,
so I guess that's good.

158
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:08,799
Nice. So,
what the fuck, man?

159
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:11,718
You're this huge movie star now?
I heard you did some...

160
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:13,845
you played a big football player
or something.

161
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,056
- I didn't see it.
- It was just this thing...

162
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:18,642
- Fucking De Niro and shit.
- What?

163
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:20,643
- He's awesome.
- Yeah.

164
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:22,645
- Deer Hunter?
- Yeah.

165
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:25,231
Man, we should sit down
and we should talk...

166
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:28,609
because I've got some
really good ideas for movies.

167
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:31,111
You could play me
and shit. Poof!

168
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:33,530
- Stories from the Force.
- Yeah.

169
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:36,116
- Yeah, definitely. That sounds good.

170
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:00,931
- Holy shit!
- What's up?

171
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:02,933
- How you doing, man?
- How you doing, man?

172
00:14:03,058 --> 00:14:05,393
- What's up?
- Hey, how you doing? Good to see you.

173
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:09,522
Get this guy a beer. This guy does not
wait for a beer. He's a movie star.

174
00:14:09,606 --> 00:14:11,733
Like, uh, Jersey's
De Niro and shit.

175
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:17,447
- Largeman, man, what are you doing home?
- I, uh...

176
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:19,866
Press junket.

177
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:22,451
That's phat, yo.
Fuck, yeah!

178
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:25,955
Serpico and shit.
"Attica!"

179
00:14:26,038 --> 00:14:28,958
Shut the fuck up, man.

180
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:32,961
You like that?

181
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:35,922
Like, uh,
"press junket"?

182
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:38,800
That's improv, bitch.
You can use it. Right?

183
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:40,802
Okay. Let me
show you something.

184
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:49,477
Largeman! Oh, whoa!
What's going on, man?

185
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:53,105
How you been?
Hey!

186
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,816
- Jess. How are you, brother?
- How's it going, man?

187
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:58,819
I haven't seen you in so long.
I heard you're kicking ass.

188
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:02,406
Oh, um, basically the man
bought my silent Velcro patent.

189
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:05,117
- What?
- I developed this little item.

190
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,452
It's just like Velcro,
but it doesn't make that...

191
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:10,121
the Velcro noise.

192
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:12,999
- So how much did they buy it for?
- A lot, man.

193
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:16,002
Wow. So wh-what are you
doing with yourself?

194
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:18,087
Um, nothing.
Nothing.

195
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:20,173
I've never been so bored
in my whole life.

196
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:23,301
Yeah. First month I went out.
I bought a whole bunch of shit.

197
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:25,302
But, y...
Nothing.

198
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:31,099
Someone got
a joint for me?

199
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,503
Here you go.

200
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,175
Oh. No, thanks, man.

201
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,761
Really? I thought you were
a big movie star and shit.

202
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,222
- Nah.
- Well, then here.

203
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,016
Eat this.

204
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,352
Welcome home.

205
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,865
- I guess I'll see you guys later.

206
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:35,994
Should we
play a game?

207
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:39,747
Let's play
"spin the bottle."

208
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:43,376
I'm not playing "spin the bottle."
How old are we?

209
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:46,337
- Or more importantly, how old are they?
- Oh, they're all legal.

210
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,338
I think.

211
00:16:48,422 --> 00:16:50,716
Well, wejust ate
all this fucking "X,"

212
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,510
so what the hell else
are we supposed to do?

213
00:16:53,593 --> 00:16:56,013
Girl has a point.

214
00:16:56,096 --> 00:16:59,474
- Fucking right.
- I'm in.!

215
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,829
- Hey.!
- Large.!

216
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:11,667
Large.!

217
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,342
- Largeman, this is Dana.
- Hi.

218
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:23,136
Hi.

219
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:25,472
- Who's up?

220
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,125
Whoo!

221
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:05,676
- This is gonna be a good night.

222
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:23,124
It's good, isn't it?

223
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:30,131
I always try to save a couple
of the marshmallows till the very end...

224
00:20:30,256 --> 00:20:32,216
but I never make it.

225
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,218
I always end up with...

226
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:36,637
a bunch of flake things
and pink milk.

227
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:40,265
My mind wanders.

228
00:20:43,393 --> 00:20:45,311
So, Tim...

229
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:48,773
How long have you been
working at Medieval Times?

230
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:52,568
Three years. B-But I've
only been a knight for two.

231
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,654
You have to
pay your dues.

232
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:57,948
I worked in the stables
and helped in the kitchen.

233
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:00,242
When I started,
he was making the coleslaw.

234
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,619
It hasn't been the same
since you got knighted.

235
00:21:02,702 --> 00:21:04,621
But I really
just stirred it.

236
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:06,706
Don't be modest.

237
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:09,167
Mr. Modesty won
the joust last night.

238
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,588
- Congratulations.
- It's not that big a deal. It's fixed.

239
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,590
What was it that happened
to you in high school?

240
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:18,592
You had a thing.
I forgot what it was.

241
00:21:18,676 --> 00:21:21,095
- He got the shit kicked out of him.
- No, he didn't.

242
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,807
How do you know? He got the shit
kicked out of him by Tyrell Freedmen.

243
00:21:24,932 --> 00:21:27,685
- I fucked him up too.
- He knocked your teeth out.

244
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,145
He only chipped one tooth.

245
00:21:32,397 --> 00:21:34,858
So, uh, w-what are you
up to now, Mark?

246
00:21:34,942 --> 00:21:36,859
You're digging graves?

247
00:21:41,448 --> 00:21:43,450
Mark's getting into
real estate.

248
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,207
- Tim can speak Klingon.
- What?

249
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:53,209
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

250
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,502
- What the fuck is Klingon?
- Like the Star Trek guys?

251
00:21:55,627 --> 00:21:58,213
- Yeah, he can speak their language.
- No, she's kidding.

252
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:00,549
No, I'm not.
Why are you being shy?

253
00:22:00,674 --> 00:22:03,176
- Yeah, don't be shy, Tim.
- It's just... It's made-up.

254
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:06,221
This guy who plays the wizard
at work is a Trekkie. I don't...

255
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:09,474
- Don't be shy. Tell them
what you said to me last night.
- No.

256
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:12,185
Say what you said
to her last night.

257
00:22:17,523 --> 00:22:19,191
You gotta be kidding me.

258
00:22:19,274 --> 00:22:22,236
It means, "I like to
mate after battle."

259
00:22:22,361 --> 00:22:24,363
- That's not what I said.
- Yeah.

260
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:26,406
No. No. That wasn't
the one I said.

261
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:28,450
This one means,
"Kill Kirk"...

262
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:32,203
and also "Hallelujah,"
depending on the context.

263
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:34,581
You must have got it
confused with, uh...

264
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:40,878
- Honey, that is good.
- You know what that means, Tim?

265
00:22:41,004 --> 00:22:43,922
Well, I do. It means,
"Get the fuck out of my house...

266
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:45,924
before I chop
your fucking head off."

267
00:22:53,974 --> 00:22:56,351
Mark, he's a knight.

268
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:59,187
He's just a fast-food knight.

269
00:23:01,606 --> 00:23:03,525
I should get going.

270
00:23:15,244 --> 00:23:17,121
Thanks, uh,
for the cereal.

271
00:23:17,246 --> 00:23:20,248
I had a lovely evening.

272
00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:22,793
By the way, it says
"balls" on your face.

273
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:27,881
- Asshole.
- My mom did it.

274
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:33,761
In the spring...

275
00:23:33,844 --> 00:23:38,140
the hungry gator must find
new and clever ways to find food.

276
00:23:42,937 --> 00:23:45,814
Did you tell Large
about... the tapes?

277
00:23:45,898 --> 00:23:48,567
No, Mom. I'm not doing
those stupid tapes.

278
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,610
- What are the tapes?
- Real estate tapes.

279
00:23:50,694 --> 00:23:54,448
You can make up to
$100,000 your first year.

280
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:57,033
You should have seen the boat
this Oriental guy had.

281
00:23:57,158 --> 00:24:00,328
He even had his own game show in China,
he had so much money.

282
00:24:00,453 --> 00:24:02,455
I think Mark would be
perfect at it.

283
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,749
Ma, shut up about those fuckin' tapes.
Okay? It's a scam.

284
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:09,545
Well, I'm doing it.
I'm saving up for those tapes.

285
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,921
Because I know what you could be
if you just apply yourself.

286
00:24:10,921 --> 00:24:12,465
Because I know what you could be
if you just apply yourself.

287
00:24:12,548 --> 00:24:15,550
You know what?
I do apply myself every day, Mom.

288
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:18,762
I work my ass off
burying dead people. Okay?

289
00:24:18,845 --> 00:24:21,681
I'm only 26. I'm not in any rush.
What's your rush for?

290
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,311
Just let me be.
I don't rush you.

291
00:24:28,897 --> 00:24:31,482
Okay. Then I'll
do 'em myself.

292
00:24:31,565 --> 00:24:34,443
Fine. Do 'em.

293
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:38,406
Okay, then I won't
let you on my yacht.

294
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:41,659
Except Large. Large, you can
come anytime you want.

295
00:24:41,784 --> 00:24:45,287
Just don't bring
your friend here.

296
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,000
Shit! I got to go
to my meeting.

297
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:53,295
Okay.

298
00:24:55,588 --> 00:24:57,507
I love you.

299
00:24:58,716 --> 00:25:01,135
- I love you too.
- I love you.

300
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:07,391
- Large, it was nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

301
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:10,144
Oh. Oh, you guys,
don't stay in here all day...

302
00:25:10,227 --> 00:25:13,104
'cause I took the batteries out of
the carbon monoxide detector.

303
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,566
It was beeping all night.

304
00:25:18,527 --> 00:25:20,654
She drives me crazy!

305
00:25:20,737 --> 00:25:24,115
She gets all baked out and makes me
feel like I have to impress her.

306
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,117
And you know what?

307
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:28,703
I'm okay with being unimpressive.
I sleep better.

308
00:25:30,371 --> 00:25:34,166
- Hey, what time is it?
- No idea.

309
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:36,210
I gotta go.

310
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:42,924
Hi, I'm Andrew Largeman.
I'm sorry.

311
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,178
- I'm really late for my appointment.
- Andrew. Andrew.

312
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:49,723
Okay, Andrew. I'm gonna need you
to fill out this paperwork for me.

313
00:25:49,806 --> 00:25:51,975
As soon as we're ready,
we'll call you in.

314
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,435
- Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Have a seat.

315
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,437
- Hello, Miss Lubin.
- Oh, hello there.

316
00:25:56,562 --> 00:25:59,065
Just have a seat.
We'll be with you soon, okay?

317
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,400
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

318
00:26:25,172 --> 00:26:27,091
How's it going?

319
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:31,887
- Get off.

320
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:33,889
Get off.

321
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,441
- Heel.

322
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:48,819
- Heel!

323
00:26:52,323 --> 00:26:54,950
Got any suggestions?

324
00:26:55,075 --> 00:26:56,994
Oh, what?

325
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,247
- You got any suggestions?
- Yeah, kick his balls.

326
00:27:01,874 --> 00:27:03,833
Kick his balls.

327
00:27:05,752 --> 00:27:09,464
Yeah, but I don't wanna destroy
future generations of charitable dogs.

328
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:11,508
Don't worry about it.
I got three Dobermans.

329
00:27:11,591 --> 00:27:15,011
If I didn't kick them in the balls regularly,
I'd never get anything done.

330
00:27:15,136 --> 00:27:17,096
But he's gotta be close
to finishing by now.

331
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,098
Not yet.

332
00:27:19,182 --> 00:27:21,309
Here comes the lipstick.

333
00:27:21,434 --> 00:27:23,727
Mrs. Lubin?
We're ready for you now.

334
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:26,730
- Okay. Come on, Arthur.

335
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:35,363
- I feel so used.

336
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:39,242
Thanks for your help.
For, at least, your good intentions.

337
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:43,788
- I recognize you.
- Oh, did you go to Columbia High?

338
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,207
No, not from high school.
From TV.

339
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,960
- Didn't you play the retarded quarterback?
- Yeah.

340
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:51,045
Are you
really retarded?

341
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,381
No, I'm not.

342
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,592
Cool.

343
00:27:56,717 --> 00:28:00,346
Great job, man. I mean,
I thought you were really retarded.

344
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,599
You're just as good as that Corky kid,
and he's actually retarded.

345
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,851
If there was some
sort of retarded Oscar...

346
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:09,520
you would win like
hands down, kick his ass.

347
00:28:09,645 --> 00:28:12,357
Well, thank you.
Thanks, I appreciate it.

348
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,900
I have to fill out
this form though, so...

349
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:16,902
- Right on.
- Thanks.

350
00:28:21,615 --> 00:28:24,201
My cousin's an actor.
Jake Ryan Winters.

351
00:28:24,284 --> 00:28:26,203
Doubt you've ever
heard of him.

352
00:28:26,286 --> 00:28:30,707
He was, like, on Xena once as a gnome
or something. That's really cool though.

353
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,251
Thanks.

354
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:36,588
Oh, my God.

355
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:38,589
That scene.
That last scene...

356
00:28:38,672 --> 00:28:40,925
where you give the speech
to the whole stadium...

357
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,844
and your dad... oh, your dad
gives you the thumbs up.

358
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:46,847
Aw. That was, like...

359
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,849
That was emotional.

360
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:52,352
So, you got
anything else coming out?

361
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:54,688
No. You know,
I'm auditioning...

362
00:28:54,772 --> 00:28:56,731
I can't believe
you're not really retarded.

363
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:58,733
I mean, Jake's not
a very good actor.

364
00:28:58,816 --> 00:29:01,903
You can't really tell on Xena
'cause he's in the hairy gnome suit...

365
00:29:01,986 --> 00:29:05,532
but when we were little, he used to
put on these really, really low-budge...

366
00:29:05,615 --> 00:29:07,909
renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber
musicals in our attic.

367
00:29:07,992 --> 00:29:10,953
And they were awful.!

368
00:29:11,078 --> 00:29:13,289
Like, so bad.

369
00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:18,794
It sucks, though, because there's not
that much work for little people, you know?

370
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:21,380
- Anyway, I'm talking too much.

371
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:24,215
I'll just...
You got to fill out your forms.

372
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:26,426
What are you
listening to?

373
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:28,469
The Shins.

374
00:29:28,594 --> 00:29:30,972
- You know them?
- No.

375
00:29:31,056 --> 00:29:34,392
You gotta hear this one song.
It'll change your life. I swear.

376
00:29:34,475 --> 00:29:38,062
Oh, I'm sorry. You have to...
You gotta fill out your forms.

377
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:40,064
Conundrum.
Think you could, uh...

378
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:43,483
- maybe listen while you fill out your forms?
- I think I can handle it.

379
00:29:43,608 --> 00:29:45,569
Yeah? Okay.

380
00:29:58,247 --> 00:30:01,542
# Gold teeth and a curse
for this town

381
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:04,963
# Were all in my mouth

382
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:07,631
# Only, I don't know how

383
00:30:07,715 --> 00:30:09,842
#They got out, dear #

384
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:11,844
#Turn me... ##

385
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:13,846
It's good.
I like it.

386
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:19,142
- So, what are you here for?
- What are you here for?

387
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:21,353
Waiting for a friend. You?

388
00:30:22,729 --> 00:30:24,647
I, uh...

389
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:27,149
Oh, fuck, that was nosy.
I'm sorry.

390
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:30,862
I am so nosy. I didn't...
I didn't mean to be. I'm sorry.

391
00:30:30,987 --> 00:30:34,156
No, I just... I get these headaches.
I just want to have it checked out.

392
00:30:34,281 --> 00:30:36,283
Cool.

393
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,285
- Andrew Largeman?
- Yes.

394
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,705
- We're ready for you now.
- Oh, okay.

395
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,708
- Thank you. Nice meeting you.
- You didn't. I'm Sam.

396
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,459
Andrew.

397
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:50,005
Nice to meet you.
Good luck with your head.

398
00:30:50,088 --> 00:30:52,048
Thanks.

399
00:30:53,508 --> 00:30:55,801
Don't worry, Sam.
We'll be with you next.

400
00:31:25,288 --> 00:31:28,333
- Mr. Andrew Largeman?
- Yes, hi.

401
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:30,543
- There's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
- What?

402
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:33,671
Just kidding.
How would I know that? Uh...

403
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:37,174
I'm Dr. Cohen.

404
00:31:39,343 --> 00:31:41,428
What can we do
for you today, Andrew.

405
00:31:42,804 --> 00:31:45,182
Um, I've been getting these
really intense headaches.

406
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:48,518
Um, they last for
like a split second.

407
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:52,438
It's like lightning, like a surge
of electricity, and then it's gone.

408
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:58,194
Lithium?

409
00:31:58,277 --> 00:32:00,363
How long have you been
on the lithium?

410
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:04,950
Um, I've been on some form of it
since I was 10 or so.

411
00:32:07,285 --> 00:32:10,080
And the Paxil,
Zoloft, Celexa...

412
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:12,124
Depakote...

413
00:32:12,207 --> 00:32:14,709
did they, uh,
help you at all?

414
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:16,711
No.

415
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:19,839
I mean,
I don't know. Uh...

416
00:32:19,964 --> 00:32:23,259
It's recently occurred to me I might not
even have a problem.

417
00:32:23,385 --> 00:32:27,805
Only, I'd never know it because as far back
as I can remember, I've been medicated.

418
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:30,099
I left them
in L.A. though.

419
00:32:30,224 --> 00:32:34,436
This is, uh, the first time I haven't had
medicine in my body for... a long time.

420
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:37,105
You know that stuff will
leave your body pretty fast.

421
00:32:37,231 --> 00:32:41,652
- I can write you a prescription.
- Actually, I was thinking about
taking a little vacation.

422
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:44,070
Have you discussed this
with your psychiatrist?

423
00:32:44,154 --> 00:32:47,490
Uh, well,
my psychiatrist is my dad.

424
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:52,203
Yeah. So I think he'd
prefer me to stay on it.

425
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:55,498
He... likes to think
it makes me happy.

426
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:00,670
You know, our bodies are capable
of doing some very funny things...

427
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:03,172
when they're consumed
with stress and anxiety.

428
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,966
Uh...

429
00:33:06,091 --> 00:33:10,929
I found my ex-best friend's
cuff links in my wife's purse.

430
00:33:13,557 --> 00:33:16,184
I couldn't get an erection
for a year and a half...

431
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:18,186
for example.

432
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:23,316
Wow. Um...

433
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:26,235
But I don't really think
that's it because I don't...

434
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,697
I don't really feel like
stressed or anxious at all.

435
00:33:29,822 --> 00:33:33,533
'Cause all the lithium he's had you on.
It's amazing you can even hear me now.

436
00:33:35,786 --> 00:33:37,996
Look, Andrew, uh,
first of all...

437
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:41,583
I think you do need to find
a psychiatrist that isn't your father.

438
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:44,502
That's something that should have
been remedied years ago.

439
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:46,504
He knows better.

440
00:33:46,588 --> 00:33:49,590
And secondly, uh, I'm in
no position to comment on...

441
00:33:49,716 --> 00:33:53,302
whether you should stay on the meds or not
because I don't know your story.

442
00:33:53,385 --> 00:33:57,348
But my opinion,
since you're paying for it...

443
00:33:57,473 --> 00:34:01,059
is that, yeah, those drugs may help you
as a means to an end...

444
00:34:01,184 --> 00:34:03,854
but sooner or later, if you're not
in some sort of therapy...

445
00:34:03,979 --> 00:34:08,191
whatever's going on in your mind will find
a way to peek its little head out of the water.

446
00:34:08,316 --> 00:34:10,485
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

447
00:34:10,568 --> 00:34:12,653
Yeah, you're all right.
You're alive.

448
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:15,573
Come on.
I'll take a look at you. Come.

449
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:21,495
I'll need you to take your shoes off.
I have to scratch your feet.

450
00:34:54,484 --> 00:34:56,779
So why were you
really there?

451
00:34:56,904 --> 00:34:58,906
Charging.
I'm a robot.

452
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:04,035
- Do you lie a lot?
- What do you consider a lot?

453
00:35:04,118 --> 00:35:06,120
Enough for people
to call you a liar.

454
00:35:06,203 --> 00:35:09,749
- People call me lots of things.
- Is one of them "liar"?

455
00:35:09,832 --> 00:35:12,710
I could say no, but how would
you know I'm not lyin'?

456
00:35:12,794 --> 00:35:15,296
I guess I could choose
to trust you.

457
00:35:15,421 --> 00:35:17,881
- You can do that?
- I can try.

458
00:35:17,964 --> 00:35:20,259
Whose bike is that?

459
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,596
It was my grandfather's.

460
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:29,225
It was the only thing he left to anyone
in my family, and he left it to me.

461
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:31,311
And I like it.

462
00:35:33,854 --> 00:35:38,233
So this is the point in the conversation
where you ask me if I'd like a ride home.

463
00:35:38,318 --> 00:35:40,486
- It is?
- Yep.

464
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,657
Would you like a ride home?

465
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:50,787
Fine. But I'm not
getting in that sidecar.

466
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,623
- Why not?
- Sidecars are for bitches.

467
00:35:53,707 --> 00:35:56,460
Anyone who rides in that
is automatically your bitch.

468
00:35:56,543 --> 00:35:59,128
Thus, I will ride
on the back.

469
00:36:07,386 --> 00:36:09,305
- Whoa.
- Hold on tight.

470
00:36:09,388 --> 00:36:11,474
Okay. Holdin'.

471
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,229
My hair is blowin'
in the wind.

472
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:23,985
What, are you
like a hang glider?

473
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:26,529
My boyfriend was gonna
pick me up so I brought it.

474
00:36:26,654 --> 00:36:30,116
- But then he couldn't.
- What does he have? One of those tandem things?

475
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:32,952
No. He drives a Ninja.
Goes way faster than this guy.

476
00:36:33,035 --> 00:36:36,497
- But what kind of helmet is that?
- You can wear it on a bike.

477
00:36:36,622 --> 00:36:39,166
- Anyway, how's your head?
- I should live through the day.

478
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,168
Cool.
Make a right here.

479
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:48,717
Are you doing
anything right now?

480
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:51,928
- Can you elaborate on "doing anything"?
- I know this guy, Jesse.

481
00:36:52,053 --> 00:36:54,055
He bought this mansion
that's right up here...

482
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,057
and he wants me
to come visit him.

483
00:36:56,182 --> 00:37:00,353
But I don't want to stay very long.
I was thinking, like if you came too...

484
00:37:00,478 --> 00:37:03,898
I could just say I have to take you home
when I'm ready to go.

485
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:07,151
Wow. That's pretty damn
random of you, Andrew.

486
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:09,736
- I know.
- "Nice to meet you. Can I use you?"

487
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:11,821
- No.
- It's the Hollywood in you, I guess.

488
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:14,366
No. Come on.
It's not like that. It'll be fun.

489
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:17,702
I'll tell you what, we can have like...
like a signal.

490
00:37:17,786 --> 00:37:20,830
Like, when you pull on your ear,
that's the code.

491
00:37:20,914 --> 00:37:24,918
And then I'll be like, "Oh, I got to
take her home." And then we'll go.

492
00:37:26,585 --> 00:37:28,671
Can we have
code names too?

493
00:37:28,754 --> 00:37:31,215
If you want.

494
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:34,217
Okay. But don't try
and like kidnap me or anything...

495
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:38,221
'cause my step-uncle's a bounty hunter
and he could have you tracked and killed.

496
00:37:38,305 --> 00:37:40,432
You're such a liar.

497
00:37:42,935 --> 00:37:44,811
Whoo!

498
00:37:46,354 --> 00:37:48,565
Okay. You ready?

499
00:38:09,793 --> 00:38:12,713
I'll be fine. Am I the first boy
you've ever brought home?

500
00:38:12,796 --> 00:38:14,756
No. But, um...

501
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,967
I lied to you before when I told you
my boyfriend drives a Ninja.

502
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:21,095
- He doesn't drive a bike?
- No, I don't have a boyfriend.

503
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:24,974
But, you know,
he might drive a Ninja.

504
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:28,269
- Wherever he is.
- Wow. We're off to a great start.

505
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,523
Okay. So...
So sometimes I lie.

506
00:38:32,648 --> 00:38:35,317
I mean,
I'm weird, man.

507
00:38:35,442 --> 00:38:38,445
About random stuff too.
I don't even know why I do it.

508
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,489
It's like...
It's like a tic.

509
00:38:40,572 --> 00:38:44,993
I mean, sometimes I hear myself
say something, and then I think...

510
00:38:45,118 --> 00:38:47,578
"Wow, that wasn't even
remotely true."

511
00:38:47,662 --> 00:38:50,248
So how do people know
what's real?

512
00:38:50,331 --> 00:38:54,377
Well, I always feel bad afterwards
and admit them when they're lies.

513
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:57,505
Can you trust that?

514
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:00,633
Open the door.

515
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:03,593
Okay.

516
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:04,511
Okay.

517
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:11,100
Kevin, down.
Mom!

518
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:14,020
Come on. Kick him in the balls.
Kick him in the balls.

519
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,314
Mom!

520
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:19,358
All right! Everybody down!
Who wants to eat?

521
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:22,653
Do you want to eat?
Then get the fuck off him.

522
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:25,448
Kevin!
Get off!

523
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:28,826
I'm so sorry. Wejust don't have
the time to train them.

524
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:31,161
Who's got the time
to train them?

525
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,956
- Mom, this is Andrew.
- Welcome.

526
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,958
Welcome.
I'm sorry the place is a wreck.

527
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:39,419
Honey, I asked you to get
the metal wheel out of the hamster cage.

528
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:42,422
- I forgot.
- Well, you forgot and now Jelly's dead.

529
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,674
Luckily, I got Peanut Butter out in time.

530
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,218
We have to get
the only hamsters on planet Earth...

531
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,470
who can't figure out
a stupid hamster wheel.

532
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,680
There's a tin box
on the kitchen counter.

533
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,350
You can do the honors.
I have to get to work.

534
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,477
- It's nice to meet you. Andrew, right?
- Yes.

535
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,854
Andrew.
Very nice to meet you.

536
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,523
Samatha, put the clothes
in the dryer and buryJelly.

537
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:07,362
So this is it.

538
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,331
- It's nice.
- No, it's not.

539
00:40:18,414 --> 00:40:21,166
Don't say that just 'cause
you can't think of anything else.

540
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,585
I'm not. I'm not.
It's... It's very cozy.

541
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:26,171
You guys are a little early
on the tree though.

542
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:30,217
Yeah, we never got around to taking it down.
When it got to be fall again...

543
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:32,261
we figured,
"Just leave it up."

544
00:40:32,344 --> 00:40:35,597
Oh, my God. You're totally freaked out.
You're totally freaked out right now.

545
00:40:35,722 --> 00:40:38,892
- You, like, can't wait to leave.
- I'm not. I'm not. I like it.

546
00:40:38,975 --> 00:40:41,602
- It's very nice.
- Well, you wanna see my room?

547
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:43,604
Sure.

548
00:40:44,647 --> 00:40:46,565
- Hey.
- Hey.

549
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:49,735
Titembay, this is my friend Andrew.
Andrew, this is my brother, Titembay.

550
00:40:49,818 --> 00:40:53,363
- Hi. It's very nice to meet you.
- Oh, it's nice to meet you.

551
00:40:53,447 --> 00:40:55,573
- I'm sorry aboutJelly.
- Oh, that's okay.

552
00:40:55,658 --> 00:40:58,285
I saved some mac and cheese for you.
It's in the fridge.

553
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,412
Thank you.

554
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:07,794
Anyway, I'm late for class.
It's nice meeting you.

555
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:10,713
- Very nice to meet you.
- See you later.

556
00:41:14,175 --> 00:41:16,093
So here we are.

557
00:41:16,177 --> 00:41:19,305
It's nothing fancy,
but you know... What?

558
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:23,642
Uh, it's... Titembay, right?

559
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:26,520
Yeah, it's weird, huh?
You're, like, so freaked out right now.

560
00:41:26,645 --> 00:41:29,940
You're running for the door. It's okay.
You can go. Don't feel bad. It's really...

561
00:41:30,023 --> 00:41:31,983
- Stop doing that.
- What?

562
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:35,445
The whole thing you just did. I wanna be here.
If I didn't, I wouldn't be.

563
00:41:35,528 --> 00:41:38,281
Trust me, my family is way more
fucked up than yours. Okay?

564
00:41:38,364 --> 00:41:39,990
Okay.

565
00:41:40,115 --> 00:41:42,993
So, Titembay.

566
00:41:43,077 --> 00:41:46,789
- Yeah, he's my brother.
- Is he adopted or...

567
00:41:46,914 --> 00:41:49,917
Kind of. My mom adopted him
from Sally Struthers like years ago.

568
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,670
One of those "For the cost
of a cup of coffee a day" sort of things.

569
00:41:53,795 --> 00:41:57,298
Where she's like, "How can you
just sit there and not help the children?"

570
00:41:57,424 --> 00:42:00,802
And we couldn't. We just couldn't sit there
and not help the children.

571
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:04,222
So we start sending him like
pictures and letters and stuff for years...

572
00:42:04,347 --> 00:42:08,101
but then I got really into ice-skating,
so we sort of forgot about him.

573
00:42:08,184 --> 00:42:11,229
Then one day we get this phone call
and it's Titembay.

574
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:13,522
And he's at the dry cleaners
around the corner.

575
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:16,358
And he's like, "I'm at Rutgers.
I live in the dorms...

576
00:42:16,483 --> 00:42:19,945
but I'm used to living with my tribe
so I'd rather live with a family."

577
00:42:20,028 --> 00:42:22,489
And he's been living
with us ever since.

578
00:42:22,572 --> 00:42:25,033
Wow.

579
00:42:25,117 --> 00:42:28,035
Yeah. I know.
He's the most amazing guy.

580
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,998
You gotta hear his stories. He struggled
through so much because he wanted to learn.

581
00:42:32,081 --> 00:42:34,208
When I think of what
he's accomplished, I just...

582
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:36,252
I just feel,
like, lazy. You know?

583
00:42:36,377 --> 00:42:39,213
He's studying criminal justice at Rutgers,
and when he was a baby...

584
00:42:39,296 --> 00:42:42,549
he was one of those kids with,
like, the flies all over his face.

585
00:42:43,884 --> 00:42:46,177
Wow.

586
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:48,221
I mean,
i-it's a crazy story.

587
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:52,225
Yeah, I know. I mean, that's a true story.
I am not that good.

588
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:55,853
This is Tickle.

589
00:42:55,979 --> 00:43:00,275
- What is Tickle?
- Tickle's my favorite thing in the whole world.

590
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,360
It's all that's left
of Nanny, my blanket.

591
00:43:03,444 --> 00:43:05,655
- Tickle's all that remains.
- Mm-hmm.

592
00:43:05,738 --> 00:43:08,198
- Was there like a hurricane or something?
- Shut up.

593
00:43:08,282 --> 00:43:11,660
No, I mean, I've had this
since I was a baby.

594
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,496
It's what they brought me home
in from the hospital.

595
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:18,792
- It's like the Wailing Wall.
- What?

596
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:21,210
Uh, the Wailing Wall
is like this, uh...

597
00:43:21,335 --> 00:43:24,881
It's like the most holy place
forJews to go and pray in Israel.

598
00:43:25,006 --> 00:43:29,677
It's all that's left of this enormous temple
that was destroyed by the Romans.

599
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,555
So you're like
reallyJewish.

600
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,598
- What?
- You are, aren't you?

601
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:36,767
- You are.
- No, I'm not.

602
00:43:36,892 --> 00:43:38,769
l-I'm Jewish,
but I'm not reallyJewish.

603
00:43:38,894 --> 00:43:41,646
I don't do anything Jewish.
I don't go to temple or anything.

604
00:43:41,772 --> 00:43:43,982
But I don't know anyJews
that go to temple.

605
00:43:44,107 --> 00:43:46,234
TheJews I know,
they go on one day.

606
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:49,321
- It's Yom Kippur, the Day of Repentance.
- Okay.

607
00:43:49,446 --> 00:43:52,239
Did you know that most temples
are built with moveable walls...

608
00:43:52,323 --> 00:43:55,702
so that on the one day of the year
when everyone comes to repent...

609
00:43:55,785 --> 00:43:58,537
they can actually make the room
big enough to hold everyone?

610
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:01,248
I don't really
believe in God.

611
00:44:01,332 --> 00:44:04,085
- Just Tickle.
- Oh, I believe in Tickle.

612
00:44:06,212 --> 00:44:08,755
- We're not gonna make out or anything.
- What?

613
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:11,633
I'm sorry.
I just totally ruined that moment, didn't I?

614
00:44:11,758 --> 00:44:14,385
- No, no.
- It's just that we're not gonna make out, okay?

615
00:44:14,469 --> 00:44:16,596
- Oh, no, I hadn't planned on trying...
- Oh, my...

616
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:19,265
I am so lame.
That was like really... I am...

617
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:21,517
I'm sorry.
Forget I just said that. I am...

618
00:44:21,642 --> 00:44:23,561
That was dumb. And...

619
00:44:23,644 --> 00:44:26,814
- You know what I do
when I feel completely unoriginal?
- What?

620
00:44:28,107 --> 00:44:31,485
# La, blah, blah
Blah, la, la ##

621
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:35,155
I make a noise or I do something
that no one has ever done before.

622
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,075
And then I can feel unique again
even if it's only for like a second.

623
00:44:39,158 --> 00:44:41,786
So, no one's
ever done that?

624
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:45,999
No, not in this spot. No. You just witnessed
a completely original moment in history.

625
00:44:46,124 --> 00:44:48,584
- It's refreshing. You should try it.
- Oh, no. Thanks.

626
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:51,420
- No, come on.
- I think that was good enough for both of us.

627
00:44:51,504 --> 00:44:53,672
Come on.
What are you, shy?

628
00:44:53,797 --> 00:44:56,091
This is your one opportunity
to do something...

629
00:44:56,174 --> 00:45:00,638
that no one has done before and that no one
will copy again throughout human existence.

630
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:05,142
A-And if nothing else, you'll be remembered
as the one guy who ever did this.

631
00:45:05,225 --> 00:45:07,144
This one thing.

632
00:45:09,312 --> 00:45:11,773
Uh...

633
00:45:16,528 --> 00:45:18,446
How was that?

634
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:20,782
Oh, I've done
that one before.

635
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:22,283
- So, uh...

636
00:45:22,283 --> 00:45:23,242
- So, uh...

637
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:26,329
I gotta go bury this hamster
before the dogs eat him.

638
00:45:26,412 --> 00:45:29,122
Wanna help? Hmm?

639
00:45:40,425 --> 00:45:43,720
- Wow.
- Yeah.

640
00:45:43,845 --> 00:45:46,013
- I mean, this is, uh...
- I know.

641
00:45:46,097 --> 00:45:49,183
It's not that we're bad
pet owners or anything.

642
00:45:49,266 --> 00:45:53,187
It's just, you know, we've had
so many of them over the years.

643
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,522
Besides,
a lot of these are fish.

644
00:45:55,647 --> 00:45:57,733
After you.

645
00:46:05,907 --> 00:46:08,534
All right.

646
00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:13,248
Sit down.

647
00:46:20,421 --> 00:46:22,422
What are you
thinking about?

648
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:26,218
- Now?
- Yeah.

649
00:46:26,343 --> 00:46:29,388
- Right now?
- Yeah.

650
00:46:29,471 --> 00:46:33,308
Right now, I was thinking I've been
going to a lot of these things lately.

651
00:46:33,433 --> 00:46:35,852
- What, dates?
- Not dates.

652
00:46:35,935 --> 00:46:38,980
Is this a date?
This isn't a date.

653
00:46:39,105 --> 00:46:41,065
Funerals.

654
00:46:41,149 --> 00:46:43,109
Why? Who else died?

655
00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:47,113
Oh, uh...

656
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:51,116
That's why I'm home actually. I guess
I haven't even told you that yet. Um...

657
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,455
My mom just died.

658
00:47:02,544 --> 00:47:05,672
God, that's weird
to say that out loud, but, uh...

659
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:09,676
My mom just died.
And, uh...

660
00:47:09,801 --> 00:47:12,303
Yeah, that's why I'm home.

661
00:47:12,428 --> 00:47:14,764
I'm so sorry.

662
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:16,933
God, I'm so sorry.

663
00:47:17,016 --> 00:47:19,893
And here I am, like, putting you
through another one of these.

664
00:47:19,976 --> 00:47:21,937
Not thatJelly's like
anywhere near your mom's.

665
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,773
I mean,
we loved Jelly but...

666
00:47:24,898 --> 00:47:26,817
I'm so sorry.

667
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,611
No, it's okay.
It's all right.

668
00:47:29,736 --> 00:47:31,654
I'm all right with it.

669
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,449
Anyway, I think it's
what she wanted, so...

670
00:47:34,532 --> 00:47:36,951
How'd she die?

671
00:47:38,536 --> 00:47:40,496
She drowned actually.

672
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:45,918
Yeah, my, uh...
My mother was a paraplegic.

673
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:48,545
She was in a wheelchair
so she, uh...

674
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,797
You know, and, uh...

675
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:52,966
I guess she was
taking a bath...

676
00:47:53,092 --> 00:47:55,093
and she must have
slipped or something.

677
00:47:55,177 --> 00:47:58,137
That's what they say.
I don't... I don't know. But...

678
00:47:58,221 --> 00:48:00,264
needless to say,
she drowned and...

679
00:48:00,348 --> 00:48:03,351
that's how she...
sh-she died.

680
00:48:03,476 --> 00:48:05,854
When?

681
00:48:05,979 --> 00:48:08,356
This was, uh...

682
00:48:09,398 --> 00:48:11,359
Sunday.

683
00:48:11,442 --> 00:48:13,736
Oh, my God.

684
00:48:19,324 --> 00:48:21,201
Why are you crying?

685
00:48:23,245 --> 00:48:25,205
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

686
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:28,791
Because... I'm not
usually like this.

687
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:33,379
It's just like...
It's just so sad.

688
00:48:33,505 --> 00:48:36,048
You know, it's like...

689
00:48:36,173 --> 00:48:39,051
It's so tragic, isn't it?
It is. It's like...

690
00:48:39,135 --> 00:48:42,971
It's like real life
tragedy or something.

691
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:46,016
Anyway, let's change
the subject, okay?

692
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:48,184
Let's really bring
the focus back toJelly...

693
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:51,396
'cause what could be ruder than talking
about someone else who died...

694
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:54,190
when you're in the act of
burying a close friend?

695
00:48:54,274 --> 00:48:58,486
- Well, what should we do?
- I don't know. I've only been
to one of these things.

696
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,696
You appear to be
the expert.

697
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:03,658
Well, we usually
say something.

698
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:06,536
Okay, uh,
I'll go first. Um...

699
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:11,623
Didn't really know you, Jelly.
From what I hear, you were a good pet.

700
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:14,168
- Little trouble with the wheel but...
- That's not funny.

701
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:22,050
Jelly, you were
a great pet.

702
00:49:24,343 --> 00:49:27,388
I'm sorry I forgot to take
the wheel out of your cage.

703
00:49:27,513 --> 00:49:30,266
I'm so, so sorry
about that.

704
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:33,852
Good-bye.

705
00:49:33,936 --> 00:49:36,104
I hope that you liked me.

706
00:50:19,479 --> 00:50:21,606
Holy shit! You scared
the shit out of me.

707
00:50:21,731 --> 00:50:24,817
- Why are you always doing that?
- I haven't seen you in a while.

708
00:50:24,942 --> 00:50:27,319
I know. I've been catching up
with people around here.

709
00:50:27,445 --> 00:50:30,906
Dr. Cohen called.
There's nothing wrong with you.

710
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:34,159
Yeah, I think I'm starting
to figure that out myself.

711
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:37,996
- When are you thinking of leaving?
- Uh, probably tomorrow.

712
00:50:38,122 --> 00:50:42,291
Um, you know, I got a lot of stuff
I got to take care of in L.A.

713
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:45,837
- Probably have to find a newjob, so...
- We need to talk.

714
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,924
Yeah, uh, how?
I mean, when?

715
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:53,636
What are you
doing... now?

716
00:50:55,388 --> 00:50:59,266
Uh, now's not so good. I told my friend Mark
I was gonna meet up with him.

717
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:01,351
But how about, uh,
like later tonight?

718
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:04,687
- Okay. Then we'll talk.
- Yeah.

719
00:51:04,813 --> 00:51:06,857
We owe that
to each other.

720
00:51:07,983 --> 00:51:09,859
Yeah.

721
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,986
We owe it to her.

722
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:15,865
Yeah.

723
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,867
Good.

724
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,911
Sorry I scared you.

725
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,999
How could you
leave all that lithium?

726
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:27,751
I was totally going to
hit you up for some, man.

727
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:31,171
This fucking guy.
I'm glad you're back, man.

728
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:35,050
This town is so messed up.
Everyone's got their drug of choice.

729
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:38,303
It's like in Brave New World.
You ever read that book?

730
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:42,682
Who wrote that?
Um, Aldous... Aldous something.

731
00:51:42,807 --> 00:51:45,851
Aldous, uh...
Anyway...

732
00:51:45,935 --> 00:51:50,397
there's like Alphas and Betas
and Epsilons and all sorts of people.

733
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:06,329
Huxtable.

734
00:52:06,412 --> 00:52:10,708
Aldous Huxtable.
That's it, bro.

735
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:29,851
Andrew, would you like
to see Sam's ice-skating tape?

736
00:52:29,977 --> 00:52:31,770
- Mom, no.
- Absolutely.

737
00:52:31,853 --> 00:52:35,274
She was so ahead of her time.
She could have gone to the Olympics.

738
00:52:35,357 --> 00:52:37,359
No, no, no, no.
I couldn't have.

739
00:52:37,484 --> 00:52:39,694
Yes, you could have.
Don't blame it on the epilepsy.

740
00:52:39,819 --> 00:52:43,447
- You had a gift.
- Come on. Let me see it.

741
00:52:43,531 --> 00:52:47,326
Let's just show him the "Florida Stars
of the Ice"opening. The gator costume.

742
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:51,539
- Mom, I'm asking you, seriously.
- Come on. Don't be shy. Let me see it!

743
00:52:51,664 --> 00:52:55,876
Oh, she wants you to see it. How could you
not want him to see how talented you are?

744
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:59,337
- Were.
- Come on.

745
00:52:59,421 --> 00:53:01,924
- Come on.
- Ohh!

746
00:53:04,051 --> 00:53:06,678
- Honey, what are you doing?
- I'm dusting for prints.

747
00:53:06,761 --> 00:53:08,971
Well, could we move
the crime scene into the kitchen?

748
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:10,973
I want to show Andrew
Sam's skating.

749
00:53:11,057 --> 00:53:14,518
But someone's been pissing on my GameCube,
and I'm about to close the case.

750
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:16,687
It wasn't me, Your Honor.

751
00:53:16,771 --> 00:53:19,231
The paw prints
point to a canine. Hmm.

752
00:53:19,356 --> 00:53:21,525
Andrew, come on.
Sit down here on the couch.

753
00:53:21,608 --> 00:53:24,528
I can't believe you're
actually showing him this.

754
00:53:27,823 --> 00:53:30,033
Look, there she is.

755
00:53:43,212 --> 00:53:47,299
- You're the alligator?
- You can tell by the hands.

756
00:54:10,779 --> 00:54:14,283
- Here comes the double axel.
- And...

757
00:54:14,408 --> 00:54:18,746
- Land! Oh, I mean, come on. Is she good?
- Wow, she's great.

758
00:54:22,374 --> 00:54:25,418
- All right.
- Wow.

759
00:54:25,502 --> 00:54:28,796
- Shut up.
- No, I mean, your mom was right.
You're really good.

760
00:54:30,673 --> 00:54:33,300
- This is awesome, but we gotta go.
- All right.

761
00:54:33,426 --> 00:54:35,637
- Just wanted to show how talented you are.
- Mom, come on!

762
00:54:35,762 --> 00:54:37,513
My baby!
All right, go on!

763
00:54:37,638 --> 00:54:40,516
Go on. Get away.
Wait a minute.

764
00:54:40,641 --> 00:54:42,768
Gimme a hug.

765
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:45,312
I love you so much.
I'm so proud of you.

766
00:54:45,396 --> 00:54:47,439
- I love you too.
- Have a good night.

767
00:54:47,523 --> 00:54:49,983
- Thanks for dinner.
- Come on! You're giving me a hug too.

768
00:54:50,066 --> 00:54:52,819
- Mom! Come on.
- I'll take a hug.

769
00:55:01,452 --> 00:55:04,455
- Good night. See you later, Tim.
- Bye, Tim.

770
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:07,583
- Peace out, player.

771
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:10,711
I don't know. It was
the only thing I ever liked doing.

772
00:55:10,836 --> 00:55:13,088
Pretending
to be someone else.

773
00:55:13,172 --> 00:55:17,342
I've been so out of it lately, the only parts
I get offered are playing handicapped people.

774
00:55:17,467 --> 00:55:19,428
- That is not funny.

775
00:55:19,511 --> 00:55:21,888
Oh, come on.
You gotta see that's a joke.

776
00:55:22,013 --> 00:55:25,892
If you can't laugh at yourself, life's gonna seem
a whole lot longer than you'd like.

777
00:55:26,017 --> 00:55:28,019
All right, so what are
we laughing at you about?

778
00:55:28,144 --> 00:55:31,647
Mm.
I lied again.

779
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:35,818
- I have epilepsy.
- Which part are we laughing about?

780
00:55:37,027 --> 00:55:39,572
I, um...

781
00:55:39,697 --> 00:55:41,949
I had a seizure at
the law office where I work.

782
00:55:42,032 --> 00:55:45,368
And they told me their insurance wouldn't
cover me unless I wore preventative covering.

783
00:55:45,493 --> 00:55:50,165
- What's preventative covering?
- The helmet I was wearing.

784
00:55:50,248 --> 00:55:52,166
Oh, come on!

785
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,168
That's funny.
That's really funny.

786
00:55:54,251 --> 00:55:56,504
I mean, I'm the only person
who wears a helmet to work...

787
00:55:56,629 --> 00:56:01,258
who isn't, like, putting out fires,
or, like, racing for NASCAR.

788
00:56:01,383 --> 00:56:04,970
Well, what do you do? I mean,
I can't quit. Their insurance is amazing.

789
00:56:05,054 --> 00:56:07,514
What do you do?
You laugh, you know?

790
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:12,143
I'm not saying I don't cry.
But in-between, I laugh.

791
00:56:12,227 --> 00:56:15,313
And I realize how silly it is
to take anything too seriously.

792
00:56:17,065 --> 00:56:20,193
Plus, I look forward
to a good cry.

793
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:22,195
Feels pretty good.

794
00:56:24,113 --> 00:56:27,367
I haven't cried since
I was a little kid.

795
00:56:27,492 --> 00:56:31,621
I didn't cry at my mother's funeral.
I tried, you know?

796
00:56:31,746 --> 00:56:33,873
I thought of all the saddest
things I could think of.

797
00:56:33,998 --> 00:56:37,792
Like, things in movies, this...

798
00:56:37,917 --> 00:56:40,254
There's this image from Life magazine
that's always haunted me.

799
00:56:40,337 --> 00:56:42,881
I just focused in on it,
you know?

800
00:56:43,006 --> 00:56:45,717
But nothing came.

801
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,761
That actually made me
sadder than anything...

802
00:56:47,844 --> 00:56:50,304
the fact that
I just felt so numb.

803
00:56:50,429 --> 00:56:53,099
- What do you mean?
- Just that...

804
00:56:53,224 --> 00:56:56,310
Hey, Vagina.!

805
00:56:56,435 --> 00:57:01,607
Hey, what's up, guys? Uh, Sam,
that's Mark, Dave and you rememberJesse.

806
00:57:01,732 --> 00:57:03,734
- Hey.
- What's up?

807
00:57:03,817 --> 00:57:06,820
Hey, nice to meet you. I'm sorry
I said "vagina"just now.

808
00:57:06,945 --> 00:57:09,072
- I didn't know you were here.
- Oh, that's okay.

809
00:57:09,156 --> 00:57:13,910
- Nice. Let's get fucked up.

810
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:19,248
One, two, three! Whoo!

811
00:57:25,004 --> 00:57:28,674
- What are you doing?
- Largeman, get the fuck in the pool.!

812
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,176
- It's so warm!

813
00:57:31,302 --> 00:57:33,679
Can't you swim?

814
00:57:33,804 --> 00:57:35,847
Of course I can swim.

815
00:57:54,073 --> 00:57:57,159
Dude, maybe you should stay on the steps.
I don't know C.P.R.

816
00:57:58,368 --> 00:58:01,913
- You look like a wet beaver.

817
00:58:16,177 --> 00:58:19,513
There's a handful
of normal kid things I kind of missed.

818
00:58:19,597 --> 00:58:23,350
There's a handful of normal
kid things I kind of wish I'd missed.

819
00:58:25,185 --> 00:58:28,814
You know that point in your life when
you realize the house you grew up in...

820
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:30,857
isn't really
your home anymore.

821
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:34,569
All of a sudden, even though you have
some place where you put your shit...

822
00:58:34,694 --> 00:58:37,154
that idea of home is gone.

823
00:58:39,532 --> 00:58:42,785
I still feel at home
in my house.

824
00:58:42,869 --> 00:58:47,373
You'll see one day when you move out.
Just sorta happens one day, and it's gone.

825
00:58:47,498 --> 00:58:51,042
You feel like you
can never get it back.

826
00:58:51,168 --> 00:58:54,004
It's like you feel homesick
for a place that doesn't even exist.

827
00:58:57,215 --> 00:58:59,718
Maybe it's like
this rite of passage, you know?

828
00:58:59,843 --> 00:59:03,554
You won't ever have that feeling again until
you create a new idea of home for yourself.

829
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:06,849
You know, for... For your kids.
For the family you start.

830
00:59:06,974 --> 00:59:09,435
It's like a cycle
or something.

831
00:59:11,186 --> 00:59:14,106
I don't know. But I miss
the idea of it, you know?

832
00:59:17,693 --> 00:59:21,197
Maybe that's all
family really is.

833
00:59:21,322 --> 00:59:24,533
A group of people that miss
the same imaginary place.

834
00:59:35,085 --> 00:59:37,045
Maybe.

835
00:59:49,389 --> 00:59:51,892
How about some
fuckin' furniture, dude?

836
00:59:51,976 --> 00:59:54,561
I bought a chair,
but I didn't like it.

837
00:59:54,644 --> 00:59:56,730
- Where is it?
- It's keeping us warm.

838
01:00:05,822 --> 01:00:09,325
- Silent Velcro.

839
01:00:10,493 --> 01:00:13,036
- You lucky motherfucker.

840
01:00:13,121 --> 01:00:16,665
I feel like if I had showed up at school
and presented the idea of silent Velcro...

841
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:19,126
they would have sent me away
a whole lot sooner.

842
01:00:19,251 --> 01:00:22,838
- Why did they send you away?
- Oh. Listen to this girl.

843
01:00:22,963 --> 01:00:26,133
- They didn't "send me away."
- You just said they sent you away.

844
01:00:26,258 --> 01:00:28,593
I mean, they sent me away.
They sent me to boarding school.

845
01:00:28,676 --> 01:00:31,137
"Sent me away" sounds like
I went to some asylum or something.

846
01:00:31,221 --> 01:00:34,849
- There were no straps involved.
- Why did they send you to boarding school?

847
01:00:36,308 --> 01:00:38,519
They sent me to
boarding school because...

848
01:00:38,644 --> 01:00:40,855
they thought
I might be dangerous.

849
01:00:42,439 --> 01:00:44,733
"Oh, are you freaked out?
You're like running for the door.

850
01:00:44,816 --> 01:00:47,110
- You can go. It's okay. Don't feel bad."
- That's really funny.

851
01:00:47,236 --> 01:00:49,696
- It's really funny.

852
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:51,698
Why would they think
you'd be dangerous?

853
01:00:51,823 --> 01:00:54,367
You're like
a little detective.

854
01:00:54,492 --> 01:00:56,286
- Want to know?
- Yeah.

855
01:00:56,369 --> 01:00:59,247
- You're gay.

856
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:02,417
No. Drumroll.

857
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,800
I was the reason
she was in a wheelchair.

858
01:01:11,884 --> 01:01:13,844
I pushed her.

859
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:17,347
So there that is.

860
01:01:19,641 --> 01:01:21,893
- Shut up!
- Fuck off.

861
01:01:22,018 --> 01:01:25,229
- No. That's the truth.
- Why?

862
01:01:25,354 --> 01:01:27,523
It was just a complete
freak accident, you know?

863
01:01:27,649 --> 01:01:30,818
It's one of those things you replay
a million times in your head...

864
01:01:30,944 --> 01:01:34,655
and you see how clearly it was
just a complete freak thing.

865
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,825
My-My whole life, she was
depressed for no reason.

866
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:39,993
And... one day,
you know...

867
01:01:40,077 --> 01:01:42,412
I was a little kid.
I was nine years old...

868
01:01:42,537 --> 01:01:45,332
and I just
hated her for that.

869
01:01:45,415 --> 01:01:47,876
And... I pushed her.

870
01:01:48,001 --> 01:01:50,378
And it was innocent.
I was just completely frustrated.

871
01:01:50,503 --> 01:01:52,547
- 'Cause...
- 'Cause you couldn't make her happy?

872
01:01:52,672 --> 01:01:56,050
Yeah! Fuck, yeah!
And any other time, you know...

873
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:59,762
any other day, she would havejust
yelled at me and sent me to my room.

874
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:02,514
But this day...

875
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:05,226
on this particular day...

876
01:02:05,351 --> 01:02:09,188
the door of the dishwasher...

877
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:11,773
had fallen open...
the latch on it was broken.

878
01:02:11,898 --> 01:02:14,192
And it would just
randomly fall open.

879
01:02:14,275 --> 01:02:17,028
That fuckin' latch,
you know.

880
01:02:17,153 --> 01:02:21,949
It's really amazing how much of my life has been
determined by a quarter-inch piece of plastic.

881
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:23,951
But...

882
01:02:24,076 --> 01:02:26,787
So, anyway, she, uh...
she fell back over the door...

883
01:02:26,912 --> 01:02:31,333
and, uh, hit her neck on the kitchen counter,
paralyzing her from the waist down.

884
01:02:33,753 --> 01:02:37,214
- Wow.
- Still want to compare fucked-up families?

885
01:02:37,297 --> 01:02:39,924
But your mom was in the wheelchair
long before you left.

886
01:02:40,049 --> 01:02:43,052
Yeah. Well, I was nine.

887
01:02:43,136 --> 01:02:46,180
So they sent me to therapy
and put me on these drugs...

888
01:02:46,264 --> 01:02:48,391
that were supposed to
"curb my anger,"

889
01:02:48,474 --> 01:02:51,394
and I've been on some
form of them ever since.

890
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:56,065
And when I was 16, my psychiatrist dad
came around to the conclusion that...

891
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:59,902
it probably wasn't the best environment
for me to be growing up in, so...

892
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:02,070
he sent me to boarding school.

893
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,698
- And I haven't been home since.
- Until now.

894
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:08,410
- For her funeral.
- Till now for her funeral.

895
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,123
I can't believe the retarded
quarterback's a pill-popper.

896
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:17,335
- Jesse?

897
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,254
Where's the sauna?

898
01:03:20,337 --> 01:03:22,840
- I'll show her.
- No, l-I got it.

899
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,217
- No, you get her a towel.
- Wait. Wait.

900
01:03:28,345 --> 01:03:31,097
Want a ride, sweetheart?

901
01:03:42,817 --> 01:03:44,985
You're in it
right now, aren't you?

902
01:03:45,111 --> 01:03:48,281
- What do you mean?
- My mom always says that when she can see...

903
01:03:48,364 --> 01:03:51,992
I'm, like, working something out in my head,
she's like, "You're in it right now."

904
01:03:52,117 --> 01:03:54,328
And I'm lookin' at you,
and you're...

905
01:03:54,453 --> 01:03:57,372
telling me
that story, and...

906
01:03:57,497 --> 01:03:59,624
you're definitely
in it right now.

907
01:04:01,001 --> 01:04:03,420
I think you're right.
I am in it.

908
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:09,425
Okay. I mean, whatever. All right.
Can we just change the subject, okay?

909
01:04:09,509 --> 01:04:12,303
Let's just... Let's just
talk about good stuff.

910
01:04:12,386 --> 01:04:17,975
- Good stuff?
- Yeah, like "glass half-full" shit.

911
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:21,895
- What do you got?
- Got a little buzz. Got that.

912
01:04:23,356 --> 01:04:25,608
- What you got?
- I got a little buzz goin'

913
01:04:29,236 --> 01:04:31,196
And I like you.

914
01:04:38,745 --> 01:04:42,749
So there's that.
I guess I have that.

915
01:04:48,879 --> 01:04:51,298
I can tap-dance.
You want to see me tap-dance?

916
01:04:51,382 --> 01:04:53,592
I would love
to see you tap-dance.

917
01:06:17,796 --> 01:06:22,384
- What are you doing?
- You collect Desert Storm trading cards?

918
01:06:22,467 --> 01:06:25,012
Fuck yeah. Those things
are collector's items, man.

919
01:06:25,137 --> 01:06:27,847
You have any idea how much
those things are gonna be worth one day?

920
01:06:27,973 --> 01:06:30,600
- Really?
- Hell, yeah. That's just like an investment.

921
01:06:30,683 --> 01:06:32,644
I have lots of little investments
all over the place.

922
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:35,688
One day I'm gonna sell all of'em
just fuckin' live off of it.

923
01:06:36,981 --> 01:06:38,983
So, like how much
is this one worth?

924
01:06:39,108 --> 01:06:43,279
- Which?
- "Night Vision Goggles."

925
01:06:43,404 --> 01:06:46,573
I don't know. Mint?
Uh, two, maybe three.

926
01:06:46,657 --> 01:06:48,742
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

927
01:06:48,825 --> 01:06:52,203
It's too early. You don't sell 'em yet.
Don't you know anything about investing?

928
01:06:52,328 --> 01:06:54,330
I'm gonna
live off that shit.

929
01:06:54,455 --> 01:06:57,000
If you have a complete set,
it's worth, like, thousands.

930
01:06:57,125 --> 01:07:00,753
- So do you have the complete set?
- Almost.

931
01:07:00,836 --> 01:07:04,465
The corners are bent on my "Friendly Fire,"
and someone stole my "Wolf Blitzer."

932
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:14,183
Now, look.
Whaddya got to do today? 'Cause, uh...

933
01:07:14,308 --> 01:07:16,351
I got you a little
going-away present...

934
01:07:16,476 --> 01:07:20,897
but, uh, I gotta kind of
track it down first.

935
01:07:21,022 --> 01:07:25,527
- So can you give me a ride?
- Uh, yeah. I just, uh...

936
01:07:25,652 --> 01:07:29,948
- What?
- No, nothin'. I just, uh...

937
01:07:30,031 --> 01:07:32,533
Say it. Speak.

938
01:07:35,036 --> 01:07:37,871
I kinda told Sam I was gonna
hang out with her today.

939
01:07:37,996 --> 01:07:41,041
- So, uh...
- She can come. I don't care.

940
01:08:44,268 --> 01:08:46,269
I can't believe we're in
fucking Handi-World.

941
01:08:46,352 --> 01:08:48,271
I really don't want
to be in Handi-World.

942
01:08:48,354 --> 01:08:50,940
We're getting money
for your present. Don't look so guilty.

943
01:08:51,065 --> 01:08:54,068
- How do I look guilty?
- Andrew Largeman?

944
01:08:54,193 --> 01:08:56,112
- Oh, no. Benson.
- Oh, no.

945
01:08:56,237 --> 01:08:58,197
- Who is that?
- Just don't give him your number.

946
01:08:58,281 --> 01:09:00,408
Hey, man. What's up?

947
01:09:00,533 --> 01:09:02,451
- Holy shit!
- How's it goin'?

948
01:09:02,535 --> 01:09:05,495
- I haven't seen you since, like, junior year.
- Yeah.

949
01:09:05,621 --> 01:09:09,416
- I thought you killed yourself.
- What?

950
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:12,460
I thought
you killed yourself.

951
01:09:12,585 --> 01:09:16,088
- That wasn't you?
- No, no. That wasn't me.

952
01:09:16,172 --> 01:09:19,676
- Who killed themselves?
- That was the Gleason kid.

953
01:09:19,801 --> 01:09:21,343
- Oh.
- Oh, and Tina.

954
01:09:21,468 --> 01:09:23,429
- Tina who?
- You remember Tina.

955
01:09:23,512 --> 01:09:26,307
- She was anorexic, did gymnastics...
- Oh, gymnastics Tina?

956
01:09:26,432 --> 01:09:29,518
- How'd she do it?
- I don't know. She wasn'tJewish. I didn't bury her.

957
01:09:29,643 --> 01:09:34,022
I think it was sleeping pills.
Or that car in the garage thing. I forgot.

958
01:09:37,067 --> 01:09:39,695
- Uh, sorry, this is Sam, Karl. Karl, Sam?
- Hey.

959
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:42,197
- Hey.
- I gotta go find that thing.

960
01:09:42,322 --> 01:09:45,700
- Uh, you two stay here. I'll be right back.
- Is it heavy, or... Okay.

961
01:09:45,825 --> 01:09:50,120
- Hey, weren't you on a TV show or something?
- Yeah, it was just this show.

962
01:09:50,245 --> 01:09:52,457
So, uh, you're like
workin' here. That's cool.

963
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:55,751
Only for a little while.
I'm opening my own business.

964
01:09:55,835 --> 01:09:57,837
Actually, I should
talk to you about it.

965
01:09:57,962 --> 01:10:00,714
I'm lookin' for smart people
like you, Large.

966
01:10:00,839 --> 01:10:05,177
- I should get your number.
- Yeah, definitely. That'd be... That'd be cool.

967
01:10:05,302 --> 01:10:07,762
I'd like to talk
to you... both...

968
01:10:07,846 --> 01:10:12,809
about a good opportunity
for you and your loved ones.

969
01:10:12,934 --> 01:10:15,061
We all have dreams.
I know I do!

970
01:10:15,186 --> 01:10:19,440
I'd like to talk to you about an exciting
opportunity that people are talking about.

971
01:10:19,523 --> 01:10:22,651
- We gotta get goin'.
- Oh, okay. It was good to see you, Karl.

972
01:10:22,776 --> 01:10:24,695
- Hey, I should get your number.
- Yeah, definitely.

973
01:10:24,778 --> 01:10:27,615
Well, I'll call you because
I think he has it in his book.

974
01:10:27,698 --> 01:10:29,616
Nice to meet you.

975
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:32,577
Why is it always the losers that get
caught up in the pyramid schemes?

976
01:10:32,702 --> 01:10:36,038
Why can't it be some charming, hot girl
nagging you incessantly to buy some shit?

977
01:10:36,164 --> 01:10:39,584
- Is that what he's doin'?
- Yeah. It's detergent or some shit.

978
01:10:39,709 --> 01:10:42,754
Why are you buying knives?
I don't need knives.

979
01:10:42,879 --> 01:10:45,715
- I'd like to return these.
- You got a receipt?

980
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,927
- Actually, no. They're a gift.
- Why are you returning these?

981
01:10:50,052 --> 01:10:53,264
- They're not sharp enough.
- They're not sharp enough?

982
01:10:53,389 --> 01:10:55,724
No. Not for what
we need them for.

983
01:10:55,849 --> 01:10:59,770
- They couldn't cut cans.
- You bought them to cut cans?

984
01:10:59,895 --> 01:11:03,189
No, but in the commercial,
it said if I wanted to cut cans, I could.

985
01:11:03,314 --> 01:11:06,234
- With these knives, I can't.
- It comes with a sharpener.

986
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:11,406
- Did you try it?
- Yeah. They're just...

987
01:11:11,531 --> 01:11:14,992
- I don't want them. They're not sharp enough.
- Okay.

988
01:11:18,412 --> 01:11:21,790
A major loophole in the Handi-World
return policy is that they permit returns...

989
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:24,834
without receipts
on items below $40.

990
01:11:24,918 --> 01:11:26,961
So, how often do you go?

991
01:11:27,086 --> 01:11:30,799
I hit every employee once,
and then I wait until they hire new ones.

992
01:11:30,924 --> 01:11:33,176
Luckily, nobody stays at
Handi-World for very long.

993
01:11:33,259 --> 01:11:36,554
- Except for Karl Benson.
- You know, Mark, it's my last day in town.

994
01:11:36,679 --> 01:11:39,348
- If you need money, I could loan you some.
- I don't need your money.

995
01:11:39,432 --> 01:11:42,601
- I'm making my own right now.
- Fuck, take Jesse's. The guy's a millionaire.

996
01:11:42,726 --> 01:11:45,062
I don't take anybody's money.
Okay, Andrew?

997
01:11:45,145 --> 01:11:47,230
I make my own.
Favors are bad news.

998
01:11:47,314 --> 01:11:50,693
The only thing worse than a favor
is a favor involving money. Okay?

999
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:55,363
Let's go. I gotta see
a guy about a nitrous tank.

1000
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:41,866
- What is this place?

1001
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:44,493
I think you can see
into the hotel rooms.

1002
01:12:53,209 --> 01:12:57,171
Oh, yeah!
Ohh! Ohh! Yeah!

1003
01:13:12,687 --> 01:13:14,855
I'm gonna fuckin' cum.!

1004
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,860
That shit was hot.
That shit was hot.

1005
01:13:20,944 --> 01:13:23,488
I gotta go drop some knowledge
on that ho right there.

1006
01:13:23,572 --> 01:13:26,157
How do you know
she's a hooker?

1007
01:13:26,282 --> 01:13:28,409
Of course she's
a fuckin' hooker.

1008
01:13:28,534 --> 01:13:31,495
Girls who look like her do not
fuck guys that look like him...

1009
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,872
unless it's for
coke, money or fame.

1010
01:13:33,998 --> 01:13:37,084
Well, Julia Roberts
married Lyle Lovett.

1011
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:40,629
- Who the fuck are you?
- This is Sam. This is Large.

1012
01:13:40,713 --> 01:13:44,007
No offense, man. But why are you
bringing these fuckin' people here?

1013
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:46,927
This is the guy who
needs that thing. Wait.

1014
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:50,013
I brought you
the tank. Okay?

1015
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:53,683
- Could you just tell us where to go now?
- That thing come with balloons?

1016
01:13:53,808 --> 01:13:56,894
What am I, a fuckin' birthday clown?
No. It doesn't come with balloons.

1017
01:13:57,019 --> 01:13:59,772
Suck it off the tap. And I need
it back when you're done...

1018
01:13:59,897 --> 01:14:02,108
- because that guy's holdin' my 39 bucks.
- All right.

1019
01:14:02,233 --> 01:14:04,110
Hold up. Hold up!

1020
01:14:04,235 --> 01:14:06,570
Who here just
saw some titties?

1021
01:14:06,695 --> 01:14:11,367
Raise you hand if you
just saw some titties. Hmm?

1022
01:14:14,953 --> 01:14:18,039
Thank you! So everybody
just calm the fuck down!

1023
01:14:19,415 --> 01:14:22,835
Now. You know where
Kiernan's Quarry is?

1024
01:14:22,919 --> 01:14:25,630
- Down in Newark, right?
- Yeah.

1025
01:14:25,755 --> 01:14:27,840
It's at the bottom of
Hillside and Rivington.

1026
01:14:27,923 --> 01:14:30,385
You can't really see it
from the street, but it's there.

1027
01:14:30,468 --> 01:14:33,303
Park your car at the gate
and hop the fence.

1028
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:38,017
At the bottom of the quarry, there's this
junkyard run by this guy named... Albert.

1029
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:41,186
He's the one that tracked down
the piece you're lookin'for. All right?

1030
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:43,772
I'll call him right now
and tell him to expect you.

1031
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:46,858
Okay, stop. What
the fuck are we doin'?

1032
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:49,068
- Just be patient, man.
- We've been patient all day...

1033
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:51,487
but it's my last day and you haven't
told us what we're doin'.

1034
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:54,282
If you told me we were going on a six-hour hunt
for blow, I would've passed.

1035
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:58,536
If I was gonna get you coke, we would've gone
to the fuckin' high school football practice.

1036
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:00,788
We would have been
rolling five hours ago.

1037
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,873
I think we corrupted
this innocent girl enough.

1038
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:06,293
- I'm not innocent!
- Yes, you are! All right?
That's what I like about you.

1039
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:09,296
I don't want this guy taking you to,
like, some sketchy quarry...

1040
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:12,382
in the middle of nowhere to find, like,
crack whores huffing turpentine...

1041
01:15:12,465 --> 01:15:16,052
or pit bulls raping each other
or whatever it is you have us doing!

1042
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:21,182
Wow. That's like the most
worked-up I've ever seen you.

1043
01:15:21,307 --> 01:15:24,894
- He was protecting me.
- So?

1044
01:15:24,977 --> 01:15:28,147
- He likes me.
- Don't be cute.

1045
01:15:28,272 --> 01:15:30,566
He's my knight
in shining armor.

1046
01:15:30,649 --> 01:15:33,985
Don't talk about knights in front of Mark.
It's a sore subject.

1047
01:15:35,946 --> 01:15:39,575
- I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.
- Pun intended?

1048
01:15:39,658 --> 01:15:42,452
- Oh, you're fuckin'...

1049
01:15:45,205 --> 01:15:47,790
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1050
01:15:47,873 --> 01:15:49,834
Ow! Ow!

1051
01:15:51,961 --> 01:15:54,338
- Oh, my God.
- Wow!

1052
01:15:54,421 --> 01:15:56,381
I never even knew
this was here.

1053
01:15:56,506 --> 01:15:59,551
I've heard about it. They were
supposed to build a mall here, I think.

1054
01:15:59,676 --> 01:16:03,180
Yeah. I remember reading about that
in the paper, that they were...

1055
01:16:03,305 --> 01:16:06,140
digging or something, and they break
into this natural phenomenon.

1056
01:16:06,225 --> 01:16:08,602
It's like an underground
Grand Canyon or something.

1057
01:16:08,685 --> 01:16:12,105
Now they're in some huge legal battle
over whether they can build here or not.

1058
01:16:12,188 --> 01:16:16,192
Can you imagine the guy whose job it is
to fight for his right to build a mall...

1059
01:16:16,317 --> 01:16:18,569
- on some, like, geological phenomenon?

1060
01:16:18,694 --> 01:16:21,697
They love their
malls here, man.

1061
01:16:21,822 --> 01:16:24,283
All right. Let's find
this guy and get out of here.

1062
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:27,953
- You're not gonna tell us what we're getting?
- It's a surprise. You'll see.

1063
01:16:28,036 --> 01:16:30,789
- I think it's gonna rain.

1064
01:16:35,543 --> 01:16:39,088
So this is it.

1065
01:16:39,214 --> 01:16:44,343
So knock! Knock and barter
for Desert Storm trading cards.

1066
01:16:44,426 --> 01:16:48,014
Don't tease me about my hobbies.
I don't tease you about being an asshole.

1067
01:16:50,057 --> 01:16:52,143
Okay!

1068
01:17:03,569 --> 01:17:05,530
- Mark?
- Yeah. Albert?

1069
01:17:06,697 --> 01:17:08,741
Come on in.

1070
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:15,956
Oh, man. You guys
must be freezing.

1071
01:17:16,081 --> 01:17:19,209
Make yourselves warm by the fire.
I'm just gonna go put her down.

1072
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:21,378
Okay? I'll be
right back out.

1073
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:31,388
Ah, I must say, I'm continually impressed
with how each place you bring us...

1074
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:34,849
- continues to be weirder and weirder.
- What do you mean? This is nice.

1075
01:17:34,933 --> 01:17:38,769
Oh, nothing. Just hangin' out on an old boat
at the bottom of a quarry in Newark.

1076
01:17:38,895 --> 01:17:41,022
It's hardly
the bottom, dude.

1077
01:17:41,105 --> 01:17:43,107
Did you check out
that cliff down there?

1078
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:47,027
Hey.! This is my wife, Faye.

1079
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:49,572
Hi.! Welcome.

1080
01:17:49,655 --> 01:17:52,741
Please. Have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.

1081
01:17:56,119 --> 01:17:58,663
Man, it's really
comin' down out there.

1082
01:17:58,788 --> 01:18:00,790
- It just started pouring all of a sudden.
- Well...

1083
01:18:00,915 --> 01:18:05,252
in a bad storm, I like to pretend that
this old boat's my own private ark.

1084
01:18:05,336 --> 01:18:08,422
Um, unfortunately,
if this is the apocalypse...

1085
01:18:08,505 --> 01:18:11,592
- I'm not quite sure it still floats.
- Yeah, I don't know.

1086
01:18:11,675 --> 01:18:15,346
- Listen, would anybody like some tea?
- I'd love some. Thank you.

1087
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:18,390
- Do you want some? I'll be right back.

1088
01:18:19,808 --> 01:18:22,644
What is this place?
What is it that you do down here?

1089
01:18:22,769 --> 01:18:24,771
Well, we're calling it
Kiernan's Fault. It's, uh...

1090
01:18:24,855 --> 01:18:27,858
No one really knows what it is because
we haven't been able to explore it.

1091
01:18:27,983 --> 01:18:30,860
Meanwhile, while they're locked
in litigation, they hired me...

1092
01:18:30,985 --> 01:18:34,572
- to make sure no one comes inside.
- Wow.

1093
01:18:34,655 --> 01:18:38,493
But what they don't know is
that at night I climb down.

1094
01:18:38,618 --> 01:18:41,411
So, how deep does it go?
Thank you.

1095
01:18:41,495 --> 01:18:44,039
You know... Thank you.
No one really knows.

1096
01:18:44,164 --> 01:18:47,001
But I like to pretend
it's infinite.

1097
01:18:47,126 --> 01:18:49,794
It's kind of an odd job.

1098
01:18:49,878 --> 01:18:54,007
- Guardian of an infinite abyss.
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is.

1099
01:18:54,132 --> 01:18:56,593
But we also trade and deal
in antique jewelry.

1100
01:18:57,969 --> 01:19:01,890
I suppose it is odd that
we live down here like this.

1101
01:19:02,015 --> 01:19:04,892
- No.
- Not at all.
- Never crossed my mind.

1102
01:19:05,017 --> 01:19:08,354
Well, we think it's important.

1103
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:12,566
Why? What is it that you
think you're gonna find?

1104
01:19:12,691 --> 01:19:15,318
I guess I just like the idea
of discovering something.

1105
01:19:15,402 --> 01:19:18,655
Of doing something
that's completely unique...

1106
01:19:18,738 --> 01:19:20,740
that's never
been done before.

1107
01:19:20,865 --> 01:19:23,910
- "Albert's Abyss."
- Well, maybe. Who knows?

1108
01:19:24,035 --> 01:19:27,455
But, you know what?
That's all ego.

1109
01:19:27,539 --> 01:19:31,333
None of that really matters. If I get to be
with this person right here...

1110
01:19:31,417 --> 01:19:34,211
and our beautiful baby...

1111
01:19:35,296 --> 01:19:37,256
that's all I need.

1112
01:19:41,885 --> 01:19:45,513
Well, I suppose you want
what you came all the way down here for.

1113
01:19:45,597 --> 01:19:47,557
Oh, yeah.
That'd be great.

1114
01:19:47,683 --> 01:19:50,268
It took me a while
to track this piece down...

1115
01:19:50,393 --> 01:19:52,687
but I owed Diego huge.

1116
01:19:55,231 --> 01:19:57,107
That's it.
Thank you so much.

1117
01:19:57,232 --> 01:19:59,860
- Yeah.
- Really.

1118
01:19:59,944 --> 01:20:04,281
Good luck in the rain. Um, do you guys
want some garbage bags or something?

1119
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:08,368
- Yeah.
- Okay. That'd be great.

1120
01:20:20,797 --> 01:20:22,757
Good-bye!

1121
01:20:23,925 --> 01:20:26,844
- Hey, Albert!
- Yeah?

1122
01:20:28,221 --> 01:20:30,431
Good luck exploring
the infinite abyss.

1123
01:20:30,556 --> 01:20:33,017
Thank you. Hey!

1124
01:20:35,435 --> 01:20:37,646
You too.

1125
01:21:50,506 --> 01:21:53,468
Whoo!

1126
01:22:48,685 --> 01:22:53,065
So, uh, I don't know if
I'm gonna see you, man.

1127
01:22:54,816 --> 01:22:57,278
Don't you want to know
what's in the bag?

1128
01:22:58,695 --> 01:23:01,197
To be honest, I don't even care anymore.

1129
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:10,040
What is it?

1130
01:23:12,542 --> 01:23:14,960
It's my mom's
favorite necklace.

1131
01:23:15,085 --> 01:23:18,505
I'd be lying to you if I told you
it was my plan all along.

1132
01:23:18,631 --> 01:23:22,217
But... I got it back to you, right?
That's gotta be worth something.

1133
01:23:24,303 --> 01:23:26,430
This whole day
was about this?

1134
01:23:28,682 --> 01:23:30,892
You didn't want it
down there with her.

1135
01:23:30,975 --> 01:23:33,269
It's better it's with you.

1136
01:23:33,394 --> 01:23:34,979
Okay.

1137
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:42,945
Hey.! If you ever need a Kato,
you know where to find me.

1138
01:23:57,792 --> 01:24:01,045
It's funny. This, uh...

1139
01:24:01,129 --> 01:24:04,966
This necklace reminds me of this really
random memory of my mother.

1140
01:24:07,384 --> 01:24:11,430
I was a little kid, and I was cryin'
for one reason or another.

1141
01:24:11,555 --> 01:24:13,515
And, uh...

1142
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:20,439
She was just like, you know, cradling me
and rocking me back and forth.

1143
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:25,068
I can remember seeing the little balls
in this thing just floating back and forth.

1144
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:27,153
And, uh...

1145
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:32,492
And there was just, like,
snot dripping down my nose, right?

1146
01:24:32,575 --> 01:24:35,035
And, uh...

1147
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:38,288
She gave me her sleeve...

1148
01:24:38,414 --> 01:24:41,250
and she told me
to blow my nose into it.

1149
01:24:46,755 --> 01:24:50,384
And I remember thinking,
even as a little kid, like...

1150
01:24:50,509 --> 01:24:52,469
"Wow!

1151
01:24:56,014 --> 01:24:58,642
This is love."

1152
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:03,687
"This is love."

1153
01:25:04,938 --> 01:25:08,442
Large?
I think I see one.

1154
01:25:08,526 --> 01:25:11,028
- Shut up.
- Yeah, I do. Wait. Wait, wait.

1155
01:25:11,153 --> 01:25:13,488
We should save it
or something.

1156
01:25:15,741 --> 01:25:19,744
Okay. Don't move.
Okay.

1157
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:27,209
We could put it in my scrapbook,
if I had a scrapbook.

1158
01:25:27,334 --> 01:25:31,380
- That it?
- I think so. I don't really feel any more coming.

1159
01:25:33,132 --> 01:25:36,052
Well, if you do, just let me know.
I'll get the cup, okay?

1160
01:25:37,428 --> 01:25:39,805
This was such a good idea.

1161
01:25:39,888 --> 01:25:42,349
- Who are you?
- I'm your new friend Sam.

1162
01:25:42,433 --> 01:25:44,851
- Tissue?

1163
01:25:49,689 --> 01:25:52,150
Come here.

1164
01:26:01,451 --> 01:26:03,828
Fuck, this hurts so much.

1165
01:26:03,911 --> 01:26:05,871
Yeah, I know.

1166
01:26:06,956 --> 01:26:08,916
But that is life.

1167
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,253
If nothing else,
that's life, you know.

1168
01:26:13,378 --> 01:26:17,757
It's real.
Sometimes it fuckin' hurts.

1169
01:26:20,218 --> 01:26:23,554
To be honest,
it's sort of all we have.

1170
01:26:32,355 --> 01:26:34,439
How are you feelin'?

1171
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:39,111
Safe.

1172
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:44,407
When I'm with you,
I feel so safe.

1173
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,036
Like I'm home.

1174
01:27:31,827 --> 01:27:35,080
But did not make it.
The driver died on impact.

1175
01:27:35,164 --> 01:27:37,666
- Dad.

1176
01:27:40,376 --> 01:27:42,796
- Come on in.
- I'm sorry I woke you up.

1177
01:27:42,879 --> 01:27:44,840
No, I was just reading.

1178
01:27:45,966 --> 01:27:47,842
Where have you been?

1179
01:27:49,635 --> 01:27:51,512
Everywhere.

1180
01:27:51,637 --> 01:27:54,390
Been on sort of a crazy journey
these last couple days.

1181
01:27:54,515 --> 01:27:56,559
You've been avoiding me.

1182
01:27:56,684 --> 01:27:59,353
No, I haven't been.
Come on.

1183
01:28:01,021 --> 01:28:04,566
Okay, maybe I have been.

1184
01:28:04,691 --> 01:28:09,571
I'm sure you can find
lots of things in your life...

1185
01:28:09,696 --> 01:28:11,573
that you can be
angry about.

1186
01:28:11,698 --> 01:28:15,827
But what I do not understand
is why you're so angry at me.

1187
01:28:15,952 --> 01:28:18,371
All I ever wanted was
for everyone to be happy again.

1188
01:28:18,496 --> 01:28:21,332
- That's all I ever wanted.
- When were we all ever happy, Dad?

1189
01:28:21,415 --> 01:28:23,334
You always say that,
but when was that?

1190
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:25,378
When was this time
that we were all so happy?

1191
01:28:25,503 --> 01:28:29,256
'Cause I don't have it in my memory.
Maybe if I did, I could help steer us back there.

1192
01:28:29,381 --> 01:28:32,384
But I just...

1193
01:28:32,509 --> 01:28:34,677
You know, you and I need
to work on being okay...

1194
01:28:34,761 --> 01:28:36,679
if that's not
in the cards for us.

1195
01:28:39,307 --> 01:28:41,601
Well, we might
have a shot at it...

1196
01:28:41,726 --> 01:28:44,020
if you can forgive yourself
for what you did.

1197
01:28:45,563 --> 01:28:49,233
What I did.
What I did.

1198
01:28:49,358 --> 01:28:52,486
Okay, let's-let's do it.
Okay, we're here, right? Le-Let's do it!

1199
01:28:52,569 --> 01:28:54,863
I'm gonna forgive myself
for what I did. Are you ready?

1200
01:28:54,946 --> 01:28:58,617
I was a little boy, and
somebody made a shitty latch.

1201
01:28:58,742 --> 01:29:01,787
That's what I think. That's what
I think about the whole thing, okay?

1202
01:29:01,912 --> 01:29:05,456
And I'm not gonna take those drugs anymore.
They left me completely fuckin' numb.

1203
01:29:05,581 --> 01:29:09,210
I have felt so fucking numb to everything
I have experienced in my life, okay?

1204
01:29:09,335 --> 01:29:11,254
And for that...

1205
01:29:12,255 --> 01:29:14,549
For that, I'm here
to forgive you.

1206
01:29:16,426 --> 01:29:19,762
You always said all you wanted was for us
to have whatever it is we wanted.

1207
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:23,265
Maybe what Mom wanted more than
anything was for it to all be over.

1208
01:29:26,601 --> 01:29:28,520
And for me...

1209
01:29:28,603 --> 01:29:32,316
what I want more than anything in the world
is for it to be okay with you...

1210
01:29:32,441 --> 01:29:34,400
for me to feel
something again.

1211
01:29:35,443 --> 01:29:37,403
Even if it's pain.

1212
01:29:39,322 --> 01:29:41,740
Well, you're going against
your doctor's recommendation.

1213
01:29:41,824 --> 01:29:44,618
That's a pretty weighty experiment
to take on, don't you think?

1214
01:29:49,998 --> 01:29:52,835
This is my life, Dad.

1215
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,920
This is it.

1216
01:29:55,045 --> 01:29:57,214
I spent 26 years waiting for
something else to start.

1217
01:29:57,297 --> 01:29:59,674
So, no, no, I don't think
it's too much to take on...

1218
01:29:59,799 --> 01:30:01,676
because it's
everything there is.

1219
01:30:02,802 --> 01:30:04,846
I see now
it's all there is.

1220
01:30:08,891 --> 01:30:11,811
You and I are going to be okay.
You know that, right?

1221
01:30:18,275 --> 01:30:21,945
We may not be as happy as you always
dreamed we would be, but...

1222
01:30:26,407 --> 01:30:31,121
for the first time, let's just allow ourselves
to be whatever it is we are.

1223
01:30:33,998 --> 01:30:35,958
And that'll be better, okay?

1224
01:30:40,254 --> 01:30:42,965
I think that'll be better.

1225
01:31:03,192 --> 01:31:05,986
What are you thinking about?

1226
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:08,614
- You're not coming back, are you?
- Come on, Sam.

1227
01:31:08,697 --> 01:31:10,699
- Of course I am.
- No, you're not.

1228
01:31:10,824 --> 01:31:14,620
You don't realize this is good.
This doesn't happen often.

1229
01:31:14,703 --> 01:31:16,705
In your life, you know?
I mean, this...

1230
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:20,292
We can work
this stuff out.

1231
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:23,045
I want to help you,
you know?

1232
01:31:23,170 --> 01:31:26,339
We need each other.
I haven't even lied in, like, two days.

1233
01:31:27,549 --> 01:31:29,801
Is that true?

1234
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:32,637
- No.

1235
01:31:35,181 --> 01:31:37,058
Look, this isn't...

1236
01:31:37,183 --> 01:31:39,560
This isn't a conversation
about this being over.

1237
01:31:39,685 --> 01:31:41,853
It's... It's...

1238
01:31:41,937 --> 01:31:44,398
I'm not puttin' a period
at the end of this, you know?

1239
01:31:44,523 --> 01:31:47,693
I'm puttin', like,
an ellipsis on it.

1240
01:31:47,818 --> 01:31:50,320
Because I'm-I'm worried
that if I don't go figure myself out...

1241
01:31:50,403 --> 01:31:52,697
if I don't go, like,
land on my own two feet...

1242
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:56,159
then I'm gonna fuck this whole thing up,
and this is too important.

1243
01:32:01,747 --> 01:32:03,833
I gotta go. l...

1244
01:32:03,916 --> 01:32:06,919
Gotta go.

1245
01:32:07,044 --> 01:32:09,879
I fired my psychiatrist.
I gotta go find a new one.

1246
01:32:12,591 --> 01:32:14,801
Look, I'm gonna call you
when I get there.

1247
01:32:16,636 --> 01:32:19,055
I'm gonna call you.

1248
01:32:24,768 --> 01:32:26,938
Look at me.

1249
01:32:29,065 --> 01:32:31,024
Look at me.

1250
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:40,700
You changed my life.

1251
01:32:46,998 --> 01:32:49,959
You changed my life,
and I've known you four days.

1252
01:32:55,131 --> 01:32:57,591
This is the beginning
of something really big.

1253
01:33:00,136 --> 01:33:02,096
But right now, I gotta go.

1254
01:33:09,770 --> 01:33:12,272
Come here.

1255
01:33:26,493 --> 01:33:28,495
Final boarding call for all...

1256
01:34:26,884 --> 01:34:29,302
Take your seats as quickly as possible.

1257
01:34:40,647 --> 01:34:44,901
- What are you doing?
- Remember that idea I had about
working stuff out on my own...

1258
01:34:45,026 --> 01:34:47,820
- and then finding you once I figured stuff out?
- The ellipsis?

1259
01:34:47,904 --> 01:34:50,572
Yeah. The ellipsis. It's dumb.
It's dumb. It's an awful idea.

1260
01:34:50,698 --> 01:34:54,035
And I'm not gonna do it, okay?
'Cause like you said, this is it.

1261
01:34:54,118 --> 01:34:56,037
This is life...

1262
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:59,456
and I'm in love
with you, Samantha.

1263
01:34:59,581 --> 01:35:03,001
I think that's the only thing I've ever been
really sure of in my entire life.

1264
01:35:03,084 --> 01:35:06,087
I'm really messed up now,
and I got a lot of stuff I gotta work out.

1265
01:35:06,212 --> 01:35:09,257
But I don't want to waste any more
of my life without you in it, okay?

1266
01:35:09,382 --> 01:35:12,260
- Yeah.
- And I think I can do this! I mean, I want to.

1267
01:35:12,385 --> 01:35:14,011
- We have to, right?
- Yeah!

1268
01:35:14,094 --> 01:35:16,221
- Right?
- Yes!

1269
01:35:18,724 --> 01:35:20,685
So what do we do?

1270
01:35:26,356 --> 01:35:28,483
What do we do?
