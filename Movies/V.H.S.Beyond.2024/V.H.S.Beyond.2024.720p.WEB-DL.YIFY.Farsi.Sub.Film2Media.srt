1
00:00:24,403 --> 00:00:27,303
<i>The person of
hardened skepticism,</i>

2
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:30,547
<i>just like the person
of hardened credulity,</i>

3
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:33,447
<i>cannot be reached.</i>

4
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,277
<i>They just either
believe or disbelieve</i>

5
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:38,624
<i>on almost a religious level.</i>

6
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:50,395
Evidence is not proof,
but it's something that puts us

7
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:52,638
on the scent trail of proof.

8
00:00:52,742 --> 00:00:55,572
<i>But these tapes have
to be considered</i>

9
00:00:55,676 --> 00:00:57,643
<i>the Holy Grail
for people who are</i>

10
00:00:57,747 --> 00:01:00,612
<i>interested in
alien encounters.</i>

11
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:20,287
<i>The story of
the Farrington House</i>

12
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,875
<i>has become kind of an urban
legend within Toronto,</i>

13
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,395
<i>as well as Canada.</i>

14
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:28,295
<i>A paranormal group
in the early 2000s</i>

15
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:30,987
collected anecdotal evidence
of, you know,

16
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,336
a person seeing
a... kind of a gray form.

17
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:40,238
<i>The allure of
the UFO connection</i>

18
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:45,001
<i>will definitely draw out
curious people.</i>

19
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,761
Doing my thing,
just out poking around,

20
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:49,730
getting some sun.

21
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,145
<i>It adds to the mystique</i>

22
00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:56,426
<i>in what stories keep going
over time.</i>

23
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,221
<i>I'm pretty determined
that we're not</i>

24
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:00,085
indigenous of this world.

25
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:03,226
I'll tell you that.

26
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,263
<i>In terms
of human nature,</i>

27
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:08,783
<i>there is more thrill
in pursuing something</i>

28
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:12,442
<i>than in catching something.</i>

29
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:14,582
<i>As long as people are
hunting for it,</i>

30
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:16,481
<i>it's almost like
the treasure map is out.</i>

31
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:18,897
<i>And we're wondering,
what will it disclose?</i>

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,831
<i>What the hell?</i>

33
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,108
<i>Whoa.</i>

34
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:24,532
<i>And it can be
a little like that</i>

35
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:28,355
with these pieces
of vaunted evidence.

36
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:32,082
<i>If we come into proof of
extraterrestrial life,</i>

37
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:36,086
<i>everything that we thought we
knew is called into question.</i>

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,460
Segura, we're here.

39
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:17,852
Stay close and keep
the camera rolling.

40
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:19,406
We capture everything.

41
00:03:22,857 --> 00:03:24,687
Keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

42
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,000
This crew in here... this crew
now is your family,

43
00:03:28,104 --> 00:03:29,899
your mommy and daddy.

44
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,177
Do exactly as they say.

45
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:34,075
You disobey
any of these orders,

46
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:36,146
I'm going to break
my foot in your ass.

47
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:46,847
<i>Hey, kid, look alive.</i>

48
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:50,516
So I got no guarantees
that's going to stay on...

49
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,059
- Everyone...
- But give it a try.

50
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:53,888
This is Segura.

51
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:55,821
<i>Yeah, hey, guys.</i>

52
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:03,484
<i>ET body cam
should be working.</i>

53
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:04,796
<i>All right, listen up.</i>

54
00:04:04,899 --> 00:04:06,073
<i>Suit yourself.</i>

55
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:08,731
I've got some bad news.

56
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:10,284
<i>Fuck.</i>

57
00:04:10,388 --> 00:04:13,391
But there's
a silver lining this time.

58
00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:17,118
We had another
kidnapping last night.

59
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:21,295
That's 17 in three months,
all infants.

60
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,883
<i>Jesus.</i>

61
00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:25,195
Good news is someone
followed the guy who did it,

62
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:28,164
and we have a location.

63
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,062
I know we all want
to put an end to this.

64
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,375
Tonight, we get our chance.

65
00:04:34,515 --> 00:04:35,941
- Who the fuck put this up?
<i>- Oh, fuck.</i>

66
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:37,760
Hey, man, I was just
trying to be thorough.

67
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:38,899
I'm sorry.
- Relax.

68
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:40,002
Sit down.

69
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,350
Take a shot or something, huh?

70
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,006
The fuck are you looking at?

71
00:04:45,215 --> 00:04:49,047
The guy's becoming a liability,
and you fucking know it.

72
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,221
I got it.

73
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,085
I'll handle it.

74
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:54,949
What the fuck is with this?

75
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:56,261
We had a fucking agreement.

76
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:58,436
You know how that fucking ends.

77
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:01,956
If you're gonna be there,
I can't have this.

78
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,372
You're losing your mind.

79
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:06,271
Look, bro, there...
there's no fucking way

80
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,031
you are keeping me out of this.

81
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:10,827
<i>I know that.</i>

82
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:12,726
<i>So you're good?</i>

83
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:18,421
Hey.

84
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:24,945
Are you fucking kidding me?

85
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:26,048
<i>Fuck you.</i>

86
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,707
<i>Hey, body bag, come here.</i>

87
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:33,540
<i>Now you're an ammo bag.</i>

88
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:37,475
Hope you're ready, rookie.

89
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:44,413
<i>Fuck.</i>

90
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:48,589
<i>Let's go.
Let's go. Move it!</i>

91
00:05:48,693 --> 00:05:49,832
<i>Load up!</i>

92
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:08,298
<i>Hey, man, you want some gum?</i>

93
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,508
<i>Sarge.</i>

94
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,856
This rookie is back here
fucking blowing it.

95
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,790
Hey. Hey.

96
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:18,274
His kid's one
of the ones missing.

97
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,378
<i>Oh.</i>

98
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:20,459
Just mind your own business,

99
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:21,529
keep that little light
blinking,

100
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:22,830
and you'll be all right.

101
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:30,804
<i>Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

102
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:36,810
<i>You seeing this?</i>

103
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:40,883
<i>What is that?</i>

104
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:45,266
<i>What the...</i>

105
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,578
<i>Sarge, you said someone</i>

106
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:49,409
<i>followed the guy
to a location.</i>

107
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:51,514
<i>That doesn't look
like just a fucking guy</i>

108
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:53,551
<i>carrying that chainsaw.</i>

109
00:06:53,654 --> 00:06:55,518
<i>What are we dealing with?</i>

110
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:58,521
<i>Whatever it is, we kill it.</i>

111
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,522
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i>

112
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:01,766
Move, move, move!

113
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:19,542
Ivy, eyes on that window.

114
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:21,751
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

115
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,373
- What are we waiting for?
- Shh.

116
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:24,477
Fuck this.

117
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:26,031
ET, God damn it.

118
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:33,694
<i>What the fuck?</i>

119
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:34,626
Hey.

120
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,529
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

121
00:07:40,632 --> 00:07:41,530
<i>Jesus, here we go.</i>

122
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,118
<i>Get ready.</i>

123
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:48,847
<i>Another one down.</i>

124
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:50,124
<i>ET, left.</i>

125
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:54,543
<i>Get if off me!</i>

126
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:55,544
<i>He's got me!</i>

127
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,062
<i>Get it off!</i>

128
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:01,377
<i>Got him.</i>

129
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,689
<i>Fuck!</i>

130
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:03,621
<i>ET!</i>

131
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:05,657
Aubert, Bennet, go with him.

132
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:07,521
Hey. Not you, kid.

133
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,798
Stay with me.

134
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,583
<i>Shit!</i>

135
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:46,422
<i>Fuck.</i>

136
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,424
Shit!

137
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,393
We lost ET.

138
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:53,497
Fuck.

139
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,775
Aubert, go.

140
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,052
On it.

141
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:07,339
<i>All clear.</i>

142
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:08,720
<i>Let's go.</i>

143
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:09,963
<i>Good shit, man.</i>

144
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,353
<i>Stork, let's go!</i>

145
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:22,769
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

146
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:27,497
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

147
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:28,498
Guys, you're gonna wanna see...

148
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:35,678
<i>What the fuck?</i>

149
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:36,955
<i>Get up.
Get up. Get up.</i>

150
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:38,232
<i>- Oh, shit.
- Come on.</i>

151
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:40,303
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

152
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:41,477
<i>What the fuck?</i>

153
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:43,859
<i>Shit!</i>

154
00:09:43,962 --> 00:09:46,137
<i>You gotta be
fucking kidding me.</i>

155
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:54,076
<i>Find it, find it.</i>

156
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:55,077
Oh, fuck.

157
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,181
Shit.

158
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:57,325
Where's the fucking light?

159
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:59,633
Fuck. Come on.

160
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,362
<i>Shh. Shh.</i>

161
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:10,332
<i>Shh.</i>

162
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:28,661
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

163
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:31,354
<i>What is it?</i>

164
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,458
<i>Fuck.</i>

165
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:33,425
<i>Two more!</i>

166
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,289
<i>There's two more.</i>

167
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:36,290
<i>Fuck you!</i>

168
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:40,501
<i>Guys, I'm okay!</i>

169
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:41,651
What are you doing up there?

170
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:42,572
Get down here!

171
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,437
<i>Fuck!</i>

172
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,680
<i>Fuck.</i>

173
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:06,666
<i>Jesus, man.</i>

174
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:11,222
<i>Reload, everyone.</i>

175
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:12,430
<i>Bennet, check right.</i>

176
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:14,259
<i>Copy.</i>

177
00:11:14,363 --> 00:11:15,191
<i>Anyone hurt?</i>

178
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:16,296
<i>I'm good.</i>

179
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,194
Nothing major.

180
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:21,232
ET, sound off.

181
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:22,474
<i>Aubert, check him.</i>

182
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:28,584
Let me see, kid.

183
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,758
Look at me.

184
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:31,276
You did good.

185
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:34,313
<i>Kid's okay.</i>

186
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:35,591
<i>It's not his blood.</i>

187
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,731
<i>Hey, check this.</i>

188
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:48,362
It's the same bandage.

189
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:51,711
<i>It's the same wound on
every single one of them.</i>

190
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,095
Some kind of ritual?

191
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,063
God knows.

192
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:03,584
Now what?

193
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:05,241
Now we go up.

194
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,255
<i>Fuck.</i>

195
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:22,983
<i>Riley.
Riley!</i>

196
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:23,812
<i>Riley!</i>

197
00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:25,123
Riley!
- Hey, stop.

198
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:26,021
Stop!

199
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:27,239
He's gonna get
himself killed.

200
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,299
Stop.

201
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:30,232
Do what he just did,
and we all die.

202
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,647
Do you understand?

203
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,855
We do this right.
- Okay.

204
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,132
- Okay?
- Okay.

205
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,652
Right.

206
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,756
<i>Fuck.</i>

207
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,137
God damn it.

208
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:43,038
<i>What the fuck
are these freaks</i>

209
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:45,109
<i>doing with babies anyway?</i>

210
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:51,356
<i>ET?</i>

211
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,599
<i>ET, is that you?</i>

212
00:12:52,702 --> 00:12:54,256
<i>Shh!</i>

213
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:09,961
<i>It's blocked.</i>

214
00:13:17,624 --> 00:13:18,763
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

215
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:21,283
<i>Shoot it in the knees.</i>

216
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:22,284
<i>Shit.</i>

217
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:39,508
<i>Let's just look.</i>

218
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,894
<i>Hey, look at this.</i>

219
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:47,896
<i>God damn.</i>

220
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,484
<i>Came down right through
the fucking ceiling.</i>

221
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:52,866
<i>What did?</i>

222
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,145
<i>That.</i>

223
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:58,492
<i>What are we looking at
here, Sarge?</i>

224
00:13:58,596 --> 00:14:00,391
<i>Some kind of meteor?</i>

225
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:01,392
<i>I don't know.</i>

226
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:03,566
<i>But it's cracked open.</i>

227
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,430
<i>Like something crawled out.</i>

228
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:08,502
Whatever it is,
we don't touch it.

229
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:09,883
You hear me?

230
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:10,850
<i>Hey, behind you!</i>

231
00:14:10,953 --> 00:14:12,230
Shit.

232
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:13,991
<i>Don't shoot it.
It looks sick.</i>

233
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:15,414
<i>I don't want its shit
all over us.</i>

234
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:16,752
<i>Ah, fuck it.</i>

235
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:19,893
<i>Damn it, Aubert.</i>

236
00:14:19,997 --> 00:14:20,790
<i>- Fuck.
- Clear.</i>

237
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,102
<i>He's alone.</i>

238
00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:24,242
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

239
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:26,520
<i>Look at him.</i>

240
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:29,109
<i>He's fucking out of it.</i>

241
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:31,249
<i>Another bandage.</i>

242
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:33,424
<i>Bennet, get a gun on him.</i>

243
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:45,608
<i>Get a look in there.</i>

244
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:53,582
<i>He's got no brains.</i>

245
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,860
<i>Or his head is empty.</i>

246
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:57,586
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

247
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,495
<i>I'd be more worried
about where his brains went</i>

248
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,279
<i>in the first place.</i>

249
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:10,081
<i>Hey, body bag,
put your camera in here.</i>

250
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:20,816
<i>Help!</i>

251
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,956
<i>Fuck. That's ET.</i>

252
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,303
<i>Help.</i>

253
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:26,477
<i>Hang on, ET!</i>

254
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,616
<i>We're coming up there.</i>

255
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,895
<i>Shh, shh. Quiet.</i>

256
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,000
<i>Twinkle, twinkle...</i>

257
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:33,933
<i>I think I see something.</i>

258
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:39,524
<i>Little star,</i>

259
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:45,910
<i>how I wonder...</i>

260
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:46,911
<i>what you are.</i>

261
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:49,327
<i>Ah!</i>

262
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:51,019
<i>Wait.</i>

263
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:52,399
<i>There's something up there.</i>

264
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:55,023
<i>There's something
up there.</i>

265
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:56,472
Bennet, light.

266
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:57,576
Fuck.

267
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:03,490
We're not getting
through here.

268
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:04,514
Fuck.

269
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:06,517
Hey, wait, wait.

270
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,037
What about the chainsaw?

271
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,762
<i>Oh, right.</i>

272
00:16:10,866 --> 00:16:12,178
Yeah, do it.

273
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:13,489
Aubert, come with me.

274
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:25,329
You got it.

275
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,064
<i>Lost your fuckin' head
there, didn't ya?</i>

276
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:12,928
<i>Go, go!</i>

277
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:20,453
Ivy, take it.

278
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:22,489
I can't see shit.

279
00:17:22,593 --> 00:17:24,836
We'll all be dead if we
don't get through that door!

280
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,837
Fuck.

281
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:26,942
Fuck.

282
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:33,914
<i>- Let's go!
- There's a door.</i>

283
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:35,018
There's a door.

284
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,054
You're first.

285
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:37,297
Come on, come on, come on.

286
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,748
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

287
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,025
<i>I can't fit.
I'm caught.</i>

288
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:42,209
<i>Camera, camera.
Come here.</i>

289
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:43,279
<i>Gimme it, gimme it, gimme it.</i>

290
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:44,408
<i>Get in, Tommy.</i>

291
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:46,444
<i>Through, through, through.</i>

292
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:47,548
<i>Fuck.</i>

293
00:17:47,618 --> 00:17:48,895
<i>- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on.</i>

294
00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:50,103
<i>Come on.
- My hat.</i>

295
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:51,104
Where's my hat?
- Here, here, here, here.

296
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,416
<i>Shit.</i>

297
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,865
<i>Fuck.</i>

298
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:55,419
<i>Move.</i>

299
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:58,560
<i>Come on.</i>

300
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:02,150
<i>Oh, man.</i>

301
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,879
<i>Ivy.</i>

302
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:16,025
<i>Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.</i>

303
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,303
<i>Don't fire.</i>

304
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:19,098
<i>He's got one of the babies.</i>

305
00:18:26,864 --> 00:18:32,904
<i>Up above the tree so high,</i>

306
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:35,769
<i>like the birds in...</i>

307
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:37,357
<i>Sarge.</i>

308
00:18:42,431 --> 00:18:43,984
ET.

309
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:47,126
Are you up there?

310
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:50,163
Whatever's up there,
whatever's responsible,

311
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:52,717
make it pay.

312
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:55,548
No reward for going
home with extra ammo.

313
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:56,790
Amen, sister.

314
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:07,353
Hey, Segura.

315
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:09,217
Wear that uniform.

316
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:52,950
<i>Fuck.</i>

317
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,127
<i>Ugh.</i>

318
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:00,578
<i>Ugh.</i>

319
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:01,441
<i>Ugh.</i>

320
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:02,684
<i>What the hell is it?</i>

321
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:04,686
<i>Ugh.</i>

322
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:31,885
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

323
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:33,853
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

324
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,478
<i>What the fuck?</i>

325
00:20:38,582 --> 00:20:40,066
<i>What the fuck is that?</i>

326
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:41,169
<i>What the fuck is it?</i>

327
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:45,244
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

328
00:20:45,347 --> 00:20:48,799
<i>It's feeding the fucking baby.</i>

329
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:59,775
<i>Amigo, light this fucker up.</i>

330
00:21:13,962 --> 00:21:15,653
<i>Guys, get it off me!
Get it off me!</i>

331
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:16,792
<i>It's got me!</i>

332
00:21:16,896 --> 00:21:18,000
It's got me!

333
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:28,321
<i>ET, wait, wait.</i>

334
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:29,253
<i>I don't wanna do
this to you, pal.</i>

335
00:21:29,357 --> 00:21:30,254
<i>Come on, man. Keep back.</i>

336
00:21:30,358 --> 00:21:31,220
<i>I don't wanna do this!</i>

337
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,257
<i>Ivy, put him down!</i>

338
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:35,949
<i>Finish it.</i>

339
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,331
<i>Phew.</i>

340
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:42,093
<i>All right, cease fire.</i>

341
00:21:42,197 --> 00:21:43,060
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

342
00:21:44,164 --> 00:21:45,200
Room?

343
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,477
Segura?

344
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:48,203
Fuckin' told you.

345
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,380
<i>So this is what it's like.</i>

346
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:53,483
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

347
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,830
<i>It's not going that way.</i>

348
00:21:54,934 --> 00:21:56,280
All right?
You're not gonna die.

349
00:21:56,384 --> 00:21:57,764
<i>No, no, no.</i>

350
00:21:57,868 --> 00:22:01,009
<i>To be like you guys,
hunting monsters...</i>

351
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,124
<i>Something like this, kid.</i>

352
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:03,149
<i>Yeah.</i>

353
00:22:03,252 --> 00:22:06,325
<i>Hey, welcome to Warden.</i>

354
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:07,326
<i>Guys, help me get him up.</i>

355
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:13,435
<i>What do we tell
the families?</i>

356
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:15,610
<i>Maybe it's best we don't.</i>

357
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,638
<i>In the 1950s, a family
of Chinese immigrants</i>

358
00:22:43,741 --> 00:22:47,987
<i>arrived in Toronto
from Hong Kong.</i>

359
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,749
<i>They were followed by good
fortune in their real estate</i>

360
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:54,959
<i>and commercial endeavors.</i>

361
00:22:55,063 --> 00:22:58,307
<i>They purchased a beautiful,
sprawling house</i>

362
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:02,346
<i>built late in the Victorian
era on a large plot of land.</i>

363
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:08,594
<i>The patriarch and matriarch
passed away in the 1980s,</i>

364
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:11,838
<i>leaving the household
to their eldest son,</i>

365
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:13,668
who eventually ended up
putting the house

366
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:15,601

00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,679
<i>He started to

371
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:31,375
<i>But what I understand
is the house was sold.</i>

372
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:35,172
<i>And the eldest son
disappeared thereafter.</i>

373
00:23:35,275 --> 00:23:40,591
<i>The son was of the mind that
the house was either haunted</i>

374

<i>or there were some kind
of mysterious visitors,</i>

375
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:49,704

he was being visited by aliens.

poltergeist or ghost

where the arguments
against the evidence

395
00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:59,670

more of a stretch

396
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:01,534

00:47:57,598 --> 00:47:58,945
Hey, hey.

549
00:47:59,048 --> 00:48:00,681
This is some next-level
best friend shit, man.

550
00:48:00,705 --> 00:48:01,568
You ready to fly?

551
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:03,225
<i>Not really, Logan.</i>

552
00:48:03,328 --> 00:48:04,858
<i>Honestly, I'm kind of
freakin' out right now.</i>

553
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,273
Yeah, well, hey,
that's normal, man.

554
00:48:06,297 --> 00:48:07,885
You're about to jump
out of this plane

555
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:09,990
and fly around like Iron
Man at 120 miles an hour

556
00:48:10,094 --> 00:48:11,474
for about 60 seconds.

557
00:48:11,578 --> 00:48:13,097
<i>If you really want
to butter me up,</i>

558
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,212
you would have said Superman.
I'm a Superman guy.

559
00:48:14,236 --> 00:48:15,306
You know this.
Yeah.

560
00:48:15,409 --> 00:48:16,514
<i>Yeah.</i>

561
00:48:16,617 --> 00:48:17,836
Hey, listen, this shit
is next-level addictive,

562
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,482
all right?

563
00:48:19,586 --> 00:48:20,839
After today, you're gonna be
begging me to come back up.

564
00:48:20,863 --> 00:48:23,038
<i>I seriously doubt that, man.</i>

565
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:25,350
<i>Look, maybe... maybe
you all jump, right?</i>

566
00:48:25,454 --> 00:48:27,456
<i>Like, I can just meet
you back at the hangar.</i>

567
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:28,457
<i>He can take me down.</i>

568
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,837
<i>Planes go both ways.</i>

569
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:30,981
<i>You don't need me to jump.</i>

570
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,254
I got you.
Okay?

571
00:48:32,357 --> 00:48:33,151
We got you.

572
00:48:33,255 --> 00:48:34,335
Jess, can you tell him, please?

573
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:35,359
Yes.

574
00:48:35,395 --> 00:48:36,395
Baby, I promise.

575
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:37,811
I know that this is insane.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

576
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,099
- This is fucking crazy, but...
<i>- I know.</i>

577
00:48:39,123 --> 00:48:41,435
It's gonna be amazing,
I swear.

578
00:48:41,539 --> 00:48:42,989
All right?
- Yeah.

579
00:48:43,092 --> 00:48:44,242
Plus, you look super
fuckin' hot in that jumpsuit

580
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:45,060
<i>Whoo!</i>

581
00:48:45,163 --> 00:48:46,302
<i>Hot, you say?</i>

582
00:48:46,406 --> 00:48:47,614
<i>I look hot?</i>

583
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:49,754
<i>Hey, Logan, can I keep
the jumpsuit, man?</i>

584
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,481
I fuckin' love you guys.

585
00:48:52,584 --> 00:48:53,941
And if that were a text,
I would emphasize it

586
00:48:53,965 --> 00:48:55,553
<i>and heart it.</i>

587
00:48:55,656 --> 00:48:56,761
<i>Hey, I love you.</i>

588
00:48:56,864 --> 00:48:58,004
- I love you.
<i>- Come here.</i>

589
00:48:58,107 --> 00:48:59,005
<i>Get under here.</i>

590
00:48:59,108 --> 00:49:00,316
<i>Mwah, mwah.</i>

591
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,524
Get outta here.
All right.

592
00:49:02,767 --> 00:49:03,887
<i>Three minutes to altitude.</i>

593
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:05,356
<i>- Okay.
- Whoo!</i>

594
00:49:05,459 --> 00:49:06,747
<i>All right, that's
three minutes, guys.</i>

595
00:49:06,771 --> 00:49:07,806
<i>Three minutes.
- Okay.</i>

596
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:08,773
<i>Three minutes.
Clip in.</i>

597
00:49:08,876 --> 00:49:10,257
<i>Tandems clip in.</i>

598
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:12,501
<i>Everyone secure your
latches, straps?</i>

599
00:49:12,604 --> 00:49:13,433
<i>Everyone good?</i>

600
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:14,710
Ready, babe?

601
00:49:14,813 --> 00:49:15,883
<i>Okay.</i>

602
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:17,264
<i>We are so crispy, guys.</i>

603
00:49:17,368 --> 00:49:18,541
All right.

604
00:49:18,645 --> 00:49:20,245
Now, remember... keep
those backs arched.

605
00:49:20,336 --> 00:49:22,994
And when in doubt, pop
those crotches out, baby.

606
00:49:23,098 --> 00:49:24,892
- I felt all of that, man.
- It's the Viagra.

607
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:26,101
Don't worry.

608
00:49:26,204 --> 00:49:27,492
That was right
on my back, okay?

609
00:49:27,516 --> 00:49:29,138
Hey, we clipped in?

610
00:49:29,242 --> 00:49:30,495
- Yeah, Z-man, scoot over.
- You all seeing this?

611
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:32,176
<i>What...</i>

612
00:49:32,279 --> 00:49:33,774
Look out the window,
starboard side, 3:00 o'clock.

613
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:35,455
<i>The hell's starboard side?</i>

614
00:49:35,558 --> 00:49:36,766
<i>- No fucking way.
- No way.</i>

615
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:37,870
<i>What is it?</i>

616
00:49:37,905 --> 00:49:38,906
<i>Whoa, shit.</i>

617
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,460
<i>What the fuck is that, man?</i>

618
00:49:40,563 --> 00:49:41,633
<i>I can't see it.</i>

619
00:49:41,737 --> 00:49:42,841
<i>Whoa!</i>

620
00:49:42,945 --> 00:49:44,084
<i>Hey, what was that, man?</i>

621
00:49:44,188 --> 00:49:45,361
That was a fucking UFO!

622
00:49:45,465 --> 00:49:46,293
What'd you see?

623
00:49:46,397 --> 00:49:48,192
<i>I have no fuckin' idea.</i>

624
00:49:48,295 --> 00:49:50,090
<i>That's insane, bro.</i>

625
00:49:50,194 --> 00:49:52,092
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

626
00:49:52,196 --> 00:49:53,059
<i>What the fuck?</i>

627
00:49:53,162 --> 00:49:54,232
<i>Easy, easy, easy.</i>

628
00:49:54,336 --> 00:49:55,854
<i>Guys, guys, guys.</i>

629
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,198
It's over here, now.
Look, look.

630
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:58,650
<i>Holy fucking shit, dude.</i>

631
00:49:58,754 --> 00:49:59,927
<i>Holy... oh, my God!</i>

632
00:50:00,031 --> 00:50:01,031
<i>We come in peace.</i>

633
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:02,171
<i>Is this Area 51?</i>

634
00:50:02,275 --> 00:50:03,483
<i>- Whoa.
- Whoa.</i>

635
00:50:04,622 --> 00:50:05,622
<i>Fuckin'...</i>

636
00:50:09,972 --> 00:50:11,456
<i>What was that?</i>

637
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:16,634
<i>That's military aircraft
in our air space.</i>

638
00:50:16,737 --> 00:50:17,635
<i>Oh...</i>

639
00:50:17,738 --> 00:50:18,738
<i>Whoa.</i>

640
00:50:18,774 --> 00:50:19,982
We're headed back.

641
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:23,368
<i>- What the fuck was that?
- Jeez.</i>

642
00:50:23,434 --> 00:50:24,987
Zach, this doesn't
look good, man.

643
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:26,275
Shift over so I can
secure that last ring.

644
00:50:26,299 --> 00:50:27,369
<i>I'm trying, man.</i>

645
00:50:27,472 --> 00:50:28,749
<i>I'm stuck.</i>

646
00:50:28,853 --> 00:50:29,854
<i>Oh, God.</i>

647
00:50:29,957 --> 00:50:30,993
<i>It's stuck on my balls.</i>

648
00:50:31,097 --> 00:50:31,959
<i>Work with me, Zach.</i>

649
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,063
<i>Come on.</i>

650
00:51:12,103 --> 00:51:13,104
Yo, we gotta jump.

651
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:14,450
<i>Get outta here.</i>

652
00:51:14,554 --> 00:51:15,554
<i>We gotta jump.</i>

653
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:40,304
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

654
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:46,275
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

655
00:52:06,088 --> 00:52:07,952
<i>Logan!</i>

656
00:52:08,055 --> 00:52:10,679
<i>Where's my chute?</i>

657
00:52:10,782 --> 00:52:13,958
<i>I can't pull it!</i>

658
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:18,480
<i>Logan, pull the chute!</i>

659
00:52:23,588 --> 00:52:25,901
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

660
00:53:02,593 --> 00:53:05,803
<i>Logan?</i>

661
00:53:13,845 --> 00:53:15,985
<i>Logan.</i>

662
00:53:25,547 --> 00:53:27,031
<i>Logan.</i>

663
00:53:27,134 --> 00:53:29,723
<i>Logan, man, come on.</i>

664
00:53:29,827 --> 00:53:30,827
<i>Logan, man.</i>

665
00:53:30,897 --> 00:53:32,046
<i>Get me out of
these straps, man.</i>

666
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:34,590
<i>Come on.</i>

667
00:53:34,694 --> 00:53:36,627
<i>Logan, you gotta
help me out, man.</i>

668
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:37,628
<i>Come on.</i>

669
00:53:45,808 --> 00:53:49,122
<i>Logan.</i>

670
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,193
<i>Logan.</i>

671
00:53:51,297 --> 00:53:52,159
<i>We gotta get outta here.</i>

672
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:55,439
<i>We gotta... oh...</i>

673
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:03,723
Logan.

674
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,420
<i>Help!</i>

675
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,251
<i>Somebody.</i>

676
00:54:15,321 --> 00:54:16,874
<i>Somebody help!</i>

677
00:54:20,153 --> 00:54:22,811
<i>Jess!</i>

678
00:54:22,914 --> 00:54:28,403
Jess, where are...

679
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:33,580
<i>Zach!</i>

680
00:54:36,825 --> 00:54:37,826
<i>Brett.</i>

681
00:54:37,929 --> 00:54:41,070
<i>Where are you?</i>

682
00:54:41,174 --> 00:54:42,658
<i>Follow my voice.</i>

683
00:54:42,762 --> 00:54:44,867
<i>We're over here!</i>

684
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:45,971
<i>Zach!</i>

685
00:54:46,006 --> 00:54:48,146
<i>Brett!</i>

686
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,250
<i>Zach!</i>

687
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,047
<i>We're over here.</i>

688
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:54,912
Oh.

689
00:54:55,015 --> 00:54:56,327
Oh, my God.

690
00:54:56,431 --> 00:54:59,365
Are you okay?

691
00:54:59,468 --> 00:55:00,952
Where's Logan?

692
00:55:01,056 --> 00:55:02,885
<i>I don't... did you see Jess?</i>

693
00:55:02,989 --> 00:55:03,852
No, no, no, no.

694
00:55:03,955 --> 00:55:05,232
She's not with us.

695
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:06,199
Where's Logan?

696
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,303
Where's Logan?

697
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:09,098
<i>I... he's...</i>

698
00:55:09,202 --> 00:55:12,688
Zach, where is Logan?

699
00:55:12,792 --> 00:55:14,207
<i>He's dead.</i>

700
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,760
What?

701
00:55:15,864 --> 00:55:16,864
Oh, fuck.

702
00:55:16,899 --> 00:55:18,211
Oh, fuck.

703
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,040
Fuck, fuck!

704
00:55:29,256 --> 00:55:30,154
We're losing him.

705
00:55:30,257 --> 00:55:31,362
We're fucking losing him.

706
00:55:31,466 --> 00:55:32,363
Press down.

707
00:55:32,467 --> 00:55:33,537
Pressure, pressure.

708
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,883
<i>Oh.</i>

709
00:55:34,986 --> 00:55:36,367
<i>- Shit.
- Press, press, press down.</i>

710
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:39,127
It's gonna be okay.

711
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:46,308
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

712
00:55:46,412 --> 00:55:47,413
There's so much blood.

713
00:55:47,516 --> 00:55:48,414
I don't know what to do.

714
00:55:48,517 --> 00:55:50,036
I don't know what to do.

715
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:51,278
Jess?

716
00:55:53,591 --> 00:55:54,791
<i>Oh, what the fuck?</i>

717
00:55:54,868 --> 00:55:56,663
<i>- The fuck's that?
- Oh, shit!</i>

718
00:55:56,767 --> 00:55:58,216
The fuck do we do?
- Ugh.

719
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,735
I don't fuckin' know.

720
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:00,564
<i>The fuck.</i>

721
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:02,151
<i>Shit, fuck, okay.</i>

722
00:56:02,255 --> 00:56:03,255
<i>Oh, God.</i>

723
00:56:03,325 --> 00:56:05,120
Oh, okay.
Okay.

724
00:56:05,223 --> 00:56:06,017
<i>You guys see Jess?</i>

725
00:56:07,812 --> 00:56:09,158
<i>- Oh, my... oh...
- Fuck.</i>

726
00:56:09,262 --> 00:56:10,297
<i>Ugh.</i>

727
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:11,851
<i>- Zach, help me!
- Fuck.</i>

728
00:56:11,954 --> 00:56:12,990
<i>Jess!</i>

729
00:56:14,129 --> 00:56:15,302
<i>Jess, is that you?</i>

730
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,410
<i>Zach!</i>

731
00:56:19,514 --> 00:56:20,514
<i>Fuck.</i>

732
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:21,619
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

733
00:56:21,723 --> 00:56:23,207
<i>Jess!</i>

734
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,140
<i>Jess, I'm coming!</i>

735
00:56:28,523 --> 00:56:29,523
<i>What the...</i>

736
00:56:29,593 --> 00:56:30,904
<i>Now what the fuck?</i>

737
00:56:31,008 --> 00:56:32,319
Oh, God!

738
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:33,769
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

739
00:56:33,873 --> 00:56:34,977
<i>Oh, my...</i>

740
00:56:35,081 --> 00:56:36,462
<i>Now run, run!
Fuck!</i>

741
00:56:36,565 --> 00:56:38,187
Run!
Now!

742
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:39,188
Run!
Let's go.

743
00:56:40,638 --> 00:56:42,433
<i>Oh, shit!
- Let's go.</i>

744
00:56:42,537 --> 00:56:43,997
- Britt, wait up.
- Oh, my God, oh, my God!

745
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:45,021
Let's go!

746
00:56:45,091 --> 00:56:46,437
<i>Run!
- Fuck.</i>

747
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:47,334
<i>Come on!</i>

748
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:48,508
<i>Come on!</i>

749
00:56:48,612 --> 00:56:49,727
<i>Yo, what the fuck was that?</i>

750
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:50,890
<i>I don't fuckin' know.</i>

751
00:56:50,993 --> 00:56:52,098
<i>Run!</i>

752
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:53,064
<i>Shut up and run!</i>

753
00:56:53,168 --> 00:56:54,480
<i>- Hey.
- Help!</i>

754
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:55,757
<i>Fuck.
Where are we?</i>

755
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,448
Jess.

756
00:56:57,552 --> 00:56:59,070
Hey, guys.
Noah, stop!

757
00:56:59,174 --> 00:57:00,555
<i>I heard Jess!</i>

758
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:02,084
What the fuck, dude?
Why are we stopping?

759
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:03,188
- I heard Jess.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

760
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:04,075
I think I heard it too.

761
00:57:04,179 --> 00:57:05,007
Wait, listen.

762
00:57:07,285 --> 00:57:08,563
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

763
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:10,081
Let's go.
Fuck.

764
00:57:10,185 --> 00:57:11,048
Go.

765
00:57:11,151 --> 00:57:12,359
<i>Brittney!</i>

766
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:14,051
<i>Brittney!</i>

767
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:16,225
Oh, my God.

768
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:22,956
<i>This way.</i>

769
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,095
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

770
00:57:24,199 --> 00:57:26,235
Run!

771
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,481
Oh, my God.

772
00:57:30,585 --> 00:57:31,758
Fuck.

773
00:57:34,623 --> 00:57:37,902
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

774
00:57:38,006 --> 00:57:41,078
<i>What the fuck?</i>

775
00:57:41,181 --> 00:57:42,079
Hurry up.

776
00:57:43,736 --> 00:57:45,151
<i>- Run.
- Ooh.</i>

777
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:46,254
<i>Run!</i>

778
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,257
<i>Zach, come on!</i>

779
00:57:48,361 --> 00:57:49,914
<i>Zach!
- Yeah.</i>

780
00:57:50,018 --> 00:57:51,167
<i>Zach, what the fuck
are you doing?</i>

781
00:57:51,191 --> 00:57:52,054
Get up.
Get up!

782
00:58:11,384 --> 00:58:12,384
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

783
00:58:12,419 --> 00:58:16,078
<i>Zach, run, run, Zach!</i>

784
00:58:16,182 --> 00:58:18,011
<i>Run!</i>

785
00:59:29,013 --> 00:59:30,325
<i>Jess?</i>

786
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,576
<i>Jess?</i>

787
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:42,095
<i>Jess!</i>

788
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:44,511
<i>Jess, babe.</i>

789
00:59:44,615 --> 00:59:47,307
<i>Babe, are you okay?</i>

790
00:59:47,411 --> 00:59:49,896
<i>Jess.</i>

791
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:50,863
<i>Jess.</i>

792
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:51,966
<i>Jess.</i>

793
00:59:58,146 --> 00:59:59,250
<i>No.</i>

794
01:00:07,189 --> 01:00:09,951
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

795
01:00:17,752 --> 01:00:20,686
<i>Fuck you!</i>

796
01:00:44,226 --> 01:00:45,226
<i>Help!</i>

797
01:00:51,095 --> 01:00:52,407
Hey!
Hey!

798
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:53,857
Hey!
Sir!

799
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,168
<i>Sir, stop the truck!</i>

800
01:00:55,272 --> 01:00:56,135
<i>Stop the truck!</i>

801
01:00:56,238 --> 01:00:57,584
<i>Oh, jeez.</i>

802
01:00:57,688 --> 01:00:58,724
<i>Oh, oh, thank...</i>

803
01:00:58,827 --> 01:01:00,104
<i>What the fuck?</i>

804
01:01:00,208 --> 01:01:02,935
<i>Sir, sir, we gotta get out.
No, no, no, no.</i>

805
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:04,222
<i>We gotta to get
out of here, sir.</i>

806
01:01:04,246 --> 01:01:05,144
Oh, shit.
- Son...

807
01:01:05,247 --> 01:01:06,527
you got till
the count of tres...

808
01:01:06,593 --> 01:01:07,594
<i>Fucking kidding me?</i>

809
01:01:07,698 --> 01:01:08,882
To get the hell
outta my truck.

810
01:01:08,906 --> 01:01:10,306
<i>Sir, there is
something out there.</i>

811
01:01:10,356 --> 01:01:11,574
<i>We need to get the fuck
outta here right now, okay?</i>

812
01:01:11,598 --> 01:01:12,772
It killed...
- One.

813
01:01:12,876 --> 01:01:13,704
<i>My friends.
It killed my wife.</i>

814
01:01:13,808 --> 01:01:14,843
Please, sir. Please.

815
01:01:14,947 --> 01:01:15,775
<i>I'm not fucking
around with you.</i>

816
01:01:15,879 --> 01:01:16,879
<i>Just...</i>
- Two.

817
01:01:16,914 --> 01:01:17,777
<i>Sir, sir, please, please.</i>

818
01:01:17,881 --> 01:01:18,881
<i>I promise you I'm not...</i>

819
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:20,159
<i>I'm not lying.</i>

820
01:02:02,304 --> 01:02:05,411
<i>Fuck this.</i>

821
01:02:05,514 --> 01:02:08,586
Oh, oh...

822
01:02:15,214 --> 01:02:16,629
<i>Come on.</i>

823
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,188
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

824
01:02:30,229 --> 01:02:31,471
<i>Oh, God.</i>

825
01:02:31,575 --> 01:02:32,575
<i>Come on.</i>

826
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:34,095
<i>Please.</i>

827
01:02:34,198 --> 01:02:35,959
<i>Please.</i>

828
01:02:42,966 --> 01:02:46,210
Oh, you've gotta
be fucking kidding.

829
01:02:47,694 --> 01:02:49,179
<i>Shit.</i>

830
01:02:49,282 --> 01:02:51,526
<i>Oh.</i>

831
01:02:51,629 --> 01:02:52,527
<i>Fuck.</i>

832
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:53,630
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

833
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:55,116
<i>Oh!</i>

834
01:02:55,219 --> 01:02:56,117
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

835
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,532
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

836
01:02:57,635 --> 01:02:59,499
<i>Oh.</i>

837
01:03:25,629 --> 01:03:28,183
<i>Oh, oh.</i>

838
01:03:33,361 --> 01:03:37,710
<i>No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!</i>

839
01:03:51,724 --> 01:03:55,417
<i>Oh, shit. Oh, shit.</i>

840
01:04:09,707 --> 01:04:15,058
<i>We are desperate
to break out of the conditions</i>

841
01:04:15,161 --> 01:04:17,267
<i>of everyday life.</i>

842
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:18,544
<i>Hey, got it.</i>

843
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:20,442
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

844
01:04:20,546 --> 01:04:21,788
<i>Roger.</i>

845
01:04:21,892 --> 01:04:23,929
When I was a kid,
I never dreamt

846
01:04:24,032 --> 01:04:30,211
that you would see serious
news reportage about UFOs

847
01:04:30,314 --> 01:04:33,559
<i>or unexplained encounters,
unknown tech.</i>

848
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:34,560
<i>Well, if there's a...</i>

849
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:36,527
<i>Look at that thing.</i>

850
01:04:36,631 --> 01:04:38,012
<i>It's rotating.</i>

851
01:04:38,115 --> 01:04:40,428
<i>Whenever I see
a piece of footage,</i>

852
01:04:40,531 --> 01:04:45,329
my first response is
to defer to analysts.

853
01:04:45,433 --> 01:04:50,127
I am not someone who has
the background or training

854
01:04:50,231 --> 01:04:53,027
to analyze footage.

855
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:54,891
I've never seen
a real UFO video.

856
01:04:54,994 --> 01:04:57,859
I think they're all fake,
but I believe

857
01:04:57,963 --> 01:04:59,896
there could be
a second layer to what

858
01:04:59,999 --> 01:05:01,656
we're about to watch today.

859
01:05:01,759 --> 01:05:03,692
<i>All the orb videos
I've seen at this point...</i>

860
01:05:03,796 --> 01:05:05,073
<i>they look exactly like this.</i>

861
01:05:05,177 --> 01:05:06,833
<i>Thing flying never
changes directions.</i>

862
01:05:06,937 --> 01:05:08,180
It's always in a straight line

863
01:05:08,283 --> 01:05:10,976
because it's being filmed
from an airplane.

864
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:12,667
- I'm Sam.
- I'm Niko.

865
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:16,015
We are from Corridor Digital,
a YouTube channel.

866
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:18,028
We have this series,
"Visual Effects Artists React,"

867
01:05:18,052 --> 01:05:19,985
where we do a weekly
breakdown of visual effects.

868
01:05:20,088 --> 01:05:22,504
<i>And it was, like,
one moment in time when</i>

869
01:05:22,608 --> 01:05:23,954
UFOs were big on the news.

870
01:05:24,058 --> 01:05:25,542
And we figured,
let's look at these

871
01:05:25,645 --> 01:05:27,854
and see if we can use our
knowledge of visual effects

872
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:30,271
to see if these videos
have been doctored.

873
01:05:30,374 --> 01:05:31,824
Oh, come on.

874
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:32,963
VFX.

875
01:05:33,067 --> 01:05:34,447
<i>Orb-like object.</i>

876
01:05:34,551 --> 01:05:36,001
<i>There's a moment
there where it</i>

877
01:05:36,104 --> 01:05:38,589
<i>looks like the classic,
like, latex balloon.</i>

878
01:05:38,693 --> 01:05:41,696
If an alien video's
mystery depends on me

879
01:05:41,799 --> 01:05:43,387
not being able
to see it clearly,

880
01:05:43,491 --> 01:05:47,115
<i>then that deducts
credibility from the video.</i>

881
01:05:47,219 --> 01:05:50,636
But there is an aesthetic
to the nicely compressed,

882
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:52,293
hard-to-see video.

883
01:05:52,396 --> 01:05:55,296
And it hits unlike
anything else, in my opinion.

884
01:05:55,399 --> 01:05:57,367
That's why everyone
likes filming spooky things

885
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:58,816
with VHS cameras.

886
01:06:02,165 --> 01:06:04,029
Welcome to Doggy Dreamhouse,

887
01:06:04,132 --> 01:06:08,136
the happiest place in all
the land, if you're a dog.

888
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,897
Are you going out of town
for a long weekend?

889
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:12,520
We've got you covered.

890
01:06:12,623 --> 01:06:16,731
Did your little guy roll around
in mud or excrement?

891
01:06:16,834 --> 01:06:18,319
Well, no problem.

892
01:06:18,422 --> 01:06:20,907
Just bring him in and we'll
give your little stinker

893
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:23,841
the first class spa treatment.

894
01:06:23,945 --> 01:06:26,189
Has naughty behavior
become an issue?

895
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:28,536
Well, if so,
we're the place to be.

896
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:31,263
We specialize in all sorts
of animal training.

897
01:06:31,366 --> 01:06:34,645
You won't believe
the changes we can make.

898
01:06:34,749 --> 01:06:36,785
And this is Robert.

899
01:06:36,889 --> 01:06:38,166
Say hello, Robert.

900
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:39,754
Robert is my baby.

901
01:06:39,857 --> 01:06:41,273
Aren't you?

902
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:44,276
But here at Doggy Dreamhouse,
we treat all dogs

903
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:46,174
like they're our very own.

904
01:06:46,278 --> 01:06:48,728
And for you helicopter
fur parents,

905
01:06:48,832 --> 01:06:50,454
each one of your
precious babies

906
01:06:50,558 --> 01:06:53,043
will be outfitted with
a little collar cam,

907
01:06:53,147 --> 01:06:55,287
just like the one
that Robert is wearing.

908
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:57,358
So you can keep tabs
on all the trouble

909
01:06:57,461 --> 01:07:00,326
your little troublemakers
are getting into...

910
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:02,328
and all the fun
they'll be having.

911
01:07:02,432 --> 01:07:05,883
So come on down
to Doggy Dreamhouse

912
01:07:05,987 --> 01:07:08,058
and have a bark-tastic day.

913
01:07:11,786 --> 01:07:16,032
Becky Baxter... been tracking
her online for a few weeks now.

914
01:07:16,135 --> 01:07:18,034
She runs her business
out of her house.

915
01:07:18,137 --> 01:07:21,140
Seems legit, except for these.

916
01:07:21,244 --> 01:07:22,417
<i>- What are those?
- Jesus.</i>

917
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:23,660
<i>God.</i>

918
01:07:23,763 --> 01:07:25,120
Those are fucking
mutilated dog corpses.

919
01:07:25,144 --> 01:07:26,180
I'm sorry. What?

920
01:07:26,283 --> 01:07:27,523
- Stop. That is...
- Disgusting.

921
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,941
- Revolt...
- What's the plan?

922
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,125
How are we gonna take
this old lady down?

923
01:07:30,149 --> 01:07:31,189
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Dude.

924
01:07:31,254 --> 01:07:32,427
- Ageism.
- Thank you.

925
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:33,394
Ageism.

926
01:07:33,497 --> 01:07:35,189
The plan is that
Stuart and Angela

927
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:36,890
will pose as our couple
wanting to board their dog.

928
01:07:36,914 --> 01:07:38,237
<i>Think he'll be able
to pull off that role?</i>

929
01:07:38,261 --> 01:07:39,745
Shut up, dude.
Come on, guys.

930
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:41,229
<i>You're so immature.</i>

931
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:42,230
<i>- It's a little funny.</i>
- Can you be an adult for...

932
01:07:42,334 --> 01:07:43,852
Can we focus here?

933
01:07:43,956 --> 01:07:46,269
Stuart and Angela will be
posing as our decoy couple.

934
01:07:46,372 --> 01:07:48,788
My dog, Pickles,
will be posing as their dog.

935
01:07:48,892 --> 01:07:52,240
We're gonna be using the kennel
cam, so make sure you get

936
01:07:52,344 --> 01:07:53,424
as much of the house
as possible.

937
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:55,036
Will do.
We're on it, boss.

938
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,244
Yep.

939
01:08:05,288 --> 01:08:06,461
<i>Oh, come on in.</i>

940
01:08:10,948 --> 01:08:11,948
<i>Hey.</i>

941
01:08:11,984 --> 01:08:13,019
<i>Oh, hi.</i>

942
01:08:13,123 --> 01:08:14,123
Hello.

943
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:15,643
You must be Tom and Sarah?

944
01:08:15,746 --> 01:08:16,644
<i>Hi.</i>

945
01:08:16,747 --> 01:08:17,645
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

946
01:08:17,748 --> 01:08:18,853
Nice to meet you too.

947
01:08:18,956 --> 01:08:19,956
Oh.

948
01:08:20,026 --> 01:08:22,684
And this must be Pickles.

949
01:08:22,788 --> 01:08:25,515
Oh, aren't you the most
precious creature

950
01:08:25,618 --> 01:08:28,380
I've ever seen
in my whole life?

951
01:08:28,483 --> 01:08:29,564
Well, let's get you
out of that carrier.

952
01:08:29,588 --> 01:08:30,727
That's okay.

953
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:32,187
I don't want him marking
his territory in your home.

954
01:08:32,211 --> 01:08:33,568
Oh, no, no, no.
That's totally fine.

955
01:08:33,592 --> 01:08:35,180
Let's let him stretch
his little legs.

956
01:08:35,283 --> 01:08:36,985
Seriously, he gets really
bad separation anxiety

957
01:08:37,009 --> 01:08:38,124
if Tom's not holding him...
<i>- Yeah.</i>

958
01:08:38,148 --> 01:08:39,184
- So...
- Okay.

959
01:08:39,287 --> 01:08:40,668
<i>Well, suit yourself.</i>

960
01:08:40,771 --> 01:08:41,772
<i>Come on in, folks.</i>

961
01:08:41,876 --> 01:08:42,876
<i>This is it.</i>

962
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:43,911
<i>Nothing fancy, I know.</i>

963
01:08:43,981 --> 01:08:44,982
It's nice.

964
01:08:45,086 --> 01:08:46,086
Looks fun.

965
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,537
Oh, it is.

966
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,678
And this little
gentleman here is Robert.

967
01:08:50,781 --> 01:08:52,024
Come here, Robert.

968
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,198
There you are.

969
01:08:53,301 --> 01:08:55,200
Robert, this is Pickles.

970
01:08:55,303 --> 01:08:56,339
Pickles, this is Robert.

971
01:08:56,442 --> 01:08:57,754
Yes.

972
01:08:57,857 --> 01:09:00,653
My sincerest hope is
that you two will become

973
01:09:00,757 --> 01:09:01,930
the very best of friends.

974
01:09:04,761 --> 01:09:06,349
Is something funny?

975
01:09:06,452 --> 01:09:07,557
No.

976
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:09,179
Your dog is just...
he's so cute.

977
01:09:09,283 --> 01:09:10,283
<i>Yeah.</i>

978
01:09:10,318 --> 01:09:11,630
He is, isn't he?

979
01:09:11,733 --> 01:09:12,907
Yes.

980
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:15,151
And he has the most
beautiful heart.

981
01:09:15,254 --> 01:09:16,462
Yeah?

982
01:09:16,566 --> 01:09:20,673
All right, down you go.

983
01:09:20,777 --> 01:09:22,330
Okay.

984
01:09:22,434 --> 01:09:26,369
Continuing with the tour,
back here is our kitchen.

985
01:09:26,472 --> 01:09:29,613
All of our meals are made
right here by yours, truly.

986
01:09:29,717 --> 01:09:33,514
All 100% healthy and organic
and 150% delicious.

987
01:09:33,617 --> 01:09:36,586
When you say "our meals,"
does anyone else live here?

988
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:37,942
Well, if I didn't know
any better,

989
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:39,846
I'd think you were prying
into my personal life.

990
01:09:39,934 --> 01:09:41,591
No, I didn't.

991
01:09:41,694 --> 01:09:44,145
<i>You know, we...</i>

992
01:09:44,249 --> 01:09:46,216
I'm messing with you.

993
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,597
No, it's fine.

994
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:48,425
Pry all you want.

995
01:09:48,529 --> 01:09:49,806
I've got nothin' to hide.

996
01:09:51,428 --> 01:09:52,647
I live here all by my
lonesome, not a suitor

997
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:53,672
in sight.

998
01:09:53,775 --> 01:09:55,329
No, I meant the
meals are for us...

999
01:09:55,432 --> 01:09:57,848
for Robert and me and
any furry friends who

1000
01:09:57,952 --> 01:09:59,112
happen to be staying with us.

1001
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,161
<i>Oh.</i>

1002
01:10:00,265 --> 01:10:01,990
<i>And who are these guys?</i>

1003
01:10:02,094 --> 01:10:05,649
Oh, my sweet babies.

1004
01:10:05,753 --> 01:10:08,859
You know, they say that
the hardest thing in life

1005
01:10:08,963 --> 01:10:11,517
is when a parent has
to bury her children.

1006
01:10:11,621 --> 01:10:13,795
And as far as I'm
concerned, the same

1007
01:10:13,899 --> 01:10:15,866
is true with fur children.

1008
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:18,490
These are my fur babies.

1009
01:10:18,593 --> 01:10:21,044
They've crossed over
the Rainbow Bridge.

1010
01:10:21,147 --> 01:10:22,632
<i>Where's Gary?</i>

1011
01:10:22,735 --> 01:10:23,909
Oh.

1012
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:27,153
Gary was my most special
boy, so I have something

1013
01:10:27,257 --> 01:10:29,466
extra special planned for him.

1014
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,123
You know, he was a Pomeranian,

1015
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,574
but he had the heart
of a pit bull.

1016
01:10:33,677 --> 01:10:35,783
He was so protective
of his mommy.

1017
01:10:35,886 --> 01:10:39,959
No, he got a hold of this
nasty little intruder

1018
01:10:40,063 --> 01:10:45,448
and he sacrificed
his life for me.

1019
01:10:45,551 --> 01:10:48,934
It's a long story, but let's
just say he died a hero.

1020
01:10:49,037 --> 01:10:51,177
<i>So you don't bury them?</i>

1021
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:52,834
Well, some, I do.

1022
01:10:52,938 --> 01:10:56,044
But it seems wrong,
somehow, to put

1023
01:10:56,148 --> 01:11:01,947
such precious things in the
ground and let them disappear.

1024
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:04,363
This is how I honor them.

1025
01:11:04,467 --> 01:11:05,813
<i>By mutilating their bodies?</i>

1026
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:07,228
<i>- Stop.
- I'm sorry.</i>

1027
01:11:07,332 --> 01:11:08,332
<i>- Stuart.
- It's barbaric.</i>

1028
01:11:08,402 --> 01:11:09,299
<i>Stop it.</i>

1029
01:11:09,403 --> 01:11:10,680
It's okay.

1030
01:11:10,783 --> 01:11:13,269
<i>He's entitled to his opinion.</i>

1031
01:11:13,372 --> 01:11:16,030
I thought you said
your name was Tom.

1032
01:11:16,133 --> 01:11:17,169
<i>It is.</i>

1033
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,619
But she called you Stuart.

1034
01:11:18,722 --> 01:11:20,034
<i>Yeah.</i>

1035
01:11:20,137 --> 01:11:21,932
That's a pet name...
middle name.

1036
01:11:22,036 --> 01:11:23,313
Oh.

1037
01:11:23,417 --> 01:11:24,977
Yeah, I'm not very
partial to pet names.

1038
01:11:25,004 --> 01:11:26,178
No.

1039
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,111
Now, if Pickles
here were my dog,

1040
01:11:28,214 --> 01:11:32,253
I'd give him a more noble name,
something with weight,

1041
01:11:32,357 --> 01:11:36,222
like Henry or Julius.

1042
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:39,985
Yes, I like that name for you.

1043
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:41,711
Oh, it's so much more regal.

1044
01:11:41,814 --> 01:11:44,783
And these are not regal
quarters, are they?

1045
01:11:45,922 --> 01:11:46,922
No.

1046
01:11:52,342 --> 01:11:53,930
How rude of me.

1047
01:11:54,033 --> 01:11:57,347
I got so distracted
by Julius here that I almost

1048
01:11:57,451 --> 01:11:59,522
forgot to finish the tour.

1049
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:02,456
How would you two like to see
where the dogs are trained?

1050
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:04,181
I bet you'd be very
impressed by that.

1051
01:12:04,285 --> 01:12:05,711
We would like that,
wouldn't we, Tom?

1052
01:12:05,735 --> 01:12:07,392
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.</i>

1053
01:12:07,495 --> 01:12:08,507
<i>And I'm sorry about
what I said earlier.</i>

1054
01:12:08,531 --> 01:12:09,566
I just...
- Oh, no, no.

1055
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:10,750
<i>I shouldn't have said that.</i>

1056
01:12:10,774 --> 01:12:11,534
It's okay.

1057
01:12:11,637 --> 01:12:12,707
Water under the bridge.

1058
01:12:12,811 --> 01:12:13,811
Oh, come on.

1059
01:12:13,881 --> 01:12:16,021
Follow the leader.

1060
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:17,816
<i>Oh, and don't mind the mess.</i>

1061
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,725
<i>You know, I like to think it
gives the place character.</i>

1062
01:12:19,749 --> 01:12:22,165
<i>But as my mother used
to say too much clutter</i>

1063
01:12:22,268 --> 01:12:24,029
<i>is just clutter.</i>

1064
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:28,171
<i>Jeez.</i>

1065
01:12:28,274 --> 01:12:29,345
<i>Ooh, Mr. Jumpy there.</i>

1066
01:12:29,448 --> 01:12:31,036
Oh, that's just my brother, Bo.

1067
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:32,417
Don't mind him.
- Hello.

1068
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,177
<i>Sorry for interrupting
your...</i>

1069
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,868
<i>You said you lived alone.</i>

1070
01:12:35,972 --> 01:12:37,180
Oh.

1071
01:12:37,283 --> 01:12:38,906
Well, it feels like
I do because Bo

1072
01:12:39,009 --> 01:12:43,531
doesn't talk much these days,
ever since the accident.

1073
01:12:43,635 --> 01:12:45,775
<i>God, he used to be
so annoying.</i>

1074
01:12:45,878 --> 01:12:48,433
<i>We would get in
the craziest fights.</i>

1075
01:12:48,536 --> 01:12:51,746
He'd be like...
And I'd be like...

1076
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:54,370
And we would just...

1077
01:12:55,992 --> 01:12:57,821
And now, he's as quiet
as a church mouse...

1078
01:12:57,925 --> 01:13:01,687
not like these rowdy kids
down here, huh, babies?

1079
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:03,793
This is where we do
all of our training.

1080
01:13:03,896 --> 01:13:06,520
Oh, and this is
our grooming station,

1081
01:13:06,623 --> 01:13:09,592
or as Frederic here likes
to call it, the panic room.

1082
01:13:09,695 --> 01:13:11,179
Ooh.

1083
01:13:11,283 --> 01:13:12,457
I'm kidding.

1084
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,665
He's a good boy.

1085
01:13:13,768 --> 01:13:15,563
He's just a little stinker.

1086
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:18,946
And over here is where
we have our floor time.

1087
01:13:19,049 --> 01:13:21,500
<i>It's just for playing
and socializing.</i>

1088
01:13:21,604 --> 01:13:23,019
<i>So what's all this?</i>

1089
01:13:23,122 --> 01:13:25,055
<i>Oh, that's my little
arts and crafts area.</i>

1090
01:13:25,159 --> 01:13:29,335
<i>It's how I keep all of my
babies alive and in my heart.</i>

1091
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:30,647
<i>What's back there?</i>

1092
01:13:30,751 --> 01:13:32,891
Well, this is
the time out corner.

1093
01:13:32,994 --> 01:13:35,480
It's where we keep
the naughty boys and girls,

1094
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:38,241
like the ones who sneak into
people's personal spaces

1095
01:13:38,344 --> 01:13:44,281
and ask rude questions,
like you two, and like he did.

1096
01:13:44,385 --> 01:13:45,385
Help me.

1097
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,318
No, no.

1098
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,422
Stuart.

1099
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:48,354
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1100
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:50,460
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1101
01:13:56,155 --> 01:13:57,433
- Please.
- No.

1102
01:13:57,536 --> 01:13:59,227
Bad dog.

1103
01:13:59,331 --> 01:14:00,228
Bark.

1104
01:14:00,332 --> 01:14:01,229
- No more.
- Bark!

1105
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:02,334
<i>Please.</i>

1106
01:14:04,025 --> 01:14:05,061
Louder!

1107
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:11,895
There, there, Julius.

1108
01:14:11,999 --> 01:14:14,035
It's okay.

1109
01:14:14,139 --> 01:14:16,072
You're safe and sound now.

1110
01:14:16,175 --> 01:14:17,487
Yes.

1111
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:20,939
Those nasty humans
can't hurt you anymore.

1112
01:14:21,042 --> 01:14:22,423
Come here, baby.

1113
01:14:22,527 --> 01:14:25,564
Oh, what a good boy.

1114
01:14:25,668 --> 01:14:27,255
Okay, let's go.

1115
01:14:35,747 --> 01:14:37,611
<i>Thank you for calling
Doggy Dreamhouse,</i>

1116
01:14:37,714 --> 01:14:40,096
<i>where your doggies' dreams
become reality.</i>

1117
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:42,305
<i>Please leave a detailed
message after the tone</i>

1118
01:14:42,408 --> 01:14:44,272
<i>and have a bark-tastic day.</i>

1119
01:14:45,964 --> 01:14:48,242
<i>Yeah, I'm not sure anyone's
getting these messages,</i>

1120
01:14:48,345 --> 01:14:51,935
<i>but again, this is Miles with
Humans Against Animal Cruelty.</i>

1121
01:14:52,039 --> 01:14:54,041
<i>And I'm looking for two
of our team members.</i>

1122
01:14:54,144 --> 01:14:57,700
<i>Please call me back
at 555-0172</i>

1123
01:14:57,803 --> 01:14:59,391
<i>as soon as you get this.</i>

1124
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:02,394
<i>I really don't wanna have
to get the police involved.</i>

1125
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,498
<i>Thank you.</i>

1126
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:06,778
Okay.

1127
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:09,470
So today has been
an exciting day.

1128
01:15:09,574 --> 01:15:12,404
Bo was able to exhume
sweet Cynthia and Marcus

1129
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,440
from the little cemetery
out back...

1130
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:18,548
here they are
during better times.

1131
01:15:18,652 --> 01:15:22,310
And here is my little
rascal, Abraham.

1132
01:15:22,414 --> 01:15:24,036
Oh, there he is.

1133
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:28,524
I am so, so, so excited to

1134
01:15:28,627 --> 01:15:30,905
show you the progress
that Abraham is making.

1135
01:15:31,009 --> 01:15:33,149
He's almost back
to his old, snarly self.

1136
01:15:33,252 --> 01:15:34,150
Yeah.

1137
01:15:35,289 --> 01:15:36,497
Bo loved Abraham.

1138
01:15:36,601 --> 01:15:37,809
Didn't you, Bo?

1139
01:15:37,912 --> 01:15:39,845
Yeah, they were like
two peas in a pod.

1140
01:15:39,949 --> 01:15:42,710
But before we get to our
soon-to-be graduate,

1141
01:15:42,814 --> 01:15:46,472
I just wanted to show you
we have some really great

1142
01:15:46,576 --> 01:15:49,648
pieces here
for our new residents

1143
01:15:49,752 --> 01:15:52,340
to help them
transition perfectly.

1144
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:55,896
Speak of the devil.

1145
01:15:55,999 --> 01:16:00,107
And he has been a little devil,
haven't you?

1146
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:02,074
Yeah, he's definitely
the naughtier

1147
01:16:02,178 --> 01:16:04,456
of our two new students.

1148
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:09,323
Oh, now, Marcus, that's not
how good boys ask for treats.

1149
01:16:09,426 --> 01:16:10,289
Please.

1150
01:16:10,393 --> 01:16:11,393
Please.

1151
01:16:11,463 --> 01:16:12,775
No.

1152
01:16:12,878 --> 01:16:15,812
"Please" is a word that
humans use when they

1153
01:16:15,916 --> 01:16:17,538
want to pretend to be nice.

1154
01:16:17,642 --> 01:16:20,196
Nice dogs are just nice.

1155
01:16:21,922 --> 01:16:22,819
Okay.

1156
01:16:22,923 --> 01:16:24,269
Okay.

1157
01:16:24,372 --> 01:16:25,960
Nap time for Marcus.

1158
01:16:26,064 --> 01:16:27,065
Good boy.

1159
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:30,758
<i>Okay.</i>

1160
01:16:30,862 --> 01:16:33,140
<i>And over here,
we have Cynthia.</i>

1161
01:16:33,243 --> 01:16:36,246
Cynthia, what do you say?

1162
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:37,489
No.

1163
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:38,835
More.
Speak.

1164
01:16:39,733 --> 01:16:41,044
Good girl.

1165
01:16:41,148 --> 01:16:42,598
Good girl.

1166
01:16:42,701 --> 01:16:45,083
Someone deserves
a good girl treat.

1167
01:16:45,186 --> 01:16:46,186
Here we go.

1168
01:16:46,222 --> 01:16:48,500
Give me your paw.

1169
01:16:50,053 --> 01:16:52,228
Good job.

1170
01:16:52,331 --> 01:16:54,989
Here you go.

1171
01:16:55,093 --> 01:16:56,715
Oh, don't worry.

1172
01:16:56,819 --> 01:16:59,097
The swelling will
go down soon enough.

1173
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:03,549
And then treat time will
only be a good time.

1174
01:17:03,653 --> 01:17:06,069
You've just gotta adjust.

1175
01:17:06,173 --> 01:17:08,554
That's what I had to do
when my husband passed.

1176
01:17:08,658 --> 01:17:10,384
You gotta adjust.

1177
01:17:10,487 --> 01:17:12,731
Bo, we need to get
Marcus ready.

1178
01:17:12,835 --> 01:17:15,872
♪ There was a lady
had some dogs ♪

1179
01:17:15,976 --> 01:17:18,772
♪ And Becky was her name-o

1180
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:21,395
♪ Becky was her name-o

1181
01:17:21,498 --> 01:17:25,226
♪ There was a lady
had some dogs, and Becky ♪

1182
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:27,125
♪ C-K-Y, B-E-C

1183
01:17:27,228 --> 01:17:28,402
Oh!

1184
01:17:28,505 --> 01:17:29,505
No.

1185
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:30,715
Bad dog.

1186
01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:32,440
Bo, get the rag.

1187
01:17:33,856 --> 01:17:35,927
Okay, we're back.

1188
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:38,032
And I am so excited
to show you.

1189
01:17:38,136 --> 01:17:44,349
Marcus finally has a proper paw
for shaking, if he ever learns

1190
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:47,455
to shake, which he'd
better because Marcus was

1191
01:17:47,559 --> 01:17:49,112
such a good little shaker boy.

1192
01:17:49,216 --> 01:17:52,012
And these here...
these are the paw pads.

1193
01:17:52,115 --> 01:17:55,394
This is gonna make it so much
more easy for him to walk

1194
01:17:55,498 --> 01:17:57,880
around on his hands and feet.

1195
01:17:57,983 --> 01:18:00,537
And now that he's being
a good little sleepy boy,

1196
01:18:00,641 --> 01:18:02,367
it's time to fix his snout.

1197
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:07,613
Oh, and these chompers here are
gonna be so useful for chewing

1198
01:18:07,717 --> 01:18:10,547
his food and
protecting his mommy,

1199
01:18:10,651 --> 01:18:12,446
once the swelling goes down.

1200
01:18:12,549 --> 01:18:15,760
And then we're gonna put on
that cute little nose for all

1201
01:18:15,863 --> 01:18:17,416
those little nose boops.

1202
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,935
Boop.

1203
01:18:20,523 --> 01:18:23,837
So we're here at this
psycho taxidermy lady's place.

1204
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:25,597
We're gonna call
the cops, but...

1205
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,195
<i>But the cops are just
a bunch of corrupt fascists.</i>

1206
01:18:27,219 --> 01:18:28,704
Dude, I got this.

1207
01:18:28,807 --> 01:18:29,808
<i>Sorry.</i>

1208
01:18:29,912 --> 01:18:31,327
Come on, let's do this.

1209
01:18:38,955 --> 01:18:41,199
Looks like your
friends are here.

1210
01:18:49,932 --> 01:18:51,588
<i>That was fucking epic.</i>

1211
01:18:51,692 --> 01:18:52,589
Did you get that?

1212
01:18:54,384 --> 01:18:57,560
Humans are
such entitled brutes,

1213
01:18:57,663 --> 01:18:59,217
just like you used to be.

1214
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:02,634
Help, help, help.

1215
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:03,738
No.

1216
01:19:03,773 --> 01:19:05,499
Bad dog, bad.

1217
01:19:05,602 --> 01:19:06,500
Bad.

1218
01:19:08,674 --> 01:19:10,090
Where's the third one?

1219
01:19:10,193 --> 01:19:11,091
<i>Help!</i>

1220
01:19:11,194 --> 01:19:12,333
Shoot.

1221
01:19:12,437 --> 01:19:14,715
Shoot, guys, I swear to God
I just heard Angela.

1222
01:19:17,097 --> 01:19:18,097
<i>Help!</i>

1223
01:19:18,132 --> 01:19:19,616
<i>Holy shit.
That's her.</i>

1224
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:20,756
<i>Help!</i>

1225
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:23,793
<i>Hey, just keep filming.</i>

1226
01:19:23,897 --> 01:19:24,760
<i>Let's fucking go.</i>

1227
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:42,777
Huh, fuck.

1228
01:19:42,812 --> 01:19:44,124
What the fuck...

1229
01:19:47,472 --> 01:19:49,336
<i>Here.</i>

1230
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:51,303
<i>The fuck was that?</i>

1231
01:19:51,407 --> 01:19:52,442
<i>Stuart?</i>

1232
01:19:52,546 --> 01:19:53,443
Shit.

1233
01:19:53,547 --> 01:19:54,548
Angela.

1234
01:19:54,651 --> 01:19:55,756
Oh, my God.

1235
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:57,585
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

1236
01:19:57,689 --> 01:19:58,689
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1237
01:19:58,724 --> 01:20:01,589
We're closed today.

1238
01:20:01,693 --> 01:20:02,763
<i>Who are you?</i>

1239
01:20:02,867 --> 01:20:04,869
Well, I'm her new fur mommy.

1240
01:20:04,972 --> 01:20:07,181
And you're intruding.

1241
01:20:07,285 --> 01:20:10,909
Boys.

1242
01:20:11,013 --> 01:20:12,083
<i>Fuck is that?</i>

1243
01:20:12,186 --> 01:20:13,739
Gary.

1244
01:20:13,843 --> 01:20:15,120
Abraham.

1245
01:20:15,224 --> 01:20:16,087
Hi.

1246
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:18,468
Mommy needs your
help right now.

1247
01:20:23,301 --> 01:20:25,165
Oh, my God.

1248
01:20:27,512 --> 01:20:28,409
Sic 'em.

1249
01:20:48,705 --> 01:20:49,879
Oh.

1250
01:21:19,771 --> 01:21:21,738
Good boy, Gary.

1251
01:21:21,842 --> 01:21:25,156
Do you want a little treat?

1252
01:21:25,259 --> 01:21:27,503
Open up.

1253
01:21:27,606 --> 01:21:30,678
That's good.

1254
01:21:30,782 --> 01:21:33,267
Such a good boy.

1255
01:21:33,371 --> 01:21:35,545
Yeah.

1256
01:21:35,649 --> 01:21:36,649
Mama loves you.

1257
01:21:40,481 --> 01:21:42,035
Boop.

1258
01:22:33,776 --> 01:22:34,984
Oh.

1259
01:22:46,409 --> 01:22:50,344
<i>In the 1950s, probably
due to the Cold War,</i>

1260
01:22:50,448 --> 01:22:57,144
<i>the dominant public point of
view was aliens as invaders,</i>

1261
01:22:57,248 --> 01:23:01,045
which was brought to mass
popularity in the 1930s

1262
01:23:01,148 --> 01:23:04,289
<i>by the great Orson Welles.</i>

1263
01:23:04,393 --> 01:23:06,947
The verisimilitude was
such that some people

1264
01:23:07,051 --> 01:23:10,192
<i>apparently believed it.</i>

1265
01:23:10,295 --> 01:23:12,273
I mean, look, it's fun to be
a little bit of a trickster.

1266
01:23:12,297 --> 01:23:13,471
We've done it ourselves.

1267
01:23:16,267 --> 01:23:17,889
<i>The whole world
thought it was real.</i>

1268
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,650
<i>And Boston Dynamics got
death threats because of us.</i>

1269
01:23:20,754 --> 01:23:23,584
<i>A piece of footage like
this, even when it's exposed,</i>

1270
01:23:23,688 --> 01:23:26,553
never dissuades
the true believers.

1271
01:23:26,656 --> 01:23:28,279
<i>Orson didn't intend
to deceive.</i>

1272
01:23:28,382 --> 01:23:30,557
He just intended to persuade.

1273
01:23:32,559 --> 01:23:34,354
<i>Orson intended to
make a drama that</i>

1274
01:23:34,457 --> 01:23:37,598
was so thrilling that you
could momentarily forget

1275
01:23:37,702 --> 01:23:39,186
what you were listening to.

1276
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:40,957
And that fear response
just came out of you.

1277
01:23:40,981 --> 01:23:42,500
<i>That's what
the best horror does.</i>

1278
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:16,948
The Mojave Desert has long
been a known UFO hot-spot,

1279
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:19,709
since long before the famed
Mojave Incident of October 21,

1280
01:24:19,813 --> 01:24:22,574
1989, when nine glowing lights
appeared in the sky and turned

1281
01:24:22,678 --> 01:24:25,715
a couple's quiet weekend away
into an unearthly nightmare,

1282
01:24:25,819 --> 01:24:28,891
as Elise and Tom Gifford...

1283
01:24:28,994 --> 01:24:29,995
Elise and Tom Gifford.

1284
01:24:30,099 --> 01:24:30,962
Elise and Tom Gifford.

1285
01:24:33,792 --> 01:24:36,032
As Elise and Tom Gifford were
trapped in their camper van

1286
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:37,520
by nonhuman creatures.

1287
01:24:37,624 --> 01:24:40,040
It has also been a known
UFO hot-spot since long

1288
01:24:40,144 --> 01:24:41,593
before George Van Tassel...

1289
01:24:41,697 --> 01:24:43,319
fuck.

1290
01:24:47,185 --> 01:24:48,531
Since George Van
Tassel, a writer,

1291
01:24:48,635 --> 01:24:50,130
aircraft, engineer,
and ufologist built

1292
01:24:50,154 --> 01:24:51,810
the Integratron 19 miles...

1293
01:24:51,914 --> 01:24:53,605
17 miles.

1294
01:24:53,709 --> 01:24:57,057
Built the Integratron
17 miles outside of Joshua Tree

1295
01:24:57,161 --> 01:24:58,441
to harness
otherworldly energies,

1296
01:24:58,507 --> 01:25:00,233
he swore, coursing
through the area.

1297
01:25:00,336 --> 01:25:02,476
And just last week,
lights reappeared

1298
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:05,100
in the California desert,
reminding us we are not alone.

1299
01:25:05,203 --> 01:25:06,584
Fuck.

1300
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:11,347
<i>Okay.</i>

1301
01:25:11,451 --> 01:25:12,969
<i>You said you saw the lights.</i>

1302
01:25:13,073 --> 01:25:13,936
I did.

1303
01:25:14,039 --> 01:25:15,075
They started there.

1304
01:25:15,179 --> 01:25:18,147
Then they moved there...

1305
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:22,427
all perfectly spaced
out, three of them.

1306
01:25:22,531 --> 01:25:26,673
And they kind of came
and went very quick.

1307
01:25:26,776 --> 01:25:28,813
<i>How long were
you observing them?</i>

1308
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:32,575
10, 15 minutes at most.

1309
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:36,096
What television station
are you from again?

1310
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,615
<i>This is a documentary.</i>

1311
01:25:37,718 --> 01:25:39,720
<i>I'm not affiliated
with a news station.</i>

1312
01:25:39,824 --> 01:25:42,137
I thought you told me
you were a reporter.

1313
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:47,590
<i>I also saw the lights
that way.</i>

1314
01:25:54,563 --> 01:25:58,360
There were, like, six
bright lights up in the sky.

1315
01:25:58,463 --> 01:26:03,917
Little one broke off,
landed somewhere back there.

1316
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:08,818
I rode out, tracked it down,
saw a bunch of, like,

1317
01:26:08,922 --> 01:26:11,511
little alien footprints.

1318
01:26:11,614 --> 01:26:13,064
Got a buddy over there, Bubba.

1319
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,479
Bubba Quails.

1320
01:26:14,583 --> 01:26:17,310
He's, like, one of those
survivalist type.

1321
01:26:17,413 --> 01:26:20,140
He said they were out there
gathering animals.

1322
01:26:20,244 --> 01:26:21,728
<i>What kind of animals?</i>

1323
01:26:21,831 --> 01:26:24,662
We got all sorts of
fuckin' animals out here.

1324
01:26:24,765 --> 01:26:26,215
We got squirrels.

1325
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:30,633
We got iguanas, tortoises,
spiders, you name it.

1326
01:26:30,737 --> 01:26:34,119
<i>Your friend saw this,
like, for real?</i>

1327
01:26:34,223 --> 01:26:36,536
In a vision.

1328
01:26:37,951 --> 01:26:39,711
<i>Like, he saw it visually?</i>

1329
01:26:39,815 --> 01:26:43,059
Nah, like one of those
vision quests.

1330
01:26:43,163 --> 01:26:44,716
You know,
the spiritual visions.

1331
01:26:58,799 --> 01:27:01,319
She says that
it started with two lights,

1332
01:27:01,423 --> 01:27:02,838
and then it became six.

1333
01:27:02,941 --> 01:27:05,496
And then they all flew away
except for one.

1334
01:27:05,599 --> 01:27:07,049
They make no sound at all.

1335
01:27:07,152 --> 01:27:08,464
They came into my room.

1336
01:27:08,568 --> 01:27:09,327
<i>Wait.</i>

1337
01:27:09,431 --> 01:27:10,431
<i>Who came into your room?</i>

1338
01:27:10,501 --> 01:27:11,501
The shadow people.

1339
01:27:11,571 --> 01:27:13,055
They tried to take Buttons.

1340
01:27:13,158 --> 01:27:14,746
<i>What's Buttons?</i>

1341
01:27:14,850 --> 01:27:16,300
My hamster.

1342
01:27:19,751 --> 01:27:22,133
<i>So they didn't take Buttons?</i>

1343
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,515
No, I told them not to,
so they didn't.

1344
01:27:24,618 --> 01:27:26,482
And then they sang me a song.

1345
01:27:39,081 --> 01:27:40,669
Using the eyewitness
testimony

1346
01:27:40,772 --> 01:27:42,302
and the initial reporting
in the desert news, which...

1347
01:27:42,326 --> 01:27:43,648
I can't believe
this hasn't already

1348
01:27:43,672 --> 01:27:44,959
gone national,
considering there were

1349
01:27:44,983 --> 01:27:46,882
over 20 eyewitness reports.

1350
01:27:46,985 --> 01:27:49,954
I have met myself
six campsites for the week

1351
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:51,714
under the path of the lights.

1352
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:04,910
When we talk about
extraterrestrial life

1353
01:28:04,934 --> 01:28:06,360
visiting Earth,
we must first consider

1354
01:28:06,384 --> 01:28:08,213
the distance that
they would have to travel.

1355
01:28:08,317 --> 01:28:10,250
Let's say that they come
from Proxima Centauri,

1356
01:28:10,354 --> 01:28:11,527
the closest possible star,

1357
01:28:11,631 --> 01:28:13,805
basically our neighbor
in the galaxy.

1358
01:28:13,909 --> 01:28:16,118
They are a measly
4 light-years away.

1359
01:28:16,221 --> 01:28:17,740
So how do they get here?

1360
01:28:17,844 --> 01:28:19,718
And what happens when you
travel near the speed of light?

1361
01:28:19,742 --> 01:28:21,444
Because of course,
by all conventional means,

1362
01:28:21,468 --> 01:28:23,332
you can't travel
at the actual speed of light.

1363
01:28:23,436 --> 01:28:25,172
That's why physicists get
so excited about things

1364
01:28:25,196 --> 01:28:26,887
like wormholes and warp speed.

1365
01:28:26,991 --> 01:28:31,478
But let's say that you can
instantly accelerate to 99.9%

1366
01:28:31,582 --> 01:28:33,169
the speed of light
and instantly

1367
01:28:33,273 --> 01:28:35,240
decelerate without
destroying your ship

1368
01:28:35,344 --> 01:28:36,966
or dying in the process.

1369
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:40,763
Everyone on Earth will have
experienced about 4 years,

1370
01:28:40,867 --> 01:28:43,697
but for you,
that trip is only 2 weeks.

1371
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:46,642
Now, let's say you're a little
bit further away... still

1372
01:28:46,666 --> 01:28:47,953
really close to
us, but just, like,

1373
01:28:47,977 --> 01:28:48,840
a little bit further away.

1374
01:28:48,944 --> 01:28:50,325
That would be Andromeda.

1375
01:28:50,428 --> 01:28:52,948
So you will experience
a trip of about 28 years,

1376
01:28:53,051 --> 01:28:58,125
but everyone on Earth will
have aged 2.5 million years.

1377
01:28:58,229 --> 01:28:59,989
It's no small feat.

1378
01:29:04,028 --> 01:29:06,375
<i>Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh,
shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.</i>

1379
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:08,412
<i>Oh, shit. Oh, my God.
Did I get it?</i>

1380
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:11,967
<i>Um, okay, I'm gonna rewind
and see if I got it.</i>

1381
01:29:13,278 --> 01:29:14,383
♪ Happy birthday to you

1382
01:29:14,487 --> 01:29:16,765
♪ Happy birthday to you

1383
01:29:16,868 --> 01:29:18,525
♪ Happy Birthday

1384
01:29:18,629 --> 01:29:20,562
♪ Happy birthday to you

1385
01:29:36,681 --> 01:29:38,476
So I didn't get it.

1386
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:39,719
Maybe some lights.

1387
01:29:42,169 --> 01:29:43,289
Could have been an airplane.

1388
01:29:47,589 --> 01:29:48,909
And I guess
I taped over some shit

1389
01:29:49,004 --> 01:29:51,938
that I didn't
exactly intend to.

1390
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:54,734
Go ahead, Steven.

1391
01:29:54,837 --> 01:29:59,014
Reason fuckin' 85 on why
Haley's a shitty mother.

1392
01:30:06,331 --> 01:30:08,126
There'll be other birthdays.

1393
01:30:09,438 --> 01:30:10,750
<i>Okay.</i>

1394
01:30:10,853 --> 01:30:12,407
<i>There are these
floating lights.</i>

1395
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:14,236
<i>They've been
flickering on and off.</i>

1396
01:30:14,339 --> 01:30:16,721
<i>And there are,
like, six of them.</i>

1397
01:30:20,311 --> 01:30:21,657
<i>I don't know
how to explain it.</i>

1398
01:30:21,761 --> 01:30:23,314
<i>I'm gonna try something.</i>

1399
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:24,867
<i>This camera has an
infrared sensor.</i>

1400
01:30:24,971 --> 01:30:27,214
<i>And I'm gonna see if
maybe we can catch</i>

1401
01:30:27,318 --> 01:30:28,181
<i>a little more light with it.</i>

1402
01:30:28,284 --> 01:30:29,700
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

1403
01:30:33,497 --> 01:30:37,052
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1404
01:30:37,155 --> 01:30:38,916
<i>That's incredible.</i>

1405
01:30:44,508 --> 01:30:45,957
<i>Oh, completely gone.</i>

1406
01:30:46,061 --> 01:30:47,062
<i>Oh.</i>

1407
01:30:50,237 --> 01:30:52,101
<i>I'm gonna try to follow.</i>

1408
01:30:59,108 --> 01:31:00,006
<i>Suck it, Steve.</i>

1409
01:31:00,109 --> 01:31:01,490
<i>Suck it, Stanford.</i>

1410
01:31:01,594 --> 01:31:02,874
<i>Following the lights in the sky.</i>

1411
01:31:02,974 --> 01:31:04,976
<i>We did it, baby.</i>

1412
01:31:09,222 --> 01:31:11,362
<i>Fuck yeah.</i>

1413
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:12,639
<i>Okay.</i>

1414
01:31:12,743 --> 01:31:13,961
<i>I think this is
where it came down.</i>

1415
01:31:13,985 --> 01:31:15,345
<i>And I'm not getting
anything in IR,</i>

1416
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,161
<i>so let's try visible light.</i>

1417
01:31:19,163 --> 01:31:22,166
<i>Okay.</i>

1418
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:23,478
<i>There's something over there.</i>

1419
01:31:23,581 --> 01:31:25,514
<i>Am I seeing...</i>

1420
01:31:25,618 --> 01:31:28,931
<i>I think I'm seeing
a light in the distance.</i>

1421
01:31:37,595 --> 01:31:41,426
<i>Doesn't seem to be
moving with me.</i>

1422
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:45,016
<i>It's just right over there.</i>

1423
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:50,677
<i>I can... I don't see
anything else.</i>

1424
01:31:50,781 --> 01:31:55,026
<i>It's just that.</i>

1425
01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:57,339
<i>There it is.</i>

1426
01:31:57,442 --> 01:31:59,548
<i>Yeah.</i>

1427
01:31:59,652 --> 01:32:02,137
<i>You see that?</i>

1428
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,070
<i>Huh, look at that.</i>

1429
01:32:04,173 --> 01:32:05,209
<i>Okay.</i>

1430
01:32:05,312 --> 01:32:07,970
<i>I'm gonna get a little closer.</i>

1431
01:32:08,074 --> 01:32:10,766
<i>Okay.</i>

1432
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:12,147
<i>Flickers on and off.</i>

1433
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:13,597
<i>It's my light.</i>

1434
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:16,358
<i>There's something.</i>

1435
01:32:16,461 --> 01:32:19,464
<i>I'm just gonna...</i>

1436
01:32:19,568 --> 01:32:22,882
<i>there's some
footprints, maybe.</i>

1437
01:32:22,985 --> 01:32:27,680
<i>They're leading away
from this.</i>

1438
01:32:27,783 --> 01:32:28,646
<i>It's very big.</i>

1439
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:30,096
<i>It's reflective.</i>

1440
01:32:30,199 --> 01:32:31,269
<i>See?</i>

1441
01:32:31,373 --> 01:32:32,754
<i>It's reflecting my light.</i>

1442
01:32:32,857 --> 01:32:37,586
<i>And is it a spaceship?</i>

1443
01:32:37,690 --> 01:32:38,690
<i>I don't know.</i>

1444
01:32:42,384 --> 01:32:43,868
<i>Getting a little closer in.</i>

1445
01:32:49,184 --> 01:32:52,428
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1446
01:32:52,532 --> 01:32:54,638
<i>I'm trying to get a sense
of how big this thing is.</i>

1447
01:32:54,741 --> 01:32:59,574
<i>And I can't.</i>

1448
01:32:59,677 --> 01:33:02,231
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1449
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,101
<i>That's me.</i>

1450
01:33:10,205 --> 01:33:11,827
<i>Yeah.</i>

1451
01:33:11,931 --> 01:33:13,898
<i>The ship's reflecting me.</i>

1452
01:33:14,002 --> 01:33:15,002
<i>Okay.</i>

1453
01:33:16,452 --> 01:33:19,835
<i>There're some noises
maybe off in the distance.</i>

1454
01:33:19,939 --> 01:33:25,634
<i>But it doesn't look
like anybody's home.</i>

1455
01:33:25,738 --> 01:33:27,325
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1456
01:33:33,228 --> 01:33:36,645
<i>How am I gonna do this?</i>

1457
01:33:36,749 --> 01:33:39,510
<i>Okay.</i>

1458
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:41,098
<i>All right.</i>

1459
01:33:41,201 --> 01:33:43,410
<i>Yeah.</i>

1460
01:33:43,514 --> 01:33:45,067
<i>Here we go.</i>

1461
01:33:51,522 --> 01:33:54,974
<i>Looks like it's made out
of, like... it's like a skin.</i>

1462
01:33:55,077 --> 01:33:58,529
<i>It's something on the walls.</i>

1463
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:03,534
Maybe some kind of...

1464
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:06,399
<i>I don't know.</i>

1465
01:34:06,502 --> 01:34:09,091
<i>It looks organic.</i>

1466
01:34:09,195 --> 01:34:15,028
<i>Not seeing any seats
or controls anywhere.</i>

1467
01:34:15,132 --> 01:34:16,409
<i>Oh.</i>

1468
01:34:16,512 --> 01:34:17,962
<i>God.</i>

1469
01:34:18,066 --> 01:34:19,768
<i>And the floor is, like,
a little bit squishy.</i>

1470
01:34:19,792 --> 01:34:24,417
<i>I don't know what
I'm looking at here.</i>

1471
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:27,420
<i>Maybe it's like
an exoskeleton.</i>

1472
01:34:27,523 --> 01:34:29,594
<i>And there's, like...
it looks like dental floss</i>

1473
01:34:29,698 --> 01:34:30,975
<i>on the whole thing.</i>

1474
01:34:31,079 --> 01:34:32,332
<i>Obviously,
it's not dental floss,</i>

1475
01:34:32,356 --> 01:34:38,051
<i>but strings of something
all over the walls.</i>

1476
01:34:38,155 --> 01:34:42,400
<i>And there's patterns
or something here.</i>

1477
01:34:42,504 --> 01:34:43,885
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

1478
01:34:43,988 --> 01:34:46,335
<i>That's the darkest
thing I've ever seen.</i>

1479
01:34:46,439 --> 01:34:47,439
<i>Ugh.</i>

1480
01:34:57,692 --> 01:35:00,004
<i>Ugh.</i>

1481
01:35:00,108 --> 01:35:05,147
<i>Some kind of membrane
or something.</i>

1482
01:35:05,251 --> 01:35:06,079
<i>Huh.</i>

1483
01:35:06,183 --> 01:35:08,461
<i>It's, like, a little bit wet.</i>

1484
01:35:08,564 --> 01:35:11,740
<i>Huh.</i>

1485
01:35:11,844 --> 01:35:15,399
<i>Smells like... I
don't know... nothing.</i>

1486
01:35:18,609 --> 01:35:22,958
<i>Gonna touch one of these,</i>

1487
01:35:23,062 --> 01:35:27,411
<i>see what happens.</i>

1488
01:35:35,212 --> 01:35:37,214
<i>Oh, I barely even touched it.</i>

1489
01:35:37,317 --> 01:35:38,317
<i>Holy hell.</i>

1490
01:35:38,387 --> 01:35:39,387
<i>That's sharp.</i>

1491
01:35:43,461 --> 01:35:44,461
<i>Oh, what is that?</i>

1492
01:35:50,606 --> 01:35:51,711
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1493
01:35:51,815 --> 01:35:53,817
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no.</i>

1494
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:55,577
<i>Oh, shit. Oh, shit.</i>

1495
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:07,244
Ow, ow, ow.

1496
01:36:17,979 --> 01:36:21,672
<i>Oh, it healed my cut.</i>

1497
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:23,260
<i>Holy shit.</i>

1498
01:36:23,363 --> 01:36:25,262
<i>I'm guessing we just saw
the future first aid.</i>

1499
01:36:25,365 --> 01:36:28,196
<i>I mean, they just saw the
injury and responded to it...</i>

1500
01:36:28,299 --> 01:36:32,165
<i>little microscopic
nanotechnology.</i>

1501
01:36:32,269 --> 01:36:33,960
<i>Huh.</i>

1502
01:36:34,064 --> 01:36:37,377
<i>Those filaments are
a remarkable material.</i>

1503
01:36:37,481 --> 01:36:39,414
<i>I mean, it was... it cut
through me like butter,</i>

1504
01:36:39,517 --> 01:36:42,210
<i>but I guess if you had
a skin that was more,</i>

1505
01:36:42,313 --> 01:36:45,834
<i>say, dense,
for example... oh, fuck.</i>

1506
01:36:48,354 --> 01:36:50,321
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1507
01:37:01,194 --> 01:37:03,024
<i>So I turned my
camera light off.</i>

1508
01:37:03,127 --> 01:37:05,785
<i>Let me turn IR back on.</i>

1509
01:37:11,101 --> 01:37:12,792
<i>I can't see any of that...</i>

1510
01:37:12,896 --> 01:37:14,587
<i>look through the camera.</i>

1511
01:37:18,487 --> 01:37:21,870
<i>Whatever it is,
that pod is glowing.</i>

1512
01:38:31,491 --> 01:38:32,492
Oh.

1513
01:38:37,463 --> 01:38:38,464
Oh.

1514
01:38:42,537 --> 01:38:43,814
<i>Okay.</i>

1515
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:48,750
<i>He went in there,
and it's closed.</i>

1516
01:38:48,853 --> 01:38:50,579
<i>I think it's sleeping.</i>

1517
01:38:54,376 --> 01:39:00,348
<i>There's, like, some kind of
pattern on the walls here.</i>

1518
01:39:00,451 --> 01:39:06,388
<i>I'm gonna see if
I can get this open.</i>

1519
01:39:09,564 --> 01:39:11,876
<i>Ow.</i>

1520
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:15,052
<i>Wow. Wow.</i>

1521
01:39:15,156 --> 01:39:16,329
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

1522
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:28,065
<i>Okay, this way now.</i>

1523
01:39:28,169 --> 01:39:30,274
<i>They've got animals in here.</i>

1524
01:39:30,378 --> 01:39:36,694
<i>Was that... it's
like an octopus.</i>

1525
01:39:36,798 --> 01:39:39,904
<i>There we've got a spider.</i>

1526
01:39:40,008 --> 01:39:41,147
<i>Oh.</i>

1527
01:39:46,256 --> 01:39:48,983
<i>I guess they don't have
a formula for humans...</i>

1528
01:39:49,086 --> 01:39:51,468
<i>some sort of lizard
or bird, maybe.</i>

1529
01:39:51,571 --> 01:39:55,230
<i>And it looks like this
is filling with some kind</i>

1530
01:39:55,334 --> 01:39:57,025
<i>of goo that's causing stasis.</i>

1531
01:39:57,129 --> 01:39:59,614
<i>I mean, it must be for
a long-distance travel</i>

1532
01:39:59,717 --> 01:40:01,029
<i>to keep them safe.</i>

1533
01:40:01,133 --> 01:40:03,790
<i>28 years to Andromeda
is a long time.</i>

1534
01:40:05,930 --> 01:40:10,142
<i>The lights just
started pulsate.</i>

1535
01:40:10,245 --> 01:40:13,352
<i>I think it's probably time
I gotta get out of here.</i>

1536
01:40:16,493 --> 01:40:17,252
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

1537
01:40:17,356 --> 01:40:19,220
<i>Where's the door?</i>

1538
01:40:19,323 --> 01:40:20,783
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

1539
01:40:20,807 --> 01:40:21,807
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1540
01:40:21,877 --> 01:40:23,224
<i>No.</i>

1541
01:40:23,327 --> 01:40:24,546
<i>Where the fuck did it go?
No, no, no.</i>

1542
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:26,710
<i>It was right here.
It was right here.</i>

1543
01:40:26,813 --> 01:40:28,367
<i>Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck.</i>

1544
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:29,954
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

1545
01:40:30,058 --> 01:40:33,441
<i>This looks like some
kind of a countdown.</i>

1546
01:40:33,544 --> 01:40:35,477
<i>No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

1547
01:40:35,581 --> 01:40:38,377
<i>Please, please, please,
please, please, no.</i>

1548
01:42:08,708 --> 01:42:12,885
I think they did the best
they could on my arm.

1549
01:42:15,405 --> 01:42:20,824
It looks like that was just
the initial push into orbit.

1550
01:42:20,927 --> 01:42:23,723
The force was incredible.

1551
01:42:23,827 --> 01:42:28,728
That's probably why
the animals and the pilots...

1552
01:42:28,832 --> 01:42:30,592
they need constant stasis.

1553
01:42:30,696 --> 01:42:32,939
I mean, I've never felt
anything like it.

1554
01:42:33,043 --> 01:42:38,255
The technology that you need
to go into hyperspeed...

1555
01:42:38,359 --> 01:42:41,327
I mean, it must be incredible.

1556
01:42:41,431 --> 01:42:45,297
I think you need shielding
and life support

1557
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,954
just for the heat
and the radiation alone.

1558
01:42:48,058 --> 01:42:51,165
I mean...

1559
01:42:51,268 --> 01:42:52,959
It's, uh...

1560
01:44:39,307 --> 01:44:42,621
Please, no more.

1561
01:45:49,722 --> 01:45:52,000
<i>What really fascinates me
about this stuff</i>

1562
01:45:52,104 --> 01:45:55,314
<i>is what people believe.</i>

1563
01:45:55,418 --> 01:45:56,764
The big mystery, of course, is

1564
01:45:56,867 --> 01:45:59,870
what happened
to the eldest son?

1565
01:45:59,974 --> 01:46:01,700
<i>He vanished.</i>

1566
01:46:01,803 --> 01:46:05,186
<i>The property was left
vacant and abandoned.</i>

1567
01:46:05,289 --> 01:46:07,740
<i>So everything was sold.</i>

1568
01:46:07,844 --> 01:46:10,605
The house was
turned into a museum

1569
01:46:10,709 --> 01:46:14,954
<i>jointly managed by different
city and provincial agencies.</i>

1570
01:46:15,058 --> 01:46:17,129
<i>Those videotapes
probably were</i>

1571
01:46:17,232 --> 01:46:21,858
<i>collected with all the assets
and sold at an auction.</i>

1572
01:46:21,961 --> 01:46:25,482
<i>In borderline or
controversial questions,</i>

1573
01:46:25,586 --> 01:46:27,415
<i>every piece of
evidence is going</i>

1574
01:46:27,519 --> 01:46:29,797
<i>to function
almost like a mirror</i>

1575
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:32,938
<i>for the individual himself.</i>

1576
01:46:33,041 --> 01:46:35,354
Whenever you're ready.

1577
01:46:35,458 --> 01:46:37,218
<i>Like any other
piece of evidence,</i>

1578
01:46:37,321 --> 01:46:40,842
<i>the rejectionists are going
to say, gee, great makeup job.</i>

1579
01:46:40,946 --> 01:46:44,950
<i>And the believers are
gonna say, case closed.</i>

1580
01:46:45,053 --> 01:46:46,261
- Ren.
- There he is.

1581
01:46:46,365 --> 01:46:47,159
- What's up?
- All right.

1582
01:46:47,262 --> 01:46:48,781
Hey.

1583
01:46:54,718 --> 01:46:56,444
It's a humanoid form.

1584
01:46:56,548 --> 01:47:00,241
He's pulling something
out of the eldest son.

1585
01:47:00,344 --> 01:47:02,864
Those are alien eggs, maybe.

1586
01:47:02,968 --> 01:47:05,971
Oh, it looks like
he's got the camera.

1587
01:47:06,074 --> 01:47:08,318
<i>Now, this is
a probe lens, right?</i>

1588
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:10,458
It's grotesque.

1589
01:47:11,528 --> 01:47:13,012
Okay.

1590
01:47:13,116 --> 01:47:16,291
<i>Real or not,
I am very uncomfortable.</i>

1591
01:47:17,776 --> 01:47:20,675
That is really gross.

1592
01:47:20,779 --> 01:47:24,576
This has to be
analyzed, verified.

1593
01:47:24,679 --> 01:47:27,544
Now the real work has to begin.

1594
01:49:37,605 --> 01:49:40,090
<i>♪ Want to kill you</i>

1595
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:56,313
<i>♪ Put your hands up</i>

1596
01:49:56,417 --> 01:49:58,626
<i>♪ It's all right then I know</i>

1597
01:49:58,730 --> 01:50:01,318
<i>♪ The distance is
too great to measure ♪</i>

01:50:01,422 --> 01:50:02,319
