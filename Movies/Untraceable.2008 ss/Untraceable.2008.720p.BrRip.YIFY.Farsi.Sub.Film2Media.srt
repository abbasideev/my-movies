00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:15,090
This has been America News
Radio from Washington.

2
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:18,860
Now back to your local
ANR station for news on the hour.

3
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:26,036
Good evening. You're listening
to 108.9 FM, KMZR, Portland. This...

4
00:02:42,793 --> 00:02:43,953
Evening, ma'am.

5
00:03:44,922 --> 00:03:46,651
You, too.

6
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,500
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

7
00:03:57,668 --> 00:04:00,136
- Careful. Careful, it's hot.
- Thank you.

8
00:04:00,304 --> 00:04:03,603
- Busy night for the bad guys?
- Even busier night for us.

9
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:12,408
Okay.

10
00:04:12,716 --> 00:04:14,809
Let's see what you got for me.

11
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,558
Oh, hey,
because you're dying to know...

12
00:04:22,726 --> 00:04:26,822
...l'm almost positive my first date last
night is eligible for the hall of fame.

13
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,032
She was amazing.
She looked exactly like her photo.

14
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:33,701
You'll never see her again.

15
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,033
- How do you know?
- Because you look nothing like yours.

16
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:40,003
Nice one.

17
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,057
- Here's that guy I was telling you about.
- Oh, yeah?

18
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,290
He changes his name every day.
It's taken me a week to isolate him.

19
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:05,094
Listen to this.

20
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:09,034
- Tunethief. Com.
- Oh, how original.

21
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:11,901
Yeah, he offers free downloads
of pirated music.

22
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:14,270
I'm running this
in a fake virtual machine.

23
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,708
Watch what happens
when I accept his offer.

24
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:20,372
Now, he's stealing my financial data...

25
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:22,515
...and all my passwords.

26
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,121
Which I happened to have gathered
in a file called "passwords."

27
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:28,052
Nice touch.

28
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:31,793
I threw in a backdoor Trojan so
we can see what he's doing with it.

29
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:35,125
He's run up a quarter-million dollars
in fraud the past three weeks.

30
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:38,597
- Well, what's he into?
- High-end tech and low-end porn.

31
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:43,035
God. You sure it's a guy? If it's
a woman, she could be my soul mate.

32
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:44,639
Send it over to me.

33
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:47,739
There you go.

34
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:50,442
My dummy Capital One card.
Hope he goes for it.

35
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:51,774
Okay, I see it.

36
00:05:54,217 --> 00:05:57,015
I'm surprised he has
the patience for auctions.

37
00:05:57,821 --> 00:06:01,313
- Oh, you've got him now.
- Okay, there's his IP address.

38
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:03,384
Let's get his physical one.

39
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,757
Portland Police sent this over.
They weren't sure what to do with it.

40
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,420
Thank you.

41
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:12,101
- It is a woman.
- ER nurse, lives alone.

42
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,767
No priors,
no history of online purchases.

43
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,668
It's not her. Gotta be a neighbor...

44
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:21,504
...somebody close by, someone
who could access her wireless router.

45
00:06:21,678 --> 00:06:24,670
Sharon Dobbs lives here.

46
00:06:25,048 --> 00:06:27,949
All right. Here we go,
here's somebody.

47
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:33,352
Sam Barrows. He's a computer
programmer for the school district.

48
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:35,423
He's lived there six weeks.
He's a renter.

49
00:06:35,592 --> 00:06:38,584
He's registered for three handguns
and two assault rifles.

50
00:06:38,762 --> 00:06:39,786
That's your guy.

51
00:06:39,963 --> 00:06:42,898
Jennifer Marsh, FBI Cyber Crimes
up in Portland.

52
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:45,330
We need you to knock down
a door for us.

53
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,147
Oh, I gotta get reassigned.

54
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:07,216
What's the matter?

55
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,722
It's just a sickness. It's just too much.

56
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:12,020
I got this
retired high school principal...

57
00:07:12,195 --> 00:07:14,459
...offering to come over
to where I'm babysitting.

58
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:17,259
He's got so many chats,
he can't keep his names straight.

59
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:19,629
He keeps calling me Jill
instead of Molly.

60
00:07:19,803 --> 00:07:22,863
I'm only interested in what his
cellmates are gonna call him.

61
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,836
I'm taking a break. Do you want?

62
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:27,476
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

63
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:48,355
All right.

64
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,043
I see feet! Get your hands up!
Get your hands up!

65
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:09,913
On your stomach! On your stomach!

66
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:29,096
- On flawless, cut Natalie K diamonds.

67
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:33,402
Huge savings on one-karat diamonds.
Presented by the LaRog Brothers.

68
00:08:37,414 --> 00:08:40,315
- What the hell is this?
- I don't know. I'm running it down now.

69
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:41,780
It is streaming live.

70
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:44,420
Just when you thought
you've seen it all.

71
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:47,313
Oh, look, a message from our sponsor.

72
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,482
"Ha-ha. Only serious."

73
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:54,827
Jennifer Marsh, Cyber Crimes.

74
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:58,565
Carter Thompson here.
I'm at the Barrow residence.

75
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:02,061
The suspect's in custody.
Hard drive's intact.

76
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:06,266
- Plenty of contraband.
- Good work. Hey, let me guess.

77
00:09:06,443 --> 00:09:09,708
It's not just Barrow. His son's
involved. He's got a son?

78
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,346
What makes you say that?

79
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:13,914
Well, high-tech toys and porn...

80
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:16,847
...and then out of the blue,
he buys a gold wristwatch.

81
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,954
How come? And then it hit me.

82
00:09:19,122 --> 00:09:23,684
01-10-57.
Sunday's his father's birthday.

83
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:26,792
Sweet dreams, Marsh.

84
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:33,860
Good morning.

85
00:09:34,037 --> 00:09:37,529
We'll return to America News Radio
after the local news and weather.

86
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:39,436
It's the 7:00 hour.

87
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:43,272
This is KMZR, 108.9 FM, Portland.

88
00:09:43,446 --> 00:09:47,644
And on the Web at mzrnews. Org.
First, the weather.

89
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:51,309
The hurricane system that has poured
3 inches of rain on western Portland...

90
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:54,389
... in the past 24 hours
has finally let up.

91
00:09:54,557 --> 00:09:57,890
Though there is no sign of an easing
of the near-freezing temperatures...

92
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:03,996
OnStar operator Tina. Good morning,
Ms. Marsh. How can I assist you?

93
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:06,067
Yes, Tina.

94
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:09,927
I'd like to get home
sometime before Easter.

95
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:11,937
I'm in a traffic jam here.

96
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:14,133
Okay, let's see.

97
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:17,246
You're in the middle
of a gaper's block.

98
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:21,248
You should be past the accident
in about 100 yards.

99
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:26,287
- Okay, I see it now. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

100
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:32,222
Come on, keep it moving.

101
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:08,522
- Shit, you scared me.
- Watch your mouth, young lady.

102
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:13,128
Hey, that's what I said to you
when you were a kid.

103
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:16,500
I know, Mom. That's what
makes it so darn funny.

104
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:18,402
Oh, somebody's crabby.

105
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:21,442
Sorry. Long night.

106
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:38,893
Mom!

107
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:41,724
- Look at the outfit I'm making.
- I can see that.

108
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:44,731
- You're stealing my job.
- You were late.

109
00:11:44,901 --> 00:11:48,234
I know. I'm sorry about that, sweetie.

110
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:50,400
Catch any bad guys?

111
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:54,539
One. Just one.

112
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,243
Okay, I'm coming.

113
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:05,548
Slowpoke. The slowest poke
I've ever seen, ever.

114
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:08,221
I'm coming.

115
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,485
- How are things with you and Maddy?
- Better.

116
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:16,257
Mrs. Tischler's gonna
give us a second chance.

117
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:19,869
- A second chance at what?
- Being friends.

118
00:12:20,036 --> 00:12:22,800
Oh, of course. I think that's great.

119
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:26,472
She can come to my party now.
Make sure to send her mom an Evite.

120
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:28,611
- You got it.
- Maybe Grandma should do it.

121
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:29,972
- I'll do it.
- Are you sure?

122
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:33,274
When I say I'll do it, I'll do it,
okay? I promise.

123
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,611
- I love you.
- I love you, too, babe.

124
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,352
I bet you'd like me
to do this some other time!

125
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:16,082
Hey, friendly.

126
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:11,239
All right, Jennifer. Let's see
this tortured kitty of yours.

127
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:13,348
Torture's over, sir.

128
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:17,475
- Yeah, I should say so.
- Poor Lulu.

129
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:19,087
That was the cat's name.

130
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:22,689
The owner, Scotty Hillman,
26, from West Linn...

131
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:26,955
...says she was snatched a few days
ago from his lawn during a yard sale.

132
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,064
He recognized her fancy collar.

133
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:30,824
West Linn. So this site...

134
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,901
...which could have originated
anywhere from Oslo to Istanbul...

135
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,662
Is local. Yes, sir.

136
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:37,465
The odds of that are pretty steep.

137
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,871
About a million to one, if it were
a coincidence, which it's not.

138
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:44,172
The only way we found out about this
is because it was tipped...

139
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:48,374
...to the county sheriff's office and the
police within minutes of it going up.

140
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:51,520
Both tips came from a pay phone
in the central city...

141
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:55,283
...so whoever is behind the site
is local and wants attention.

142
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,426
- Shut him down.
- I just did.

143
00:15:00,663 --> 00:15:03,154
- There you go.
- I'll type the address in again.

144
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,132
It's been doing that all night.

145
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:16,244
The site's IP changes constantly. Each
new address is an exploited server...

146
00:15:16,412 --> 00:15:18,277
...that's running a mirror of the site.

147
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:21,343
The site's Russian name server
uses a low TTL...

148
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:24,543
...so your computer constantly queries
the name server's record.

149
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:27,053
That's how it gives
you a new address consistently.

150
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:29,919
There are thousands of exploited
servers on the Internet...

151
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:32,152
...so he won't run out of victims soon.

152
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:34,296
He's accessing these machines
so quickly...

153
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:36,694
...he's got to be
running his own botnet.

154
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:38,356
We are blackholing these IPs...

155
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:41,628
...but every time we shut one down,
a new mirror pops up.

156
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:44,204
I don't understand a single word
you just said.

157
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:46,137
What does Russia
have to do with this?

158
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:49,472
The domain registrar
and name servers are all in Russia.

159
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:51,637
We have no jurisdiction there.

160
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:54,146
Jennifer...

161
00:15:54,317 --> 00:15:56,080
... it's a cat.
- Yeah.

162
00:15:56,252 --> 00:15:59,619
Considering the state of the world,
aren't there more important things...

163
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:03,247
...to be concerned about, like
something under our jurisdiction?

164
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:07,955
Back to work, gentlemen.

165
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:21,969
Things are about to get warmer when
one of the hottest hockey rivalries...

166
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,408
Are you the guy? You got the
extra ticket for the hockey game?

167
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:26,174
Grandma! Grandma! Grandma!

168
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:27,866
- Did you get it?
- Yes, I did!

169
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:30,069
Oh, my God, I'm so proud of you!

170
00:17:30,246 --> 00:17:33,147
And the boy I fought was so tall too.

171
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:36,581
- Careful, I'm all wet.
- So am I.

172
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:39,984
We celebrated. We had an ice cream.

173
00:17:40,456 --> 00:17:42,083
Hello.

174
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:21,254
Mom?

175
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,728
- Honey... Mom, please!
- Okay, okay.

176
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,164
Come on, baby.
Let's get you out of these clothes.

177
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,537
I've been monitoring the site all week.
Nothing but a still of the dead kitten.

178
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,702
Last night around 11, the site
went down, I'd hoped forever.

179
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,408
Anyway, a few minutes ago, this.

180
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:46,747
It's the same basement
still streaming live.

181
00:18:46,923 --> 00:18:50,950
The top is the number of active viewers
and some chemical-dosage flow.

182
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:53,823
He's carved the name of the website
into the guy's chest.

183
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:55,588
He's threatening to drain him.

184
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:58,825
Threatening to drain what, his blood?
How's he gonna do that?

185
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:01,697
Those letters aren't any deeper
than paper cuts.

186
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:03,338
Not the cuts, it's the bleeding.

187
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:06,498
We think that box regulates
the fluid going into the victim.

188
00:19:06,676 --> 00:19:09,509
Those cables are probably
connected to our guy's computer.

189
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,375
Look, his nose is starting
to bleed and he's bruising.

190
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:15,073
We think those bags have
some anticoagulant in them.

191
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:18,448
I've got a list of them right here.
The most common is heparin.

192
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:22,785
If you get the dose right, you save a
life. Wrong, you've got a hemophiliac.

193
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:27,093
So the more people who visit the site,
the more the drug is released...

194
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:28,560
...and the faster he bleeds.

195
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:31,256
- That's what we believe.
- Well, isn't that wonderful?

196
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:34,961
Well, if that counter is accurate,
the public would seem to agree.

197
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:37,071
They're tuning in at an alarming rate.

198
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,538
The victim's name
is Herbert Miller, 54.

199
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:43,076
Lives in Sellwood, works
for Burnside Executive Charter.

200
00:19:43,246 --> 00:19:47,182
Friday night, got back from a shuttle
to Mount Hood, called his wife...

201
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,615
...says that he gets an e-mail
from a friend of a friend...

202
00:19:50,786 --> 00:19:53,653
...offering center-ice seats
to the Winter Hawks game.

203
00:19:53,823 --> 00:19:55,848
He promises
he'll be home afterwards.

204
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:57,890
- He wasn't.
- Any priors?

205
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:01,586
- Who, Miller?
- Why is that relevant?

206
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:04,494
Remember that snuff film
sent to the L.A. Office last year?

207
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:07,534
Teenage geisha cut in two.
Looked as real as anything you saw.

208
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:11,571
Six weeks later, they found her alive
and well, waiting tables in Little Tokyo.

209
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:14,608
Maybe Miller's involved somehow.
Maybe there's a connection.

210
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:29,489
What are you doing to me?

211
00:20:55,051 --> 00:20:56,143
Mrs. Miller!

212
00:21:00,356 --> 00:21:02,051
Just go away. Just leave.

213
00:21:02,224 --> 00:21:05,091
- Okay, folks, one side, please.
- I don't know.

214
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:08,025
Come on. Police.
Coming through. Mrs. Miller.

215
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:10,555
Back off. Back off. Mrs. Miller.

216
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:13,361
- Portland Police. May we come in?
- Thank God you're here.

217
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:15,697
I need you to back off right now.

218
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,274
My name is Detective Box.
This is my partner, Detective Moy.

219
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:25,380
Listen, is there someplace
else we can talk?

220
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:27,713
Yeah, let's go outside.

221
00:21:35,091 --> 00:21:37,855
Oh, shit. Fuck!

222
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:41,996
So, Mrs. Miller, when was the
last time you saw your husband?

223
00:21:42,898 --> 00:21:44,388
Yesterday morning.

224
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:50,028
He called, and he said he'd got tickets
to the Winter Hawks game last night.

225
00:21:50,206 --> 00:21:54,074
He likes hockey, and I just wanted
him to come straight home.

226
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:56,404
Okay. Listen...

227
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:00,140
...I understand what you're going
through is very difficult. All right?

228
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:04,150
But you're making it worse by talking
to the press. Don't talk to the press.

229
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,548
Do you understand? Listen.

230
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:09,418
Don't talk to the press
and stay off the computer. Okay?

231
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:34,474
Listen to this. I'm running the logs
from that mirror we took down.

232
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,882
He's blocking all the foreign IPs. Only
Americans can gain access to the site.

233
00:22:39,055 --> 00:22:41,046
How patriotic.

234
00:22:41,657 --> 00:22:44,854
We've scanned every newsgroup,
chat room, blog, website and forum...

235
00:22:45,027 --> 00:22:48,622
...referencing "Kill With Me,"
and I think we found our first post.

236
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:52,427
It appeared just before the site went
up, then it was spammed Web-wide.

237
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:55,161
"A cat caught in a rattrap.
How's that for irony?

238
00:22:55,337 --> 00:22:58,397
It's streaming live on killwithme. Com.
It's awesome. Check it out."

239
00:22:58,574 --> 00:23:01,407
It was posted by a sophomore
named Andrew Kilburn.

240
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:05,604
It came from his account, but it didn't
actually originate from his computer.

241
00:23:05,781 --> 00:23:08,716
So our guy hacked his account
and used it to start the thread.

242
00:23:08,884 --> 00:23:11,079
- Yeah.
- Let's go after the originating IP.

243
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,015
Oh, God.

244
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:19,058
It's too bad this guy wasn't
a Boy Scout.

245
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:21,753
He could just blink Morse code
and tell us where he is.

246
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:39,775
Okay, I've got the "who is."
It comes back Blue Sky ISP.

247
00:23:39,949 --> 00:23:43,942
- Username and password, please.
- Coming to you now.

248
00:23:47,022 --> 00:23:49,718
- "Chang's Restaurant"?
- He hacked into their site?

249
00:23:49,892 --> 00:23:52,690
No. No. Half the office eats there.

250
00:23:52,862 --> 00:23:55,831
He's messing with us.
He wanted us to find this.

251
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:58,125
Who the hell is this guy?

252
00:24:05,107 --> 00:24:07,598
Jennifer Marsh, Detective Eric Box.

253
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:09,971
Portland Police has him
on the Miller abduction.

254
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:13,513
- Jennifer's our case agent on this.
- Case agent, sir?

255
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:15,547
- You caught it, you got it.
- Please.

256
00:24:15,718 --> 00:24:18,653
Sir, anyone else. You know I'm
on nights because of my daughter.

257
00:24:18,821 --> 00:24:20,755
I understand that, but you're it.

258
00:24:22,057 --> 00:24:23,888
- We forming a task force?
- Not yet.

259
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:25,890
Not yet?
How much more do you need?

260
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:29,724
So far we have one dead cat and a man
who may or may not be in danger...

261
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:33,198
That's today. You think this is it?
It's just the beginning.

262
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:35,259
Marsh, hold it.

263
00:24:35,437 --> 00:24:38,167
You share what you've got,
and then you take it from there.

264
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,002
Appreciate your coming in, detective.

265
00:24:44,013 --> 00:24:46,277
All right. You first.

266
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:49,583
Well, we found Miller's car
in the Rose Garden parking lot.

267
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:51,686
No prints but his own.

268
00:24:51,854 --> 00:24:54,755
We passed out photos of the
basement to some local contractors.

269
00:24:54,924 --> 00:24:58,416
They say, judging from the timbers,
the house was built in the '20s or '30s.

270
00:24:58,594 --> 00:25:01,757
Which narrows it down to,
you know, half the city.

271
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,924
Yeah, what else?

272
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:08,831
Miller appears to be a decent guy.
He's a Vietnam vet...

273
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:11,996
...coaches his daughter's soccer,
they go to church every Sunday.

274
00:25:12,174 --> 00:25:14,301
So why'd the subject pick him?

275
00:25:15,177 --> 00:25:16,769
"Subject"?

276
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,113
Are we in science class?

277
00:25:19,882 --> 00:25:22,578
- What would you prefer?
- How about "piece of shit"?

278
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:25,676
Why Miller?

279
00:25:26,322 --> 00:25:28,586
I don't know. Maybe it was random.

280
00:25:28,757 --> 00:25:30,588
What about the kitten?
Talk to that guy?

281
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,989
Scotty Hillman, yeah.
He's a fucking jackass.

282
00:25:33,162 --> 00:25:35,562
All he cares about is getting
the kitten's collar...

283
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:38,666
...because he paid 12 bucks
for it on bidityours. Com

284
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:41,667
Which I suppose is a lot of money
if you're flipping burgers.

285
00:25:41,837 --> 00:25:45,295
What I would like to know is,
why him? Why his kitten?

286
00:25:45,474 --> 00:25:48,841
Why take the risk of stealing when
you can get one free at any shelter?

287
00:25:49,345 --> 00:25:52,075
- What do you guys got?
- It's a website.

288
00:25:52,248 --> 00:25:55,342
It's like nothing we've ever seen.
It's extremely sophisticated.

289
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:58,611
As long as its source-streaming site
is a ghost, it's untraceable.

290
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:02,615
This guy can invite the world to help
him kill Miller or anybody...

291
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:05,624
...and there's not a goddamn thing
we can do about it.

292
00:26:10,266 --> 00:26:11,858
Excuse me.

293
00:26:21,277 --> 00:26:24,610
- It's over.
- Yeah.

294
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,014
The numbers, they just... exploded.

295
00:26:35,357 --> 00:26:38,053
"Rolling on the floor laughing.

296
00:26:38,227 --> 00:26:39,387
Thank you for..."

297
00:26:40,262 --> 00:26:42,696
"For all your support.

298
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:44,127
More to come."

299
00:26:46,368 --> 00:26:48,529
Well, we'll see about that.

300
00:26:52,508 --> 00:26:54,738
It's a jungle in there.

301
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:28,138
Hey, I just went to the site
after the guy was dead...

302
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,768
I got a list of assholes my girlfriends
and me think he ought to kill next.

303
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:38,079
Last seen five days ago, FBI agents
have been working around the clock...

304
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,491
There's a pickup truck.

305
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:51,633
What's that on the back, a gun rack?

306
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:55,801
Yeah, well, there's no way that freak is
stepping foot in my dad's country club.

307
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:57,802
So call Tucker.

308
00:28:12,054 --> 00:28:14,887
- At 7: 15 a.m., a vehicle at the home...

309
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:17,787
... of Oregon congressman
Joseph A. Restom.

310
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,929
Herbert Miller had been the focus
of an intense local...

311
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:23,087
... and statewide police
and FBI search...

312
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:25,631
... since midday Saturday
when he showed up...

313
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:29,567
...on an Internet website
being tortured and murdered live.

314
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:33,401
Now, because of the uniqueness
of the crime, and because the FBI...

315
00:28:33,575 --> 00:28:37,409
...is able to provide resources
critical to this investigation...

316
00:28:38,046 --> 00:28:42,176
...they will be leading the interagency
task force assigned to the case.

317
00:28:43,152 --> 00:28:47,282
He flew helicopters for a living. What's
his connection to a U.S. Congressman?

318
00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:51,187
Our guy had to dump the body.
Why not on a national stage?

319
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,659
You think he did it to get a press
conference? Build up his fan base?

320
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,821
Don't call them fans.
They're accomplices.

321
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:59,900
All right, whatever.
Why'd he choose Restom?

322
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:01,399
He's owned by Silicon Valley.

323
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:04,505
He sits on the House Judiciary
Committee on Net neutrality.

324
00:29:04,673 --> 00:29:07,506
No restriction on content,
all traffic treated equally.

325
00:29:07,676 --> 00:29:10,474
- Wouldn't our guy be for that?
- You'd think so.

326
00:29:10,646 --> 00:29:12,614
Miller's clients
were corporate executives.

327
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:14,248
Maybe some were from high-tech.

328
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:16,407
I'll track down a customer list.

329
00:29:16,585 --> 00:29:19,520
- What about the neighbors?
- One saw a van drive by at 4 a.m.

330
00:29:19,688 --> 00:29:21,781
Another heard a car door slam
a minute later.

331
00:29:21,957 --> 00:29:23,948
Figured it was the paper
being delivered.

332
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:26,253
Excuse me a second.
Might have something here.

333
00:29:26,428 --> 00:29:28,828
- What is it?
- Tip just came in through a hot line.

334
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:33,400
Guy named Arthur James Elmer, an
engineer at Chadwick Technologies.

335
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:35,696
He was fired six months ago...

336
00:29:35,871 --> 00:29:38,339
...for installing a wireless Webcam
in the men's room.

337
00:29:38,507 --> 00:29:41,840
Nice. Anyway, he's been talking
about killwithme.com nonstop...

338
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,274
...ever since the kitty died.
Wanna ride with us?

339
00:29:44,446 --> 00:29:46,346
Let me check this guy out
on my end.

340
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:48,642
- We'll catch up later.
- Yeah.

341
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:20,779
- So, what's going on?
- He won't let us in. Kind of shy.

342
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:29,881
Elmer.

343
00:30:32,394 --> 00:30:35,886
Look, if you didn't do anything,
you got nothing to lose letting us in.

344
00:30:36,865 --> 00:30:40,357
And if you did, we can always
come back with a warrant.

345
00:30:43,171 --> 00:30:45,298
So how do you wanna play it?

346
00:30:53,582 --> 00:30:55,106
Hi.

347
00:30:56,084 --> 00:30:57,676
I'm Detective Box.

348
00:30:57,853 --> 00:31:00,083
Unusual name.

349
00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:03,617
Well, it wasn't up to me.

350
00:31:05,928 --> 00:31:09,523
So you really think I killed that guy?

351
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:13,033
I don't know. Did you?

352
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:15,367
Well, I'm flattered.

353
00:31:15,537 --> 00:31:18,700
I found it highly entertaining,
especially at the end.

354
00:31:18,874 --> 00:31:20,933
The way viewership
increased exponentially...

355
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:24,272
...like some sort of epidemic.

356
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,111
Can I see the basement?

357
00:32:09,524 --> 00:32:11,287
You like movies, huh?

358
00:32:12,227 --> 00:32:13,717
Yeah, who doesn't?

359
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,497
Me.

360
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:20,797
Burn your own copies?

361
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:22,493
You know that's illegal, right?

362
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:36,079
Can't say they didn't warn you.

363
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,927
Got our proof it wasn't Elmer.

364
00:32:54,736 --> 00:32:56,431
Starting Friday at 1 p. M...

365
00:32:56,772 --> 00:33:00,799
...Elmer was logged into a chat
room for 12 consecutive hours.

366
00:33:00,976 --> 00:33:04,844
At the time Miller disappeared,
Elmer was in a steamy private chat...

367
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:08,813
...with the first tenor of the
Men's Chorus of Greater Tacoma.

368
00:33:08,984 --> 00:33:11,111
It still felt good arresting him.

369
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:35,609
- Hello?
- I caught you.

370
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:40,180
- Barely. I've got a big date tonight.
- Big, special or big, large?

371
00:33:40,348 --> 00:33:44,341
I don't know. I haven't met Peggy
the secretary yet. What's up?

372
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:48,353
I had a thought. Remember that
Andrew Kilburn guy and his review?

373
00:33:48,523 --> 00:33:50,286
Yeah, sure. What about it?

374
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,084
Well, why use his account?

375
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:56,992
I mean, maybe it wasn't random.
Maybe they know each other.

376
00:33:57,466 --> 00:33:59,696
- Yeah, it's possible.
- Yeah.

377
00:33:59,868 --> 00:34:02,996
- All right. I'll see you Sunday.
- Wait, Sunday?

378
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:05,498
Annie's birthday.

379
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:09,200
Oh, shit, I forgot.

380
00:34:09,377 --> 00:34:11,743
- Okay, can I bring a date?
- Are you kidding?

381
00:34:12,013 --> 00:34:14,038
You don't even know
if you like this girl.

382
00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:17,674
No, not Peggy. Melanie.
She's a social worker.

383
00:34:17,853 --> 00:34:20,413
She likes sushi and rock-climbing
and Dickens.

384
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:24,218
- I can't believe you.
- It's a numbers game.

385
00:34:24,392 --> 00:34:27,020
Fine, fine. I gotta go.

386
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:29,595
Okay. Hey, you got a date?

387
00:34:29,765 --> 00:34:33,758
- Good night.
- Okay. Bye. Good night, Sam.

388
00:34:47,816 --> 00:34:49,681
Molly gave me
a birthday present already.

389
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:51,751
It's a computer game
that I downloaded.

390
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,946
- It's about horses.
- How sweet of her. That looks like fun.

391
00:34:55,957 --> 00:34:57,948
Not really. It's kind of silly.

392
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,294
- I'll show it to you later.
- Okay, honey. I love you. Gotta run.

393
00:35:34,563 --> 00:35:37,532
Come on, Annie. Let me get one first.

394
00:35:39,734 --> 00:35:41,429
Somebody order a bunch of pizzas?

395
00:35:41,603 --> 00:35:42,968
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

396
00:35:43,138 --> 00:35:45,197
- Hey, Griffin.
- For the birthday girl. Hello.

397
00:35:45,373 --> 00:35:48,206
- How are you? Over here?
- Over here.

398
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:54,177
Listen, I only made it through
a few months of Kilburn's posts.

399
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:56,146
- We'll need more bodies on this.
- Okay.

400
00:35:56,318 --> 00:36:01,085
He blogged, he uploaded vids, he
built sites. He practically lived online.

401
00:36:01,256 --> 00:36:04,248
- What, not anymore?
- Not since he died...

402
00:36:04,426 --> 00:36:07,793
...of something called
diabetic ketoacidosis.

403
00:36:07,963 --> 00:36:11,296
Which is what happens when you
don't take your insulin for a few days.

404
00:36:11,466 --> 00:36:14,367
Anyway, an hour after his body
was found...

405
00:36:14,536 --> 00:36:15,696
...Kill With Me went up.

406
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:18,840
And an hour after that, Kilburn's
review was spammed Web-wide.

407
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:22,875
- And you think our guy killed him?
- The ME called it a suicide.

408
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,498
Hi.

409
00:36:49,671 --> 00:36:51,332
You're right on time.

410
00:36:51,506 --> 00:36:55,101
Yeah, well, it's a curse.
I spend half my life waiting for people.

411
00:36:55,277 --> 00:36:58,405
So... Dave Williams.

412
00:37:01,182 --> 00:37:05,619
That's a great address, by the way.
Eights bring prosperity.

413
00:37:05,787 --> 00:37:08,688
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

414
00:37:09,524 --> 00:37:11,617
- Come in.
- Thanks.

415
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:28,566
Here you go, honey.

416
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:30,802
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

417
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,676
Detective.

418
00:37:36,851 --> 00:37:38,978
- Hi.
- Hi.

419
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:42,487
Griffin invited me
to his birthday party.

420
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:46,220
Yeah. Kind of a young crowd.

421
00:37:46,394 --> 00:37:48,453
Kind of a young crowd, Griffin.

422
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,463
- Well, do you skate?
- No.

423
00:37:51,633 --> 00:37:53,658
- Thank you.
- Yeah, go ahead.

424
00:37:53,835 --> 00:37:56,668
Look, I'm gonna get out of here.
I'm sorry.

425
00:37:56,838 --> 00:38:00,672
You just got here. Don't go.
Have some pizza.

426
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:03,811
Come on. It's not that bad.

427
00:38:13,488 --> 00:38:16,651
Wow, you must really like Asia, huh?

428
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,491
Just Korea.

429
00:38:22,864 --> 00:38:24,593
Korea.

430
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:27,057
Well, it's fabulous.

431
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:29,827
Thank you.

432
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,574
So you gonna let me see them?

433
00:38:35,143 --> 00:38:36,838
Of course.

434
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:39,246
Through the kitchen.

435
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:46,649
I gotta tell you, a 710 Pullman
and a 712 Observation Car?

436
00:38:46,821 --> 00:38:48,948
My heart skipped a beat
when I got your e-mail.

437
00:38:49,124 --> 00:38:53,288
- Lf they're really in mint condition...
- My dad and I hardly ever used them.

438
00:38:53,828 --> 00:38:58,026
We mostly played foosball
and we built things.

439
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:02,436
Toys, contraptions.

440
00:39:03,004 --> 00:39:05,029
We had a workshop.

441
00:39:05,707 --> 00:39:07,641
He died last year.

442
00:39:10,378 --> 00:39:13,404
Well, I'm sorry.

443
00:39:27,462 --> 00:39:28,063
Annie, would you come over here
for a second? Bring your skates.

444
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:30,691
Annie, would you come over here
for a second? Bring your skates.

445
00:39:30,865 --> 00:39:33,959
- Okay.
- I want you to meet someone.

446
00:39:36,404 --> 00:39:39,464
This is Annie, the birthday girl.
This is my friend, Eric.

447
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:41,438
- Hello, Annie.
- Hi.

448
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:43,440
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

449
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:45,812
You must be, what, 8?

450
00:39:46,314 --> 00:39:48,805
How did you know?
Everyone else thinks I'm older.

451
00:39:50,118 --> 00:39:51,585
Well, I'm a detective.

452
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:55,921
- Are you ready to go skating finally?
- I think.

453
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,565
I sure hope you like it.

454
00:40:14,742 --> 00:40:16,369
It's a punching bag.

455
00:40:16,544 --> 00:40:17,772
Okay, so you blow it up...

456
00:40:17,946 --> 00:40:20,176
...and whenever you
get in a really bad mood...

457
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:21,906
...you sock it in the head.

458
00:40:23,251 --> 00:40:24,275
Can I do karate on it?

459
00:40:24,452 --> 00:40:28,616
Of course you can. You can do karate,
kung fu, tae kwon do.

460
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,816
- Thank you, Griffin.
- You're welcome, sweetie.

461
00:40:31,993 --> 00:40:33,324
That might be my date.

462
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,088
Mom.

463
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,225
Oh, come on.

464
00:40:41,836 --> 00:40:43,064
Happy birthday, sweetie.

465
00:40:43,238 --> 00:40:44,398
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

466
00:40:46,441 --> 00:40:48,341
Sweetheart...

467
00:40:48,843 --> 00:40:49,832
...I gotta go.

468
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:52,877
It's a real emergency, or I
would never leave you like this.

469
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:56,016
- I'll make it up to you, I promise. Okay?
- Okay.

470
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,745
I'm looking for Griffin Dowd. He's...

471
00:41:00,922 --> 00:41:01,911
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

472
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,887
- I'm Melanie.
- Oh, yes. Hi, Melanie.

473
00:41:04,058 --> 00:41:07,186
Wow, you are gorgeous.
I'm sorry. I've gotta run.

474
00:41:38,126 --> 00:41:39,684
Todd!

475
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:42,554
Isn't that your dad?

476
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:54,068
- Same build, same coloring.
- The counter's faster than last time.

477
00:41:54,776 --> 00:41:56,368
Yeah.

478
00:41:57,412 --> 00:41:59,403
I swear I've seen this guy
somewhere before.

479
00:41:59,581 --> 00:42:01,606
- Yeah.
- We all have. He's David Williams.

480
00:42:01,783 --> 00:42:03,808
He used to be
a reporter for Channel 12.

481
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:06,246
He now hosts a TV show
on public access.

482
00:42:06,487 --> 00:42:08,318
Call Bagley.
Set up a press conference.

483
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:11,083
Sir, wait just a minute, please.

484
00:42:11,492 --> 00:42:14,393
This is what he wants. Anything
you say will promote the site.

485
00:42:14,562 --> 00:42:16,792
That's a possibility,
but what would you prefer?

486
00:42:16,965 --> 00:42:18,557
Talk to National Security Agency.

487
00:42:18,733 --> 00:42:21,531
Their computer capability's
beyond ours. We need their help.

488
00:42:21,703 --> 00:42:24,297
That's fine, but I've got
a man being publicly tortured.

489
00:42:24,472 --> 00:42:27,908
How will it look if he dies and the
Bureau never tried to help the guy?

490
00:42:28,076 --> 00:42:31,842
Not as bad as if we reach out
and it kills him faster.

491
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,508
You honestly believe
that could happen?

492
00:42:37,418 --> 00:42:39,010
Yes, sir, I do.

493
00:42:47,495 --> 00:42:48,792
I'm sorry, Marsh.

494
00:42:50,598 --> 00:42:52,327
I got no choice.

495
00:43:19,994 --> 00:43:22,258
We're gathered here
to share some information...

496
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,125
... in regards to criminal conduct...

497
00:43:24,299 --> 00:43:27,063
... that originated in the
Portland metropolitan area...

498
00:43:27,235 --> 00:43:30,329
... but that has
far-reaching implications.

499
00:43:30,505 --> 00:43:32,473
Let me introduce
Special Agent-in-Charge...

500
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,040
... of the FBI's Portland field office...

501
00:43:35,209 --> 00:43:37,177
...Richard Brooks.

502
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:40,103
Thank you, chief.

503
00:43:41,149 --> 00:43:44,812
A week ago, a man was killed
in this city.

504
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,487
This barbaric, cowardly murder
was streamed live on the Internet.

505
00:43:50,658 --> 00:43:54,560
As part of the killer's design, the more
people who logged on to the site...

506
00:43:54,729 --> 00:43:59,166
... to witness the victim's suffering,
the sooner the victim died.

507
00:43:59,334 --> 00:44:01,564
Millions of Americans
chose to visit the site...

508
00:44:01,736 --> 00:44:06,435
... believing that they were witnessing
a mere hoax, a stunt or a prank.

509
00:44:06,607 --> 00:44:08,199
Well, unfortunately, it wasn't.

510
00:44:08,376 --> 00:44:10,003
Today a second individual...

511
00:44:10,178 --> 00:44:13,079
... has appeared on the site
and his life, too, is in jeopardy.

512
00:44:13,247 --> 00:44:16,705
The victim is the doting father
of two boys...

513
00:44:18,553 --> 00:44:20,919
... a loving husband of 22 years...

514
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:24,547
... and a devoted son. In other words,
he's a good American, one of us.

515
00:44:24,726 --> 00:44:28,856
The torture that he is experiencing
now is unimaginable in its cruelty.

516
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,927
We're doing what we can...

517
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:34,262
... to shut down the site
and bring the killer to justice.

518
00:44:34,502 --> 00:44:37,437
In the meantime, we ask that
everyone stay away from the site.

519
00:44:38,072 --> 00:44:40,165
Any visit to this site,
no matter how brief...

520
00:44:40,341 --> 00:44:42,400
...will only hasten the victim's death.

521
00:44:44,479 --> 00:44:47,971
Any American who visits the site
is an accomplice to murder.

522
00:44:48,149 --> 00:44:50,583
We are the murder weapon.

523
00:44:50,752 --> 00:44:54,518
- We ask that you spread the word...
- Let's main-screen the website.

524
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:58,782
Hey, Tim, I think
he's trying to say something.

525
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,294
Eight... Eight...

526
00:45:07,902 --> 00:45:10,336
Eight, eight, eight.

527
00:45:10,905 --> 00:45:12,998
Oh, I get it. It's an address, I think.

528
00:45:13,608 --> 00:45:17,635
Eight... Eight-oh-eight...

529
00:45:17,812 --> 00:45:19,473
...Newberry.
- Newberry?

530
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:21,615
There's a Newberry Road
in Laurelhurst.

531
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:48,232
Police! Open the door!

532
00:46:09,397 --> 00:46:11,194
Basement's here!

533
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:25,803
It's the wrong house.

534
00:46:33,988 --> 00:46:36,650
- Any American who visits the site...
- He was here, though.

535
00:46:36,824 --> 00:46:40,055
... is an accomplice to murder.
We are the murder weapon.

536
00:46:40,228 --> 00:46:44,221
Any American who visits the site
is an accomplice to murder.

537
00:46:44,398 --> 00:46:47,196
We are the murder weapon.
Any American...

538
00:46:47,368 --> 00:46:50,667
All right. We should send
Forensics in here.

539
00:46:52,373 --> 00:46:56,104
Any American who visits the site
is an accomplice to murder.

540
00:46:56,277 --> 00:46:59,110
We are the murder weapon.

541
00:47:04,585 --> 00:47:09,613
Yeah, I understand that. Just
have her check it again, okay?

542
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:13,021
- Six hours. So fast.
- Twice as fast as Miller.

543
00:47:13,294 --> 00:47:15,762
Nobody thinks
they did anything wrong.

544
00:47:16,464 --> 00:47:20,901
Why should they?
They're curious about a website.

545
00:47:21,402 --> 00:47:23,893
You check the headlines,
check the stock market...

546
00:47:24,071 --> 00:47:26,096
...watch some strangers have sex.

547
00:47:26,574 --> 00:47:29,134
See a journalist get his head cut off.

548
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:34,709
When did the world
go so fucking insane?

549
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:39,912
You've been working
the streets too long.

550
00:47:40,621 --> 00:47:44,751
He was definitely here.
He just got moved and didn't know it.

551
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:51,592
So Mrs. Williams is checking her
husband's e-mail for us.

552
00:47:53,901 --> 00:47:57,496
She says he was contacted about the
trains through the public TV website.

553
00:47:58,773 --> 00:48:02,573
I guess in his bio, he mentions he's
a collector. That was about a week ago.

554
00:48:03,077 --> 00:48:04,203
Who owns the house?

555
00:48:04,378 --> 00:48:10,214
Tom Park, 60s, widower. He's out
of town visiting family in South Korea.

556
00:48:10,384 --> 00:48:13,547
He runs a local market here.
He makes the trip every year.

557
00:48:14,121 --> 00:48:16,419
So our guy's a customer.

558
00:48:16,757 --> 00:48:19,749
We're trying to get ahold of Mr. Park,
see if he knows anything.

559
00:48:19,927 --> 00:48:23,055
We'll do a canvass. Seems like
a pretty tight-knit community.

560
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,822
Maybe somebody saw something.

561
00:49:40,341 --> 00:49:41,968
Did you see this?

562
00:49:45,046 --> 00:49:47,378
On the bright side, along with
every other daily...

563
00:49:47,548 --> 00:49:49,641
...they're not printing
the name of the site.

564
00:49:49,817 --> 00:49:51,751
Well, isn't that noble?

565
00:49:51,919 --> 00:49:53,113
A little late, though.

566
00:49:55,022 --> 00:49:58,219
Did Annie ever forgive you
for bailing on the party?

567
00:49:58,592 --> 00:50:02,460
Yeah. After 11 bedtime stories.
Thank you.

568
00:50:03,731 --> 00:50:07,497
You know, when we first met,
I knew you looked familiar.

569
00:50:10,404 --> 00:50:12,372
Nick and I came up together.

570
00:50:15,276 --> 00:50:17,904
Nick Haskins.
That was Annie's father, right?

571
00:50:18,979 --> 00:50:20,810
Did he introduce us?

572
00:50:21,982 --> 00:50:25,611
No. No, we never met.
I saw you at the funeral.

573
00:50:27,755 --> 00:50:29,382
Right.

574
00:50:34,729 --> 00:50:38,631
Anyway, he was a...
He was a great guy.

575
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,128
Yeah, he was a great guy.

576
00:50:51,812 --> 00:50:55,009
It's apparent our subject
is extremely organized...

577
00:50:55,182 --> 00:50:56,911
...and sophisticated.

578
00:50:57,084 --> 00:50:59,746
And based upon his ability
to subdue his victims...

579
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,684
...transport them and maintain
physical control over them...

580
00:51:02,857 --> 00:51:06,588
...in a private setting, I'd describe
the offender as highly capable.

581
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:08,729
Remember, he's not going
after easy prey.

582
00:51:08,896 --> 00:51:11,330
These abductions leave him exposed.

583
00:51:11,499 --> 00:51:14,798
Even the kitten he stole
in broad daylight. Why the risks?

584
00:51:14,969 --> 00:51:19,736
Because each of these actions was
absolutely essential to his purpose.

585
00:51:19,907 --> 00:51:22,467
You wanna catch him,
understand his goals.

586
00:51:22,643 --> 00:51:24,634
You know, this guy...

587
00:51:24,812 --> 00:51:27,303
...he's the same as
the Unabomber, Tim McVeigh.

588
00:51:27,481 --> 00:51:29,745
He's another terrorist
trying to make a statement.

589
00:51:29,917 --> 00:51:33,785
Maybe. Still, it goes back to his goals.
Why kill these particular people?

590
00:51:34,121 --> 00:51:36,555
And why is he killing them
on the Internet?

591
00:51:36,724 --> 00:51:40,285
My guess, none of it's random.
None of it.

592
00:51:45,766 --> 00:51:51,204
Okay. Every post Kilburn ever left.
Thousands. And a couple of DVDs.

593
00:51:51,372 --> 00:51:55,741
One for you, one for me. Every
video clip that he ever uploaded.

594
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:59,368
That was his real hobby, was
pulling the sick shit off the Net...

595
00:51:59,547 --> 00:52:02,812
...and then posting it
on shock-video sites.

596
00:52:03,617 --> 00:52:07,018
Anyways, this is the last post
before he died.

597
00:52:07,388 --> 00:52:09,413
It's sort of a best-of compilation...

598
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:12,115
...something he called
"The Best of the Worst."

599
00:52:18,432 --> 00:52:19,558
Oh, yeah.

600
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:24,869
Poor Kilburn. He had so much
to offer the world.

601
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:26,267
Yeah.

602
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,440
I got four more bodies from Brooks,
so let's share the pain, shall we?

603
00:52:30,611 --> 00:52:32,044
Great.

604
00:53:27,735 --> 00:53:29,566
Okay.

605
00:54:21,422 --> 00:54:25,153
Mom. TiVo's not working.

606
00:54:25,326 --> 00:54:28,454
Okay, honey.
Look, I'll be out in a minute.

607
00:54:58,292 --> 00:55:01,352
Mom, there's a video of our house
on the computer.

608
00:55:01,528 --> 00:55:04,827
Watch whatever you want, honey.
I'll be right out.

609
00:55:41,535 --> 00:55:43,935
Hey, Griff. Good morning.

610
00:55:58,852 --> 00:55:59,910
Annie.

611
00:56:09,463 --> 00:56:11,090
Annie!

612
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,763
- Annie!
- Mom?

613
00:56:19,106 --> 00:56:22,234
Baby, what are you doing out here?
What are you doing outside?

614
00:56:22,409 --> 00:56:24,775
I was just gonna ride my bike
for the camera.

615
00:56:24,945 --> 00:56:27,038
You stay with Grandma.

616
00:56:39,193 --> 00:56:41,491
Hey. Hey, that's evidence.

617
00:56:41,662 --> 00:56:44,597
- I'm sorry. My daughter, she...
- It's okay. We're here now.

618
00:56:44,765 --> 00:56:47,632
It's okay.
Do you know whose car this is?

619
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:50,497
Yeah, I think I have an idea
whose car this is.

620
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:58,002
God.

621
00:57:35,782 --> 00:57:38,649
Annie thought she'd downloaded
a game from one of her friends.

622
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:40,116
It had a backdoor Trojan.

623
00:57:40,287 --> 00:57:43,347
It got him all the way
into my wireless network.

624
00:57:43,891 --> 00:57:46,086
Which means that he has access
to all my files.

625
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:13,986
Call me when you get there.
I love you.

626
00:58:25,899 --> 00:58:27,992
Why don't you just go with them?

627
00:58:29,303 --> 00:58:31,066
What are you waiting for?

628
00:58:33,273 --> 00:58:35,207
And do what? Hide out?

629
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:37,802
That's right.

630
00:58:38,378 --> 00:58:41,404
I think you've sacrificed enough
already, don't you?

631
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,475
Nobody's gonna blame you
for taking cover.

632
00:58:45,652 --> 00:58:48,143
The piece of shit's camped out
on your front lawn.

633
00:58:48,522 --> 00:58:51,184
Annie's already lost one parent
to the job, so...

634
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:55,260
...yeah. Get lost.

635
00:58:58,932 --> 00:59:00,797
Just my opinion.

636
00:59:28,795 --> 00:59:32,162
- Yeah?
- Hey, Jen. Did they get off okay?

637
00:59:32,332 --> 00:59:36,166
Yeah. The Bureau's gonna put
them up a couple hours away.

638
00:59:36,336 --> 00:59:38,896
And I'm gonna stay someplace
closer to work.

639
00:59:39,072 --> 00:59:43,133
Good. So you wanna hear my theory
why he did this?

640
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,368
Of course.

641
00:59:44,544 --> 00:59:47,308
There is a connection
between him and Kilburn...

642
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:51,178
... and he knows you're leading
the team to find it.

643
00:59:51,451 --> 00:59:53,544
I think I might know what
that connection is.

644
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,120
Emphasis on "might."
A few things I gotta check out.

645
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:57,848
I'm on my way in. Are you coming?

646
00:59:58,825 --> 01:00:00,156
I need a couple hours.

647
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:01,791
I'll see you at the office.

648
01:00:01,962 --> 01:00:03,589
Okay, I'll show you
what I got then.

649
01:00:03,764 --> 01:00:05,197
Okay.

650
01:00:09,069 --> 01:00:12,038
- Griffin Dowd.
- Hi. It's Melanie.

651
01:00:13,874 --> 01:00:17,674
Melanie, hi. I didn't think
I'd hear from you again.

652
01:00:17,978 --> 01:00:20,845
Your e-mail was very sweet.

653
01:00:21,014 --> 01:00:23,812
Thank you. Yeah, I spent
a lot of time on that one.

654
01:00:25,786 --> 01:00:28,914
So I heard you hung out
at the roller rink.

655
01:00:29,089 --> 01:00:31,114
Even had some cake?

656
01:00:31,558 --> 01:00:34,652
Two pieces. But don't tell anybody.

657
01:00:34,828 --> 01:00:37,262
Okay, well,
your secret is safe with me.

658
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:40,730
Annie really liked you, and
you know what they say about kids.

659
01:00:40,901 --> 01:00:44,393
Along with dogs, they're terrific
judges of character.

660
01:00:45,305 --> 01:00:48,365
What can I say?
I would have to agree.

661
01:00:49,343 --> 01:00:51,641
I'm a total catch.

662
01:00:59,553 --> 01:01:01,111
Hi, Ray.

663
01:01:16,236 --> 01:01:18,727
- Where's Griffin?
- Haven't seen him.

664
01:01:19,573 --> 01:01:21,404
Brooks wants to see you.

665
01:01:21,575 --> 01:01:23,304
- Now?
- Now.

666
01:02:02,182 --> 01:02:05,310
- Agent Marsh, sir.
- Yeah, send her in.

667
01:02:09,189 --> 01:02:11,180
You wanted to see me, sir?

668
01:02:11,725 --> 01:02:13,454
How are you doing?

669
01:02:13,927 --> 01:02:17,954
Well, it was an interesting start
of the day. We're fine.

670
01:02:18,832 --> 01:02:20,356
Good.

671
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:22,999
I want you to know
I did follow up with the NSA.

672
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:26,662
As far as using their supercomputer
goes, unfortunately the answer's no.

673
01:02:28,575 --> 01:02:31,408
- Why not?
- They're barred for domestic use.

674
01:02:31,578 --> 01:02:35,605
Domestic? We've got him using
mirrors in Russia, Malaysia...

675
01:02:35,782 --> 01:02:38,842
It's too public a forum. They
don't want their capabilities known.

676
01:02:39,019 --> 01:02:40,452
As far as what they can and...

677
01:02:59,272 --> 01:03:02,002
It's Griffin. It's Griffin!

678
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,371
Where do these tubes lead?
What are those tanks?

679
01:03:09,549 --> 01:03:11,244
Tim! Punch in on those tanks.

680
01:03:14,387 --> 01:03:16,048
What's that say?

681
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,315
"Sulfuric acid"?

682
01:03:18,391 --> 01:03:19,688
Sulfuric acid?

683
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,328
If that's water in that tank...

684
01:03:27,934 --> 01:03:30,630
...pretty soon he's gonna be
sitting in battery acid.

685
01:04:06,106 --> 01:04:08,370
Don't wanna hear about
bureaus and jurisdictions.

686
01:04:08,542 --> 01:04:11,204
This is domestic terrorism,
plain and simple.

687
01:04:13,413 --> 01:04:16,974
Yeah? Well, just get it done.
Yeah. All right.

688
01:04:31,498 --> 01:04:35,298
You know, if no one was watching
right now, you'd just be sitting in water.

689
01:04:39,372 --> 01:04:43,274
But the whole world wants to watch
you die, and they don't even know you.

690
01:05:02,796 --> 01:05:05,128
It's so fast this time.

691
01:05:06,633 --> 01:05:08,999
It's word of mouth, I guess.

692
01:05:10,604 --> 01:05:12,765
Because I let you keep your badge on.

693
01:06:25,178 --> 01:06:28,204
Ray! I need your help.

694
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:36,420
Tim, go in on his eyes.

695
01:06:40,794 --> 01:06:44,560
I think he's trying to say something
to us. Here.

696
01:06:45,231 --> 01:06:48,667
Please. Do your best. Hurry!

697
01:06:52,605 --> 01:06:54,698
Right eye's dots.

698
01:06:54,874 --> 01:06:57,434
Left is... Left is dashes.

699
01:07:05,351 --> 01:07:06,875
"S."

700
01:07:19,065 --> 01:07:20,657
"I."

701
01:07:24,904 --> 01:07:26,337
"D."

702
01:07:59,172 --> 01:08:01,197
There aren't any other kids here...

703
01:08:01,374 --> 01:08:04,366
... but the swimming pool's fun
and there's satellite TV.

704
01:08:05,044 --> 01:08:07,069
Mom, are you there?

705
01:08:09,682 --> 01:08:11,513
We miss you, Mommy.
When are you coming?

706
01:08:11,684 --> 01:08:16,018
It's starting to get really boring.
Your work isn't done yet?

707
01:08:16,656 --> 01:08:18,521
I wish.

708
01:08:21,161 --> 01:08:22,753
Mom?

709
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:24,822
I have to go now, honey.

710
01:08:25,165 --> 01:08:27,793
Listen, you call me
as soon as you wake up. Okay, bug?

711
01:08:27,967 --> 01:08:31,528
- It's Box.
- I will. Love you. Say hi to Griffin.

712
01:08:31,704 --> 01:08:35,470
I love you too, honey. Bye.

713
01:08:59,966 --> 01:09:01,661
Dinner.

714
01:09:11,778 --> 01:09:14,303
I think I'll take a shower first.

715
01:09:45,378 --> 01:09:50,816
The acid was stolen from a research
lab at Marshall Junior College.

716
01:09:53,386 --> 01:09:56,719
The thief apparently knew
his way around.

717
01:10:00,093 --> 01:10:04,553
Looks like... Looks like Griffin
was baited with a phone call.

718
01:10:04,731 --> 01:10:08,599
But we can't trace it because
it was made with a spoof card.

719
01:10:08,768 --> 01:10:11,566
Yeah, it's a phone card.
Costs about 10 bucks an hour.

720
01:10:11,738 --> 01:10:14,730
Lets you program any
caller ID you want.

721
01:10:15,975 --> 01:10:19,809
This guy breached my laptop.
He must've owned Griffin's too.

722
01:10:19,979 --> 01:10:22,470
Figured out where he was vulnerable.

723
01:10:27,887 --> 01:10:29,616
Sorry.

724
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:35,689
I'm good at a lot of things, you know?

725
01:10:36,663 --> 01:10:39,131
But I'm not good at losing people.

726
01:10:39,299 --> 01:10:42,234
I'm bad at losing people.

727
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,769
Rush-hour suicide.

728
01:11:56,976 --> 01:12:01,538
I'm pretty sure that's what Griffin was
trying to say. I'm just not sure why.

729
01:12:04,751 --> 01:12:06,480
Yeah, I remember.

730
01:12:06,652 --> 01:12:09,678
He was a professor, that guy.

731
01:12:10,156 --> 01:12:13,614
Andrew Kilburn included this
in his greatest hits.

732
01:12:15,695 --> 01:12:19,756
- I was just there, like a week ago.
- Where?

733
01:12:19,999 --> 01:12:24,197
At the Bridge Diner. You know, the
one under the Broadway Bridge.

734
01:12:24,837 --> 01:12:27,499
I was talking to Scotty Hillman...

735
01:12:27,673 --> 01:12:30,073
...the guy who owned the cat.
That's where he works.

736
01:12:31,744 --> 01:12:34,110
What was this guy's name?
Do you remember?

737
01:12:35,581 --> 01:12:39,176
No. I think
he taught Chemistry, though.

738
01:12:42,088 --> 01:12:44,648
At Marshall Junior College?

739
01:12:52,298 --> 01:12:56,496
Andrew Kilburn, a sophomore at
Portland State. Died last month...

740
01:12:56,669 --> 01:13:00,230
...but that didn't stop him
from recommending, after he died...

741
01:13:00,406 --> 01:13:03,807
...a new website called
killwithme. Com.

742
01:13:04,143 --> 01:13:08,204
How'd he do that? He didn't.
The killer did, using his account.

743
01:13:08,381 --> 01:13:11,145
When Agent Griffin Dowd's
investigation revealed why...

744
01:13:11,317 --> 01:13:13,410
...this deceased college student
was chosen...

745
01:13:13,586 --> 01:13:17,750
...to promote the Kill With Me site,
it cost him his life.

746
01:13:22,028 --> 01:13:24,292
This is James Reilly.

747
01:13:24,664 --> 01:13:25,892
Sixteen months ago...

748
01:13:26,065 --> 01:13:29,091
...depressed over the recent death
of his wife, a hematologist...

749
01:13:29,268 --> 01:13:33,500
...Reilly staggered out into rush-hour
traffic on the Broadway Bridge.

750
01:13:33,673 --> 01:13:35,573
Traffic copters were out in force...

751
01:13:35,741 --> 01:13:38,608
...but only one caught all the action
from beginning to end...

752
01:13:38,778 --> 01:13:40,211
...Channel 12.

753
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:44,509
The regular pilot was out sick that day,
so the job went to Herbert Miller.

754
01:13:45,985 --> 01:13:50,888
He later told friends he'd gotten lucky.
At the right place at the right time.

755
01:13:55,695 --> 01:13:57,185
The back of Reilly's skull...

756
01:13:57,363 --> 01:14:00,890
...landed on the rooftop
of this diner. So did his glasses.

757
01:14:01,067 --> 01:14:03,035
The skull was turned over
to the coroner...

758
01:14:03,202 --> 01:14:06,694
...but the glasses were retrieved
by one of the diner's employees...

759
01:14:06,873 --> 01:14:08,067
...Scotty Hillman.

760
01:14:08,908 --> 01:14:10,808
He put them up for sale online.

761
01:14:10,977 --> 01:14:12,740
And they sold quickly.

762
01:14:12,912 --> 01:14:15,176
Kids were home from school.
Parents were outraged.

763
01:14:15,348 --> 01:14:17,908
They called the TV stations.
The TV stations apologized.

764
01:14:18,084 --> 01:14:19,483
Except for Channel 12.

765
01:14:19,652 --> 01:14:23,110
They'd been having a little problem
in the ratings, but not that afternoon.

766
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:24,916
Their numbers were sky-high.

767
01:14:25,091 --> 01:14:27,616
And knowing a good thing
when it fell into their lap...

768
01:14:27,793 --> 01:14:30,091
...they rushed a veteran reporter
to the scene.

769
01:14:30,263 --> 01:14:31,457
This is David Williams...

770
01:14:31,631 --> 01:14:34,464
He got lucky, landed an interview
with a local businessman...

771
01:14:34,634 --> 01:14:37,694
...whose parked Cadillac had been
struck by Reilly's falling body.

772
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:39,132
When the interview ended...

773
01:14:39,305 --> 01:14:42,297
...Channel 12, as a courtesy to
those who might have missed it...

774
01:14:42,475 --> 01:14:44,841
...aired the entire video one last time.

775
01:14:45,011 --> 01:14:47,775
Within minutes, Andrew Kilburn
had pulled it off his TiVo...

776
01:14:47,947 --> 01:14:51,075
...and posted it on five different
shock-video sites.

777
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:54,378
From there, Reilly's suicide
was public domain.

778
01:14:54,554 --> 01:14:59,685
Something for five billion people
to feed on, laugh at, gossip about.

779
01:14:59,859 --> 01:15:01,793
Reilly had a son, Owen.

780
01:15:02,929 --> 01:15:06,296
He was brilliant. Good at electronics,
mechanics and computers...

781
01:15:06,465 --> 01:15:09,798
... but he was disturbed.
He was troubled. He was withdrawn.

782
01:15:10,436 --> 01:15:12,768
Owen took his father's suicide
very hard.

783
01:15:12,939 --> 01:15:16,705
He had to be hospitalized.
And six months ago he was released.

784
01:15:17,476 --> 01:15:20,343
This x-ray image is supposed to be
Owen's father.

785
01:15:20,513 --> 01:15:23,209
The number on the left,
the date his father died...

786
01:15:24,217 --> 01:15:27,482
...followed by the number
of his autopsy report.

787
01:15:27,887 --> 01:15:30,788
Owen lives alone now
at his father's house in Fairview.

788
01:15:30,957 --> 01:15:33,221
What do you say we arrest
the piece of shit?

789
01:15:35,056 --> 01:15:36,717
Go! Go!

790
01:16:12,327 --> 01:16:13,589
Basement's clear!

791
01:16:28,643 --> 01:16:30,440
This is bad.

792
01:17:04,012 --> 01:17:07,072
There are new developments
in the Internet murder investigation...

793
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:10,740
... tonight out of Portland, Oregon.
For more, let's turn to Marilyn Deutsch.

794
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:13,648
Right. Police now say they know
who is kidnapping people...

795
01:17:13,821 --> 01:17:16,756
... in this area and then killing them
live on the Web.

796
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:20,891
Take a look at this picture. Police say
the suspect's name is Owen Reilly.

797
01:17:21,062 --> 01:17:24,828
He is 20 years old,
and just nine months ago...

798
01:17:25,566 --> 01:17:27,158
First...

799
01:17:27,335 --> 01:17:30,862
...I just wanted to say how sorry I am.

800
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:34,237
This was a loss for all of us...

801
01:17:34,409 --> 01:17:37,606
...but most deeply for you,
and we know that. I know that.

802
01:17:39,714 --> 01:17:44,276
You've done everything you
possibly could. You've given enough.

803
01:17:45,486 --> 01:17:49,115
- I want you to take some time off.
- What?

804
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:52,718
Why? Because now it's personal?

805
01:17:52,894 --> 01:17:55,158
This guy's still running around,
the case is open.

806
01:17:55,329 --> 01:17:56,694
The kid's face is everywhere.

807
01:17:56,864 --> 01:18:00,231
He's driving around in a 40-year-old
VW bus with electronics in it.

808
01:18:00,401 --> 01:18:02,062
We'll have him
by this time tomorrow.

809
01:18:02,236 --> 01:18:05,603
- Maybe.
- Jennifer, I'm not only thinking of you.

810
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:10,340
Now join your family. Just for a week.

811
01:18:12,714 --> 01:18:14,841
I'll take a day.

812
01:19:05,099 --> 01:19:07,465
- Hey.
- Hey.

813
01:19:08,002 --> 01:19:11,028
So, what'd he say?

814
01:19:11,806 --> 01:19:13,899
He told me to get lost.

815
01:19:15,576 --> 01:19:16,941
Well, he's right.

816
01:19:19,814 --> 01:19:21,941
And what did you say?

817
01:19:27,889 --> 01:19:29,720
That's what I figured.

818
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:24,831
This has been America News Radio.

819
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:28,498
Now back to your local
ANR station for news.

820
01:21:29,143 --> 01:21:31,839
Good evening.
You're listening to KMZR, Portland.

821
01:21:32,013 --> 01:21:34,982
This is the news at the top
of the 10:00 hour.

822
01:21:35,149 --> 01:21:37,777
Dominating the news again here
and across the nation...

823
01:21:37,952 --> 01:21:40,978
... is the increasingly urgent search
for the Internet killer...

824
01:21:41,155 --> 01:21:44,249
... now known to be
Owen Reilly of Portland.

825
01:21:44,425 --> 01:21:48,521
His most recent victim, an FBI
cyber-crimes agent, Griffin Dowd...

826
01:21:48,696 --> 01:21:52,188
... was discovered dead in Reilly's
Fairview home basement this morning.

827
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:56,233
In what the FBI is describing as
the most serious Internet crime wave...

828
01:21:56,404 --> 01:21:58,929
... since the computer age began...

829
01:22:45,219 --> 01:22:46,208
Shit!

830
01:22:48,622 --> 01:22:50,351
Hello, Jennifer.

831
01:22:55,963 --> 01:22:57,828
Look out the front window.

832
01:22:58,632 --> 01:23:00,896
Under that streetlight.

833
01:23:02,236 --> 01:23:05,364
That's where my father's body
fell over the railing.

834
01:23:05,539 --> 01:23:07,939
Some websites show the whole
thing in slow motion...

835
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:11,340
... because it's just so much
better that way.

836
01:23:13,147 --> 01:23:16,207
One archives it in a section
called "whoa."

837
01:23:16,917 --> 01:23:20,409
That's it. Just "whoa."

838
01:23:21,722 --> 01:23:23,849
You and the people you work with...

839
01:23:24,892 --> 01:23:28,020
... you let people say and do
almost anything they want.

840
01:23:28,195 --> 01:23:30,356
It doesn't matter who it hurts.

841
01:23:33,834 --> 01:23:35,961
I'm sorry, Owen.

842
01:23:39,673 --> 01:23:41,664
Owen, are you there?

843
01:24:17,111 --> 01:24:18,738
- Call Answering Center.
- Listen.

844
01:24:18,913 --> 01:24:20,437
I'm an agent with the FBI.

845
01:24:20,614 --> 01:24:23,708
I need you to connect me
to the Portland field office.

846
01:24:23,884 --> 01:24:24,976
Do you understand?

847
01:24:37,598 --> 01:24:40,089
- Yeah.
- It's Owen!

848
01:24:40,267 --> 01:24:43,031
He's hacked into my car's
computer and my cell phone.

849
01:24:43,204 --> 01:24:44,637
I'm on the Broadway Bridge.

850
01:24:44,805 --> 01:24:47,365
Don't move. I'll send a
black-and-white. Stay there.

851
01:24:47,741 --> 01:24:49,231
All right.

852
01:25:47,535 --> 01:25:49,628
- Box.
- Lieutenant, I'm on the bridge.

853
01:25:49,803 --> 01:25:51,236
There's no sign of Marsh.

854
01:25:51,405 --> 01:25:54,272
Okay. Relay that to FBI Portland.
I'm minutes away.

855
01:25:55,142 --> 01:25:57,406
- Hurry. Get the director on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

856
01:25:57,578 --> 01:26:00,012
Shut down every road to and from
the Broadway Bridge.

857
01:26:00,181 --> 01:26:02,206
Every car gets stopped now.

858
01:27:03,877 --> 01:27:07,142
I need you to run a check
on a 2006 Saab.

859
01:27:07,314 --> 01:27:09,908
Get me a location, start tracking.
Name: Jennifer Marsh.

860
01:27:10,084 --> 01:27:11,813
Portland, Oregon.

861
01:27:53,394 --> 01:27:56,522
Fucker disabled her car's computer.
We can't track her.

862
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:07,539
Hello.

863
01:28:49,016 --> 01:28:50,711
You know...

864
01:28:50,884 --> 01:28:55,321
...l'm only doing to you
what they're going to do to me.

865
01:28:56,523 --> 01:28:58,150
Only...

866
01:28:58,459 --> 01:29:03,624
...they'll use potassium chloride, and
they won't let very many people watch.

867
01:29:05,065 --> 01:29:07,158
But not for long.

868
01:29:10,838 --> 01:29:12,203
You see, soon...

869
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:18,475
...executions will be delivered
live to our TVs...

870
01:29:18,912 --> 01:29:23,906
...our computers, our phones,
our handhelds...

871
01:29:24,385 --> 01:29:27,286
...and it won't cost much.

872
01:29:27,454 --> 01:29:30,480
Maybe 10 bucks.

873
01:29:39,133 --> 01:29:40,998
Millions of eyes...

874
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:46,070
...all watching the same thing
at the same time.

875
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,565
One big, happy family.

876
01:29:51,478 --> 01:29:53,639
And all of it brought to you by...

877
01:29:59,253 --> 01:30:01,187
It doesn't matter.

878
01:30:05,092 --> 01:30:07,788
They'll have no trouble
finding sponsors.

879
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:42,128
What's going on?
We have a signal?

880
01:30:42,296 --> 01:30:43,558
We're still locked out.

881
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:46,096
- Stay on it.
- Yes, sir.

882
01:31:08,522 --> 01:31:11,821
I wonder if they'll kill you
faster or slower.

883
01:31:14,161 --> 01:31:16,857
Based on what I've seen online...

884
01:31:17,731 --> 01:31:21,326
...the awful things that men do to
women that other men pay to watch...

885
01:31:25,639 --> 01:31:28,164
...my guess would be faster.

886
01:31:31,979 --> 01:31:33,913
Much faster.

887
01:31:53,066 --> 01:31:55,591
Jesus Christ, it's Marsh!

888
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:12,577
- This is Box.
- It's Brooks. He's got Marsh on his site.

889
01:32:13,554 --> 01:32:15,283
Send it to me.

890
01:33:35,302 --> 01:33:37,327
You're giving me my best numbers.

891
01:33:41,241 --> 01:33:44,301
That's... That's her basement.
He's got her in her own basement.

892
01:33:59,126 --> 01:34:00,559
No, no.

893
01:34:12,773 --> 01:34:15,037
- Did you see that?
- Fuck!

894
01:34:17,744 --> 01:34:19,268
Fuck!

895
01:34:41,768 --> 01:34:43,292
Yes!
