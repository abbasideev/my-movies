I'm Virginia. Your Assessor.

[electronic chime]

103
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,541
- [chuckles softly]
- Your supporting material,

104
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,666
as previously reported,

105
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:48,125
places you in the top 0.1
percentile of citizens.

106
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:54,125
I'm therefore happy to
confirm that under Article 96,

107
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:58,083
you qualify for
in-person Assessment.

108
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,166
- Over the next seven days...
- Can I just ask someth...

109
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,853
Virginia: There's a
lot to get through.

110
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,541
Sorry, I just...

111
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,068
Virginia: Over the
next seven days,

112
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:11,000
you'll undergo close
observation and formal testing

113
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,875
to ascertain suitability
for parenting.

114
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,041
In the event of a
pass, your material

115
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,541
will be passed on for
ex-utero gestation.

116
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,708
All other methods
of reproduction

117
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,583
still remain forbidden.

118
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,541
In the event of a fail,

119
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,708
candidates will be
notified immediately.

120
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:38,583
Candidates have the right
to withdraw from Assessment

121
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,125
at any point up to and including
the in-person questionnaire.

122
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,541
After which they waive
any and all right

123
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,041
to future applications.

124
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,625
Assessor's decision
is final. Clear?

125
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,541
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

126
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,208
Finally, you are reminded:

127
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,083
Everything that takes place
over the next seven days

128
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,416
is highly confidential.

129
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,500
And what are we being
assessed on exactly?

130
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,125
It's just a little... opaque.

131
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,541
Opaque?

132
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:15,416
Not opaque... I just
mean, not clear.

133
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,541
- That is what opaque means.
- What Mia's trying to say is...

134
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:23,041
We couldn't find any
specific criteria,

135
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,583
that's what I'm trying to say.

136
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,125
Virginia: The less you know
in advance, the better.

137
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,916
I want to get to
know the real you.

138
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,500
- Is that a good idea?
- Virginia: Yes.

139
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:34,666
I was joking.

140
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,041
Hmm. [chuckles]

141
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,083
Good. [chuckles]
Humor is important.

142
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,125
I'm sure that
everyone says this...

143
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,666
but I...

144
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,375
We would be really
great parents.

145
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,875
Everyone does say
that. [chuckles softly]

146
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,416
So, who's first?

147
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,958
On a scale of one to ten,

148
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,875
how would you rate
your current levels

149
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,958
of satisfaction with
the relationship?

150
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,666
Nine, at least.

151
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,083
Describe Mia with three words.

152
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,250
Funny. Smart.

153
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,125
Sharp. She can be
a little sharp.

154
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,625
But I like that.
Keeps me on my toes.

155
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,000
We were in a lab

156
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,708
and he was absorbed
in some code.

157
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:32,250
And I don't know why I took
this moment to tell him,

158
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:36,416
but I said "I love you", it
just popped out and he said,

159
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,916
"That's right." [chuckles]

160
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,625
How often do you have sex?

161
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:50,458
- Once or twice a week.
- How are we defining sex?

162
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,208
Virginia: Oral,
manual, anal or full.

163
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,541
[low thrum]

164
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,708
Do you achieve regular climax?

165
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,541
Yes.

166
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:01,958
Virginia: Every time?

167
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,791
Would you like some water?

168
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,291
Is that part of the test?

169
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,583
- No, just water.
- I'm fine. Thank you.

170
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,750
Tell me about your mother.

171
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,666
She expected a lot
from me, but...

172
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,833
it was good.

173
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,458
She was sent to the Old World

174
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,809
when my sister
and I were little,

175
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,500
so I only have a few memories.

176
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,708
- She was a dissident?
- Yes.

177
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,875
Do you have any
differences with the State?

178
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:38,583
No. Does it not say
this in my file?

179
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,916
Virginia: Why do
you want a child?

180
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,208
We know how lucky
we are. We feel...

181
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,250
We feel fulfilled...

182
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,875
...professionally and personally
and want to share that.

183
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,416
Every child deserves
the best possible start.

184
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,250
That sounds a little prepared.

185
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,708
[chuckles softly] It's
our duty to help nurture

186
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,291
the future of this society.

187
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,208
It's a big thing, so,
yes, we're prepared.

188
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,750
Mia: I want to give a
child what I never had.

189
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,416
[soft choral music playing]

190
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,416
And what was that?

191
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,333
A sense of belonging.

192
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,958
You don't feel you belong?

193
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,125
Now, yeah. No, I
meant as a child.

194
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:31,333
[choral music continues]

195
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,791
Everything's as per
the instructions.

196
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,708
We thought that we
could use this...

197
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,916
Not that we're
presuming, but we...

198
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,291
- [wind whistles]
- [sighs]

199
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,083
Do you hear that?

200
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,666
Loose springs.

201
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,625
But there's no springs
in that mattress.

202
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,166
Do you have somewhere else?

203
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,125
Yes, but there's
actually no springs...

204
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,333
You take our room.
We'll sleep in here.

205
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,820
Virginia: Don't
go to any trouble.

206
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,833
- It's no trouble.
- Yeah, yeah.

207
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,166
It's no trouble at all.

208
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,083
Better.

209
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:36,708
[low thrumming]

210
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,875
[soft whooshing]

211
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,256
[Mia echoing] I call it
Aaryan's thinking cave.

212
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,250
[Aaryan echoing] Sjøhus,
open Cooper slate.

213
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,250
I'm working on
the cat's texture.

214
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,500
This is all virtually generated.

215
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:05,583
[softly echoing] This is where
you designed the virtual pets?

216
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,916
Not the prototypes, they
were at the university,

217
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,708
but, yes, the second generation.

218
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,916
It's funny, I was in this seat
right here when it struck me...

219
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,458
Virginia: And what about you?

220
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,833
Do you have a work space?

221
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,458
Yes. Sure.

222
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,375
[chuckles softly]

223
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:35,041
[mysterious music playing]

224
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,541
[wind whistles]

225
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,916
The airflow system allows

226
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,458
different micro-climates
to coexist,

227
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,333
that's what allows
for the variety.

228
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,916
[water dripping]

229
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,416
It's very, er...

230
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,708
- colorful.
- Colorful?

231
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,750
This is a template

232
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,642
for sustainable food
production everywhere,

233
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,541
- it's a laboratory.
- Colorful's right.

234
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,958
Nature wants to be noticed,
but she's deceptive.

235
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:08,083
Underneath her beautiful façade,
she provides energy and shelter.

236
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,750
And this greenhouse alone

237
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,708
contains over 1000
different species

238
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,000
- of plants and algae able to...
- What's this one?

239
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,916
Oh... paphiopedilum.

240
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,208
It's also known as
the Venus Orchid.

241
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,458
It's the oldest of its
kind. Some live to be 100.

242
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,125
My mother gave it to me.

243
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,750
It's the only thing
I have of hers.

244
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,750
Your mother?

245
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,458
Sorry, can you be careful?

246
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,375
- Virginia: [scoffs]
- Sorry, she's sensitive.

247
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,458
I'll need full
access to all areas.

248
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:44,125
- But you don't mean...
- Full access.

249
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,934
It's already done.
I programmed Sjøhus

250
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,583
to recognize your voice. Sjøhus?

251
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,875
- Sjøhus: <i>Welcome, Virginia.</i>
- [chuckles softly]

252
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,916
I'll also need samples
of urine, saliva,

253
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,750
blood, hair, vaginal
mucus and semen.

254
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:02,125
[mysterious music playing]

255
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,333
I thought we already gave these.

256
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,750
[Aaryan pants, grunts softly]

257
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,875
[sighs]

258
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Virginia: You'd be surprised
how many people cheat.

259
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,541
[she clears her throat]

260
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,291
It'll do.

261
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,333
[mysterious music concludes]

262
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,000
Mia synthesizes all
the nutrients herself.

263
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,541
We can produce
crops all year round

264
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,416
without depleting the soil.

265
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,375
May I? A little wine?

266
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,666
She's found a way of harnessing
the soil microbials into energy

267
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,500
that powers all our work.

268
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,916
[munches]

269
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,250
How did you get your scar?

270
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,958
The pet cull hadn't
happened long before

271
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,458
and some people thought I was
somehow responsible, so...

272
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,791
some activists
decided to intervene.

273
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:22,625
Which is insane because
Aaryan developed

274
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,083
virtual pets as a
solution to the cull,

275
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,333
he wasn't responsible for it.

276
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,666
The pet cull was part of
the disease prevention

277
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,833
and resource
conservation program.

278
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,500
The problem was the
State underestimated

279
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,708
the psychological
importance of companionship

280
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,833
when they exterminated
all the pets.

281
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,916
Especially during a
time of upheaval, so...

282
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,875
I was tasked with creating
an alternative. I did.

283
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,583
Just, not everybody
saw it that way.

284
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,041
These people firebombed
the university research lab

285
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,125
that Aaryan was working in.

286
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,791
I... I jumped out of
a third floor window.

287
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,416
Broke my shoulder,
my collar bone,

288
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,041
three vertebrae and
these burn scars.

289
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,583
That must've been terrifying.

290
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,708
Mia: He's still
traumatized by fire.

291
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,750
What happened to the
people responsible?

292
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,142
They were sent to the Old World.

293
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,791
They got what they deserved.

294
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,208
Your mother was sent
to the Old World.

295
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,500
Did she get what she deserved?

296
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,583
All that stuff about my mother.

297
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,059
She's just pushing
buttons, okay?

298
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,333
It's obviously how it works.

299
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,083
We just need to stay
cool, not react.

300
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,041
She likes you.

301
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,041
[chuckles] You jealous?

302
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:39,291
Yeah, embarrassingly so. I am.

303
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,875
Maybe I can make
you not jealous.

304
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,833
Light, Sjøhus.

305
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,500
[grunts softly]

306
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,541
[chuckles] Being in a single bed

307
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,125
makes me feel like
a teenager again.

308
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,083
Pervert.

309
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,750
[chuckles softly]

310
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,500
Get on your back.

311
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,000
Ow! You just kneed
me in the balls.

312
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,406
Sorry, do you want to complain,

313
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,940
or do you want your
cock in my mouth?

314
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,375
- What was the first option?
- [laughs] Yeah.

315
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,375
[smooches]

316
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,810
- You gonna fold those?
- [Mia chuckles]

317
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,375
Don't make me laugh. I'm being
very, very serious right now.

318
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,041
Aaryan: Okay.

319
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,416
[moans]

320
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,958
[Mia moans]

321
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:02,833
Oh. Oh, fuck!
Virginia! Virginia!

322
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,583
Mia: Oh, my God.

[pants]

324
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,916
I need to assess all aspects
of your relationship.

325
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,291
It's fine.

326
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,958
Seriously?

327
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,583
Virginia: Just
imagine I'm not here.

328
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,083
[Mia whispers] What? No.

329
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,375
[Mia clears throat]

330
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,625
- Aaryan?
- Yeah?

331
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,125
I... Fuck.

332
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:47,500
[mysterious music playing]

333
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,916

[dish clangs]

339
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,250
Oh, hey.

340
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,083
Erm, these all came. Do
you know what they are?

341
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,333
You sleep okay?

[breathes deeply]

346
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,041
You gonna eat?

347
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,416
Virginia: [chuckles]

348
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:41,875
[both] Mm.

349
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,333
[chuckles]

350
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,708
Why don't you try?
Yeah? You wanna try?

351
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:49,250
Yeah, that's, that's...
That's really good.

352
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:52,166
It's really yummy.
Whoa! What the f...

353
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:58,250
- You shouted at me.
- Mia: I did not. I did not...

354
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,541
- You did, you shouted.
- It was not. No, I...

355
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,166
- I raised my voice.
- Did.

356
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:04,541
- Mia: I raised my voice.
- Did.

357
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:06,375
Mia: It's just not
the same thing.

358
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,166
- Did. [chuckles]
- Mia: No, I didn't.

359
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,958
- Did!
- It was a little loud.

360
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:12,250
- Did!
- Ha! No, it was not!

361
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:14,708
- Did. Did. Did. Did.
- Mia: Okay, Virginia.

362
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,666
That's very cute, very charming.

363
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,625
- Did.
- Mia: Okay.

364
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,515
- [stomps] Did. Did. Did.
- Mia: Virginia.

365
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:23,083
- [bangs]
- Virginia, could you stop?

366
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,166
- Virginia, please stop.
- Did.

367
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,916
- Mia: Virginia.
- [chuckles] Did.

368
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,392
- Mia: Virginia.
- Yeah. [chuckles]

369
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,250
- Mia: Virginia.
- Did! Did! Did!

370
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:31,625
Mia: Virginia!

371
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:37,833
Okay, that was... that
was a shout, yeah?

372
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,333
Why don't we start again, hmm?

373
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,041
[stomps]

374
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,958
Aaryan: Hey! Why
don't we try a game?

375
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,291
It's a train.

376
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:56,458
Oh, it's a bullet train.
[imitates a train]

377
00:25:56,916 --> 00:26:00,708
Oh, it's going really fast.
Oh, is it gonna crash?

378
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,750
Oh... Or it could
go in the tunnel.

379
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:06,958
You don't want it to
crash now. Come on.

380
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:08,666
Come on.

381
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:12,500
Pew! There it is!

382
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,333
All right.

383
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,041
All right.

384
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,750
- Spoon.
- Spoon?

385
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:24,375
You wanna feed yourself?
Okay, all right.

386
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,098
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- [chuckles]

387
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,208
- Aaryan: Mm. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

388
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:33,583
All right.

389
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,708
[both chuckle]

390
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,708
Sorry. It's kind of funny.

391
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:53,666
- Ooh...
- Virginia: [giggles]

392
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,416
- Ow, fuck. [grunts]
- Fuck.

393
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:57,625
- Aaryan: Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?

394
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:59,291
[grunts] I got shit in my eye.

395
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,416
- Yeah. [chuckles]
- Aaryan: Oh, that's not good.

396
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,041
- Shit.
- Shit!

397
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,375
Aaryan: Oh, it hurts.

398
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:09,083
- [groans] Fuck, I can't see.
- Fuck!

399
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,416
- What?
- Fuck! Shit!

400
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:11,851
Aaryan: It's fine.
I just can't see.

401
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,333
What do you mean you can't see?

402
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,900
- Mia: Aaryan, are you okay?
- Fuck!

403
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:18,125
Fuck. Shit. Shit. Fuck. Fuck.

404
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:20,250
- [water running]
- Mia: Is it better?

405
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:22,541
Aaryan: I can see now.
It just hurts like hell.

406
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:23,916
Sorry.

407
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:26,291
[Virginia shouting indistinctly]

408
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,291
- Wanna get some drops?
- [grunts softly]

409
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:30,875
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

410
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,750
- One. Okay, a second.
- [grunts]

411
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:37,916
- Yeah, okay.
- [grunts, whimpers]

412
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:39,416
Let me get this
out of your face.

413
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,333
Virginia: [in the
distance] Shit! Fuck!

414
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,625
Hey, can I see it? Lemme see.

415
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:46,250
Oh, my God.

416
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,625
- It's really red.
- Ow.

417
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,166
Do you think this is normal?

418
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,583
I mean, it has to be, right?

419
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,000
Why don't we just...
Let's set some rules.

420
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:02,333
Because children respond
to boundaries, right?

421
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,375
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

422
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:05,541
Okay.

423
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:07,958
Okay.

424
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:11,625
Okay. We're gonna...

425
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:16,708
I'm gonna apologize.

426
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,291
- So just let me...
- Yeah.

427
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:20,166
- Can you let me...
- Yeah, okay, okay.

428
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,375
Hey, Virginia, sweetie...

429
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,208
We...

430
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,291
[rhythmic panting]

431
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,333
Mia: You gotta be kidding me.

432
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,267
Aaryan: She's having fun with
us. We can clear this up.

433
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:39,250
Mia: It's everywhere.

434
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,458
Oh, my God.

435
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:44,791
Oh, my God.

436
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:47,458
[both] Virginia!

437
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:50,166
[rhythmic panting intensifies]

438
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,208
[both] Virginia!

439
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,291
- Aaryan: Okay.
- Can you?

440
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:56,958
- Aaryan: Okay.
- Mia: Virginia!

441
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:59,541
Aaryan: Virginia!
You're not serious.

442
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:02,625
- Virginia!
- Virginia!

443
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:08,541
Aaryan: Oh, shit.
No, no, no, no.

444
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:09,750
Mia: This is crazy.

445
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,583
[metallic clanking]

446
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:29,833
[high-pitched thrumming]

447
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:36,750
[intense music playing]

448
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:52,833
[high-pitched thrumming]

449
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,125
[metallic clanking]

450
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:59,958
Stop! [pants]

451
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:06,375
[quivers]

452
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,375
[sighs]

453
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:15,750
This is not a toy!

454
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,625
End of test.

455
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:35,958
Are you sure that we can't get
you any dessert or a drink?

456
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,958
[chuckles] Please,
treat me normally.

457
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,750
No airs or graces. Mia: Oh...

458
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:45,431
- [electronic chime]
- Sjøhus: <i>A delivery.</i>

459
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:47,333
Sjøhus: <i>A delivery has arrived.</i>

460
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,958
[wind whistles]

461
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,500
- Aaryan: Can you?
- Mia: Yeah.

462
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:02,266
- Aaryan: It's really heavy.
- Mia: Okay.

463
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:03,875
Aaryan: [grunts]

464
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,541
- There.
- Mia: Okay.

465
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,166
[clanks]

466
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,375
This could be your child's.

467
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:28,708
If you pass, of course.

468
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:35,750
You have until morning.

469
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:40,791
Aaryan: Okay. There's eight
different types of those?

470
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:42,250
- Mia: Yeah.
- Aaryan: So...

471
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,018
Do we know which one's
which, or just...

472
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:47,458
Mia: No, I don't know yet,
but we will figure it out.

473
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:48,958
Aaryan: Well, if we check the...

474
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,625
Does this say which orange piece

475
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:54,250
we're supposed to use for
the bottom with the greens?

476
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:55,791
The grey pieces are the pieces

477
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,517
- that actually link it.
- These connect...

478
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,642
Aaryan: They're the connectors.

479
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,958
...the orange.

480
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,041
No. The orange pieces
just sit on top.

481
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:03,583
They're not doing
any connecting.

482
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,250
- You use it to...
- My God.

483
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:08,250
The grey bit connects the pipes.

484
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:10,351
- Mia: Okay. Okay! Put the grey.
- Aaryan: That's it.

485
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:11,855
Then use them on
top. Put that on top.

486
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:13,267
Aaryan: And then you
just put that on top.

487
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,625
Well, you know the instructions

488
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:16,142
don't necessarily have to
tell us the right thing.

489
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:17,791
You don't necessarily think

490
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:20,000
the instructions have
to say the right thing?

491
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:21,708
Yes, that's what I said.

492
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,291
Okay.

493
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,375
[sighs] Okay, wait.

494
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:31,875
Now, after this, I'm
gonna need that wrench.

495
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:33,833
- Is it nearby?
- Aaryan: The wrench?

496
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,500
- Mia: The little tool? Shit.
- Aaryan: Okay, it's over there.

497
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,066
Gimme a second. Oh,
my finger. Shit.

498
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,708
Okay, wait, wait...

499
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,726
- Mia: Yeah. Sorry. Got it.
- Aaryan: I'll loose the head.

500
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,517
- Yeah, got it. I got it.
- Aaryan: Okay. Wait.

501
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:45,833
Yeah. Oh, my God.

502
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,125
- I can't...
- Mia: You are my savior.

503
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,541
Okay, okay.

504
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,125

[tense music playing]

506
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,416
But that's...

507
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,083
We've got that, so
if you want that...

508
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:04,791
[electronic chime]

509
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,583
Mm-mm.

"Warning: For safety purposes,
all parts must be used."

511
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,166
What are we gonna do with it?

[mysterious music concludes]

517
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,458
I like it. You've done well.

518
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:40,166
Thank you. It was
a team effort.

519
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,625
Virginia: Would you get my bag?

520
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,375
I slept terribly.

521
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,791
Yeah.

- Hi.
- Hi.

Aaryan: Are you "you" now or...

531
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,208

Mia: What are you
talking about?

712
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:26,833
[chuckles softly]

713
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,125
[metal clanging]

714
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:48,166
[choral music playing]

715
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:56,833
[low rumbling]

716
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:02,541
[electronic chime]

717
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:04,875
Sjøhus: <i>Your first
guests have arrived.</i>

718
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,916
- Hi.
- Hi. Come on in.

719
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:11,000
[choral music concludes]

720
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:12,708
Mia: Hello.

721
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:14,666
- Hey.
- Hi, Aaryan.

722
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:17,000
Hi. Hi. Er, Mia,
this is Serena.

723
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:20,833
Oh. Yeah, the Serena. Hi, um...

724
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,291
I've heard a lot of
great things. I'm Mia.

725
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:25,338
- It's really nice to meet you.
- Mia: Likewise.

726
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:30,208
- This is Holly and Amelia.
- Holly, hi. And Amelia?

727
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:33,333
It is... it's really such
a pleasure to meet you.

728
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,666
Are we going in?

729
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:38,541
- [chuckles]
- Sorry. Kids... Amelia!

730
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:42,559
I'm gonna go make
sure that everyone...

731
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:43,583
- Sure.
- Okay.

732
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:45,583
[footsteps recede]

733
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:47,416
Mia: Can I get you
something to drink?

734
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,958
- We have wine, juice.
- Holly: Thanks. Amelia...

735
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,875
How's Assessment going so far?

736
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,750
[indistinct chatter
in background]

737
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,916
[sighs] It's a
fucking nightmare.

738
00:49:57,291 --> 00:49:59,250
[chuckles] We thought
we were a disaster

739
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:00,541
and then we got Amelia.

740
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:02,583
You'll be fine.

741
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,791
[indistinct chatter continues]

742
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:08,309
Holly: Serena, you
have to come see this.

743
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,500
Serena: I should...

744
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,291
Sjøhus: <i>More guests
have arrived.</i>

745
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:13,250
Aaryan: Hi. I'm Aaryan.

746
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:15,375
I'm Walter. And this is...

747
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:17,559
Oh, don't bother with all
that. We shan't meet again.

748
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:19,041
Amelia: They always stare.

749
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:20,968
Serena: They haven't
seen a child in a while.

750
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:22,642
- Walter: You seen that girl?
- Evie: Stealing our oxygen.

751
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:24,708
Amelia: There's never
anyone to play with.

752
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:26,208
[crash]

753
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,791
- Welcome!
- Evie: Oh, Jesus!

754
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:31,000
This is Virginia, our Assessor.

755
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:33,666
Mia. It's been too long.

756
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:35,313
Evie: Any chance of
a drink over here?

757
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:36,916
[electronic chime]

758
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:39,476
- Serena: How do you two...
- I was Walter's lab assistant.

759
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,476
- Serena: Oh, that makes sense.
- Walter: Mia was the most

760
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,260
brilliant and dedicated
assistant I ever had.

761
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,791
- Holly: High Praise.
- Regrettably,

762
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,708
she abandoned me for a
more exciting scientist.

763
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:48,934
Holly: Don't stare, sweetie.

764
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,791
I wanted to pursue my own work.

765
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:53,750
I still bear the scars
from your departure.

766
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:57,416
[she scoffs] Scratches, darling.
All down your back, if I recall.

767
00:50:57,583 --> 00:51:00,125
- Can I get anyone anything?
- Is there alcohol in this?

768
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:02,166
- Yes, a bit, is that all right?
- No.

769
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:04,333
I'm gonna need
something stronger.

770
00:51:06,791 --> 00:51:08,041
So, um, about Walter...

771
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:09,601
It's okay. You don't
have to explain.

772
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:12,625
When I was his student,
we had an affair

773
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:14,500
that I think Evie knows about.

774
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:16,291
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
she knows about it.

775
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:20,625
It was completely inappropriate
and he probably exploited me,

776
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:23,541
but, you know, he was actually
a pretty good professor.

777
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:25,000
[quivers]

778
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,846
- Look at me, I'm shaking.
- Aaryan: Mia...

779
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:29,375
These people are
here to throw us off.

780
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:30,791
That's the game.

781
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:35,125
- We just have to stay calm.
- [inhales deeply] Okay.

782
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,390
Evie: Can't believe I
have to endure this.

783
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:39,375
Mia: So, Amelia, do
you go to school?

784
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:42,750
- Amelia self-educates.
- No schools in our district.

785
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:45,208
It's better, though. You get
to follow your own interests.

786
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:47,458
- Holly: Amelia's an artist.
- Mia: Oh!

787
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:48,958
Abstracts, mainly.

788
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:52,250
I would love to see
your work some time.

789
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:55,208
Do you show your art
at any exhibitions?

790
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:57,166
Amelia: Not really.
But I want to.

791
00:51:57,875 --> 00:51:59,208
- Aaryan: Virginia?
- [grunts]

792
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,351
- Mia: Virginia. That's okay.
- Aaryan: Virginia, could you...

793
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:03,015
- Amelia: Is she okay?
- [Virginia chokes]

794
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:06,916
- Serena: I'm sure she's fine.
- Evie: Oh, God.

795
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:09,245
- Mia: Okay, sweetie.
- Amelia: She doesn't look fine.

796
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:10,541
- [chime]
- Sjøhus: <i>Aaryan...</i>

797
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:12,041
<i>your mother has arrived.</i>

798
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:14,708
[Aaryan sighs deeply]

799
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,333
Don't start. First thing
I knew about this...

800
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,500
- What the hell is that?
- Mom.

801
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:21,333
No, you stop calling me that.

802
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,958
You're not a child, anymore.
It's Ambika, not Mom.

803
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:27,916
You know, I was having
a perfectly nice time

804
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:29,708
in the gym when I got the call.

805
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:32,875
But as we all know, an
invitation from the State

806
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:35,041
isn't really an
invitation at all.

807
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:36,791
Okay. Can you just
promise me one thing?

808
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:39,250
Don't say anything
stupid or embarrassing?

809
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,166
You're so like your father.

810
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:45,041
Oh, Ambika, hi!
How was your trip?

811
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:46,875
Nice to see you too, Mom.

812
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:49,500
- Mia: How's work, Ambika?
- I'm not allowed to say.

813
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,625
Walter: Why? Is
it very secret?

814
00:52:51,791 --> 00:52:53,583
Ambika: Ah, no.

815
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,500
Aaryan asked me not to talk
in case I embarrass him.

816
00:52:56,666 --> 00:52:57,791
Aaryan: I was joking.

817
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,309
Serena: I'm sure he
was just teasing.

818
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:00,333
Evie: Virginia, stop it!

819
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,208
I design the modular estates.

820
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:04,875
- Virginia!
- I hear they're fantastic.

821
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:06,041
[screams]

822
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:07,916
How old is she supposed to be?

823
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:10,125
- Okay, I'm gonna clear plates.
- Mia: I'll help.

824
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:13,958
Thank you.

825
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,083
Evie: Are we pretending
this is okay?

826
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:19,833
Assessment is everybody's right,
whether we agree with it or not.

827
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,916
- It's an indulgence.
- How?

828
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:24,666
'Cause we don't
have the resources.

829
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:27,166
Serena: That's for the
state to decide, not you.

830
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:29,708
They reengineered Senoxidine
to prevent reproduction,

831
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:32,958
- as well as aging and disease.
- What about you, Holly?

832
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:34,605
Amelia: She's sliding
under the table.

833
00:53:34,666 --> 00:53:36,125
What keeps you occupied?

834
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:38,041
Holly monitors border activity.

835
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,809
- Walter: That's fascinating.
- Mia: What is?

836
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:41,333
Serena: Holly works
by the border.

837
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,916
Honestly, I'm nowhere near.
I just see the reports.

838
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:46,250
What's to report? I thought
they were just dying.

839
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,750
Well, there are indications

840
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:51,333
that limited tracts of
land may be survivable.

841
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,666
- Are you serious?
- How long are they surviving?

842
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:55,041
Holly: The data's limited.

843
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:56,488
Ambika: How long
do people think?

844
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:58,225
- Years.
- Holly: We don't know for sure.

845
00:53:58,291 --> 00:53:59,708
So, they're reproducing?

846
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:02,166
Once the Senoxidine
wears off, in theory.

847
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:03,583
Virginia: [squeals]

848
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:05,517
I mean that's what we're
trying to find out.

849
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:07,501
How would they have babies
without the Assessment?

850
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:09,745
- From their own wombs.
- Evie: Like in the Dark Ages.

851
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:11,351
Amelia: You mean it's
not forbidden there?

852
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:13,017
Virginia, I'm asking
nicely... Come back to me.

853
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,791
- Think of the pain.
- Yeah.

854
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:18,958
They must live such
short and unhappy lives.

855
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:21,791
Holly: I'm really not supposed
to talk about any of this.

856
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,291
We should be reducing the
population, not increasing it.

857
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:26,500
I'm not sure this
is the occasion

858
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:28,791
to talk about
population control.

859
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:30,458
This is the exact occasion

860
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:32,000
to talk about
population control!

861
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:33,976
- Mia: Okay, Virginia...
- Virginia: [cries out]

862
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,375
- Walter: Oh, shit.
- Evie: Control that brat.

863
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,833
Ambika: It was not
like this in my day.

864
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,250
Aaryan: Sorry about this.

865
00:54:43,166 --> 00:54:45,125
[Mia whispers] It's okay.
It's okay, I'm not mad.

866
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:50,750
I'd like to propose a toast.

867
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:52,458
Ambika: A toast!

868
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:53,708
To Mia.

869
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,166
And Aaryan. The future.

870
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:59,541
- Oh, my God!
- All: The future!

871
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:01,333
Second time lucky, then?

872
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:05,416
Sorry, what do you
mean second time?

873
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:08,958
Well, you must know that
Aaryan and Serena applied?

874
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:12,166
- Mia: Oh...
- Obviously, it didn't work out.

875
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:13,708
Walter: [chuckles softly]

876
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:16,416
I guess things just
got interesting.

877
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:19,041
- Evie: She didn't know that?
- No, I didn't know.

878
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:20,625
We didn't get far at all.

879
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:23,101
I pulled out before the
end of the questionnaire.

880
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:24,541
So Aaryan wanted to continue?

881
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:27,041
It didn't mean anything.
I don't mean...

882
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:30,458
It's fine. He's right. It didn't
mean anything. It was a mistake.

883
00:55:30,625 --> 00:55:32,425
- I'm gonna make space.
- Aaryan: Mia, this...

884
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,708
Oh, wow. Yeah, the future!

885
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:40,333
- Amelia: The future!
- Evie: Hooray.

886
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,500
- Serena: Ah, Jesus.
- Evie: Well done, Ambika.

887
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:44,041
[Walter chuckles]

888
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:46,000
[indistinct chatter]

889
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:47,916
[footsteps approach]

890
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:53,375
I didn't want to upset you.

891
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:59,833
Can we talk about this later?

892
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,125
Mia?

893
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:09,333
Holly: If you're
concerned about resources,

894
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,083
stop taking Senoxidine.

895
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,375
- Serena: Good idea.
- Walter: Great idea.

896
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:15,791
Let's grow old and die.

897
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:18,041
Why not throw ourselves
into the abyss?

898
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,041
But maybe finish dessert first.

899
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,666
Hands up. Who wants to die to
make room for the new people?

900
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:25,250
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on.

901
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:27,136
- What about madam over there?
- Amelia: Me?

902
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:29,208
Why not? Last one
in, first out.

903
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:30,895
- [Amelia gasps]
- God, you're a witch!

904
00:56:31,041 --> 00:56:32,726
I think you'll find the
witches are in the Old World

905
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,750
along with the other
enemies of progress.

906
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:36,791
Enough! Mia's mother was
sent to the Old World.

907
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:39,791
Oh, I know. I know exactly
what happened to her.

908
00:56:41,125 --> 00:56:43,833
She was exiled for spreading
lies and misinformation.

909
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:45,851
She deserved exactly
what she had coming...

910
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:47,208
Hey!

911
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,070
- Don't talk to her like that.
- Oh, spare me your outrage.

912
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:53,500
You're all too young to
remember the border, aren't you?

913
00:56:53,666 --> 00:56:55,266
Amelia: You were alive
before the border?

914
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:56,541
How old are you?

915
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:58,833
I'm 153.

916
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,541
- What was it like?
- You don't want to know.

917
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:05,166
You really do not want to know.

918
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,666
I do.

919
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:09,513
Aaryan: Virginia, will
you sit down please?

920
00:57:09,583 --> 00:57:11,226
- Evie: Oh, God, what now?
- Virginia: I wanna know.

921
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,601
Holly: It's okay.
Stay there, Amelia.

922
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:14,041
Evie: Oh, well...

923
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:16,059
- Aaryan: Virginia!
- Evie: I can tell you from...

924
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:18,583
- Oh, God. Ow.
- Holly: Don't worry, it's fine.

925
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,083
- Evie: You comfortable? Right.
- Virginia: Hm.

926
00:57:25,666 --> 00:57:29,291
In the beginning, all
anyone could talk about

927
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,500
was how nice it was to
finally have decent summers.

928
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:34,625
And then the summers
never stopped.

929
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:38,500
Unbearable heat,
endless storms...

930
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:42,916
No crops, no shelter.
Nothing habitable.

931
00:57:43,083 --> 00:57:44,791
[melancholic music playing]

932
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,958
Famine. Disease.

933
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,208
Countless species extinct.

934
00:57:52,291 --> 00:57:54,708
Did you know we tore each
other apart over scraps?

935
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:59,875
We'd finally done it.
Destroyed ourselves.

936
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:02,583
All for greed and indifference.

937
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:05,625
And then one day, those
of us who were left,

938
00:58:06,458 --> 00:58:07,916
we found a solution.

939
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:10,291
A new world.

940
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:13,375
We had to be smarter
than we were before,

941
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:15,166
because there wasn't
room for everyone.

942
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:18,250
Choices had to be made.

943
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,458
It wasn't kind or nice,

944
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,570
but it was necessary
for survival.

945
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:31,083
You think because we're
able to drink wine and...

946
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:36,916
grow crops in greenhouses,
and breed brats in bags,

947
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:39,375
you've somehow conquered nature.

948
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:42,916
You're wrong. It's borrowed.

949
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:45,458
And anything you
take from nature...

950
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:49,125
sooner or later,
she'll want it back.

951
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,541
So, forgive me if I
don't smile politely

952
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:55,500
and go along with this
whole fucking charade,

953
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:58,541
while you risk
everything we have

954
00:58:58,708 --> 00:59:01,750
just to scratch some
vain and vestigial itch.

955
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,583
Fucking hubris will
be the death of us.

956
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,708
All of us. I want
no part of that.

957
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:13,500
There we are. That's
the story. Was it fun?

958
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:16,791
- [liquid trickles]
- [chuckles softly]

959
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:21,583
- Oh, my God. Get off!
- Ambika: What happened?

960
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,666
- Get off me!
- Mia: Hey...

961
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:27,083
Evie: She pissed all over
me, the fucking little bitch!

962
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:29,291
- Oh, my God.
- Ambika: Here. Take this.

963
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:31,541
Holly: I'm sure you'll
feel just awful.

964
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:32,916
Evie: Oh, my Gosh.

965
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:34,768
Serena: Can I get
something to clean up?

966
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:36,392
Evie: Well, at least we
know it runs in the family.

967
00:59:36,416 --> 00:59:37,958
- Walter: Evie, please.
- What does?

968
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:39,392
Evie: Being a bad
fucking mother.

969
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:40,916
- [yells]
- Aaryan: Mia!

970
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:44,875
Amelia: Is Assessment
always like this?

971
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:46,083
Holly: Oh, my God.

972
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,875
- Evie: Fucking barbarians!
- Aaryan: Hey...

973
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:51,750
[melancholic music playing]

974
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:59,625
[sighs loudly]

975

[door opens]

976
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:11,583
Mia: It's late.
It's time for bed.

977
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:31,250
Evie was mean to me.

978
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:37,833
[kisses]

979
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:42,750
Thank you, Mummy.

980
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:50,250
- Mia: Hm.
- [chuckles softly]

981
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:57,583
- [smooches] Hm, no, I...
- [smooches]

982
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:00,750
- I...
- [chuckles]

983
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:03,625
Aren't you a silly? [chuckles]

984
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:33,465
I didn't realize I had
to tell you every detail

985
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:35,125
about my life before we met.

986
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:38,541
- Assessment's not a detail.
- [sighs loudly]

987
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:43,083
Mia, it didn't mean
anything, okay?

988
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:45,250
Serena said it herself,
it meant nothing.

989
01:01:45,416 --> 01:01:47,875
- It is not nothing.
- Okay, maybe it's not nothing.

990
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:49,541
But it's not as big
a deal as you...

991
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:53,166
Stop! Stop. Stop. Stop.
Everything we went through.

992
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:57,375
The check-ups, the
protocols, the application,

993
01:01:58,083 --> 01:02:00,916
just imagining the life
that we would have, and...

994
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:08,125
you never thought to mention
that you did that with her, too.

995
01:02:09,166 --> 01:02:11,166
Yeah, I'm sorry. I
should've told you.

996
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:13,958
This can't just be another thing
for you to be good at, Aaryan.

997
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:17,666
You need to want this with me.

998
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:20,416
- I guess I was scared.
- Of what?

999
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:23,166
That you'd think I
wasn't good enough

1000
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:24,750
to raise a child with.

1001
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:29,833
That if you knew Serena

1002
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,923
felt I wasn't good enough,
you'd feel the same.

1003
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:33,500
What are you talking about?

1004
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:36,958
I love you.

1005
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:39,500
I want to have a child with you.

1006
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:42,416
I thought that was obvious.

1007
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:46,750
I'm sorry.

1008
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:49,166
Me, too.

1009
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,000
This is really fucking hard.

1010
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,125
Just two more days with
her, then she's gone.

1011
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,291

1012

[music fades]

1015
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,166
Aaryan: Virginia?

1016
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:11,083
I think you're having
a bad dream, okay?

1017
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:13,416
I think you need
to go back to bed.

1018
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:19,500
[breathes shakily] Yeah. [pants]

1019
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:24,625
No, Virginia. Your
own bed. Not here.

1020
01:04:24,791 --> 01:04:27,541
That's okay. It's okay.
Just let her sleep here.

1021
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:43,208

1022

- [soft whooshing]
- [dripping sound]

1025
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:26,791
How do you think
Aaryan's coping?

1026
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:37,000
I'd say that we're
both doing very well.

1027
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,708
- [dripping fades]
- [chuckles]

1028
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,125
Virginia: [hums softly]

1029
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:17,416
Sjøhus: <i>Mia, incoming call
from State Hospital West.</i>

1030
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:20,708
The doctor said that
she had an embolism

1031
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:22,416
and lost her speech and sound.

1032
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:24,000
Aaryan: For good?

1033
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,892
Mia: They don't know,
they're running tests

1034
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:27,351
They just said to get
there as soon as I could.

1035
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:29,041
Did you tell them
you got Assessment?

1036
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:30,916
What? No.

1037
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:33,041
- Do you think you should?
- Why?

1038
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:35,750
I just don't know if
it's okay for you to go.

1039
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:37,375
She's my sister.

1040
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:39,250
Aaryan: But Mia, you
hardly ever see her.

1041
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:40,875
I'm the only family she has.

1042
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:42,841
I'm just saying we should
check with Virginia.

1043
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,392
- Virginia: Check what?
- Aaryan: Jesus!

1044
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:46,083
Mia: My sister is
in intensive care.

1045
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:47,851
So I just need to make
sure that she's okay.

1046
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:50,250
- Virginia: You have to see her?
- Yes.

- Come on. Come on!
- [grunts]

1221
01:21:42,833 --> 01:21:44,208
Mia: Come on!

1222
01:21:45,708 --> 01:21:47,750
- Aaryan!
- I am trying!

1223
01:21:49,041 --> 01:21:52,500
I can't fucking move! [grunts]

1224
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,458
I can't move.

1225
01:21:58,416 --> 01:21:59,416
[she groans] Mia!

1226
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,625
[coughs]

1227
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:09,666
[whispers] Come on. Okay.

1228
01:22:11,291 --> 01:22:12,625
[whispers] Come on!

1229
01:22:12,791 --> 01:22:14,666
- [glass shattering]
- [Mia mumbles]

1230
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:19,916
Okay. Okay. One, two! [grunts]

1231
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:24,416
- Yeah, yeah, it's okay.
- [Virginia coughs]

1232
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:27,250
- Aaryan: Mia!
- Mia: Aaryan. Aaryan, I can't.

1233
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:33,375
- Aaryan: Hey. [coughs]
- [coughs]

1234
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,500
[groans]

1235
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:38,833
[explosion]

1236
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:45,291
[breathes shakily]

1237
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:54,000
[explosion]

1238
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:21,041
Virginia, please eat.

1239
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:25,875
Come on.

1240
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:29,833
- Virginia.
- Just let her go.

1241
01:23:40,041 --> 01:23:41,333
You could've died.

1242
01:23:43,291 --> 01:23:44,458
Yeah. What about her?

1243
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:50,625
I tried. I couldn't
because of the fire.

1244
01:23:51,666 --> 01:23:52,666
Yeah, I know.

1245
01:23:55,041 --> 01:23:56,083
Do you?

1246
01:23:58,541 --> 01:23:59,791
I'm gonna be right back.

1247
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:02,416
Mia...

1248
01:24:10,416 --> 01:24:11,875
[exhales sharply]

1249
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:16,583
- [waves crashing]
- [wind howling]

1250
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:32,083
You know all my work
was in that greenhouse.

1251
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:36,333
My orchid...

1252
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:41,708
my entire life.

1253
01:24:46,833 --> 01:24:48,541
Do you have any idea
how long it takes

1254
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,375
to build something like that?

1255
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:55,166
'Cause it doesn't just happen.

1256
01:24:59,416 --> 01:25:00,625
Are you listening?

1257
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:02,250
Do you care? I...

1258
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:06,250
Do you even know what
you're doing anymore?

1259
01:25:10,041 --> 01:25:11,875
[whimpers lightly]

1260
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:22,875
[soft choral vocalizing]

1261
01:25:26,625 --> 01:25:28,416
[receding footsteps]

1262
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:37,458
[vocalizing continues]

1263
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:44,208
[vocalizing fades]

1264
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:47,250
Virginia: <i>Assessment
is a rigorous process</i>

1265
01:25:47,916 --> 01:25:49,708
<i>with a high threshold
for success.</i>

1266
01:25:50,583 --> 01:25:52,916
You've marked yourselves
out as serious

1267
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:56,625
and impressive candidates,

1268
01:25:58,125 --> 01:26:01,166
demonstrating high
levels of competency.

1269
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:05,875
So, it's therefore with...

1270
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:10,833
regret that I must inform you

1271
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:14,083
that your application
has not been successful.

1272
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:19,916
You can't do that.

1273
01:26:25,666 --> 01:26:26,946
We've done everything you asked.

1274
01:26:27,083 --> 01:26:30,083
- My decision is final.
- Aaryan: No.

1275
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:34,458
We did everything you asked.

1276
01:26:36,583 --> 01:26:38,833
I did everything.

1277
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:42,541
Everything!

1278
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:49,375
You can't fail me
'cause of that.

1279
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:53,958
You told me I had to do
it to pass Assessment!

1280
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:56,041
I never said that.

1281
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:02,208
You fucked her?

1282
01:27:07,416 --> 01:27:08,666
I did it for us.

1283
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:10,476
- You fucked our child.
- She's not our child.

1284
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,017
Of course she is,
that's the entire point.

1285
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:14,166
She was not our child
when she fucked me!

1286
01:27:15,375 --> 01:27:17,375
You said if Assessment was
over, you'd let us know.

1287
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,791
Why didn't you fail
us at the time?

1288
01:27:19,958 --> 01:27:21,375
You can't do this.
It's not right.

1289
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:23,166
- Step aside.
- Why did you not do that?

1290
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:24,541
[chuckles softly]

1291
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:26,517
Aaryan: You can't do this,
okay? It's not right.

1292
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:28,226
- Assessor: Please.
- Aaryan: No, it's not right.

1293
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,976
You can't. It's... Do you
know the things I've done

1294
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,708
for this society?
The people I know?

1295
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:35,083
- Listen to me. Listen to me!
- [Mia laughs hysterically]

1296
01:27:36,583 --> 01:27:38,083
[Mia continues laughing]

1297
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,375
[gulps, breathes shakily]

1298
01:28:02,208 --> 01:28:04,875
- [munches]
- [cutlery clatters]

1299
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:16,041
[somber music playing]

1300
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,208
[rattling]

1301
01:28:56,625 --> 01:28:58,125
[music intensifies]

1302
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:29,041
[music fades]

1303
01:29:30,291 --> 01:29:32,916
[grunts]

1304
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:37,666
Fuck! [sobs]

1305
01:29:39,166 --> 01:29:41,375
[grunting intensifies]

1306
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:48,083
[breathes shakily, grunts]

1307
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:53,833
[sobs]

1308
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,666
Aaryan: Hey. Hey.

1309
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,416
[sobs, whimpers]

1310
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:27,551
Aaryan: There's something
I want to show you.

1311
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:05,916
[baby gurgles]

1312
01:31:09,458 --> 01:31:10,875
[whispers] Hi.

1313
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:14,000
Hi. [shushes]

1314
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:16,500
[whispers] Oh, my gosh.

1315
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:22,250
- [whispers] Hi. Hi.
- [baby coos]

1316
01:31:23,583 --> 01:31:26,291
- [whispers] Hi.
- [coos]

1317
01:31:28,875 --> 01:31:30,155
- Mia: You okay?
- [baby gurgles]

1318
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:31,416
Mia: Yes.

1319
01:31:33,708 --> 01:31:35,750
- [baby coos]
- I haven't named her yet.

1320
01:31:36,333 --> 01:31:38,708
[baby gurgles and coos]

1321
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,916
Mia: Hey. Hey.

1322
01:31:46,166 --> 01:31:48,458
[baby coos]

1323
01:31:49,625 --> 01:31:53,375
- [baby gurgles]
- [Mia chuckles softly]

1324
01:31:54,791 --> 01:31:56,958
[whispers] Yes. Yes.

1325
01:32:03,083 --> 01:32:04,333
[sniffs]

1326
01:32:11,583 --> 01:32:14,416
What? What's wrong?

1327
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:26,541
- [baby cries]
- Mia! What is it?

1328
01:32:30,208 --> 01:32:31,375
Mia: Her smell.

1329
01:32:31,833 --> 01:32:33,916
Aaryan: Her smell? What
do you mean? I don't...

1330
01:32:34,083 --> 01:32:38,250
[shakily] She... She doesn't
smell of anything. She...

1331
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:41,041
- She has no smell.
- I'm gonna work on that, okay?

1332
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:42,541
I'm gonna get it
right, I promise.

1333
01:32:42,708 --> 01:32:44,500
No, I don't want right,
I just want human.

1334
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:48,125
So do I, but we can't
have that. We tried.

1335
01:32:48,291 --> 01:32:49,958
I called in every
possible favor.

1336
01:32:50,208 --> 01:32:52,528
They all said the same thing.
Assessor's decision is final.

1337
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:54,125
These are the rules we live by.

1338
01:32:54,291 --> 01:32:55,916
Mia: I... I can't
do this anymore.

1339
01:32:56,541 --> 01:32:58,750
It's the price we pay
to drink clean water,

1340
01:32:58,916 --> 01:33:00,250
to live, to breathe.

1341
01:33:00,666 --> 01:33:04,791
[shakily] Then why does it
feel like I'm suffocating?

1342
01:33:05,458 --> 01:33:07,041
[baby coos]

1343
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:13,666
We'll go back

1344
01:33:14,791 --> 01:33:16,458
to how it was before.

1345
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:21,833
- I need to know why we failed.
- Why?

1346
01:33:23,625 --> 01:33:25,000
What's the point?

1347
01:33:28,833 --> 01:33:30,541
'Cause I have to understand.

1348
01:33:32,916 --> 01:33:34,875
How is that going to help us?

1349
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:37,333
Mia.

1350
01:33:39,166 --> 01:33:40,500
We love each other.

1351
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:43,708
- [baby cries]
- That's right.

1352
01:33:47,125 --> 01:33:48,166
Mia: That's right.

1353
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:50,541
[baby continues whining]

1354
01:33:54,583 --> 01:33:56,625
[baby cries]

1355
01:34:03,541 --> 01:34:05,083
[haunting music playing]

1356
01:34:11,541 --> 01:34:13,291
[indistinct voice over PA]

1357
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:26,000
[low, rhythmic rumbling]

1358
01:34:55,333 --> 01:34:56,500
[music fades]

1359
01:35:05,916 --> 01:35:06,958
[sighs]

1360
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:13,875
[door closes]

1361
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:18,490
Virginia: You
have five minutes.

1362
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:23,000
It wasn't easy to find
you. Grace, right?

1363
01:35:23,583 --> 01:35:25,791
They think it helps
you keep less involved,

1364
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,458
if you use a different name.

1365
01:35:30,583 --> 01:35:33,583
[water trickling]

1366
01:35:35,625 --> 01:35:38,291
Look, if you're here to tell
me what a monster I am...

1367
01:35:38,458 --> 01:35:39,541
Why did we fail?

1368
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,083
- Because you...
- [Grace sighs]

1369
01:35:43,583 --> 01:35:47,166
- ...you tricked Aaryan.
- Aaryan made a choice.

1370
01:35:48,791 --> 01:35:51,000
You trusted him.
Children lie, Mia.

1371
01:35:51,166 --> 01:35:53,291
No, we're not these
kinds of people.

1372
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:58,041
'Cause people like you couldn't
possibly be not good enough.

1373
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,916
What does that mean,
people like me?

1374
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:01,416
Do you even know how serious

1375
01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:03,023
an offense it is
you even being here?

1376
01:36:05,125 --> 01:36:07,000
I could have you arrested.

1377
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:09,958
I could have you exiled.

1378
01:36:10,333 --> 01:36:12,708
I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me why we failed.

1379
01:36:12,875 --> 01:36:15,291
I've told you why you failed.

1380
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,458
You're lying. I know you are.

1381
01:36:17,875 --> 01:36:19,875
'Cause I saved
your fucking life.

1382
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:22,750
I...

1383
01:36:24,083 --> 01:36:25,166
We...

1384
01:36:26,666 --> 01:36:29,333
- connected.
- It's... It's common,

1385
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,708
for candidates to feel a
bond with their Assessor,

1386
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
- it doesn't mean...
- Why are you being like this?

1387
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:39,791
What are you afraid of?

1388
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
That you might actually
feel something?

1389
01:36:43,166 --> 01:36:46,000
I've had to learn
how to not feel.

1390
01:36:46,291 --> 01:36:47,291
What I'm...

1391
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:50,208
What I'm trying to do
here, Mia, is to help you.

1392
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:51,750
You need to leave.

1393
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:54,875
I actually thought there was
a person behind the uniform,

1394
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:56,892
that it couldn't
all just be an act,

1395
01:36:56,916 --> 01:36:58,500
but there isn't, is there?

1396
01:36:58,666 --> 01:37:01,625
- You're a lonely bitter husk.
- Yes. I'm a monster.

1397
01:37:01,791 --> 01:37:03,958
So it's normal for you to
fuck someone's partner?

1398
01:37:04,125 --> 01:37:07,791
To nearly die? That's
just what you do?

1399
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:11,291
'Cause I have to say it sounds
a little unprofessional.

1400
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:13,791
Don't you think people
ought to know that this is

1401
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:16,541
- what Assessment is?
- Everything that I did

1402
01:37:16,833 --> 01:37:18,666
is within the protocols.

1403
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:21,041
But you failed for
the same reason

1404
01:37:21,708 --> 01:37:23,666
that everyone fails, Mia.

1405
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:27,250
You just weren't
good enough. [sighs]

1406
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:29,916
What do you mean,
everyone fails?

1407
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:32,208
[scoffs]

1408
01:37:34,583 --> 01:37:37,958
What do you mean,
everyone fails?

1409
01:37:38,791 --> 01:37:41,125
That's... That's a turn of
phrase. I didn't mean...

1410
01:37:41,416 --> 01:37:43,136
How many people passed
Assessment this year?

1411
01:37:43,291 --> 01:37:45,166
Grace: That's
confidential information.

1412
01:37:45,416 --> 01:37:46,666
What about the last two years?

1413
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,041
The last three? The
last five? How many?

1414
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:51,750
A 100? Ten? One? What? Do
you think we can't find out?

1415
01:37:51,916 --> 01:37:53,583
That Aaryan and I
don't know who to ask?

1416
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:54,875
Six years.

1417
01:37:57,083 --> 01:37:59,625
That's the last
time anyone passed.

1418
01:38:05,416 --> 01:38:07,375
[breathes shakily]

1419
01:38:17,458 --> 01:38:18,666
[whispers] So...

1420
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:22,250
So, we never had a chance.

1421
01:38:27,458 --> 01:38:31,416
Then what is the
point of any of it?

1422
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,875
Stopping it would
be bad for morale.

1423
01:38:39,041 --> 01:38:41,791
You could've just failed us.
You didn't have to humiliate us.

1424
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:47,250
No, I had to prove you
weren't good enough.

1425
01:38:50,875 --> 01:38:52,291
What is wrong with you?

1426
01:38:54,125 --> 01:38:57,166
- How can you even do this?
- Most can't.

1427
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:02,375
Assessors usually burn out

1428
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:05,708
within a few months,
they find it too intense.

1429
01:39:09,083 --> 01:39:10,416
But if you can do it,

1430
01:39:11,833 --> 01:39:13,041
there are rewards.

1431
01:39:14,041 --> 01:39:17,125
- And what was yours?
- A child.

1432
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:22,833
[laughs softly]

1433
01:39:26,625 --> 01:39:28,208
Grace: They're gonna
give me a child.

1434
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:32,375
- Okay.
- Grace: In the future.

1435
01:39:33,291 --> 01:39:36,000
If the numbers drop.

1436
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:37,750
And you think that
you would be ahead

1437
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,916
of people like Aaryan and me?

1438
01:39:42,708 --> 01:39:45,208
We've made things
for this society.

1439
01:39:46,125 --> 01:39:48,708
And what have you done? Just
victimized innocent people?

1440
01:39:48,875 --> 01:39:52,583
I've done everything
that they asked of me!

1441
01:39:54,875 --> 01:39:56,500
And I've been spat on.

1442
01:39:57,958 --> 01:40:01,375
I've been demeaned,
I've been debased.

1443
01:40:01,875 --> 01:40:04,791
I've sacrificed every
single part of me

1444
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:06,375
that is left to...

1445
01:40:07,083 --> 01:40:08,875
to help the society to function,

1446
01:40:09,041 --> 01:40:11,416
and you fucking dare
to look down on me.

1447
01:40:12,375 --> 01:40:13,684
There's no list.
You must know that.

1448
01:40:13,708 --> 01:40:15,000
Of course, there's a list.

1449
01:40:15,458 --> 01:40:17,538
- Mia: Why would there be?
- Because there has to be!

1450
01:40:24,125 --> 01:40:29,125
Because this
society needs people

1451
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,541
who know what it is...

1452
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:34,458
to love a child.

1453
01:40:39,083 --> 01:40:40,875
You have no idea...

1454
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:44,166
what it's like...

1455
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:47,875
to hold...

1456
01:40:48,541 --> 01:40:51,458
to hold your child
in your arms...

1457
01:40:53,708 --> 01:40:56,916
telling her that
everything's gonna be okay...

1458
01:40:57,833 --> 01:40:59,291
even though she's dying.

1459
01:41:03,958 --> 01:41:07,375
That's when you really
know what love is.

1460
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:15,208
My daughter is not alive,
but she's here, you know?

1461
01:41:15,791 --> 01:41:18,000
She's... she's present.

1462
01:41:18,416 --> 01:41:22,000
She's a part of me for
every single second.

1463
01:41:23,333 --> 01:41:24,458
And you can't...

1464
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:28,583
You can't, you
can't possibly know

1465
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,166
what that's like.

1466
01:41:33,791 --> 01:41:38,166
Not the way that I
do. [breathes shakily]

1467
01:42:04,708 --> 01:42:06,416
[softly] I'm sorry
about your daughter.

1468
01:42:11,958 --> 01:42:14,458
It's her birthday next week.

1469
01:42:16,666 --> 01:42:18,291
She drowned when she was eight.

1470
01:42:19,791 --> 01:42:21,208
[quietly] So stupid.

1471
01:42:23,166 --> 01:42:25,041
[sighs deeply]

1472
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:39,083
Is it true what
Holly said, that...

1473
01:42:40,833 --> 01:42:42,500
that people are surviving?

1474
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,166
Grace: It's not much of a life.

1475
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:53,458
But yes.

1476
01:42:57,333 --> 01:42:58,500
Would you go?

1477
01:43:01,625 --> 01:43:03,416
[sighs]

1478
01:43:05,416 --> 01:43:07,375
I'm old, Mia.

1479
01:43:09,916 --> 01:43:12,458
Without the Senoxidine,
I won't last long.

1480
01:43:16,583 --> 01:43:19,000
And the Old World is
not a nice place to be.

1481
01:43:21,291 --> 01:43:22,458
And this is?

1482
01:43:24,083 --> 01:43:25,583
[soft music playing]

1483
01:43:31,333 --> 01:43:33,375

1495

Is that clear?

1496
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:15,750
I'm sure everyone
says this, but...

1497
01:44:16,833 --> 01:44:18,208
we'd make really great parents.

show you the room.

It's got everything
you asked for.

1500
01:44:49,125 --> 01:44:50,208
Adequate.

1501
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:54,791
I'll... I'll let you unpack.

1502
01:44:57,625 --> 01:44:58,666
Do you...

1503
01:44:59,791 --> 01:45:04,208
Do you ever keep in
touch with the children

1504

as they grow?

1505
01:45:08,333 --> 01:45:10,916
No. I don't.
