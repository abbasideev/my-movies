1
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:43,010
<i>Amira's brought down outside the area.</i>

2
00:00:43,094 --> 00:00:44,845
<i>The keeper catches it comfortably.</i>

3
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:48,808
<i>It now looks like there will be</i>
<i>a substitution for the blues.</i>

4
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:50,393
<i>Gentry replaces Penny.</i>

5
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:51,727
Take your time.

6
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:53,396
You what?

7
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:55,481
Big head on that, mate. Thank you.

8
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:56,607
No problem.

9
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:02,905
Two weeks of straight drinking.
What a great time.

10
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:05,283
I had a great time.
I felt better when I got home.

11
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:06,242
Easy.

12
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:07,368
What about...

13
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:09,620
-No, we're too old for Ibiza.

14
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:12,373
What are you on about?
You're never too old for the island.

15
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:15,501
That's what people who are too old
for Ibiza say. Where are the crisps?

16
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:17,920
I said, "Can I have crisps for that guy?"
I pointed to you.

17
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:20,047
He said you're not allowed
to have crisps anymore.

18
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:22,466
-He said you're only allowed salad.
-Fucking dickhead.

19
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,052
That's what he said, Dom. Sorry.
-That's harsh, man.

20
00:01:25,136 --> 00:01:28,514
Why don't we go to... boom! Amsterdam?

21
00:01:28,597 --> 00:01:30,433
No, it's too touristy now, isn't it?

22
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:32,977
-Alright, TripAdvisor.
-I'm not getting off my head again.

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,979
-Yeah, good wines.

24
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,188
No.

25
00:01:36,272 --> 00:01:37,982
Berlin, then?
-<i>Nein</i>.

26
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:38,899
Belgium?

27
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:41,652
Belgium? Mate, no one's ever
been to Belgium by choice.

28
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:45,698
What's in Belgium?
-Beers that are, like, 42% or something.

29
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:46,991
What about hiking?

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,994
Yeah... hiking.

31
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,707
-That's a good shout.
-Come on, man. Let's do something good.

32
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,376
What's it called again?

33
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,755
The King's Trail.
It kind of runs between Sweden and Norway.

34
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:03,924
-You can go there in the summer.

35
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,844
Yeah, apart from,
there's more history than hillbillies.

36
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,472
I wanna do something different.
I don't wanna go to Amsterdam.

37
00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:10,389
We wanna... mix it up.

38
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,476
Yeah, it's not like we're 21 anymore.

39
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,395
Oh, look, there's that...
Look, I'm gonna get a bottle.

40
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,605
Who's on it?

41
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:19,023
No way. School night, mate.

42
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,399
I wanna crack on.

43
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:22,401
Does no one wanna...
Anyone wanna come with me?

44
00:02:24,236 --> 00:02:25,571
-Nope.
 Come on, Robert.

45
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:27,114
-Go on, then.
 Oh, man!

46
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:29,909
Bad idea.

47
00:02:29,992 --> 00:02:31,869
You're not getting involved,
are you?

48
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,371
-I'm getting an Uber.
-Yeah, good.

49
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:36,791
Don't you think, when we meet up,
it getting harder to have a good time?

50
00:02:36,874 --> 00:02:39,752
Did you know that Phil
actually suggested making this brunch?

51
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:40,961
Fucking brunch.

52
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:41,879
I'm not...

53
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:45,049
I'm not gonna plan a lads' holiday
over a fucking avocado on toast, mate.

54
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,467
I'm not doing it.

55
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:48,427
Avocado's alright.

56
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:51,138
Do you really wanna go hiking?
Hiking for fun?

57
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:52,932
-Yeah.
 In fucking Sweden?

58
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:54,100
Yeah, I do.

59
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:57,019
I don't know, I just wanna
test myself a little, have a challenge.

60
00:02:57,103 --> 00:03:00,147
Do you know what would be a challenge?
Getting Dom on the side of a mountain.

61
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:01,982
Where's the vodka?

62
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:05,611
It's just a shame, you know. It's a shame.
It's a shame what he's become.

63
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:07,238
Yeah. Yeah, big shame.

64
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:10,491
Yeah, big successful businessman
with a beautiful wife and children.

65
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:11,659
Yeah, no. It's a...

66
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:17,873
What else have you got?

67
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:22,461
Don't fucking argue, you cunt.
There's more. Where the fuck is it, huh?

68
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:25,089
Stop fucking crying.

69
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:30,469
Don't fucking move.

70
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,309
Give me your wallet.

71
00:03:37,393 --> 00:03:38,728
Give it to him.

72
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:39,854
OK.

73
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:41,021
Look, it's OK.

74
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:44,358
Don't stand there. Do it.
 Give me your fucking wallet.

75
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:49,572
What else you got?

76
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:52,950
Take his watch.
 Give me the watch.

77
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,493
Here.
 Do it.

78
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:55,828
OK.

79
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:58,831
And the ring.

80
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:01,167
No.

81
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:04,462
-That's my wedding ring.
 We don't give a fuck.

82
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,380
Just give me the fucking ring.

83
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:07,965
Just take it off him.

84
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,134
No, look, you've done enough. It...

85
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:13,220
-Just leave.
 Take it the fuck off him!

86
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,681
Come on.

87
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,892
Listen, you take that ring off,

88
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:19,643
or I will fuck you up.

89
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:27,109
Look, I'm not gonna...

90
00:04:30,154 --> 00:04:31,655
Oh, fuck.

91
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:33,240
Mate, what are you doing?

92
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:34,867
I told you.

93
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,286
Fucking hell, mate!

94
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:38,829
What are you doing?

95
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:42,124
It's alright. I've got it.
 For fuck's sake, leave it!

96
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,709
Right, let's go! Let's go!

97
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,754
Morning.

98
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,965
Fuck me, it's cold.

99
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:15,676
I'll get the coffees on.

100
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:22,433
Morning, bud.

101
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,184
Morning.

102
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:28,397
Like I just walked up
a big fucking mountain, man.

103
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:30,899
One night down, two to go, mate.

104
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:49,043
<i>It makes you feel insignificant.</i>
 <i>Speak for yourself.</i>

105
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:50,836
<i>Come on, man. Where's your soul?</i>

106
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,466
These mountains were smashed out
by Nordic gods with big bastard hammers.

107
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,177
You know what they have
on walking trails in England?

108
00:06:58,594 --> 00:06:59,678
Pubs.  Yeah, whatever.

109
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,183
Don't tell me you aren't impressed.

110
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:06,560
Give me a pint of ale
and some pork scratchings.

111
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,611
Yeah, yeah, these are new boots.
They were reduced to 200 quid.

112
00:07:15,694 --> 00:07:18,614
-Memory foam as well.
 But you need to break them in.

113
00:07:18,697 --> 00:07:20,282
Yeah, definitely.

114
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:22,534
It's basic common sense, Phil.

115
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,621
OK, I think I've found a spot...

116
00:07:26,956 --> 00:07:28,290
just up the top of that hill.

117
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:05,160
Fuck me.

118
00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:07,037
It's beautiful.

119
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:11,750
Jesus...

120
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,085
Christ.

121
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:15,671
Oh, fuck every hill in the world!

122
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:17,172
Shall we do this?

123
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,849
Bo will be up there waiting for him.

124
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:28,934
Man, I hated that dog.

125
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:32,646
He was a good man.

126
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:35,649
The best of us.

127
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,945
It should never have happened.

128
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:48,996
It should never have happened,
but it did.

129
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,083
And all we can do is remember him.

130
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:51,850
Robert, we miss you mate.

131
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:13,497
We haven't seen her.
I can't remember the last time I saw her.

132
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,332
Yeah, I mean, she mentioned Gayle.

133
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,292
Yeah, well, they get on.

134
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:18,836
Get together or something...

135
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:44,027
Rob would have loved this place.

136
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,655
Except we wouldn't be here, would we?

137
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:48,157
We would be on some...

138
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,034
terrible lads' holiday
he would have hated.

139
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:55,247
I've said it before,
I don't care what anyone says.

140
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,957
It wasn't your fault, mate.

141
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:06,800
-I think it is, yeah, just over there.

142
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:09,011
-I know.
 I thought we were further out.

143
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,474
When we get back,
I was thinking I might stop on a few days.

144
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:17,436
Maybe get out there,
do a little bit more hiking.

145
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:19,187
What do you think, man?

146
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:20,105
I don't know, mate.

147
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:22,232
We came all this way.
We have to make the most of it.

148
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:25,110
I think... I think this is enough for me.

149
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:33,410
Here. Give it here.
 Fuck.

150
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,412
It's the wrong way round.
Give it here.

151
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,456
-Unclip the pole.
 Jesus Christ.

152
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,969
Oh, this is awful
in almost every conceivable way.

153
00:11:51,053 --> 00:11:54,056
There are some, Phil,
who consider this character-building.

154
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:57,476
Quite frankly, right now,
Sweden can lick my bridge.

155
00:11:57,935 --> 00:11:59,811
-My bridge.

156
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:01,021
Jesus Christ, the bridge.

157
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:02,981
-Oh, you mean the perineum.
-Yeah, the gooch.

158
00:12:03,065 --> 00:12:04,274
-The bridge.
-Yeah, yeah.

159
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:08,820
Fuck!

160
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:14,242
Come on. Let's get you up.
-Oh, fuck! Shit!

161
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:16,370
Alright, come on. Easy, easy.

162
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:19,873
-Come on, you're alright.
 Up, up.

163
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:21,333
Yeah, alright. Easy.

164
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,336
Fuck.
-Walk about a bit on it.

165
00:12:25,837 --> 00:12:27,047
Give it a walk around.

166
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:28,590
That's it.

167
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,093
You're OK.

168
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:36,223
Oh, it's twisted.

169
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:38,308
It hurts like a son of a bitch.

170
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,353
You can probably walk it off.

171
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:44,147
No, it's my meniscus.
I've done it before. It's fucked.

172
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,400
Alright, we'll get him
something to lean on.

173
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:48,151
Phil, can you get the rods, please?

174
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:51,989
What are we thinking, Dom?

175
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:56,660
Because the trail goes right round
those mountains. It's probably, what...?

176
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,245
Six hours till we camp?

177
00:12:58,328 --> 00:13:00,080
Another eight round to the lodge?

178
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:02,207
What are we thinking?

179
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,750
Fuck me.

180
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:06,586
I'm not doing 14 hours on this. OK, man?

181
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:09,172
Let's get the map.

182
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,008
Do you wanna try
your phone as well?

183
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,427
-No, no need.
 There's no reception anyway.

184
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:16,847
Cheers, man. Luke, my office.

185
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,061
What do you think?

186
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:25,147
I think we could be carrying him out there

187
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,025
like a fucking Egyptian princess
if we're not careful.

188
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:31,611
-It's probably not as bad as he says.
-Almost certainly not as bad as he says.

189
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:34,114
But it's not gonna stop him moaning
all the way back, is it?

190
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:41,538
-There is another way out of this, man.

191
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,291
Well, you saw it last night... the lodge.

192
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,544
It's not that far as the crow flies. Look.

193
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,672
If we go south-west, through here,
we cut the journey in half.

194
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,720
A little off-trail hiking.

195
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,014
Could be exciting,
might even do us some good.

196
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:01,600
We could be kicking back by the evening.

197
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:07,314
I think we need this.

198
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:10,192
Look, why don't me and you
leave them here with the food?

199
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:11,860
Then we can go back, get some help.

200
00:14:11,943 --> 00:14:14,821
No fucking way you're leaving us
on this fucking mountain.

201
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:16,990
I can walk, alright?

202
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:19,368
If you know a quicker route, let's do it.

203
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:38,970
How's the knee, Dom
 Killing me.

204
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:46,103
Are there bears in this forest?

205
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,730
Of course there's fucking bears.
Big bastards as well.

206
00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:50,732
We should have gone to Vegas.

207
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:52,901
You'd find something
to fall over in Vegas.

208
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:55,362
Yeah, a massive pile of tits.

209
00:14:58,281 --> 00:14:59,533
Shit...

210
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:04,079
Everything in this bastard country
is a relic.

211
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:05,997
Strange place to park, isn't it?

212
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,042
My next door neighbor
has one of those.

213
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:11,962
My eldest is absolutely obsessed by it.

214
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,382
I got a hand job in one of those once,
at a festival.

215
00:15:15,465 --> 00:15:17,676
Thanks, Phil. What a beautiful story.

216
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:21,638
Are you scared of the woods?

217
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,670
Now, is it me
or is it really quiet in here?

218
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,422
Alright, don't shit your pants.

219
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:58,175
The trees soak up the sound.
That's what trees do.

220
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:01,428
Hiking was easier yesterday.
 Well, we weren't in the forest.

221
00:16:01,511 --> 00:16:03,472
No, we bloody weren't.
 Come on.

222
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:06,516
The sooner we get to town, the sooner
we get to the bar and get drunk.

223
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:11,646
The Swedes were big into logging,
until the 1950s.

224
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,316
-Then they decided to pack it in.
 That's interesting.

225
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,653
Which is why Sweden
is an untouched land of natural beauty,

226
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:20,238
and Britain is a car park.

227
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:22,949
If you love Sweden so much,
why don't you marry it?

228
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:27,454
Right, time out.

229
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:30,665
Dom, what did Gayle say when you told her
you were going on a hiking holiday?

230
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:33,293
She said, "Who are you
and what have you done with my husband?"

231
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:38,965
Oh, here we go. Photo op.

232
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,718
-Here we go.
 Scott of the Antarctic.

233
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,471
Work it, baby.
-Fucking Amelia Earhart over there.

234
00:16:44,554 --> 00:16:46,515
Wallop. Yes, that's it.
-Look at that.

235
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:49,434
-Let's get a selfie while we're here.
 Selfie

236
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:52,854
You too, Luke. Come on.
Let's preserve this magic moment.

237
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:55,232
There you go.
 It's a beautiful thing.

238
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,900
Here we go. Everyone get in.

239
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:59,986
One, two three... and Brexit. Boom.

240
00:17:01,196 --> 00:17:03,698
-Yes.
-Yeah, yeah. Four twats in a forest.

241
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:05,909
Yeah.

242
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,864
My stomach is beginning to eat itself.

243
00:17:44,948 --> 00:17:46,658
Yeah, I could do a steak.

244
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,121
Big fat, juicy steak.

245
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:54,749
I want peppercorn sauce,
I want hand-cooked chips,

246
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,001
side salad.

247
00:17:56,084 --> 00:17:57,794
A nice tumbler of scotch...

248
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,839
and a big fat cigar at the end.

249
00:18:00,922 --> 00:18:03,633
Oh, man.
I could go for some sushi right now.

250
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,679
Yeah, some red wine instead of white.

251
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,347
Lashings of wasabi.

252
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:12,350
Big Mac, plastic tray, by myself,

253
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:14,269
and no one to talk to.

254
00:18:14,603 --> 00:18:16,187
Can I have a kebab, please, mate?

255
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:18,648
Donner?
-No, chicken shish, please.

256
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,527
Rob liked a Donner, remember that?

257
00:18:23,695 --> 00:18:24,863
Yeah.

258
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:26,489
Every Saturday night at uni.

259
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:28,033
There he was,

260
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:30,118
pissed, covered in grease.

261
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:42,964
What the fuck is that?

262
00:18:53,975 --> 00:18:55,310
Why is it ripped open?

263
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:56,811
It's been gutted.

264
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,148
Yeah, why hang it like that?

265
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,359
I mean, would someone do that?

266
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:05,528
It didn't fucking put itself there,
that's for sure.

267
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,906
Could be hunters out here.
 What, bait?

268
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,532
Possibly.

269
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:12,077
Or it's the bit they don't show you
in nature documentaries.

270
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,079
-A bear.

271
00:19:14,162 --> 00:19:15,080
Do bears do that?

272
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:17,499
I don't know, Dominic.
I'm not a fucking bear expert.

273
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,754
It's still bleeding.

274
00:19:22,837 --> 00:19:23,922
So?

275
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:26,549
So, it means that whatever did that...
We should go.

276
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:27,926
It's a fresh kill.

277
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:31,221
Yeah, we should go.

278
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:17,142
Fucking Jesus Christ!

279
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:19,644
Fuck.

280
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:21,980
Where the hell are we, Hutch?

281
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:23,273
Let me check.

282
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:26,776
This is ridiculous, man.

283
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,738
We should pitch the tents.

284
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:32,574
We should pitch the tents!

285
00:20:32,657 --> 00:20:34,951
So we're giving up making it
back to town tonight, then?

286
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,287
Well, I don't see
we have much choice, Philip.

287
00:20:39,914 --> 00:20:41,040
Guys.

288
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,501
What is it?

289
00:20:43,585 --> 00:20:44,961
Look at this.

290
00:20:45,462 --> 00:20:46,963
Huh?
 Look.

291
00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:59,893
Well, how about that!

292
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:01,102
What is that?

293
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:02,937
Is that a house?

294
00:21:04,189 --> 00:21:06,149
Come on.
 Thank Christ.

295
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:12,947
-Hey, Hutch. Wait a minute!
 Come on!

296
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:22,791
Can you see anything?

297
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,085
It looks empty.
 We should leave it alone, then.

298
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,630
Let's kick it in.

299
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,465
No fucking way.

300
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:33,259
We need to get under cover, mate.
Phil, give us a hand.

301
00:21:33,343 --> 00:21:34,677
Alright, come on, then.

302
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,473
Wait, wait, wait!
We can't just break in.

303
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:40,475
We can't stay out here all night.

304
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:42,101
On three, yeah?

305
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:43,520
One, two, three.

306
00:22:11,506 --> 00:22:14,217
Luke, you're getting soaked!
 Did you hear that?

307
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,219
No, I didn't hear anything.
Come on!

308
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,815
This is clearly the house
we'll get murdered in.

309
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:31,067
It's not as bad
as our uni accommodation.

310
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:37,865
That's the shape on the tree, I think.

311
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:43,538
Guys, this place
is definitely abandoned, yeah?

312
00:22:43,621 --> 00:22:45,456
Abandoned

313
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,377
Whoever it was, they were packing.
Look at that.

314
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,965
I don't like this place.
-Not too keen on it myself, mate.

315
00:22:54,048 --> 00:22:56,384
But it's a lesser of two evils
kind of situation.

316
00:22:57,093 --> 00:22:58,094
Hutch,

317
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,263
I definitely just heard something outside.

318
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,683
Maybe you did, Lukey.
We're not the only animals in the woods.

319
00:23:05,476 --> 00:23:07,854
Alright, let's see
if we can get this stove working.

320
00:23:07,937 --> 00:23:09,230
We'll need stuff to burn.

321
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:10,898
Like what?

322
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:13,318
Anything made of wood will do.

323
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:20,825
We're gonna smash the place up,
are we?

324
00:23:21,576 --> 00:23:24,329
Fuck them.

325
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:27,415
Whoever lives here has more to worry about
than their table being on fire.

326
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,418
Might be some stuff to burn up there.

327
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:32,503
Go on, Phil. You're nearest.

328
00:23:33,004 --> 00:23:34,631
What?
 Go on!

329
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,883
Do you want me to come with you?

330
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:37,884
No.

331
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:10,875
Hey! That's it, lad!

332
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:14,212
Dickheads.

333
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,880
Guys, get the fuck up here, now!

334
00:24:58,297 --> 00:24:59,298
What now?

335
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:09,600
Oh, shit.

336
00:25:13,396 --> 00:25:14,522
Oh, my God.

337
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:18,776
What the fuck is that?

338
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,909
That's witchcraft.

339
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:27,869
Huh?

340
00:25:27,952 --> 00:25:29,328
That's what that is: witchcraft.

341
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:32,248
Is that meant to be a person?

342
00:25:32,915 --> 00:25:34,917
What, with no head
and antlers for hands?

343
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:39,922
-If I hear anything come down the stairs--
-Don't! Fucking hell!

344
00:25:43,468 --> 00:25:46,137
I'm going downstairs
to get that fire started.

345
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,264
You guys can stay up here if you want.

346
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,268
Yeah, good idea.
 Come on.

347
00:26:11,746 --> 00:26:13,581
It looked like that thing
in the tree.

348
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:17,210
Could be idolizing a spirit
or a deity.

349
00:26:17,293 --> 00:26:20,880
Some kind of pagan or Nordic shit,

350
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:22,340
like an offering.

351
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:25,802
Yeah, well, I almost offered up
a massive shit when I saw it.

352
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:29,430
-Well, that is Nordic.

353
00:26:29,514 --> 00:26:33,434
Who knows what they're into out here?
Living here in the middle of nowhere...

354
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,145
Sun goes down,
doesn't come up for six months... You're bound to go fucking mental
in the winter.

355
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,692
We should burn
this place down when we leave.

356
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:43,945
I'm fucking well up for burning it down.

357
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:47,073
Listen, though, I think that...

358
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:52,495
when we wake up tomorrow, we should think
about just going back out the way we came.

359
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:55,998
We don't need to willfully add
another day to the trip, do we?

360
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:58,000
Let's just stick to the shortcut--

361
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:01,128
My old scoutmaster used to say,
"If a shortcut was a shortcut,

362
00:27:01,212 --> 00:27:02,463
it would be called a route."

363
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:05,424
Why do you pretend you were in the Scouts?
You were never in the Scouts.

364
00:27:05,508 --> 00:27:06,968
Where did I get the quote from?

365
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:09,512
Guys, right, we have a map,
we have a compass,

366
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:11,180
we have supplies.

367
00:27:11,264 --> 00:27:14,392
So as long as we don't panic,
as long as we don't fuck ourselves,

368
00:27:14,475 --> 00:27:15,935
we're gonna be absolutely OK.

369
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:19,063
No one's fucking anyone.
 It could be a long night.

370
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:20,940
No one's fucking anybody.

371
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:24,735
We're in sleeping bags,
for crying out loud.

372
00:27:24,986 --> 00:27:26,404
It could get messy.

373
00:27:29,198 --> 00:27:32,326
I'd give anyone a grand to go upstairs
and sleep with that thing.

374
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,120
Absolutely, no way.

375
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:37,039
-My wife would never forgive me.
 No, she wouldn't.

376
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:38,040
Goodnight.

377
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:42,003
Yeah, alright. OK, a couple of hours.
As soon as it's light, we'll get out.

378
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:01,832
Hutch?

379
00:30:20,036 --> 00:30:20,995
Hutch?

380
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:22,455
Hutch?

381
00:30:22,538 --> 00:30:24,248
Mate. Wake up, mate.

382
00:30:24,332 --> 00:30:25,791
It's OK. It's OK.

383
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,501
Where the fuck am I?

384
00:30:27,585 --> 00:30:29,920
We're in that house.
We're in that fucking house.

385
00:30:30,004 --> 00:30:32,256
Get up, OK? Get up! Where's the... where's my fucking...

386
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:44,018
Jesus Christ.

387
00:30:44,852 --> 00:30:46,228
I've pissed myself.

388
00:30:47,855 --> 00:30:49,273
Gayle!
 Dom.

389
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:52,401
Gayle!

390
00:30:53,361 --> 00:30:54,362
Dom?

391
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,738
Dom!

392
00:30:56,739 --> 00:30:59,784
Gayle!
-Dom, wake up. Mate, mate, it's OK.

393
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:02,578
It's OK. Get up, mate.

394
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:05,122
You, two...

395
00:31:05,206 --> 00:31:06,248
Wake up!

396
00:31:06,957 --> 00:31:07,792
Where's Phil?

397
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,251
Where the fuck's...

398
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,225
Phil?

399
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:28,562
Fuck!

400
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:31,357
Phil!

401
00:31:31,941 --> 00:31:33,234
Phil, what are you doing?

402
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,404
Phil, what are you doing?

403
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:38,531
It's OK.

404
00:31:40,574 --> 00:31:41,492
It's OK.

405
00:31:42,118 --> 00:31:43,077
Mate, get up. OK?

406
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:46,872
What is this I don't know, mate.

407
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:54,380
Get up, OK?

408
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:15,192
Just grab everything. Just shove it in the bags. Let's go.

409
00:32:24,827 --> 00:32:26,287
Can we fucking hurry up, yeah?

410
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:28,706
I want to get out of here now!

411
00:32:45,514 --> 00:32:47,933
Oh, for fuck's sake.

412
00:32:48,392 --> 00:32:49,560
We shouldn't be here.

413
00:32:49,643 --> 00:32:50,728
It's a warning.

414
00:32:51,604 --> 00:32:52,730
We don't know that.

415
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:53,772
We do not know that.

416
00:32:53,856 --> 00:32:55,941
-It's a warning.
 Fuck!

417
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:01,906
Listen.

418
00:33:02,615 --> 00:33:05,409
Hutch, we just go out
the way we came in, OK?

419
00:33:05,493 --> 00:33:06,911
We go back north-east.

420
00:33:06,994 --> 00:33:08,704
It's a knee-jerk plan.

421
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:10,498
It's a bad plan...
 Mate.

422
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:12,166
Hey! Hey!

423
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:13,959
Is that a path?

424
00:33:14,043 --> 00:33:16,295
No, Dom. South-west is this way, mate.

425
00:33:16,378 --> 00:33:17,963
South-west can go fuck itself.

426
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:20,424
You said we would
get out of this forest yesterday.

427
00:33:20,508 --> 00:33:22,551
The storm slowed us down.
What do you want me to do?

428
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:26,222
So did the dead thing hanging in the trees
and the spooky fucking house!

429
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,601
-We don't even know where that goes.

430
00:33:30,935 --> 00:33:32,853
We could end up in Norway for all we know.

431
00:33:32,937 --> 00:33:33,854
Great!

432
00:33:34,188 --> 00:33:37,608
I'm sick of this off

433
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,861
A path means civilization.

434
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:44,823
Dom.

435
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,245
Marvelous.

436
00:34:22,152 --> 00:34:23,487
Are we gonna talk about it or not?

437
00:34:24,947 --> 00:34:27,700
-Because I'd really like to talk about it.
-I'd rather not, mate.

438
00:34:28,242 --> 00:34:29,326
You'd rather not.

439
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:32,580
I woke up stark bollock-naked
in front of that thing, praying to it.

440
00:34:32,663 --> 00:34:35,583
-I'd love if someone could explain that.
-It was a nightmare, Phil.

441
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:38,711
-You had what's known as a nightmare.
 Well, what happened to you?

442
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:41,630
We all did. We all had nightmares.

443
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:45,426
We got spooked
and we had bad dreams, alright?

444
00:34:45,509 --> 00:34:46,510
Yeah.

445
00:34:46,844 --> 00:34:48,971
-Leave it out, mate.
-No, hang on, mate.

446
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:51,390
You were screaming and shouting
at the top of your voice.

447
00:34:51,473 --> 00:34:52,891
You were shouting, "Gayle."

448
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:55,978
I said, leave it out, Luke.

449
00:34:56,353 --> 00:34:57,771
Something made me do that.

450
00:34:58,188 --> 00:35:00,608
-Press on.
-Bad dreams or not, I'd never do that.

451
00:35:00,691 --> 00:35:02,776
-Something was there--
 For fuck's sake!

452
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,778
Listen to yourself, mate.

453
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:08,616
I'm a bit fucking humiliated
about being found in my kegs

454
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:09,992
covered in piss, alright?

455
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:13,495
I don't really wanna psychoanalyze it.
I don't wanna play fucking make-believe.

456
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:17,249
Because right now,
we have some real fucking problems,

457
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:20,294
like finding out which way
this fucking path ends up.

458
00:35:20,711 --> 00:35:22,963
Enough of the bullshit ghost stories, OK?

459
00:35:23,047 --> 00:35:24,965
You're starting to sound
like my daughters.

460
00:35:28,135 --> 00:35:30,095
Outside, I'd never have done that, mate.

461
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,308
Something's not right here.

462
00:35:45,736 --> 00:35:47,613
-Yes.

463
00:35:47,696 --> 00:35:49,740
-That ridge up there.

464
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:52,117
What, towards the light?

465
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:54,411
Yeah.
We're just tracking along it.

466
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,666
Five more minutes on this path
and I'm pulling rank.

467
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:03,629
You see these things?

468
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,464
Manmade.

469
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,257
We're getting somewhere.

470
00:36:22,064 --> 00:36:23,524
Should we have a look Absolutely not.

471
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,362
Let's keep going.
 Yeah.

472
00:36:28,862 --> 00:36:30,489
We can still get out of here today.

473
00:36:33,701 --> 00:36:34,743
Dom...

474
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,997
Dom,
maybe we should think about this.

475
00:36:40,124 --> 00:36:41,083
Dom?

476
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:43,168
Dom.

477
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:04,523
Guys,

478
00:37:05,274 --> 00:37:06,400
I just need a minute.

479
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:09,820
My knee is killing me.

480
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:13,574
These are the wrong fucking shoes.

481
00:37:16,744 --> 00:37:17,619
Dom,

482
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,998
you might have to push
through the pain barrier a bit, mate.

483
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:23,792
We can't keep going at this pace.

484
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,586
Screw you.

485
00:37:25,669 --> 00:37:28,130
I'm through the pain barrier.
I'm in bloody agony.

486
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:30,966
No, I think you're uncomfortable.
There's a difference.

487
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:33,594
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you were a doctor.

488
00:37:33,677 --> 00:37:35,804
Why don't you give yourself
a fucking prostate exam

489
00:37:35,888 --> 00:37:37,389
and leave me in peace, yeah?

490
00:37:37,473 --> 00:37:39,141
Dom, come on. Get up.

491
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:41,977
No.

492
00:37:42,644 --> 00:37:46,440
Dom, I want out of these woods now.
Please get up.

493
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,693
This is fucking ridiculous.

494
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:53,447
I'm gonna go to the top of that ridge
and see if I can see anything.

495
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,157
Yeah. Good idea, man.

496
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:57,618
-To the ridge, straight back.
 Got it.

497
00:37:58,035 --> 00:37:59,536
-Don't go too far.
 Got it!

498
00:39:01,098 --> 00:39:02,474
Fuck!

499
00:39:49,313 --> 00:39:50,230
Guys!

500
00:39:51,231 --> 00:39:53,400
-There's something there.

501
00:39:53,483 --> 00:39:56,111
What?
-There's something up there in the woods.

502
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:58,196
Like what?
-Something fucking big.

503
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,158
What, like an animal?

504
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:04,161
Can we all agree to not
start losing our fucking shit here?

505
00:40:04,244 --> 00:40:06,413
I'm telling you,
there is something up there.

506
00:40:06,496 --> 00:40:09,791
I'm not trying to fucking freak you out,
but I woke up last night...

507
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,793
and there was some fucking...

508
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:12,920
Look at this.

509
00:40:14,254 --> 00:40:15,088
What?

510
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:16,632
What the fuck is that?

511
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,843
Nothing has done that to you.

512
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:20,844
You...

513
00:40:21,845 --> 00:40:23,847
You were on your own.
You've done it to yourself.

514
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:26,433
-You were outside. You walked into a tree.

515
00:40:26,516 --> 00:40:28,810
Why do you have to fucking deny
everything I say?

516
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:32,230
Because I do not
value your judgement, Luke.

517
00:40:32,314 --> 00:40:36,818
-And I want to get the fuck out of here.
-We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

518
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:39,905
No, we wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

519
00:40:39,988 --> 00:40:41,031
Dom, shut up!

520
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:49,081
Come on. What do you mean by that?

521
00:40:53,627 --> 00:40:55,128
Track it back.

522
00:40:57,005 --> 00:40:58,590
You know what I'm talking about.

523
00:40:58,674 --> 00:41:01,093
No, I don't. I don't, no.

524
00:41:01,176 --> 00:41:02,469
Why don't you just...

525
00:41:03,053 --> 00:41:04,179
fucking come out and say it?

526
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,473
Oh, come on, guys. This is bullshit!

527
00:41:06,556 --> 00:41:08,850
-Come on, mate.
-Now, there it is.

528
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:11,436
Now he's got some
fucking fight in him, yeah?

529
00:41:12,729 --> 00:41:14,189
Where was that with Rob?

530
00:41:15,565 --> 00:41:16,692
You'll fight your friends.

531
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:19,236
-You can't stand up for them.
-You're not my friend anymore.

532
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:21,405
-You're not my fucking friend.
 No, I'm not.

533
00:41:21,488 --> 00:41:23,657
-No, you're fucking not.
 For fuck's sake.

534
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,617
No, you are fucking not. OK?

535
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:27,661
Do you know what?
I am fucking done with you.

536
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:32,374
Not a drop of blood on you.

537
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:34,543
Fucking coward.

538
00:41:36,586 --> 00:41:38,922
-Dom, you shut the fuck up.

539
00:41:39,006 --> 00:41:41,675
No, hang on, Hutch, mate.
No, hang on, hang on. What?

540
00:41:42,926 --> 00:41:43,969
Fucking what?

541
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,471
He has his skull cracked in half...

542
00:41:46,888 --> 00:41:50,142
and you come out of there
without a drop of blood on you.

543
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:52,811
What the fuck are you doing?
What was that?

544
00:41:52,894 --> 00:41:54,938
You alright, mate?
-He's broken my nose.

545
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,315
Shut up!
You've not broken your nose, alright?

546
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:59,693
Don't start your shit now.

547
00:41:59,776 --> 00:42:02,696
You keep quiet if you want,
but somebody's got to say something.

548
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:16,043
This is exactly the kind of situation
where people fall out,

549
00:42:16,126 --> 00:42:17,127
and we need to be...

550
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,547
Where are you going?
We need to be working together, man.

551
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:25,635
Luke. Fucking hell. Luke!

552
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,429
Luke.

553
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:29,890
Is that what you think?

554
00:42:30,223 --> 00:42:31,391
That it was my fault?

555
00:42:32,768 --> 00:42:34,102
That I should have stood up?

556
00:42:37,105 --> 00:42:38,356
I don't know.

557
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:25,278
Looks like someone was here.

558
00:43:26,822 --> 00:43:28,115
Are we stopping?

559
00:43:30,784 --> 00:43:32,244
What the fuck is that?

560
00:43:34,996 --> 00:43:36,665
Yeah, what is that, man?

561
00:43:36,873 --> 00:43:38,708
Some sort of fabric, I think.

562
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:49,427
I think it's a tent or something.

563
00:44:14,035 --> 00:44:15,078
It's a credit card.

564
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,539
Anna Eriksen, expires 1984.

565
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:19,958
That's a bad sign, isn't it?

566
00:44:20,876 --> 00:44:22,377
Just leaving your tent behind,

567
00:44:22,836 --> 00:44:24,045
and your shoes.

568
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:27,632
Guys.

569
00:44:28,592 --> 00:44:29,801
Guys, seriously, come on.

570
00:44:29,885 --> 00:44:32,387
We're not gonna
be these people, right, OK?

571
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,348
Because we registered at the lodge,

572
00:44:35,432 --> 00:44:40,228
and in five hours' time,
they are gonna report us missing.

573
00:44:40,312 --> 00:44:43,815
We're on a path in the woods.
It is near a hiking trail.

574
00:44:44,691 --> 00:44:46,902
This is where people get found, right?

575
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:50,363
It's getting dark again.

576
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:39,621
Oh... thanks. Thank you.

577
00:45:41,623 --> 00:45:42,832
How are you doing?

578
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:45,669
Well, I'm looking forward
to the rescue party.

579
00:45:54,427 --> 00:45:56,596
Dom's knee is getting worse, not better.

580
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,933
Phil's not looking great.

581
00:46:08,191 --> 00:46:11,444
You're the strongest.
You should try and get out, get help.

582
00:46:12,112 --> 00:46:13,613
I'll stay with these two.

583
00:46:15,323 --> 00:46:16,366
You think so?

584
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:19,119
Definitely.

585
00:46:21,621 --> 00:46:23,373
I'll get you fixed up in the morning.

586
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:26,042
-Take the compass, head south-west.
-OK.

587
00:46:26,501 --> 00:46:28,044
-Keep south-west.
-OK.

588
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,756
-Good man, mate.
 Yeah.

589
00:46:34,426 --> 00:46:35,927
How are we doing here, mate?

590
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:38,138
Let's have a look at this.

591
00:46:38,555 --> 00:46:40,974
Oh, looks nasty, man.

592
00:46:42,517 --> 00:46:45,020
It's not good.
 Have you put anything on it?

593
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:46,563
No, I haven't got anything.

594
00:46:46,896 --> 00:46:49,441
Maybe Dom's got something
in his backpack.

595
00:46:49,524 --> 00:46:51,776
Fucking shoes.
 That looks grim.

596
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:36,548
Coward.

597
00:49:01,197 --> 00:49:02,991
Phil!

598
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:04,951
-Phil, Phil, Phil!
 It was here.

599
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:13,585
-I don't know.

600
00:49:13,668 --> 00:49:15,920
Where's Hutch?
-All I saw was shadows.

601
00:49:16,004 --> 00:49:17,297
What?
-I don't know!

602
00:49:18,131 --> 00:49:20,383
-It just took him.
 Hutch!

603
00:49:20,466 --> 00:49:21,467
Hutch!

604
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:25,597
Get up! Hutch is gone.

605
00:49:25,847 --> 00:49:27,557
Hutch is gone!

606
00:49:37,066 --> 00:49:37,984
Oh, fuck.

607
00:49:41,237 --> 00:49:43,531
What are we gonna do?
 I don't know.

608
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,118
Hutch!

609
00:49:48,995 --> 00:49:50,205
Hutch!

610
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:53,625
-Hutch!
 Luke!

611
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:55,543
Hutch!

612
00:49:56,628 --> 00:49:57,670
Hutch!

613
00:49:58,922 --> 00:50:00,089
Luke!

614
00:50:00,173 --> 00:50:02,425
-We're getting turned around out here.
 Hutch!

615
00:50:02,508 --> 00:50:05,345
Maybe we should, like,
try and retrace our steps?

616
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:08,973
All we have is in the tents, Luke.
-He's fucking screaming.

617
00:50:09,057 --> 00:50:12,644
I know, but if we run around in circles,
we're gonna get fucking lost. OK?

618
00:50:12,727 --> 00:50:15,355
We need to get back to the camp.
We need to get our bearings. Yeah?

619
00:50:16,856 --> 00:50:17,982
Fuck.

620
00:50:18,066 --> 00:50:19,108
Fuck!

621
00:50:22,445 --> 00:50:24,489
We'll find the tents
and come back for him.

622
00:51:46,321 --> 00:51:47,447
Is that...

623
00:51:49,532 --> 00:51:50,533
Is that Hutch?

624
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:03,379
Oh, my God!

625
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:06,674
Oh, my God!

626
00:52:18,227 --> 00:52:19,520
Fuck.

627
00:52:21,773 --> 00:52:24,567
No.

628
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:27,153
I don't know.

629
00:52:27,236 --> 00:52:29,447
What about his kids?
 Listen, OK?

630
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:32,116
Just calm down.
We need to get out of here, now.

631
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,242
We need to move.

632
00:52:33,326 --> 00:52:37,080
We can't leave him here.

633
00:52:37,372 --> 00:52:39,457
When we get out,
we'll send people back to get him.

634
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,918
Fucking hell, we don't know where we are.

635
00:52:42,251 --> 00:52:43,795
It put him there, didn't it?

636
00:52:44,128 --> 00:52:45,129
What?

637
00:52:45,213 --> 00:52:47,965
It knew we were gonna come this way.
We were supposed to find him.

638
00:52:48,049 --> 00:52:49,675
Oh, for fuck's sake.

639
00:52:49,759 --> 00:52:51,803
You don't fucking do this.

640
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:55,306
-You keep your shit together!
 Shush.

641
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:57,100
He's right.

642
00:52:58,684 --> 00:53:00,353
I'm not leaving him like this.

643
00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:30,341
-We should say something.
 We need to go.

644
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:33,261
It's gonna come back.

645
00:53:36,264 --> 00:53:37,640
Dom, come on.

646
00:53:38,808 --> 00:53:39,892
Come on.

647
00:53:50,987 --> 00:53:52,530
It was at that house.

648
00:53:54,907 --> 00:53:57,577
We had those nightmares
and it followed us, didn't it?

649
00:53:58,453 --> 00:53:59,370
Yeah.

650
00:54:00,455 --> 00:54:03,124
It followed us from that house
and it did that to Hutch.

651
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,294
Did you actually see it yesterday?

652
00:54:06,586 --> 00:54:07,920
No, I don't know what I saw.

653
00:54:08,004 --> 00:54:08,880
Well,

654
00:54:09,464 --> 00:54:10,548
I did see it...

655
00:54:11,757 --> 00:54:14,302
while I was up on that ridge
and the trees were the same as this.

656
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:15,803
Jesus Christ.

657
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:18,014
It was big, OK.

658
00:54:18,097 --> 00:54:20,349
It had to be to put
that fucking elk in the tree.

659
00:54:20,433 --> 00:54:23,311
It was hunters. Pagan fucking hillbillies
from those houses.

660
00:54:23,394 --> 00:54:26,772
-No one's lived in those houses for years.
 Fucking hell.

661
00:54:26,856 --> 00:54:29,108
-Keep your voice down.
 There are houses here.

662
00:54:29,192 --> 00:54:32,111
There are people
and they killed our fucking friend.

663
00:54:32,195 --> 00:54:33,404
Shut the fuck up. Shut up.

664
00:54:34,489 --> 00:54:35,948
Keep your fucking voice down.

665
00:54:38,034 --> 00:54:39,494
There are three of us,

666
00:54:40,036 --> 00:54:41,245
and there is one of it.

667
00:54:42,038 --> 00:54:43,456
And I've got a fucking knife.

668
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:46,876
So, we're gonna keep going
in the direction that Hutch said

669
00:54:46,959 --> 00:54:49,795
until we get out of this fucking forest,
do you hear me?

670
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,605
Oh, my God.

671
00:56:38,404 --> 00:56:39,780
You see?

672
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,325
There are people.

673
00:56:43,951 --> 00:56:46,329
Are we following these?
 Of course not.

674
00:56:47,747 --> 00:56:49,081
We shouldn't go that way.

675
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:51,459
OK.

676
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:53,169
OK.

677
00:56:57,131 --> 00:56:58,507
South-west is up.

678
00:57:01,302 --> 00:57:02,595
I'm tired, man.

679
00:57:53,854 --> 00:57:54,855
It's OK.

680
00:57:57,358 --> 00:57:58,567
It's OK.

681
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,195
Come on, mate. Get up.

682
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:03,906
It got inside my head, man.

683
00:58:05,366 --> 00:58:07,368
It made me pray
to that thing in the house.

684
00:58:09,745 --> 00:58:11,455
I can't get it out my fucking head.

685
00:58:13,624 --> 00:58:14,583
Come on, mate. Get up.

686
00:58:15,835 --> 00:58:17,294
We're far away from that now.

687
00:58:19,046 --> 00:58:20,464
Come on, you can do it.

688
00:58:40,943 --> 00:58:42,862
Phil, look. Look.

689
00:58:45,406 --> 00:58:46,407
Phil.

690
00:58:55,124 --> 00:58:56,333
Where are you going?

691
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:14,560
We're close.

692
00:59:16,645 --> 00:59:19,023
Guys, I can see the end!

693
00:59:20,483 --> 00:59:21,901
I can see the end.

694
00:59:27,573 --> 00:59:28,574
Hutch was... Hutch was right.

695
00:59:52,014 --> 00:59:53,015
Guys?

696
00:59:54,475 --> 00:59:56,060
Guys, you've got to see this.

697
00:59:56,977 --> 00:59:57,853
Dom?

698
00:59:59,855 --> 01:00:00,815
Phil?

699
01:00:01,774 --> 01:00:02,983
What are you doing?

700
01:00:04,151 --> 01:00:06,487
We heard something.
 Phil.

701
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,908
You can't run.

702
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:32,156
Dom?

703
01:01:33,616 --> 01:01:34,450
Dom?

704
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,161
Phil?

705
01:02:02,728 --> 01:02:04,230
Shh...

706
01:02:04,939 --> 01:02:06,440
What the...?

707
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:10,486
Fuck, fuck.
You're alive, you're alive.

708
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:12,238
Where's Phil?

709
01:02:13,822 --> 01:02:15,741
I just heard something coming and it...

710
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:17,868
And it just took him.

711
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,498
What did it look like?
 I don't know.

712
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:24,541
It was fast.

713
01:02:27,294 --> 01:02:30,005
It's fucking hunting us.
 Jesus Christ.

714
01:02:30,297 --> 01:02:31,674
I thought I'd die.

715
01:02:31,757 --> 01:02:33,425
I don't wanna die.

716
01:02:33,509 --> 01:02:35,552
-I don't wanna die alone.
-Look at me.

717
01:02:36,011 --> 01:02:37,471
Look at me.

718
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:41,141
I am not going to leave you. OK?

719
01:02:42,393 --> 01:02:43,477
OK?

720
01:02:50,442 --> 01:02:52,736
-Yes.

721
01:02:53,279 --> 01:02:54,113
Yeah.

722
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:56,407
But I think I might have found a way out.

723
01:03:01,328 --> 01:03:02,788
Do you think you can move your leg?

724
01:03:04,498 --> 01:03:06,166
Yeah, a little.

725
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:07,668
OK. OK.

726
01:03:12,006 --> 01:03:13,048
Piggy back?

727
01:03:16,302 --> 01:03:18,429
-I'm afraid we're gonna have to run.
-Yeah.

728
01:03:18,512 --> 01:03:19,346
OK?
-I know.

729
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:20,514
Are you ready?

730
01:03:20,973 --> 01:03:22,975
In a minute. In a minute.

731
01:03:32,568 --> 01:03:33,694
Let's go on "three".

732
01:03:35,154 --> 01:03:36,155
OK?

733
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:38,782
One.

734
01:03:42,328 --> 01:03:43,287
Two.

735
01:03:45,664 --> 01:03:46,665
Three.

736
01:04:24,912 --> 01:04:26,538
His eyes... His eyes...

737
01:04:34,046 --> 01:04:35,214
There's a path.

738
01:04:39,426 --> 01:04:40,302
Oh, fuck.

739
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:43,514
We've got to go.
 Phil!

740
01:04:43,597 --> 01:04:45,265
No, we've got to go!
 Phil!

741
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:46,600
Dom! Come on.

742
01:04:46,934 --> 01:04:47,976
We've got to go!

743
01:04:55,734 --> 01:04:56,985
Hello?

744
01:04:57,069 --> 01:04:58,112
Please!

745
01:05:05,994 --> 01:05:08,038
Come on. Get up, get up!

746
01:05:54,626 --> 01:05:55,752
Luke.

747
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:01,800
Wake up.

748
01:06:03,969 --> 01:06:05,471
What the fuck?

749
01:06:14,605 --> 01:06:15,898
What is that?

750
01:06:16,398 --> 01:06:18,108
I don't know, mate. I don't fucking know.

751
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:36,210
What can you see?

752
01:06:37,252 --> 01:06:38,128
I see people.

753
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,758
-Two, three... four.
 What are they doing?

754
01:06:42,841 --> 01:06:44,259
It looks like they're...

755
01:06:44,718 --> 01:06:47,888
It looks like they're building,
putting something together.

756
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:49,181
What do they want?

757
01:06:52,267 --> 01:06:53,435
Those fuckers!

758
01:06:57,022 --> 01:06:58,398
I've got to get out of here.

759
01:07:03,278 --> 01:07:04,613
Can you reach the table?

760
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:08,659
Why?
 Break the glass, cut the ropes.

761
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,627
Go on. Go on, Luke.

762
01:07:19,253 --> 01:07:20,254
Yes.

763
01:07:20,671 --> 01:07:21,630
Go on, Luke.

764
01:07:30,347 --> 01:07:31,515
Fuck.

765
01:08:04,673 --> 01:08:05,757
Is that water?

766
01:08:05,841 --> 01:08:06,758
Water?

767
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:28,071
What are you doing?

768
01:08:29,615 --> 01:08:30,532
What are you doing?

769
01:08:41,126 --> 01:08:42,127
What?

770
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:56,475
Come on. No, give him some.

771
01:08:58,894 --> 01:09:00,604
No, give... Give him some.

772
01:09:02,064 --> 01:09:03,732
Oh, no! No!

773
01:09:09,613 --> 01:09:11,531
Luke! Help!

774
01:09:12,908 --> 01:09:14,034
Dom!

775
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:23,126
Dom!

776
01:09:26,338 --> 01:09:27,547
Dom! Dom!

777
01:09:39,059 --> 01:09:40,310
No!

778
01:09:40,602 --> 01:09:42,312
Oh, my God!
-Dom!

779
01:09:43,438 --> 01:09:45,899
Oh, God, no!

780
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:15,971
They prepare for sacrifice...

781
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:17,889
Over soon.

782
01:10:57,012 --> 01:10:58,138
Are you OK?

783
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,895
Dom?

784
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:10,901
Are you OK, mate?

785
01:11:15,071 --> 01:11:18,575
I never told you
about my nightmare.

786
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:22,537
I saw these people...

787
01:11:23,497 --> 01:11:25,290
offering me to that thing.

788
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:28,168
Its dead hands...

789
01:11:32,339 --> 01:11:33,465
gripping me.

790
01:11:37,469 --> 01:11:38,678
And I saw...

791
01:11:39,346 --> 01:11:40,263
Gayle.

792
01:11:42,933 --> 01:11:44,309
I saw my wife.

793
01:11:49,856 --> 01:11:51,066
I'm gonna die here, Luke.

794
01:11:51,691 --> 01:11:52,609
No.

795
01:11:52,943 --> 01:11:53,985
No, you're not.

796
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,196
I couldn't lose all of you.

797
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:58,323
They're gonna kill me. Do you understand?

798
01:11:58,406 --> 01:11:59,324
They are not...

799
01:11:59,407 --> 01:12:02,285
They're not gonna kill you because
I'm not gonna let them kill you, OK?

800
01:12:02,619 --> 01:12:03,912
Listen to me.

801
01:12:04,996 --> 01:12:06,581
You're gonna get out of here.

802
01:12:07,374 --> 01:12:08,583
And you're gonna...

803
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:13,463
burn this fucking place to the ground
behind you.

804
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:16,716
Do you understand?

805
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:19,594
You don't stop.

806
01:12:20,053 --> 01:12:21,179
You keep going.

807
01:12:22,305 --> 01:12:23,515
You live.

808
01:12:26,685 --> 01:12:28,562
And you tell my wife...

809
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:32,357
I tried to get back to her.

810
01:12:32,774 --> 01:12:35,986
I'm not gonna do that
because I don't need to do that. OK?

811
01:12:36,069 --> 01:12:37,195
Luke.

812
01:12:38,446 --> 01:12:40,991
I don't need to do that.

813
01:12:43,451 --> 01:12:45,161
OK?

814
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:52,896
Come on.

815
01:13:53,438 --> 01:13:54,564
Come on!

816
01:14:04,032 --> 01:14:05,325
What the hell is this?

817
01:14:21,591 --> 01:14:25,804
You fucking stupid pricks.

818
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,725
Why don't we do this, yeah?

819
01:14:31,685 --> 01:14:33,144
What are you waiting for?

820
01:14:48,118 --> 01:14:49,119
Come on.

821
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,205
What are you waiting for?

822
01:15:09,097 --> 01:15:09,973
Come on.

823
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:11,641
Fucking come on.

824
01:15:56,853 --> 01:15:57,937
Gayle?

825
01:16:00,982 --> 01:16:02,233
Gayle!

826
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:04,527
Dom?

827
01:16:04,611 --> 01:16:06,112
Come on.

828
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:10,158
<i>Gayle!</i>

829
01:16:11,743 --> 01:16:12,869
Gayle.

830
01:16:24,255 --> 01:16:25,423
Dom.

831
01:16:26,091 --> 01:16:27,217
Gayle?

832
01:17:53,344 --> 01:17:55,180
Did you take him down from the tree?

833
01:17:56,931 --> 01:17:58,558
We don't move the bodies.

834
01:17:59,517 --> 01:18:00,602
What is it?

835
01:18:01,561 --> 01:18:02,729
A god. Ancient.

836
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:06,858
One of the Jötunn.

837
01:18:10,778 --> 01:18:13,031
A bastard offspring of Loki.

838
01:18:13,656 --> 01:18:14,866
We do not say its name.

839
01:18:15,617 --> 01:18:17,035
Because you're afraid of it?

840
01:18:18,453 --> 01:18:19,579
We worship it.

841
01:18:20,121 --> 01:18:21,414
It keeps us here...

842
01:18:22,457 --> 01:18:24,250
lets us live beyond natural life.

843
01:18:25,418 --> 01:18:26,544
No more pain. No more death.

844
01:18:32,175 --> 01:18:33,885
Your ritual begins tonight.

845
01:18:35,136 --> 01:18:36,804
It is a privilege to worship.

846
01:18:38,348 --> 01:18:40,058
You will kneel before the god.

847
01:18:40,683 --> 01:18:41,684
If not,

848
01:18:42,393 --> 01:18:44,020
it will hang you from the trees.

849
01:18:48,775 --> 01:18:49,734
Why me?

850
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:54,197
Your pain is great.

851
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,406
Yeah, I'm not like you

852
01:18:55,865 --> 01:18:57,951
and I will not live like this.

853
01:19:00,078 --> 01:19:02,830
You will kneel before it,
like the rest of us.

854
01:23:44,487 --> 01:23:45,696
Fuck off.

855
01:23:50,451 --> 01:23:51,494
Shit.

856
01:23:54,247 --> 01:23:55,331
Fuck.

857
01:24:17,687 --> 01:24:18,646
Drop the axe.

858
01:24:20,982 --> 01:24:21,899
Stay there.

859
01:24:22,441 --> 01:24:24,986
Stay there.

860
01:27:04,729 --> 01:27:05,938
No, no.
