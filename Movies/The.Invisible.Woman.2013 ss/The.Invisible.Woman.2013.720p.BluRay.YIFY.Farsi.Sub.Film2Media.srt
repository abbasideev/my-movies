1
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,679
Our boys' curriculum is very wide.

2
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,119
They perform a short play
at the end of every term.

3
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,439
Theater's an abiding
interest of my wife.

4
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,599
- Ah, Mary, tea if you please.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,186
Through the open door.

6
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,679
Nelly, where were you?

7
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,639
Mr. Benham has been
here since 3:00.

8
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,759
I'm so sorry.

9
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,759
Mr. Lambourne has been
organizing the boys best he can.

10
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,585
I lost all sense of time.

11
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,119
Careful with those corners, boys.

12
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,024
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

13
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,799
Thank you, Mary.

14
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,159
Ah, Mrs. Wharton Robinson.
At last.

15
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,950
I'm so sorry, Mr. Benham.

16
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,747
I just kept walking. Forgive me.

17
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,039
Dear boys, let's go
from the third act.

18
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,599
Everyone get into positions.

19
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,709
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, Mr. Lambourne.

20
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,719
Mr. Benham must not see
all our tricks quite yet

21
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,639
or there'll be nothing left
to show him tomorrow.

22
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,879
It is cold outside?

23
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,228
It is, but it clears the mind.

24
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,999
It would be good to decide on the
readings before the end of term.

25
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,428
Of course. Perhaps later.

26
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,505
- Laurenson and Tanner, are you ready?
- Yes, ma'am.

27
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,021
Geoffrey dear,

28
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,799
don't forget, you come
in on the final line.

29
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,261
Sit there.

30
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,839
Coates, Watson, take those.

31
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,665
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you, ma'am.

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,959
I recall no lion in Mr. Dickens

33
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,479
and Mr. Collins' play,
Mrs. Wharton Robinson.

34
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,719
A little dramatic license.

35
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,988
I'm confident that Mr. Dickens
would have let it pass.

36
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,039
Yates, if you could
drop the backing.

37
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,341
Yes, ma'am.

38
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,541
Musicians.

39
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,679
- Is everyone ready?
- I think so.

40
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,709
Yes, ma'am.

41
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,910
Boys, remember your positions.

42
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,319
Let's begin.

43
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,759
Well, my lads, the day
is breaking at last.

44
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,586
"Has broken," Hadley. Mr. Dickens
was very particular.

45
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,106
Well, my lads, the day
has broken at last.

46
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,999
What do you say
to the weather now?

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,559
I am ready to cross the
mountain with the gentleman,

48
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,719
if the others will go with me.

49
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,500
I can see for myself
there's a storm coming.

50
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,439
I smell the snow. I feel
the hurricane in the air.

51
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,759
No money those gentlemen can offer

52
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,028
will tempt me to cross the
mountain with them today.

53
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,068
Tanner, your cue.

54
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,039
Well, are you ready at last?

55
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,399
My patience is at an end.

56
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,199
I'm sick and weary
of all this doubt and delay.

57
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,106
I'm your man. I will guide
you to your journey's end.

58
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,759
- Say when.
- Now.

59
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,759
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

60
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,061
Come along.

61
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,071
Pull it taut.

62
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,189
Upright like a brigadier.

63
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,119
And thread it through.

64
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,626
Thank you.

65
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,945
Were you on the beach again today?

66
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,026
Miss Brooke thought she saw you.

67
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,221
Yes.

68
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,229
- Look. See? It is signed.
- Really?

69
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,319
Apparently he modeled the character
of Lucie Manette on Nelly.

70
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,679
The families were very
close when Nelly was a child.

71
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,879
I'm sure he drew
inspiration from many people.

72
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,079
My wife adores his novels.

73
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,119
Of course, he's often very funny,
but I find a little bleak.

74
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,719
One wonders what demons
raged in his mind.

75
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,799
Indeed.

76
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,159
Thackeray, there's a writer.

77
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,519
George, you cannot compare them.

78
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,279
Oh, I agree. I am for Mr. Dickens.

79
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,679
There are times that I have
envied Mrs. Wharton Robinson

80
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,559
to have known him even as a child.

81
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,679
A writer.

82
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,279
Yes, at times bleak, but one who
makes us laugh at our own absurdity.

83
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,319
We see ourselves
clearly in all our folly.

84
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,879
He's been dead for some years,
but yes, he is still with us.

85
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,319
Thank you, Mr. Benham.

86
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,359
Oh, it is a subject in which I
sometimes run away with myself,

87
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,559
as Mrs. Wharton Robinson
knows only too well.

88
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,759
Run away. Run away.

89
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,879
I, for one, am determined
to revisit him immediately.

90
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,199
Where would you suggest I begin?

91
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,359
<i>Martin Chuzzlewit.</i>

92
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,239
Any novel, but for brief pleasure,

93
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,239
I would suggest browsing
through a copy of

94
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,199
Dickens' weekly literary magazine.

95
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,626
Oh.

96
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,879
<i>Household Words.</i>

97
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,399
A collection of many
of his writings,

98
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,702
and indeed,
chapters of his novels.

99
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,199
And I'm sure Mrs. Wharton Robinson

100
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,039
would not mind if
you cared to borrow.

101
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,119
Of course.

102
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,799
My wife has nearly every edition.

103
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,359
We have run out of shelves.

104
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,799
Sir.

105
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,829
Ah, good. Thank you, Mary.

106
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,350
<i>The Frozen Deep.</i>

107
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,399
You have the text
of Mr. Collins' play?

108
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,225
Yes. it is not a good play.

109
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,983
But I shall find you one.

110
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,279
<i>- David Copperfield.
- David Copperfield?</i>

111
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,628
- For our readings.
- Oh, yes.

112
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,879
Will you walk again tomorrow?

113
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,386
Perhaps.

114
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,559
May I join you?

115
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,100
I walk at quite a pace.

116
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,399
- Welcome. Welcome, Mrs. Ternan.
- Thank you, Charley.

117
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,679
Oh, dear.

118
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,982
Um, yes, do be careful now.

119
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,799
Oh, my!

120
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,759
- Oh, Miss Maria. Come inside.
- Thank you.

121
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,359
- Come inside.
- Thank you. Ooh!

122
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,741
Miss Ellen, welcome.

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,359
- Oh, your glove.
- Thank you.

124
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,479
I'm Charley Dickens.
Welcome to Manchester.

125
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,959
It's so wet.

126
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,239
My father is waiting.

127
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,304
The others are already here.

128
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,039
Nelly, look. See?

129
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,239
There we are.

130
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,985
Come on.

131
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,784
Look, Nelly.

132
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,999
- Father.
- Ah!

133
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,799
At last we have a full company.

134
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,159
Mrs. Ternan, welcome.

135
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,479
What a beautiful theater
you've built.

136
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,839
Thank you.
I'm glad, we have tried.

137
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,719
- Miss Maria, welcome.
- Thank you.

138
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,879
You had a good journey, I hope.

139
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,919
Yes, thank you, Mr. Dickens.

140
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,479
- Quite comfortable.
- Good. Good. Good.

141
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,511
- And you must be Miss Ellen Ternan?
- I am.

142
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,599
You've met my eldest son,
Charley, of course?

143
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,079
- He kindly rescued my glove, yes.
- Ah.

144
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,479
The gallant chevalier.

145
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,839
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I introduce Miss Ellen

146
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,959
who is helping us
in our hour of need.

147
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,799
We wish your sister, Fanny, well.

148
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,159
Is it the Haymarket or the Phoenix
Theater we've lost her to?

149
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,239
The Haymarket.

150
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,519
She's so sad not to be here.

151
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,239
No, Nelly will give you
a wonderful performance.

152
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,399
I have no doubt.

153
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,799
Now, Mrs. Ternan, Maria, you've met

154
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,639
everyone on our
previous rehearsals.

155
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,639
Miss Ellen, may I introduce
our family of actors?

156
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,959
- We have Mr. Lemon.
- Delighted.

157
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,079
- And Mr. Egg.
- Welcome.

158
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,279
- And our composer, Mr. Berger.
- Hello.

159
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,359
And Mr. Pigott.
Miss Sabine. Mr. Charles.

160
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,279
And I'd like to introduce our author,
Mr. Collins, but as ever, he is late.

161
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,199
But here are some
of my own family.

162
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,559
My daughters, Mamey, Katey.

163
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,599
My sister-in-law,
Miss Georgina Hogarth.

164
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,279
Assorted sons, Frank,
Alfred, Sydney, Henry.

165
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,159
And where is youngest boy?

166
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,919
Don't hide there, Plorn. Come here.

167
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,559
And that is it, I think.

168
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,067
Uh, yes, of course, and my wife.

169
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,279
And half an hour.

170
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,599
Is that time enough, ladies, for
you to settle your bonnets?

171
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,479
I'd like to rehearse,
but without our author,

172
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,239
Mr. Collins, who is at last here.

173
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,119
Why am I always waiting, Wilkie?

174
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,679
Why must you always be late?

175
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,799
Because it irritates you, Charles.

176
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,228
And it amuses me to
see you in bad temper.

177
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,079
Charles, I don't think
we can afford to cut it.

178
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,879
But it's too long.
It'll bore if it's too long.

179
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,159
It was too long in London, it'll
be too long in Manchester.

180
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,519
Though it pains, Wilkie.
Cut, cut, cut.

181
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,959
It is done.

182
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,039
You can tell Mr. Egg
he's lost his last soliloquy.

183
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,559
No, you must do it as author.
I shall not deny you that.

184
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,559
You are insufferable. And this?

185
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,079
And here and here.

186
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,319
Now, everyone, please be careful.

187
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,199
Our little theater's
not yet complete.

188
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,519
Remember, we are rehearsing Miss Ellen
in today, so let's be considerate.

189
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,279
Now I'm keen to review
the last act,

190
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,479
just the final entry
of Wardour and Aldersly.

191
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,039
So places, friends.

192
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,399
- Now, Maria. Maria.
- Yes.

193
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,639
We should have
you just here, I think.

194
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,999
Then Mrs. Ternan and the girls.
And Miss Ellen...

195
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,639
Mr. Dickens, may I suggest that the
ladies are slightly further upstage?

196
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,759
Yes. Of course.

197
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,319
Have your officers
trimmed to your satisfaction?

198
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,759
Yes, excellent, excellent.
Very good.

199
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,879
Um, do you think I ought to stand
a little wider for the entrance?

200
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,879
Yes, but not too much for
it's your face and not mine

201
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,399
that'll be holding the attention
of our audience, I feel sure.

202
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,519
Uh, Wilkie, are you ready?

203
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,079
I need you standing at the
back if I'm to carry you in.

204
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,223
- Are you ready?
- No.

205
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,679
- Yes, come on, come on.
- Yes, yes.

206
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,799
Charley. Just relax the arms.

207
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,839
Just a little less stiff.

208
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,999
- Yeah?
- Hmm.

209
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,301
That's good, yes.

210
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,199
Should you not come?
I cannot carry myself.

211
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,919
Yes, yes, of course.

212
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,359
Do I speak after the gun?

213
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,679
After the gun and you move
downstage to the middle.

214
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,919
Frank! Frank!

215
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,359
Then my line,
"Saved, saved for you."

216
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,399
- Then you've put me down here.
- Yes, I have.

217
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,864
And I am footsore and
weary, Clara, but I have saved him.

218
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,639
Yes. That's good.
Then your line, Wilkie.

219
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,599
Where is Wardour?
Help him. Never mind me.

220
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,959
Mark, that's when you come down.

221
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,399
Wardour. Dear Wardour.

222
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,559
Old friend whom I have wronged,
remember and forgive me.

223
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,839
Very good, you're forgiven.

224
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,759
Don't be afraid to project. We
have nearly a thousand seats.

225
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,869
Catherine, do say
if you cannot hear us.

226
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,199
- What?
- We can hear you very well, Charles.

227
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,919
Very good. Everyone speak up.

228
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,839
Then, Maria, that's when
you come over here

229
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,439
and take me gently in your arms.

230
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,639
- Here.
- Sorry.

231
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,159
Richard. Richard,
look upon your old playmate.

232
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,439
And then music...

233
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,559
No, Berger... Berger, not yet.

234
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,679
I'm just marking through the cues.

235
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,439
It plays until
the curtain has fallen

236
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,199
by which time we kiss, then gun.

237
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,990
Bang. Then I'm dead.

238
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,545
And then epilogue.

239
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,741
This is a tale of woe.
This is a tale of sorrow.

240
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,039
A love denied. A love restored
to live beyond tomorrow.

241
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,759
Lest we think silence is the
place to hide a heavy heart,

242
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,385
remember, to love and be loved is life
itself without which we are nought.

243
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,239
And then the curtain closes.
Loud applause.

244
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,862
Yet audible the crying of 2,000!

245
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,879
Thank you. Bravo. Bravo.

246
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,679
Ladies, gentlemen.
Thank you, Maria.

247
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,999
Charles, your last speech
I think could benefit from cutting.

248
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,759
- You do?
- I do.

249
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,999
Shall we discuss it?

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,745
Uh, yes, yeah. Later.

251
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,906
She has something.

252
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,305
Come nearer.

253
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,661
Clara.

254
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,871
Kiss me.

255
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,586
Sister, kiss me

256
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,864
- before I die.
- No.

257
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,261
William Thackeray!

258
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,519
No, no, no. it is not enough that
we play before these mere mortals.

259
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,399
Friends, it is Manchester who has
given us the highest accolade.

260
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,359
It is Manchester whose
approval I have looked for,

261
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,319
and it is Manchester who has
bestowed tonight's success.

262
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,079
Friends, we are victorious!

263
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,559
Sir Roger de Coverley,
Mr. Berger, please.

264
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,279
And again!

265
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,991
Strip the willow!

266
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,145
Back-to-back!

267
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,668
Gentlemen, change for
the <i>British Grenadiers.</i>

268
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,464
Raise your arms higher like a bird.

269
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,839
And then, when you are
ready, give me your hands.

270
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,199
It's remarkable.

271
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,740
Give me your hands.

272
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,066
There. Now you are safe with me.

273
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,429
One of his magic tricks.

274
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,024
Where are you?

275
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,825
I'm on my own.

276
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,359
You are an admirer of my
husband's work, Miss Ellen?

277
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,025
Of course.

278
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,599
At the moment,
I'm lost in <i>Little Dorrit.</i>

279
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,519
Until now, I thought <i>Bleak House</i>

280
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,119
would be the novel that would
stay with me the most.

281
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,439
It has this alarming spirit
of unease.

282
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,664
Lady Dedlock haunted by her past.

283
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,822
I keep coming back to those
pages again and again.

284
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,479
Yet there's so much
that makes me smile.

285
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,279
'Tis a fiction
designed to entertain.

286
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,663
Surely it's more than that.
It changes us.

287
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,439
Now you are, you are back with us.

288
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,102
He will be up all night.

289
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,119
And cross all day.

290
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,239
Katey. Mamey.

291
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,239
Now, someone else. Who is next?

292
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,666
Hmm?

293
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,426
- Who is next?
- Good night.

294
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,519
<i>Hold the baby.
Hold the baby. She's gone.</i>

295
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,719
Where is she? Where is she? Is she
safe? Please tell me she's safe.

296
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,990
And now you are back
with us, Mrs. Ternan.

297
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,068
- Back where?
- Mother.

298
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,319
Mother, I think you were
remembering Fanny on the boat.

299
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,839
Oh. What did I say?

300
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,347
- You were trying to save her, Mother.
- Oh.

301
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,279
I'm sorry, Mr. Dickens.

302
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,079
I think I may have strayed
into some family history.

303
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,381
Oh?

304
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,631
My eldest daughter, Fanny,
was, um, thrown from her cot.

305
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,023
My husband and I were traveling
around America some years ago,

306
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,828
and, um, our paddle steamer
was rammed by another boat,

307
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,999
and Fanny was thrown
up into the air

308
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,587
and saved, miraculously,
by a mattress.

309
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,679
The angels were watching.

310
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,425
- Yes.
- They were.

311
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,267
Extraordinary story.

312
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,079
I am done, Mr. Dickens.

313
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,079
As am I. I must go.

314
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,759
Tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow.

315
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,300
- Good night, Wilkie.
- Good night.

316
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,821
5:00.

317
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,788
- Bed.
- Or breakfast?

318
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,706
Good night.

319
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,079
Thank you, gentlemen.

320
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,319
- Good night.
- Good night.

321
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,719
Maria, you broke all our hearts tonight.

322
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,999
Everyone was weeping.

323
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,999
I couldn't hold back the tears.
You were so good.

324
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,319
I did try to console her
in a hushed aside,

325
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,479
but all she could say was,
"Oh, so sad, so sad."

326
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,519
Such a good,
dear, pale little face.

327
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,999
You won't find a better Clara.

328
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,159
Thank you, Mother.

329
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,319
I must get my angels to bed.

330
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,839
I'm too awake to sleep.

331
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,824
- It's daylight.
- Nelly.

332
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,669
Everyone needs sleep, Nelly dear.

333
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,388
This is my favorite time.

334
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,679
When the day is creeping up on us

335
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,599
and we must put in order
the chaos of the night.

336
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,824
Stand guard once more,
ready for life.

337
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,548
A wonderful fact to reflect
upon, that every human creature

338
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,348
is a profound secret
and mystery to every other.

339
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,269
Until that secret is
given to another to look after.

340
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,546
And then perhaps two human
creatures may know each other.

341
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,861
Do you not think?

342
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,701
Yeah.

343
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,541
Has Mrs. Dickens gone to bed?

344
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,639
Some time ago.

345
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,226
Mmm, yeah, well...

346
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,782
She has terrible headaches.

347
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,588
Sleep.

348
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,629
Why must you do that?

349
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,265
Do what, Nelly?

350
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,119
Flaunt my connection?

351
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,239
It is dull.

352
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,759
Dull?

353
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,919
To have known Dickens?

354
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,665
I was a child.

355
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,424
Yet to refer to him as bleak.

356
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,999
It is a misconception.

357
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,119
What?

358
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,719
I do not understand what
you are talking of, Nelly.

359
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,749
This constant agitation.

360
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,479
<i>"As we struggled on,
nearer and nearer to the sea</i>

361
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,079
<i>"from which this mighty wind
was blowing dead on shore,</i>

362
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,702
<i>"its force became more
and more terrific.</i>

363
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,559
<i>"When we came
within sight of the sea,</i>

364
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:48,359
<i>"the waves on the horizon, caught at
intervals above the rolling abyss,</i>

365
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,279
"were like glimpses of another
shore with towers and buildings.

366
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,279
"As the high watery walls
came rolling in,

367
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,981
"and at their highest
tumbled into surf,

368
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,550
"they looked as if the least
would engulf the town.

369
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:10,039
"As the receding wave swept
back with a hoarse roar,

370
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,559
"it seemed to scoop out
deep caves in the beach,

371
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,910
"as if its purpose were
to undermine the earth.

372
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,948
"Ham watched the sea,
standing alone,

373
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,399
"until there was
a great retiring wave.

374
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,039
"When, with a backward glance
at those who held the rope

375
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,709
"which was made fast around his
body, he dashed in after it.

376
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,999
"And, in a moment,
was buffeting with the water,

377
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,439
"rising with the hills, falling with
the valleys, lost beneath the foam,

378
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,223
"borne in towards the shore,
borne on towards the ship.

379
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,239
"At last Ham neared the wreck.

380
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,079
"He was so near that with one
more of his vigorous strokes,

381
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,839
"he would be clinging to it

382
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,759
"when a high, green,
vast hillside of water

383
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,439
"moving on shoreward
from beyond the ship,

384
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,907
"he seemed to leap up into it
with a mighty bound.

385
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,951
"And the ship was gone."

386
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,759
Truly, Mr. Dickens,
it is never so alive

387
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,599
as when it is spoken
by its author.

388
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,709
Thank you. Thank you.
Will you excuse me?

389
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,359
- Ah, Mrs. Ternan.
- Mr. Dickens.

390
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,959
It was remarkable.

391
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,319
Such control, such mastery
in your performance.

392
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,439
Thank you. I am told
these readings double sales.

393
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,199
It was quite brilliant,
Mr. Dickens.

394
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,039
- It was?
- Yes. Yes.

395
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,626
- Absolutely.
- Miss Fanny.

396
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,159
We've missed you.

397
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,508
Well, not enough, it would seem.

398
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,999
- Mrs. Dickens isn't here?
- Uh, no, not today.

399
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,621
- Oh, what a pity to have missed it.
- Mmm-hmm.

400
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,359
Oh, such a storm.

401
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,399
We were quite blown off course.

402
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,879
- So, it did not disappoint?
- No.

403
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,182
- Well...
- Well?

404
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,399
Nelly has read
every chapter twice.

405
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,719
I may have read
every chapter twice,

406
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,024
but I didn't really
hear it until now.

407
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,264
Hearing it spoken,
I felt I was in the storm.

408
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,306
I was there with Copperfield
seeing his friend drowned.

409
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,159
It was unbearable.

410
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,825
Yes, I...

411
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,999
I am glad.

412
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,159
Charles, do please come
and talk to these gentlemen.

413
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,079
I've been entertaining them
for several minutes now,

414
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,159
but ultimately I feel
I am a poor substitute.

415
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,839
Wilkie, I am coming.

416
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,359
Where are you playing next?

417
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,119
They're engaged to play
Doncaster for three weeks.

418
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,199
And what are you playing?

419
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,999
Uh, two tragedies and a farce.

420
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,199
Ah, a farce. What farce?

421
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,039
<i>The Pet of the Petticoats.</i>

422
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,719
<i>The Pet of the Petticoats?</i>
What a terrible title.

423
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,999
Yes.

424
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,187
Well, um...

425
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,061
But very good races, Doncaster.
Excuse me. Don't go away.

426
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,946
Catherine.

427
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,101
Yes?

428
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,065
Shall we sit together?

429
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,879
If you wish.

430
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,719
Well, no, if you'd
prefer not, I, um...

431
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,999
I did not sleep well last night.

432
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,559
Perhaps I will go to bed now.

433
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,703
Yes, of course, yes.

434
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,599
Wilkie has an idea for
<i>Household Words.</i>

435
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,199
A trip to the North.

436
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,079
He's calling it <i>A Lazy Tour
of Two Idle Apprentices.</i>

437
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,104
It might be a couple
of pages in it.

438
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,430
- Where will you start?
- Um...

439
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,919
- Doncaster, I think.
- Hmm.

440
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,959
Turn up the lamp.

441
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,831
You cannot write in this light.

442
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,559
She won! She won!

443
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,759
Nelly, victory.

444
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,159
Nelly, you've won!

445
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,839
- How much?
- 5 shillings.

446
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,079
5 shillings?

447
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,839
It was fixed. It was fixed.

448
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,039
I hope you're not
a bad sport, Mr. Collins.

449
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,319
- I am a very bad sport.
- Then you must win.

450
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,119
So, what will you do
with your winnings, Nelly?

451
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,039
I shall spend it all at once.

452
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,559
No, I may spend a half a shilling
on a copy of <i>Household Words</i>

453
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,999
just to be sure
the two apprentices

454
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,039
returned safely
from their lazy tour.

455
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,959
They did, though they did
not want to go home.

456
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,159
But what of their families?

457
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,199
Well, they missed them of course,

458
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,959
but they did so enjoy being away.

459
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,919
Charles Dickens.

460
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,959
Charles, you've been rumbled.

461
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,199
Mr. Dickens.

462
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,479
Hello. Good day. Yes. Thank you.

463
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,199
How very unexpected.

464
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,159
Thank you. Thank you.

465
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,270
Welcome to Yorkshire. Will
you write a book about us?

466
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,062
Mr. Dickens, great talking to you.

467
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,039
Miss Ellen.

468
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,830
- Mr. Dickens.
- Thank you.

469
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,359
- I've read all your stories.
- Thank you.

470
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,343
Through there, please.

471
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,025
- Watch it!
- Yes, ma'am.

472
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,199
Give me that, Maria dear.

473
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,239
Thank you, Mother.

474
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,542
Nearly there.

475
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,239
Oh, home.

476
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,719
Home.

477
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,624
That's yours.

478
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,781
- Does that need washing, do you think?
- I'll put it in.

479
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,079
This will not stretch
to another season.

480
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,439
I cannot mend another sleeve again.

481
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,439
The cuffs are still good.

482
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,980
And there's lace
on the collar I can save.

483
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,239
Yes, I'll unpick it.

484
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,269
Maria, also this hem.

485
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,984
Thank you. Look.

486
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,425
I'm collecting washing.

487
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,959
Here.

488
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,541
This signed?

489
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,307
- A souvenir.
- Where are my scissors?

490
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,580
They're in the drawer.

491
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,786
It's to be treasured.

492
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,510
Oh, Catherine.

493
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,144
Um, excuse me.

494
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,545
Why are you up so early?

495
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,022
- I must go to London.
- Now?

496
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,639
There will be no train.

497
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,079
Well, then I shall walk.

498
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,719
It will take you all day.

499
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,022
Then it will take me all day.

500
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,119
<i>So, here's perverseness.</i>

501
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,119
No, no, 'tis Charles only
whom you would prefer.

502
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,759
'Tis evident his vices and
follies have won your heart.

503
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,199
I have obeyed you, both in neither
seeing nor corresponding with him.

504
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,079
Yet I cannot think it culpable if,

505
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,479
though my understanding
severely condemns his vices,

506
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,421
my heart professes some...

507
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,639
Suggests some pity
for his distresses.

508
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,959
Egad, we'll have the
wedding tomorrow morning.

509
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,719
Thank you, dear uncle.

510
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,799
What, you rogue, don't you ask
the girl's consent first?

511
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,519
I have done that a long time...

512
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,999
- A minute ago and she looked...
- Be hard to believe she was so bad.

513
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,839
- Yes.
- For shame, Charles.

514
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,839
I protest, Sir Peter.
There has not been a word.

515
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,759
Because we can't hear a word!

516
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,184
Well, then the fewer the better.

517
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,519
May your love for each other
never know abatement.

518
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,839
And may you live
as happily together

519
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,839
as Lady Teazle and I intend to do.

520
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,679
That was very good, Nelly.

521
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,839
Really, Mother?

522
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,279
There is such clarity
in your performance, Nelly.

523
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,079
Oh, thank you, Fanny.

524
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,039
- You looked so beautiful.
- Thank you, Maria.

525
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,239
Mr. Dickens, why didn't you
tell us you were coming?

526
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,679
A last minute impulse.

527
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,559
- Mr. Dickens.
- My dear Buckstone.

528
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,319
Always a pleasure to have
you grace our theater.

529
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,679
Thank you. A memorable night.

530
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,599
Miss Ellen,
you were simply splendid.

531
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,559
Oh, thank you, Mr. Arnott.
As were you.

532
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,719
And how is the writing,
Mr. Dickens?

533
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,399
My writing is ferocious.

534
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,959
I'm up at 7:00, cold bath before
breakfast, then I blaze away until 3:00.

535
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,989
I fight not to be distracted.

536
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,345
Won't you sit?

537
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,759
No, I don't think.

538
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,039
It's very late. You must
be tired, Mr. Dickens.

539
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,199
There's so much to do, I don't
know whether my head is on or off.

540
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,879
Nelly, you must come
and meet my very good friends.

541
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,501
Thank you. Yes, Mr. Arnott,
I'd be delighted to.

542
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,719
- This is Ambrose.
- Hello.

543
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,261
- She is much in demand.
- Mmm, indeed.

544
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,399
Come through. Come through.

545
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,239
Thank you, Mrs. Ternan.

546
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,399
- Fanny, Maria, we need to feed our guest.
- Yes, Mother.

547
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,159
Please do not trouble
yourself, Mrs. Ternan.

548
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,359
There is some meat in the larder.

549
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,399
And some fruit. And bread.

550
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,704
Nelly, would you bring a
drink for Mr. Dickens?

551
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,347
This is enchanting.

552
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,861
Ah, I see you have
Mr. Keene as the Moor.

553
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,719
I played his Desdemona. May I
take your coat, Mr. Dickens?

554
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,759
I know. Thank you, Mrs. Ternan.

555
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,079
And my husband was Iago.

556
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,748
Indeed. "Farewell
the tranquil mind."

557
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,479
- Thank you.
- Uh, would you sit?

558
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,839
It is the only chair in
the house that doesn't sag

559
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,439
should you shift
in search of comfort.

560
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,981
Well, I am warned. Thank you.

561
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,439
We have ham and plums.

562
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,279
And some bread and some cheese.

563
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,519
This is charming.

564
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,359
And Wine.

565
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,119
Then I shall never leave.

566
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,639
- Oh, watch the...
- Sorry.

567
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,039
And I didn't know how
I could get rid of him.

568
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,359
And then what did you say?

569
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,639
Well, what I should have said was,

570
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,959
"Mr. Andersen, though your
<i>Ugly Duckling</i> has delighted,

571
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,799
"you've slept in this room for five
weeks now and you must go home."

572
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,679
- But you did not.
- I did not.

573
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,759
Why didn't you?

574
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,199
He doesn't understand English.

575
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,639
He only speaks Danish, and I'm
not sure he understands Danish.

576
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,959
I was tempted to learn his
language so I could say to him,

577
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,879
"May you never outstay your
welcome so long again."

578
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,839
And now it seems that
I have done the same.

579
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,999
No, never.

580
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,159
I will thank you, ladies,
for a pleasurable night.

581
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,239
Life is nothing
without good company.

582
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,668
Congratulations, Nelly,
on your performance.

583
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,665
Thank you.

584
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,319
Good night, ladies.
Ladies, good night.

585
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,190
- Good night.
- Good night.

586
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,559
This is a very pretty cottage.

587
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,147
Thank you. If a little small.

588
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,679
The rewards of our profession
are rarely monetary.

589
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,159
But I would have it no other way.

590
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,519
No one is entirely
useless in this world

591
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,679
if they may lighten the burden.

592
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,187
I didn't know he was
going to be there.

593
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,426
My daughters are fine young women.

594
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,428
Sometimes, I'm anxious
for their future.

595
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,039
I understand.

596
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,820
If I may be of assistance
in any way?

597
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,988
I cannot risk Nelly's reputation.

598
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,021
I hope that nothing I could
offer would compromise her.

599
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,879
Good night, Mrs. Ternan.

600
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,864
Good night, Mr. Dickens.

601
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,679
Good night, ladies.

602
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,061
Good night.

603
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,985
Come on out.

604
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,784
Shilling a blow, sir?
Shilling a blow?

605
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,827
I shall give you 5 if you
go home safely tonight.

606
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,559
I can play house, sir.

607
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,191
Want me as your wife, sir?

608
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,919
Where is your mother?

609
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,106
<i>Last night, I sat next to
a gentleman at dinner,</i>

610
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,639
<i>and he asked me in some fury</i>

611
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:13,390
<i>why it was that our city should help
those who do not help themselves.</i>

612
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,959
<i>By "those" he meant
the many fallen women</i>

613
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,069
<i>that we see around us every day,</i>

614
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,984
<i>and their offspring, many who
rely on this hospital today.</i>

615
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,839
<i>I replied,</i>

616
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,839
<i>"The two grim nurses,
poverty and sickness,</i>

617
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,199
<i>"bring these children before you
and preside over their births,</i>

618
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,319
<i>"rock their wretched cradles,</i>

619
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,359
<i>"nail down their little coffins,</i>

620
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,391
<i>"pile up the earth
above their graves.</i>

621
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,479
"Their unnatural deaths
form one third

622
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,465
"of the annual deaths
in this great town."

623
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,188
"But what of God?"
he piously replied.

624
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,023
"What Of him?" I said.

625
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,319
"I feel sure God looks
leniently on all vice

626
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:09,706
"that proceeds from human
tenderness and natural passion."

627
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,759
I hope we will, too,
and give generously tonight.

628
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,061
Thank you.

629
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,342
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Good night, sir.

630
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,070
Thank you, ma'am.

631
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,945
- Good night.
- Thank you, My Lord.

632
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,468
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

633
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,479
- Good night.
- Thank you.

634
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,590
Oh, I'm sure you can do
better than that, sir.

635
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,079
Maria. Fanny. Nelly.
Have we fleeced them?

636
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,319
With every ounce
of our souls, Mr. Dickens.

637
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,399
Thank you. Thank you.

638
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,119
I did not believe we would
raise so much money.

639
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,279
Where does one begin?

640
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,799
They'll take some counting.

641
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,999
Yes. Yes.

642
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,119
Such an achievement.

643
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,239
We must celebrate.

644
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,799
Yes! We must!

645
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,359
We shall.

646
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,399
Here we are. Please,
Mrs. Ternan, come through.

647
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,479
Are you moving
in or out, Mr. Dickens?

648
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,399
I'm thinking of letting it.

649
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,799
My wife prefers to live
outside of the public glare.

650
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,999
London tires her

651
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,319
and Gad's Hill is where she likes
to retreat with the children.

652
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,079
Gad's Hill near Rochester?

653
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,759
Indeed, very close.
Walking distance.

654
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,959
Nelly was born in Rochester.

655
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,999
Ah, I was schooled in Chatham.

656
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,519
But my earliest memories
are of Newcastle.

657
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,959
Newcastle I do not know so well.

658
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,599
Please, sit down.
Make yourselves at home.

659
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,879
We have champagne.

660
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,228
Thank you, John.
Please, on the piano.

661
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,799
Now did you ever see
Mr. Keene's <i>Corsican Brothers?</i>

662
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,310
Interesting. I saw that melodrama
many, many years ago...

663
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,839
Nelly.

664
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,759
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mr. Dickens. We must leave you.

665
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,239
Fanny has an audition in the
morning and must rest her voice.

666
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,439
But, of course, of course.

667
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,879
Uh, we have a wager, Mr. Dickens,

668
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,679
on how much we collected tonight.

669
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,279
I think 400 pounds,
but Fanny thinks more.

670
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,559
Then I shall count it right away.

671
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,719
It must be banked tomorrow.

672
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,199
You'll be up all night.

673
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,559
Well, I don't sleep well anyway.

674
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,839
Why don't we help you?

675
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,199
Together it will take us no time.

676
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,799
- We have a rehearsal in the morning.
- No.

677
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,439
I could stay and help,
Mr. Dickens, with Nelly.

678
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,868
- If you have no objection.
- No, I...

679
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,427
Well, yes, thank you. Thank you.

680
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,839
Well, then, I shall
walk home with Fanny.

681
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,919
- Very well.
- Thank you, Mr. Dickens.

682
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,879
Thank you. Good night,
Maria. Good night, Fanny.

683
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,625
We shan't be long.

684
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,079
507 pounds,

685
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,748
six shillings and thruppence.

686
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,026
- We are rich.
- Yes.

687
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,062
And they will be delighted

688
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,229
until the next time.

689
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,023
Do you like this life?

690
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,864
Constantly on show.

691
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,399
Constantly watched.

692
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,102
Well, it is not always
of my own making, but...

693
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,182
I do not think I would.

694
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,119
Well, I have my work.

695
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,639
It is a great foil.

696
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,628
They try, but they cannot
always find you there.

697
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,599
"They"?

698
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,479
Mmm, the hawkers,

699
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,319
the men who need to make money
who look to trip you up.

700
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,559
And then there are the admirers.

701
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:50,999
Those who wish you to be more
than you can possibly be.

702
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,631
And what is that?

703
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,141
Good, I suppose.

704
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,387
My father was sent to a
debtor's prison when I was 12.

705
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,879
I worked in a blacking factory
thereafter,

706
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,660
sealing bottles
and sticking labels.

707
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,984
It was hateful.

708
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,541
- Were you fond of your father?
- Well...

709
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,559
He was my first audience.

710
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,022
I honed my comic lines on him.

711
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,079
Mmm...

712
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,239
I've told you too much.

713
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,384
You're too good at this.
You, now, you.

714
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,559
My father was an actor.

715
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,719
The son of a Dublin grocer.
Also in debt. Also dead.

716
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,351
When I was seven.

717
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,544
In an asylum.

718
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,585
I had a brother.

719
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,343
He died at 10 months.

720
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,342
Though how a boy would have
fit with three girls.

721
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,504
She is devoted to us.

722
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,464
Our life is unpredictable.

723
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,705
You are...

724
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,746
What?

725
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,909
You are so free.

726
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,079
She will sleep all night
if we leave her.

727
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,759
I will ask John to bring
the carriage around.

728
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,061
Nelly?

729
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,306
Nelly?

730
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,780
Tell me a secret.

731
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,959
What kind of secret?

732
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,319
Anything.

733
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,239
Something that
you've never told anyone

734
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,588
or perhaps never even
thought of telling.

735
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,307
My middle name is Lawless.

736
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,187
Now your turn.

737
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,266
Hmm.

738
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,509
Ellen Lawless Ternan.

739
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,628
That is my secret.

740
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,543
She's barely 18.

741
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,950
I've never had to concern
myself about you and Maria.

742
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,919
There's always a tour for you
and your younger sister.

743
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,879
Mr. Buckstone's already enquired

744
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,467
if Maria is free for pantomime.

745
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,185
But Nelly...

746
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,191
Nelly is different.

747
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,069
Her talent lies elsewhere.

748
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,710
I love her.

749
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,383
I love her dearly.

750
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:55,066
Charles Dickens is not merely some
opportunist, some adventurer.

751
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,063
I am thinking about what
this life can offer her.

752
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,079
I'm thinking about her future.

753
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,984
What future would that be, Mother?

754
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,199
Our profession is hard enough,
even if you have talent.

755
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,319
Go away, Fanny.

756
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,668
I will stay out here
all day if I have to.

757
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,986
Nelly.

758
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,599
- Did no one think of telling me?
- Nelly.

759
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,119
You are the truest person
I know in life,

760
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,865
but you are not an actress.

761
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,079
And what other arrangements have
been made which I do not know about?

762
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,348
It's only because we care so.

763
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,679
Do you love him?

764
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,799
He is married.

765
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,468
That has not stopped him
falling in love with you.

766
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,159
We discussed <i>Hard Times,</i>

767
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,464
but it just doesn't
feel quite right.

768
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,279
I don't know. They're quite lost.

769
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,839
So I thought <i>Great Expectations</i>

770
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,279
might be a choice
for our readings.

771
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,679
<i>David Copperfield</i> is,
of course, a contender,

772
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,508
but for me, <i>Great Expectations</i>
wins out in the end.

773
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,345
Do you agree?

774
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,990
'Tis a fine novel.

775
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,190
Mrs. Wharton Robinson,

776
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:02,305
I see you are soulful, distracted.

777
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,119
There is some...

778
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,626
As if...

779
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,347
...a part of you is absent.

780
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,079
I do not wish to intrude.

781
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,428
You talk, I am sure,
to your husband.

782
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,399
No.

783
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,668
Not all wives do.

784
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,279
To confide in the person
you love the most,

785
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,519
well, sometimes that is hard.

786
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,549
George is a good man.

787
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,079
- A very good man.
- Of course.

788
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,269
But you are troubled.

789
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,549
Comes and then it goes.

790
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,709
But it returns.

791
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,119
I wish to help you.

792
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,839
I hope I can be someone
you can trust.

793
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,950
- Really, I'm quite well.
- You are not.

794
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,789
Please, Mr. Benham.

795
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,470
I will listen without judgment.

796
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,623
I am always here.

797
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,759
Come on, boys.

798
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,799
Come on, Plorn.

799
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,599
The whole point of the third
leg is to give you more speed.

800
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,119
Oh!

801
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,945
Useless boy.

802
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,783
It's time to get you undone.

803
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,319
What's happened here?

804
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,759
Do you have enough to eat?

805
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,505
- Thank you, Mr. Dickens.
- Good.

806
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,627
More gossip in <i>The London Diary?</i>

807
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,959
You could not keep it
quiet forever, Charles.

808
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,519
No matter. You must deny it.

809
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,982
Rumors can always be denied.

810
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,839
Do not worry, it will pass.

811
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,222
And then you must stop this.

812
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,631
What if I do not want to?

813
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,479
Don't be foolish.

814
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,191
You cannot keep her a secret.

815
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,310
Yes, I can.

816
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,879
Plorn! We'll do a hopping race.

817
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,959
Mamey. Katey. Come on. Come on.

818
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,519
One leg. Come on, are you ready?

819
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,719
Come here, come here, come here.

820
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,919
Come on. Quickly, come on,
Plorn. You're so slow.

821
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,079
And ready, steady, go!

822
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:48,101
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

823
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,500
Ladies, can I interest
you in some of this?

824
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,039
- Close your eyes.
- Don't turn around, Nelly.

825
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,626
Don't turn around.

826
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,505
Close your eyes.

827
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,199
Keep them closed until I say...

828
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,344
Open your eyes! Happy birthday.

829
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,430
Happy birthday.

830
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,959
That's lovely. Oh, look.

831
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,388
Ma'am, there's a Mrs. Dickens
to see Miss Ellen.

832
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,387
Mother.

833
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,349
I shall cut the cake.

834
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,639
And he never went home again.

835
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,799
And that was the first
and last time.

836
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,262
Mr. Ambrose? Have you
ever took to the stage?

837
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,225
Mrs. Dickens.

838
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,702
I thought this was the right house.

839
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,066
Won't you sit?

840
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,839
Such attention to detail.

841
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,666
It's all just paste and glass.

842
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,907
You find us in disarray.

843
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,839
I'd heard that he'd found you
somewhere close on the square.

844
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,239
My mother and sister
are to go to Italy.

845
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,907
Fanny is to be a governess
to the Trollope family.

846
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,079
Really?

847
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:23,101
Mr. Dickens, um, kindly
made the introduction.

848
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,039
My husband's always
been very generous.

849
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,580
Mmm.

850
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,544
Happy birthday, Miss Ternan.

851
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,787
Won't you open it?

852
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,502
It is a gift from Charles.

853
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:06,221
It was mistakenly delivered to me.

854
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,390
The jewelers naturally believing.

855
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,390
Charles insisted that I delivered
it to its rightful recipient.

856
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,829
He is fond of you.

857
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,466
And you of him?

858
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,030
Silly question.

859
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,661
He is Mr. Charles Dickens.

860
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,479
In those early years together,

861
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,828
I could not fail to be impressed.

862
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,181
But you will find that you must
share him with his public.

863
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,702
They will be the constant.

864
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,559
And, in truth, you will
never absolutely know

865
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,430
which one he loves the most.

866
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,919
You.

867
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,665
Or them.

868
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,471
I do not believe he knows himself.

869
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,159
I'm interrupting your party.

870
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,839
I'm far too old for parties.

871
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,639
There's not a soul
under 20 in attendance.

872
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,466
Well, Charles will be here soon.

873
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,104
And he's nothing if not youthful.

874
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,399
Keep these for later.

875
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,941
Ah.

876
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,119
- Good evening.
- Happy birthday.

877
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,759
Are we too late? We're too late.

878
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,999
You've missed Maria's cake.

879
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,879
Oh, no! Say it's not so. We haven't
missed all the fun, have we?

880
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,999
We thought you might
provide the fun.

881
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,479
Well, then there's
only one thing for it.

882
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,959
We must whisk
the birthday girl away.

883
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,599
Yes.

884
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,901
Nelly.

885
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,509
Say you'll come.

886
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,111
Where are we going?

887
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,159
Come through. Come in, come in.

888
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,621
Caroline?

889
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,639
Nelly, follow me.

890
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,987
Caroline.

891
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,949
We have visitors.

892
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,665
Wilkie, why did you not say?

893
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,479
We are celebrating
a very special birthday.

894
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,319
Caroline, may I present
Miss Ellen Ternan?

895
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,479
It's her birthday today.

896
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,431
Happy birthday. I've
heard only good things.

897
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:23,861
Caroline!

898
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,719
A new painting.

899
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,239
It's unusual. It's quite slap-up.

900
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,719
Is The Butler about?

901
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,500
Yes, yes, she's about.
Ah, here she is.

902
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,559
Squeals. There she is.

903
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,839
Squeals. And she squeals.

904
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,869
May I take your wrap and gloves?

905
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,666
Thank you.
I prefer to keep them on.

906
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,903
Please.

907
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,879
What a lovely home.

908
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,119
Yes. Yes.

909
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,184
Wilkie found it.

910
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,231
Charles christened her "The
Butler" on their first meeting.

911
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,599
It is all a game with him.

912
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,550
She's very dear.

913
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,471
Does this offend you, Miss Ternan?

914
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,902
Wilkie despises marriage, and
as a widow, this suits me well.

915
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,583
We live very happily.

916
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,228
But you do disapprove, I see.

917
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,749
We have fallen in love with
men of standing, Miss Ternan.

918
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,959
I am not in love.

919
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,479
The giant's coming.

920
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,147
It is late. Really.

921
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,959
It is too, too late. I must leave.

922
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,989
Please excuse me, Miss Graves.

923
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,101
Charles, will you stay for dinner?

924
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,067
Nelly?

925
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,146
Mmm.

926
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,639
And still she is silent.

927
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:29,422
Mr. Buckstone has offered
me <i>The World and The Stage.</i>

928
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,628
It has a ridiculous plot.

929
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,519
A titled lady saved from debt
by her sister, an actress.

930
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,079
Yes, but a very
amusing final scene.

931
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,826
And it was you that
secured me the role.

932
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,399
Did you mean to deliberately
humiliate me tonight?

933
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,839
You did not like Miss Graves?

934
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,799
You cannot expect me
to associate with a woman

935
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,999
living so openly with a
man outside of marriage.

936
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,879
- Oh, Nelly... Nelly... Nelly!
- Entertaining guests as if she“.

937
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,990
I do not wish to appear ungrateful.

938
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,382
You have been generous.

939
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,504
Some might say too
generous to my family.

940
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,188
But I did not realize that
I was to be your whore.

941
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,980
Nelly.

942
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,439
Nelly.

943
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,039
Nelly, it was a mistake.

944
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:29,239
- Did you send Catherine to me?
- Yes.

945
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,999
She is the mother
of your children.

946
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,439
How could you be so cruel to her?

947
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,879
And for that,
I shall always be grateful,

948
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,399
but I do not love her.

949
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,719
She comprehends nothing.

950
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,679
She sees nothing.

951
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,119
I thought if she saw you,
then she would understand

952
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,785
that I have nothing with her.

953
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,959
- I wanted her to see it.
- "It"?

954
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,342
What is "it," Charles?

955
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,550
What is it that we are?

956
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:03,548
When your wife asked me
if I was fond of you,

957
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,861
I could not honestly reply.

958
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,304
I wanted to say no!

959
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,519
Can I be of assistance, sir?

960
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,279
Is this young lady
troubling you, sir?

961
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,599
Uh, thank you. She is not
troubling me at all. All is well.

962
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,709
Very good. Good night, sir.

963
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,839
Nelly?

964
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,630
Nelly.

965
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,104
May I come in?

966
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,946
Nelly.

967
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:08,159
I used to walk from
the Aldwych to Highgate,

968
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,799
then back to Westminster,
then on to Millbank.

969
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,319
You've London in your blood.

970
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,987
I do. I walk at quite a pace.

971
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,384
- Good day.
- Good day.

972
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,119
And I'd walk to Putney and...

973
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,742
- I've done that walk.
- Yes.

974
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,239
You don't believe me?

975
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,159
Father.

976
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,700
Charley.

977
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,305
What are you doing here?

978
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,359
I walk this way if I've
taken an earlier train.

979
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,239
You remember Miss Ellen?

980
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,359
Of course.

981
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,239
Charley, you look well.

982
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,039
I am quite well.
Thank you, Miss Ternan.

983
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,079
Charley is working in the city.

984
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,030
- How clever.
- Not really.

985
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,399
It's a friend of Father's.

986
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,719
I still have the glove
which you rescued for me.

987
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,319
I would have been most
unhappy to have lost it.

988
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,519
They're my favorite pair.

989
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,948
I am sure you would
have found another.

990
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,599
Well, I am already late...

991
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,186
Yes, yes.

992
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,425
Father.

993
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,541
Will we see you at home?

994
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,541
Yes.

995
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,541
Good day, Charley.

996
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,425
Charley.

997
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,559
What is it?

998
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,146
It's a letter in <i>The Times.</i>

999
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,905
It's from Father.

1000
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,224
I can't read it.

1001
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,949
Would you read it?

1002
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,950
Read it to me.

1003
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,479
"There is some domestic
trouble of mine,

1004
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,559
"longstanding,

1005
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,959

01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,919

1025
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,190
Thank you.

1026
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,743
He's an honorable man.

1027
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:53,599
And you, Nelly, are a beautiful...

1028
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,790
- Mother.
- ...clever, wonderful young woman.

1029
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,827
- But he cannot marry me.
- No.

1030
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,625
He cannot.

1031
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,951
But I have been married,

1032
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,025
and it is at times
the loneliest place.

1033
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,030
What do I do?

1034
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,661
Um...

1035
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:35,879
Fanny and I leave for Italy
at the end of the month.

1036
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,750
You could come with us.

1037
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,559
Um...

1038
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:42,784
I can arrange a passage.
It's easily done.

1039
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,999
He's burnt a lifetime's
correspondence, Nelly. Nelly, listen.

1040
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,679
He's even asked me to burn
all our correspondence.

1041
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,399
There is an insanity
to his behavior.

1042
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,999
No, he's not insane.
He's distraught.

1043
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,519
And I am not?

1044
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,679
You have a choice.

1045
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,399
You can distance
yourself from him.

1046
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,839
You could find a new life,
a different life.

1047
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,266
A different life?

1048
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,679
What different life?

1049
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,187
What life is there for me?

1050
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,423
He is a good man...

1051
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,670
Trying to be a good man.

1052
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,624
But he is a great man.

1053
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,189
You see him, Nelly.

1054
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,146
I watch you together.
You see him, he sees you.

1055
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,189
What more does one want in life?

1056
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,150
- Wilkie.
- I'm coming.

1057
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,279
We have to break
these conventions.

1058
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,389
Smash them up.

1059
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,919
We're the pioneers.

1060
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,585
Pioneers?

1061
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,919
You men,

1062
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,190
you live your lives while
it is we who have to wait.

1063
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,867
You see a freedom
which I do not see.

1064
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,746
Wilkie.

1065
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:02,030
The Butler will not sleep
if I don't read to her.

1066
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:36,703
My name is whispered with yours.

1067
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,799
Yet I have nothing.

1068
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,261
Nelly.

1069
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,679
- I have no regrets.
- Charles...

1070
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:48,586
I have broken something
which needed breaking.

1071
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,119
I have finished it.

1072
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,079
Yes, it is finished.

1073
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,906
No, no, no. The book.

1074
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,104
I have finished the book. Here.

1075
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,470
You do not like it?

1076
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,261
No.

1077
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,709
I like it.

1078
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,505
I like it very much.

1079
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,359
Wilkie thinks I should
change the ending.

1080
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,519
No, you must not.

1081
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,679
To bring Estella and Pip together
at the end but not to unite them.

1082
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,359
- She is changed. That is enough?
- Yes.

1083
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:56,359
It is a sad ending, but
Estella finds her heart.

1084
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,662
- She finds an understanding at last.
- Exactly.

1085
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,519
And at times...

1086
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,759
Pip is not heroic.

1087
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,319
He is filled with the vanities,

1088
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,159
the ambitions,
the flaws in all of us.

1089
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,719
Yes.

1090
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,719
I know what I have done,

1091
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:16,309
but to stay as it was,
I cannot when my heart...

1092
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,866
Nelly.

1093
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:33,239
In an earlier chapter, Pip said,

1094
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:37,670
"You are part of my
existence, part of myself."

1095
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,039
I remember.

1096
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:44,439
"You have been in every
line I have ever read.

1097
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,999
"You have been in every
prospect I have ever seen,

1098
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,199
"on the river,
on the sails of the ships,

1099
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:56,079
"on the marshes,
in the clouds, in the light,

1100
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,679
"in the darkness,
in the wind, in the woods,

1101
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,119
"in the sea, in the streets.

1102
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:07,439
"You have been the embodiment
of every graceful fancy

1103
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,222
"that my mind has ever
become acquainted with.

1104
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,431
"Estella.

1105
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,422
"To the last hour of my life,

1106
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,546
"you cannot choose but
remain part of my character.

1107
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,262
"Part of the little good in me.

1108
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,741
"Part of the evil."

1109
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,945
Let us go away.

1110
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:17,439
"'Now, touch my face with yours

1111
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,999
"'in case I should not hold
out till you come back.

1112
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,399
"'I love you, Mortimer."'

1113
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,559
"The discovery was hers.

1114
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,959
"'Observe, my dear Eugene,

1115
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,439
"'while I am away, you will know

1116
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,999
"'that I have discharged
my trust..."'

1117
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,559
<i>"'...so much, John dear,
and since you do,</i>

1118
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,519
<i>"'I am sorry that these shoes
are a full size too large.</i>

1119
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,505
<i>"'But I don't want a carriage,
believe me.</i>

1120
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:24,187
<i>I have agreed
to 50 more readings.</i>

1121
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,799
In Manchester, Glasgow and Dublin.

1122
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,199
And I've been asked to
give a reading in Paris.

1123
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,185
- Shall I come with you?
- Well...

1124
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,511
There are whisperings, Nelly.

1125
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,359
- Where?
- In Paris.

1126
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,345
And if they're in Paris, then
they will soon be in London.

1127
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,182
I've been out of circulation.

1128
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,039
Then you must go.

1129
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,866
Yes. It is what I am.

1130
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,199
No, I shall not go.

1131
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,559
- No, you shall.
- No, no, no.

1132
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:08,386
- My mind is made up. I shall not go.
- No, you will.

1133
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,279
Sorry, ma'am.
I didn't see you there.

1134
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,999
It is quite all right, Mary.

1135
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,745
I will do it.

1136
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,279
Is there anything else, ma'am?

1137
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:43,559
The guests will
be arriving shortly.

1138
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:46,545
That is everything.
Thank you, Mary.

1139
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,985
Mr. Tringham, I am sorry.

1140
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,986
Even when they are perfectly
developed at birth, it happens.

1141
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,787
I need a signature.

1142
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,151
It is necessary.

1143
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,039
Will he have a burial?

1144
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,342
Yes, of course.

1145
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:19,183
Certificate of Death

1146
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:24,785
Nelly, have you left
the keys on the table?

1147
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:31,222
I believe an English family wish
to take the house for the winter.

1148
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,187
Nelly?

1149
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,870
Say something.

1150
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,141
Say something!

1151
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,791
We shall miss our train.

1152
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:49,959
All passengers arrived from France.
This train for London.

1153
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:53,959
I think we're in the
last compartment here.

1154
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:55,079
It's Mr. Dickens.

1155
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,639
Thank you. We're in here, I think.

1156
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:57,759
Mr. Dickens, sir.

1157
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,519
My wife says she should marry
Rokesmith and be done.

1158
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,199
- Perhaps the next chapter.
- I'll tell her.

1159
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,990
That's for you.
Thank you very much.

1160
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:06,985
Thank you.

1161
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:01,626
Sleep, Nelly, and when you
wake, we shall be home.

1162
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:05,110
Gentlemen, please. Someone
open these carriages here.

1163
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:08,399
And your wife? Is anyone
else in this carriage?

1164
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,479
Excuse me.

1165
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,039
- Help!
- Over here!

1166
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,159
- Please, they are hurt.
- Help!

1167
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,679
Take the weight on your other leg.

1168
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,141
Sir?

1169
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:19,999
Sir?

1170
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,519
We're asking everyone able-bodied

1171
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,151
if they could help
with the most injured.

1172
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,987
We need all the hands we can get.

1173
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:29,911
Nelly.

1174
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,461
Nelly.

1175
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,546
Sir?

1176
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,199
Excuse me, sir.

1177
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,519
Could you come and assist me?

1178
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,982
- Is it Mr. Dickens, sir?
- Yes.

1179
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,679
Were you traveling alone, sir?

1180
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,141
Go.

1181
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,599
Mr. Dickens.

1182
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:53,039
- Were you traveling alone?
- Go.

1183
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,639
Go. Go.

1184
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:55,959
Sir?

1185
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,199
Yes, quite alone.

1186
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,879
This woman is in need
of assistance.

1187
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,199
We are dealing
with the most injured first.

1188
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,319
Yes, I'll do what I can, but you
must attend to this young woman.

1189
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,919
Madam, I will get one of
these ladies to attend to you.

1190
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:06,759
Ladies, please. This way, sir.

1191
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:08,519
- Yes, we're with her.
- Please, will you attend to her?

1192
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,599
- We're with her.
- I have brandy here.

1193
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:11,719
Uh...

1194
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:13,359
- Sir?
- Don't worry. Stay here.

1195
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,479
Check who's inside.

1196
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:15,861
Ah.

1197
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:21,342
Sir, press down as hard as
you can to stop the blood flow.

1198
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,119
Sir, this is brandy.

1199
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:26,866
We will find assistance
for you as soon as possible.

1200
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,719
Porter, we need to release
all passengers

1201
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:35,919
from the train above so they
may help with the injured.

1202
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:40,384
All able-bodied gentlemen,
bring their hats to this tree.

1203
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,265
Ellen Ternan?

1204
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,786
Yes.

1205
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,260
That was my name.

1206
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,465
You have always known this?

1207
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:54,105
Suspected.

1208
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,159
Things you said.

1209
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,621
Comments.

1210
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:03,547
Memories of Mr. Dickens that
were not a child's memories.

1211
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,984
I saw him read once.

1212
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,990
It was magical.

1213
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:19,426
One forgets that he was more
than writer, more than actor.

1214
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:26,187
I have lived my life in the
pages of those novels.

1215
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,839
I should not have
expected their author

1216
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,983
to have lived so quiet a life.

1217
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,710
<i>The house is to your liking?</i>

1218
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:13,666
Yes.

1219
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:17,625
I'm happy to see the castle
from the window.

1220
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,399
There's a fire in every room.

1221
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:22,399
And I've taken the liberty of employing
a nurse who will attend to you.

1222
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:25,749
She's a local woman
but of good kind.

1223
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,959
It's a sleepy market town
with a very fine butchers.

1224
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:35,106
And the church is newly
restored, which you must visit.

1225
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:40,639
The fast train from
Paddington takes 18 minutes.

1226
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:43,999
Or alternatively, there's a train to
Windsor from Victoria or Waterloo,

1227
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,382
which also serves well.

1228
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,341
Nelly?

1229
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,662
It's as if it's floating.

1230
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,262
You will come to see me?

1231
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,879
Yes. Of course.

1232
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:17,199
Weekly?

1233
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:19,119
Mmm, twice weekly. More.

1234
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:20,799
And if I should need anything?

1235
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,421
You need only ask.

1236
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27,119
And should I expect you
at weekends and holidays?

1237
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:31,186
- Yes, but my family...
- Of course.

1238
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,386
When you can.

1239
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:38,941
Yes.

1240
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,630
And shall we keep Tringham?

1241
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,621
Yes.

1242
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:50,820
Then this is how it is to be now.

1243
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,959
Whatever I have
tried to do in life,

1244
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,866
I have tried with all
my heart to do it well.

1245
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:04,359
Whatever I've
devoted myself to, I...

1246
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:05,946
Don't, Charles.

1247
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,029
Don't explain.

1248
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,823
There's nothing to say.

1249
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,863
Everyone has their secret.

1250
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:27,030
And this is ours.

1251
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,227
Yes.

1252
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:01,064
<i>I was not a child
when I met Mr. Dickens-</i>

1253
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:04,110
I was 18.

1254
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:08,919
It wasn't easy, our friendship.

1255
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:14,226
Yet there were days of such
joy, such celebration.

1256
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,624
And we'd talk and laugh together.

1257
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:27,541
He knew he'd leave me first.

1258
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:33,142
That he would die first.

1259
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:41,308
Charles understood
that however painful it is,

1260
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:46,265
we're alone.

1261
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:52,599
Whoever we're with,

1262
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:54,425
we are alone.

1263
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:58,990
He was right.

1264
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,623
<i>Great Expectations.</i>

1265
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:11,599
He wrote an ending. it was his
first instinctive ending.

1266
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,106
A good ending.

1267
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,785
Pip and Estella do not
come together.

1268
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:25,309
Pip sees that
she will never be his.

1269
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:29,839
Later they wanted him
to change it.

1270
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:32,479
Some people thought it too brutal.

1271
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,350
So instead...

1272
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,781
Pip's final words are...

1273
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:49,145
"I saw the shadow of
no parting from her."

1274
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,141
He ends the book in shadows.

1275
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,709
In uncertainty.

1276
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,344
In haunting.

1277
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:19,266
And that is where
I have been living.

1278
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,345
Do you see?

1279
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,146
Yes.

1280
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,668
I will not live there anymore.

1281
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,599
Nelly.

1282
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,079
You're late. It's nearly dark.

1283
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:45,319
Where have you been?

1284
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:46,860
George.

1285
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,705
I am here.

1286
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,870
I am here.

1287
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,199
Are you quite well?

1288
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:01,119
Yes, George.

1289
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:03,070
Are you sure?

1290
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:12,548
I walked with Mr. Benham today.

1291
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,399
We talked about Mr. Dickens.

1292
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,906
Yes.

1293
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,787
George...

1294
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:28,546
The memories of a child, Nelly.

1295
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,230
Geoffrey.

1296
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:37,944
Oh, Geoffrey.

1297
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,559
You will frighten our guests.

1298
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,319
I think he was trying
to frighten his mother.

1299
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,746
Geoffrey.

1300
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:49,260
- Go on, take your place.
- Yes, Mama.

1301
01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:59,261
Nelly.

1302
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:33,919
<i>Well, my lads,
the day has broken at last.</i>

1303
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:35,745
<i>What do you say
to the weather now?</i>

1304
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,359
I say the weather will do.

1305
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:39,599
I say doubtful.

1306
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:44,159
I can see for myself
there's a storm coming.

1307
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:48,079
I smell the snow. I can feel
the hurricane in the air.

1308
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:49,879
No money those gentlemen can offer

1309
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:52,228
will tempt me to cross the
mountain with them today.

1310
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,666
Well, are you ready at last

1311
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,919
to cross the mountain
with us or not?

1312
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:02,879
I say yes, if the others
will say yes, too.

1313
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,199
I say no!

1314
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:05,519
I am mountain boy.

1315
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:08,199
I know the pass up there
as I know my ABC.

1316
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:11,079
You know the mountain.
If you risk it, I will.

1317
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:14,279
I'm your man. I will guide
you to your journey's end.

1318
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:16,279
- Say when.
- Now!

1319
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:17,599
Are you ready?

1320
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,799
I am ready. Come along.

1321
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:25,039
This is a tale of woe.

1322
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,479
This is a tale of sorrow.

1323
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:29,959
A love denied, a love restored,

1324
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:32,439
to live beyond tomorrow.

1325
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:36,279
Lest we think silence is the
place to hide a heavy heart,

1326
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:40,679
remember, to love
and be loved is life itself

1327
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:43,267
without which we are nought.
