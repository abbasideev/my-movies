1
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:49,658
<i>What's your name?</i>

2
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:51,897
- Shelly Gardner.
- <i>Just need the first.</i>

3
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:53,140
Oh, sorry.

4
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:55,055
<i>How tall are you?</i>

5
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,710
- 5'7".
- <i>Age?</i>

6
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:03,106
Oh, a gentleman never
asks a lady her age.

7
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,455
36?

8
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,110
Sorry, I lied.

9
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:08,938
I'm 42.

10
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,635
But this house is huge.

11
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:12,855
I mean, distance helps.

12
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:15,466
- <i>Oh.</i>
- Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,641
I'm so nervous.

14
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:17,642
I've been on the Razzle-Dazzle

15
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:19,383
for so very long and...

16
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:23,518
I just haven't
auditioned in a while.

17
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:25,607
But it's exciting.

18
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:26,999
<i>Yeah.</i>

19
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:29,089
<i>You have an act prepared?</i>

20
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:32,396
I do. I'm a dancer.

21
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,181
<i>Music?</i>

22
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:35,530
Yeah.

23
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:37,488
I gave it to the maestro.

24
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,274
<i>Okay.</i>

25
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:41,753
Okay.

26
00:02:12,393 --> 00:02:14,525
Did someone raid a cemetery
for this fuckin' audience?

27
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,310
Oh, shh.

28
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,051
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!

29
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:20,444
- Go!
- Did that just rip?

30
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:22,577
- Shit.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

31
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:24,709
When did they install
that new door handle?

32
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:26,283
- Like, three months ago.
- Oh, God,

33
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:27,732
that thing is asking
for ripped costumes.

34
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:28,863
Are you sure? Is
it really ripped?

35
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:29,887
Yeah, it's ripped.

36
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,238
I have, like, 20/20 vision.

37
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:33,370
Good for fuckin' you, Jodie.

38
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,115
Okay. Yeah, bye.

39
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,638
That's good as wow!

40
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,736
I caught my wing on
that door handle!

41
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,627
It's a trap. They're
so desperate for money,

42
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:55,566
they're tryin' to squeeze
it back out of us.

43
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,177
Paranoid.

44
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:59,231
Oh, God, but you know,
they have to change that.

45
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:01,093
I mean, look at
this gaping hole.

46
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:02,878
Okay, let's keep
it movin', Shelly.

47
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:05,620
I will, I just... look at that.

48
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,317
Oh, gosh.

49
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,191
I mean, I love that darn wing.

50
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:13,802
You know, of all the
wings in the entire show,

51
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:15,238
that's the oldest wing.

52
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:17,675
- Ida is gonna kill me.
- Oh, whatever.

53
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:20,130
That old Russian bitch has
hated me for, like, nine years.

54
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:22,376
Because you keep losing
rhinestones and feathers.

55
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,510
Oh, I'm not tryin' to be
a klutz out there, Jesus.

56
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,959
I'm tryin' fuckin' dancing.
Like, what am I supposed to do?

57
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:28,338
I am dancing.

58
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:29,924
It's just so
disappointing, you know.

59
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:31,602
Lemons, and now this.

60
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:33,387
Lemons?

61
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:35,171
They've just recently
been so expensive.

62
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,260
Clip-ons, Shelly. Clip-ons?

63
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,740
Okay, can you
please put them on?

64
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,045
Okay, well, I am. I mean,

65
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,525
gosh, they're 89 cents apiece.

66
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,068
You know, lemons are
not even really food,

67
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:44,372
you know, they're
like a garnish.

68
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:45,398
They're more like herbs.

69
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:46,748
They're like accessories.

70
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:48,122
- Who needs lemons?
- Let's go!

71
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,272
Okay. Okay, okay.

72
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,405
Let's go!

73
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,755
The music's about to change.

74
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:55,472
Well, I'm buying some nice
salmon steaks for dinner

75
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:56,864
because I'm entertaining
tomorrow evening.

76
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,194
Music's changing.

77
00:03:58,368 --> 00:03:59,519
I got this beautiful
salmon steak idea

78
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:01,328
from Ina Rosenberg's cookbook.

79
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:03,721
She has beautiful lemon
slices on the salmon.

80
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:05,419
Oh!

81
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:07,153
What? So I need them.
I need the lemons.

82
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,553
Shells, you've got
the wrong clip-ons.

83
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:11,167
Oh, my God. I mean,
when did they put

84
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:12,600
that door handle on anyway?

85
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:13,774
Like, two weeks ago?

86
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:15,342
It was, like, three months ago.

87
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:16,971
Oh, my God, I keep
forgetting that it's there.

88
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:18,190
Well, yeah, because you're old.

89
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:19,215
I mean, I'm older.

90
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:20,389
I'm not that old.

91
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:21,957
Okay, come on.

92
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:23,698
Come on!

93
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:27,528
Let's go!

94
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:31,358
Come on!

95
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:34,274
Fuck you, door handle.

96
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:35,773
...I could go back
in time, you know,

97
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:37,296
and see the door
handle, say to myself...

98
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,384
You ladies mind moving
a little faster?

99
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,149
Everyone else is out there.

100
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,040
You're the only ones acting
like you're at fuckin' brunch.

101
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:43,979
Oh, like anyone gives
a flying shit, Eddie.

102
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:45,415
What are there, 12 people?

103
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:46,373
Excuse me. You know
who gives a shit?

104
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:47,939
I do. I give a shit.

105
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:49,550
It's my job to get you on stage.

106
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:51,223
Have we ever not made
it on the stage, Eddie?

107
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:52,944
- Shell!
- Jesus.

108
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,991
Cue 453, go.

109
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,271
So, who's the guy?

110
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:17,491
Rick. He saw me leaving
the parking lot.

111
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:21,973
Oh, a stage door
Johnny situation, huh?

112
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:24,062
Paging stage door Johnny!

113
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:25,629
- Shh! Shh!
- Aisle four!

114
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:27,259
No, he recognized me
in the parking lot.

115
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:28,676
Uh-huh.

116
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,765
Does he think you're
a escort on the side?

117
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,288
Annette, no!

118
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:34,769
What? Guys think that.

119
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:36,336
Well, they do.

120
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,250
Well, Rick is nice. He likes me.

121
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:39,774
He doesn't think that.

122
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:41,384
<i>Please scan your item again.</i>

123
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:43,038
<i>Please scan your item again.</i>

124
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:44,474
Well, it's on there.

125
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:46,041
- It's right there!
- Wait, wait.

126
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:47,477
<i>Please scan your item again.</i>

127
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:49,131
No, it's telling you
to scan it again.

128
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:50,326
<i>Please scan your item again.</i>

129
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,786
Put it in the bag.

130
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:55,224
<i>Please scan your item again.</i>

131
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:02,100
- Oh, no.
- What?

132
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:07,192
Oh. Have to cancel tonight.

133
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,367
Workin' late.

134
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:09,717
Yeah, rain check.

135
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:11,066
Sorry.

136
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,503
You wanna return the fish?

137
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,766
No. It's okay.

138
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,426
Shit.

139
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,950
Fuckin' hell.

140
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:31,565
She's open.

141
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:37,875
Good. But then I won!

142
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:42,837
So what the fuck does it matter
if I previously lost, you know?

143
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,883
Oh, really, you're gonna have
an orange right before dinner?

144
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:47,644
Well, there's only enough fish
for, like, two people, Annette.

145
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:48,948
I'm tryin' to get
it where I can.

146
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:50,018
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry guys.

147
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:51,541
A little impromptu soiree.

148
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:54,152
But I got enough.
Men like to be fed.

149
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:56,067
Shelly, who is this guy anyway?

150
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:58,156
Oh, Rick the dick!

151
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,115
I bet you he was married.

152
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:02,073
Well, he was divorced.
Didn't have a ring.

153
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:04,641
Uh-huh. Did you
check his pockets?

154
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:07,470
- He liked me. He...
- Uh-huh.

155
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:09,646
That's why we're
eating his fish.

156
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,620
Look, girls, you don't
have to worry about me.

157
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:13,781
I am a very lucky person.

158
00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:15,913
I mean, I am. I have luck.

159
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:17,654
It's in me. You
know what I mean?

160
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:19,508
I mean, it's in me.
Not everybody has that.

161
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:21,092
Sure.

162
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:23,186
You gonna save your winnings
for when you retire?

163
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:26,837
What? Retire?

164
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:29,405
Are you crazy? Like,
bankers retire.

165
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:32,321
I... What do you
think I have a 501k?

166
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,018
No, I'm not gonna retire.

167
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:35,716
I'm not gonna retire.
I'm gonna work.

168
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,457
And then, I'm gonna
work some more.

169
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:38,631
And then I'm gonna die.

170
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:40,851
I'll probably die in my uniform.

171
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:43,463
- That's my plan.
- You don't wanna retire?

172
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:46,248
You know... you know,
it's not an option, Jodie.

173
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,425
Yeah, isn't it
like a requirement?

174
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,035
No!

175
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:53,037
Esme Rodriguez is 83.

176
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:54,299
She is still cocktailing.

177
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,823
Oh, my God, she's 83?

178
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:57,607
83!

179
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:59,870
I know because I was
invited to the party.

180
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:02,569
I didn't go 'cause I
don't like soft foods.

181
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:05,572
Well, I can't wait to retire.

182
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,138
You're 19!

183
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:08,488
It just seems, like,

184
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:09,813
it's such a wonderful
time in life.

185
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,099
I don't... I don't know!

186
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:13,623
I just think it seems fun!

187
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:16,583
You know, learning new things.

188
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:17,997
Maybe taking up a new language.

189
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:19,411
No, you can't learn

190
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:21,196
a new language
that late in life.

191
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,650
The brain doesn't work that way.

192
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:24,634
Well, I wanna learn French.

193
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:27,594
I love languages. I can
say "Je m'appelle Jodie."

194
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:28,832
- That's good.
- I know how to say

195
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:29,856
"My name is Jodie"

196
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:31,064
in five different languages,

197
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:32,555
including English.

198
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,402
But that's like the most
useless phrase, though.

199
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:35,534
You could just point at
yourself and say, "Jodie."

200
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:36,558
Useless? Are you kidding?

201
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,439
Shelly, let's learn
French together.

202
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,564
No, no. Je m'appelle Shelly.

203
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:43,784
Hey, guys, you know what?

204
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,437
I like my life, right?

205
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,657
I like it. I like my job.

206
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:50,007
I mean, most people don't
like playing grab-ass

207
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:52,749
with a bunch of coked-up
gamblers at 10:00 a.m., but...

208
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:56,318
- But you are one so...
- But I don't mind it.

209
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:57,711
They amuse me.

210
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,364
That's right. They amuse me.

211
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,846
And then I can go drink
and gamble on my own time.

212
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,544
Annette is a bon vivant.

213
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,197
Oh, French.

214
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:12,290
- Who's that?
- Oh, it's Eddie!

215
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:13,465
- Wait, what?
- What?

216
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,920
Wait, that is gonna be so weird!

217
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:16,904
Eddie is coming here?

218
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,558
Jodie, what were you thinking?

219
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:19,950
Well, no, it's not...

220
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:21,909
and he's like...
he's like our dad!

221
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,519
He's not like our dad.

222
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:25,366
He's seen our boobs,
like, a thousand times.

223
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,219
Have you never heard of
an impromptu girls' night?

224
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:30,874
When was the last time
you saw Eddie, anyway?

225
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,702
Oh, no, no, no. I
haven't seen Eddie

226
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:34,637
since I left the show,
and I have not missed him.

227
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:36,184
Well, that's not nice.

228
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:38,403
I feel like we're all
kind of like a big family.

229
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,207
Okay, well, if this is a
family, it's pretty fucked up.

230
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:42,016
We're tits out all the time.

231
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,845
No, like, you're our mom, and...

232
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,630
Wait. You're tryin' to
make Shelly your mom

233
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,110
- and Eddie your dad?
- Ugh.

234
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:50,807
I mean, I feel like
this is a family.

235
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:53,462
- We're a family.
- Okay.

236
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,246
Well, you know what, girls?

237
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,034
I will be the girl outside
getting drunk very fast.

238
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:02,602
Okay.

239
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:06,799
- And we used to do that thing.
- Oh, God.

240
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:08,453
And just sit there like
this, not say a word.

241
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:09,826
- Oh, wow.
- Naked.

242
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,456
Put it everywhere.
You know what I mean?

243
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,880
- Look who's here!
- Welcome, Eddie.

244
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,918
Hey, ladies. Hey,
Annette, good to see you.

245
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:16,572
Oh, no, no, no, I'm
not gonna hug you.

246
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,095
- I'm sweating.
- That's okay.

247
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:19,706
No, no, no, really.

248
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,882
I am not gonna hug you
because I am sweating.

249
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,884
- Okay.
- It's gross.

250
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:26,277
But it's awful good
to see ya, Eddie.

251
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:28,845
- Yeah. Yeah, you, too.
- Yeah. Mm.

252
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,847
Show's not the same without you.

253
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:32,544
It isn't? Really?

254
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,938
I kind of feel like it is.

255
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:38,289
Oh. I mean,
technically, it is.

256
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,465
- Yeah.
- It is the same show.

257
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,033
Um, just meant figuratively.

258
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,556
Yeah.

259
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:48,473
Hey, um, who took
over my track again?

260
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,737
Was it, um... wait.

261
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,086
Uh, Valerie?

262
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,436
- Francine.
- Francine!

263
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,743
Francine, yeah.

264
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,005
She sucked.

265
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:00,921
I mean, she can't fouette.

266
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:03,314
She really... she's
a terrible dancer.

267
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:05,490
But how did she
take over my track?

268
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:08,711
She does the pas de deux
in the fairy ballet?

269
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:10,278
She can't partner.

270
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:13,194
I mean, does she even
know how to partner?

271
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:14,674
Yeah, I mean, it's
been six years

272
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:15,936
since you left the show.

273
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,198
She does it every night.

274
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:19,156
She figured it out.

275
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,029
So, Eddie brought some wine.

276
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:24,335
Yeah. Should I go open it up?

277
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:25,685
Yeah.

278
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:27,338
A little Malbec for anybody?

279
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:28,775
Annette? Mary-Anne?

280
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:30,864
I'm allergic to red.

281
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,169
Yeah, no.

282
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:35,172
I'm, um... I'm
drinking margaritas.

283
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:37,609
Okay.

284
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:40,700
I just... I brought
it because...

285
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:43,441
well, it's funny.

286
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:45,269
When I was on Siegfried and Roy,

287
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:47,160
those guys would have
us over on the off days

288
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:50,274
and I went pretty hard
on the red wine, so...

289
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:52,624
Wait, they went
hard on red wine?

290
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,020
Yeah, well, it's ages ago.

291
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,266
Uh, there was this one
time when I got caught

292
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,746
in the escape trap
with a white tiger.

293
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,250
- What?
- Yeah. No.

294
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:11,078
- No!
- Yeah, no, yeah.

295
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:12,969
So, you know, the tiger's
supposed to disappear off stage

296
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:14,318
- during his trick, right?
- Uh-huh.

297
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:15,778
And so I'm down, um,

298
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,392
opening the trap
door onto the floor.

299
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,086
- Yeah.
- And the tiger knows

300
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,846
to go through the tunnel
and into the holding pen.

301
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,219
And somehow,

302
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:23,633
I got caught in the holding pen

303
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,266
with the white tiger.

304
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,963
And I shit myself.

305
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,965
That is insane!

306
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,751
Did the tiger swat at you?

307
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,753
- No.
- Oh.

308
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,148
They're very well trained, huh?

309
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:39,628
Oh, very. Yeah,
it's impressive.

310
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:42,892
- Wow.
- Thank you.

311
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,416
I mean, that's scary, though.

312
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:48,202
Great story, Eddie.

313
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,075
<i>I'm still hungry.</i>

314
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:53,990
That was, like,
two ounces of fish.

315
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:56,166
I have some cup of
noodles above the fridge.

316
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,820
- Oh.
- If you want that, sweetie.

317
00:12:57,994 --> 00:12:59,213
Thank you.

318
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:00,954
- Eddie, are you okay?
- No.

319
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:03,478
I think I swallowed
a teeny fish bone.

320
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:06,046
- You?
- Um, so listen.

321
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,570
I didn't come here
tonight just to, um...

322
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,879
I got somethin' I
need to tell you.

323
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:14,576
Are you okay?

324
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:22,105
Muffy told me that
the show is closing.

325
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,891
I'm sorry. What?

326
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:26,544
Yeah, the show's closing.

327
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:31,071
Oh! Way to bury
the lead, shithead!

328
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:32,942
Don't call me a
shithead, Annette.

329
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:35,553
Well, then, don't
fuckin' drop a bomb

330
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,252
in the middle of a dinner an
hour after you've arrived!

331
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:41,081
I mean, hold on. Hold on. I
mean, Muffy is senile, okay?

332
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,647
She's, like, a
thousand years old.

333
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,542
- She's about to die.
- Muffy is not senile.

334
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:47,522
Just tell me what she said.

335
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:50,003
She said the new casino owners

336
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:52,222
wanna put their own
stamp on the place.

337
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:53,789
So they brought in the circus.

338
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:55,922
That show's doing
really well, so...

339
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:57,749
I mean, who puts
money into a circus

340
00:13:57,924 --> 00:14:00,752
that's not Cirque
du Soleil, right?

341
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,319
That's dumb.

342
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,173
I knew when we started
sharing our theater,

343
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:06,169
when they started taking
over our Thursday, Friday,

344
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:07,672
Saturday shows,
it was a bad sign.

345
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,370
No shit. And also,
no, you did not.

346
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,285
- Yeah, I did. Yes.
- No, you didn't.

347
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:12,610
- Ah, you guys, wait.
- No, you did not.

348
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:15,506
You guys, our show is legendary.

349
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,249
It is, but Le Razzle-Dazzle,
it's... it's old.

350
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:21,599
It's the last show of
its kind on the strip.

351
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:23,340
I know, that's what
makes it so special,

352
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:25,865
the fact that it's the last one.

353
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,344
It's a show.

354
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:29,956
It's the costumes, the sets.

355
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,610
Look, it is a dinosaur, Shelly.

356
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:35,962
I think we're gonna
get notice tomorrow.

357
00:14:36,136 --> 00:14:38,181
Are you kidding?

358
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:40,444
You heard this from Muffy?

359
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:41,924
Yeah.

360
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,417
Oh! What is wrong with you?

361
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:59,594
Do you like being the
bearer of bad news?

362
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,336
No.

363
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,946
Just it was important
information.

364
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,469
I wanted them to
hear it from me.

365
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:08,820
Oh, really? Well, your
important information

366
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:11,040
just broke her fucking heart.

367
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:17,807
You're saying that you don't do

368
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,179
the straddle, bitch?

369
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:20,180
I see your warm up
every single night.

370
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:21,485
I don't look good.

371
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:23,618
Okay. Yeah, bye.

372
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,794
That's good as wow!

373
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,101
<i>Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.</i>

374
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:31,060
<i>I regret to inform you
that Le Razzle Dazzle</i>

375
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:33,671
<i>will have its final
performance in two weeks.</i>

376
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,544
<i>On behalf of Muffy, as
well as our long-time</i>

377
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:39,112
<i>producing partners
at the casino,</i>

378
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:42,419
<i>the decision to close the show
has been a hard one to make,</i>

379
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,727
<i>but it's been an
incredible 38-year run,</i>

380
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,750
and they wish to thank everyone

381
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,644
for their hard work
over the years.

382
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,218
Did you guys know?

383
00:15:58,392 --> 00:15:59,741
No! Did you know?

384
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:02,546
<i>This is your 15-minute call,</i>

385
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,745
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

386
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,616
<i>15 minutes to curtain.</i>

387
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:24,418
I just want to say
on behalf of myself,

388
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:28,900
your hard work and dedication,

389
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:32,687
it's been something special.

390
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:37,257
I wish everybody a
great show tonight,

391
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,031
and a great show over
the next two weeks.

392
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:41,261
Thanks.

393
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:52,054
Hey.

394
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:53,534
Hey.

395
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:08,766
You know what?

396
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,460
If they just poured
a little more money

397
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,466
into the advertising campaign...

398
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,296
I mean, our press shots
are from the early '80s.

399
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,995
Aren't you in some
of those shots?

400
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:23,999
Yeah, I am.

401
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,828
You had the Hindenburg solo.

402
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:28,656
I did.

403
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,441
How long did you do it?

404
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:36,359
Well, when I was cast
in '87 until about '99

405
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,187
when Renata joined the cast.

406
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:40,537
Then she took it over.

407
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:44,498
I bet you were great, huh?

408
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,855
Did you ever wanna get married?

409
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,209
I was married when
I was really young.

410
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:02,733
For a short time.

411
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:04,605
Yeah.

412
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:09,175
Well, what happened?

413
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:10,828
I was dancing.

414
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:12,458
I was already in the
show here when we met,

415
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:16,007
and he didn't like Vegas much.

416
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:18,184
He got a job in New York.

417
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:19,707
The show here was
really thriving,

418
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:21,578
and there was a lot
of press around us.

419
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:23,667
It was very exciting.
I was very young.

420
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:25,713
And so I stayed here.

421
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,454
What did you do?

422
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:29,562
Well, we tried to make it
work for a couple years,

423
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:32,023
but eventually he
met somebody there

424
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:34,504
and he tried to convince
me to come to New York

425
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:36,463
and dance, and I tried it.

426
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:38,658
But, you know, I went to an
open call for the Rockettes,

427
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:42,686
I went to an open call
for a Broadway musical,

428
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,559
I just missed the
thrill of the show here.

429
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,737
You'd be a perfect Rockette.

430
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:53,610
Yeah, I found all that
kicking very redundant.

431
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:33,824
<i>Hi, you've reached Hannah.</i>

432
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:36,349
<i>Leave a message.</i>

433
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:38,655
Hey, Hannie.

434
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:41,484
<i>Oh, I tried to call you Hannah
and honey at the same time.</i>

435
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:44,705
<i>Oh, my goodness.
Hannie. That's funny.</i>

436
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:49,579
<i>Um, just checking in to
see if you wanted to,</i>

437
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:53,714
<i>um, you know, get a bite,
get a cup of coffee?</i>

438
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:55,629
<i>I don't know. I don't
really drink coffee,</i>

439
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:59,372
but, um, what I really
like is a nice drink.

440
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:01,504
But, yeah, that'd
be inappropriate

441
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:03,419
'cause you're, what, 20?

442
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:05,639
Oh, my God, you're 22. How
do I delete this thing?

443
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:07,815
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh!

444
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:09,512
<i>To listen to this
message, press one.</i>

445
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:12,211
<i>To delete your
message, press two.</i>

446
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:14,474
Just shut up!

447
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,302
I'm trying to leave
an important message.

448
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:17,781
Oh!

449
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,089
Okay.

450
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,525
<i>To hear your options again,</i>

451
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:25,441
<i>- press three.</i>
- Yes. Yes, okay. Mm-hmm.

452
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:27,965
Okay. Okay.

453
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:29,402
Oh!

454
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:31,055
<i>Message sent.</i>

455
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,232
No! Oh, God!

456
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:39,890
C'est la vie.

457
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:53,295
I went to a dance call today.

458
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:54,688
You did? Already?

459
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:56,690
Yeah, what'd you go out for?

460
00:20:56,864 --> 00:21:00,171
Mm, it was a show called
Hedonist Paradise.

461
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:02,522
I can't believe that's
the title of a show.

462
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:06,047
What, like Le Razzle
Dazzle's any better?

463
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:07,962
Le Razzle Dazzle is a
name that's evocative

464
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:11,618
of another time in
history, of Paris,

465
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,665
of the theater in a way.

466
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,189
You get all that from
Le Razzle Dazzle?

467
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,844
Well, what do you get
from Hedonist Paradise?

468
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:23,673
I get girls grinding on poles,
doused with water like animals.

469
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,327
Like, it's totally tasteless.

470
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,502
- Tasteless?
- Yes!

471
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:27,851
You... I... you know,

472
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:29,465
I can't have this
conversation again.

473
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,189
Well, what do you want
from me, Mary-Anne?

474
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,180
If you think this is so
terrible, why are you here?

475
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:34,399
I mean, what makes you
wanna do this job...

476
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:36,207
Because it's a job, okay?

477
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:37,905
And it pays American dollars.

478
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:47,262
I don't know.

479
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,616
You wanna see the combination?

480
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:57,707
Sure.

481
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,361
Okay.

482
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:03,060
Oh, so there's a chair involved.

483
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:04,279
Uh, yeah.

484
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:07,064
So, well, you're, um,

485
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:10,459
like, backwards on a chair.

486
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:14,028
And then... and
then you're like...

487
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:17,640
♪ <i>Mm, mm, mm, mm,
mm, mm, mm, mm</i> ♪

488
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:20,730
♪ <i>Slap the thighs, up the
body, through the hair</i> ♪

489
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:22,471
Hold.

490
00:22:22,645 --> 00:22:24,343
And one, two, three, four.

491
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:25,779
And ass, ass, uh, uh.

492
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:27,215
Cut it. This is ridiculous.

493
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,043
One and a two, hold.

494
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:30,653
- And body roll.
- Okay, yeah.

495
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:32,829
- And body roll. And hold.
- I'm not mad at it.

496
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:35,484
And one, two, three, four.

497
00:22:35,658 --> 00:22:37,791
And uh, and uh.

498
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:40,315
And then you go around.

499
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:41,969
Uh, on the chair.

500
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:43,579
- Oh!
- And one...

501
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:47,191
And hump the chair. And
pulse, pulse, pulse.

502
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,366
And down.

503
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:50,281
And then you go around.

504
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:52,240
- And then you go up here.
- Oh, God.

505
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:55,112
Okay, stop. Stop, please.
I can't. I can't anymore.

506
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:57,006
I would never audition
for a show like that.

507
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:58,202
Never.

508
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,421
Okay.

509
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:00,901
Never.

510
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:04,295
- Yeah, okay.
- I'm sorry, it's just...

511
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,428
- Okay.
- I can't. I can't.

512
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,735
I mean, how am I
supposed to react?

513
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,180
I don't even know what
I'm gonna do for Christmas

514
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:21,051
if I don't have this.

515
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:37,066
Hey, Shell.

516
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:38,373
Hey.

517
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,466
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

518
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,120
All right.

519
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:47,880
You know, since we lost
those shows, these checks

520
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:49,906
feel like they're getting
slimmer and slimmer.

521
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:53,083
Yeah.

522
00:23:53,257 --> 00:23:54,781
Hmm.

523
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,740
Hey, Eddie.

524
00:23:57,914 --> 00:23:59,394
I mean, are you
sure this is right?

525
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:03,703
This is a lot less than I
thought it was gonna be.

526
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:06,140
Well, it's less
because less shows.

527
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:08,751
Oh, well, I know
that, obviously.

528
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:10,884
I was just thinking, you know,

529
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:13,713
800 divided by 11 shows minus
the three shows we lost.

530
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:15,236
Well, you might have been

531
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,050
makin' slightly more
than the ones we lost

532
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:20,459
because those shows were,
better sold, generally.

533
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:21,982
Oh.

534
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,727
Um, if you want, I can
check with accounts payable.

535
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:29,946
Nah.

536
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,920
They're not gonna do
anything about it, right?

537
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,515
No, probably not.

538
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:38,302
You know, I just,
uh, done the math

539
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,653
and reworked my budget

540
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:43,177
according to what I
thought it was gonna be.

541
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:47,486
Organic milk is so
expensive these days.

542
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,141
Oh, they docked me for the wing.

543
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:52,665
Oh.

544
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:55,842
- The rip.
- Yeah, shit.

545
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:57,931
I mean, it must have been bad.

546
00:24:58,105 --> 00:25:00,237
I mean, it wasn't
on a seem, you know?

547
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:02,718
No, I think Ida had
to reorder the fabric.

548
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:04,546
Oh, she did?

549
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,156
Yeah.

550
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,462
Just to repair one wing.

551
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:08,831
You know, the show's gonna end.

552
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:10,421
Oh no, I get it.

553
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:13,599
You're never gonna need that
fabric for anything else.

554
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:16,515
Well, I'm sorry to me, then.

555
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:21,563
- Bye.
- Ciao.

556
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:29,876
<i>To listen to this
message, press one.</i>

557
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,575
<i>Hey, Hannie.</i>

558
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:36,926
<i>Oh, I tried to call you Hannah
and honey at the same time.</i>

559
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,061
<i>Oh, my goodness.
Hannie. That's funny.</i>

560
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:45,892
<i>Um, just checking in to
see if you wanted to, um,</i>

561
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:49,025
<i>you know, get a bite,
get a cup of coffee?</i>

562
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,984
<i>I don't know, I don't
really drink coffee,</i>

563
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:53,769
<i>but, uh, darn it, I'd
have a cup of coffee.</i>

564
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:55,728
<i>Or maybe I could have some tea.</i>

565
00:25:55,902 --> 00:25:58,513
<i>And, uh, um, you know...</i>

566
00:25:58,687 --> 00:26:01,081
<i>You know what I really
want is a nice drink.</i>

567
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:02,952
<i>That'd be inappropriate
because...</i>

568
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:05,346
Well, I could always move in
with you, and pay you rent.

569
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:08,543
No, my lease is up
in, like, ten months.

570
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,587
You're gonna gamble
it all. I know you.

571
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:10,960
No, I will not.

572
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:12,808
I'm gonna lose my house
like you lost yours.

573
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:15,182
Stop. Hey, Phyllis, you
want another ginger ale?

574
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:17,010
- Oh, yeah, please.
- Yeah. Jack Daniels?

575
00:26:17,184 --> 00:26:20,100
- Oh, yes, honey.
- Thanks, Annette.

576
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:22,015
You know, I don't like that.

577
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:24,539
It makes you think
like I'm irresponsible.

578
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:27,847
I am not irresponsible. I'm
thinking of opening an IRA.

579
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:30,197
Oh, I think you're too
old to open an IRA.

580
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:32,329
Okay, whatever.

581
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:34,680
I just... I mean, you know me.

582
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:37,857
- I make money.
- Exactly.

583
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:40,033
You know, you could always
get together with Eddie.

584
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:41,600
What?

585
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:43,186
- Oh, my God, that's a first.
- You could.

586
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,472
Who are you?

587
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:47,606
Hey, Tony, I need
a Jack and Ginger.

588
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,192
- Hey, we're cutting the floor.
- What?

589
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,957
You and Esme can go home.

590
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:54,351
- Who's staying?
- Jennifer and Jessica.

591
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:56,397
Of course they are.

592
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:59,574
Well, you can tell one of
the assholes over there

593
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:03,578
to drop that to Zsa Zsa
Gabor in the nickel slots.

594
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:05,188
Who?

595
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:06,668
Zsa Zsa!

596
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,191
That's insane.

597
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:10,193
Look, fine, then if not me,

598
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:14,676
I just... I think you want
a guy around the house.

599
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,200
You keep dating
these business types,

600
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:19,594
who come to town two three days,

601
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:22,684
and you cook for them like
you wanna get married.

602
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:24,512
I don't. I don't
wanna get married.

603
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:27,036
Well, I think you forget

604
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,606
guys come to Vegas to get a
story they can go home with.

605
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,827
Like shtupping a showgirl.

606
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:38,265
- No, Annette! Yes, Annette.
- It's true. Come on.

607
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:39,745
And you know that.

608
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,487
But you see, you
and Eddie, I mean,

609
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,533
you guys have a history
and he lives here.

610
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,448
Yeah, we have a bad history.

611
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:49,798
All histories are bad with men.

612
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:51,104
But you have history.

613
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:52,801
And you know, he's...

614
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:56,631
I don't know, he's
a solid enough guy.

615
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:58,154
I don't particularly like him

616
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:00,330
or even find him
that attractive.

617
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:03,682
But, you know, he might
even have a pension.

618
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,596
Do you have a pension?

619
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,139
Do you have a pension?
I don't have a pension.

620
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:08,469
- No.
- Exactly.

621
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:14,388
And you know, I
mean, he's cute-ish.

622
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:18,697
I can also... I can
also get you a job here.

623
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:20,699
What, cocktailing?

624
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:22,309
Yes.

625
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:24,050
Hey, Esme.

626
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:26,008
You know what? Fuck them.

627
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:28,707
Right? Screw them.

628
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:31,013
Seriously.

629
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:34,103
Hey. You want a cigarette?

630
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,504
Oh, my God!

631
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,681
Oh, my God, is that you?

632
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:32,727
- Oh! Oh!
- Hey, Shelly.

633
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:34,468
You got my message.

634
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:36,165
It's so good to see you.

635
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:38,167
My goodness, what
are you doing here?

636
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:39,952
I mean, of course, you know,

637
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:42,650
I'm happy to see you,
but I mean, jeez,

638
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:45,479
you could show up at my
doorstep anytime, anywhere.

639
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:49,788
Oh, it's just so
good to see you.

640
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:51,485
God, I'm sorry. I'm such a mess.

641
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,662
I mean, I just haven't
had a lot of sleep lately.

642
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:57,186
Hormones.

643
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:01,321
Why aren't you in school?

644
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:04,498
Um, I had to come home
for Lisa's birthday, so...

645
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:07,196
Oh, it's Lisa's birthday.

646
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,025
I mean, I gotta send her a
card or a call or something.

647
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:12,027
You don't have to do that.

648
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:13,768
I want to. I will.
I mean, how is she?

649
00:30:13,942 --> 00:30:16,815
She's, um, how are she and Jeff?

650
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:20,122
They're really good. Uh,
I'm graduating in May, so...

651
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:23,822
Oh, I know. I know, hon. Gosh,
you're graduating so soon.

652
00:30:23,996 --> 00:30:25,258
I just can't believe it.

653
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:27,086
And Becky's graduating, too,

654
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,915
so we're gonna do, like,
a joint party kinda thing.

655
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:32,482
Oh, really? Becky
is graduating, too?

656
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:36,791
Yeah, good for her.
Good for Becky.

657
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:39,228
Yeah.

658
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:41,622
It's a lot of family time,

659
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:44,668
so I wanted to get out
of the house anyways.

660
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,934
Sorry.

661
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:52,372
Oh, you look so beautiful.

662
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:54,113
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

663
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:57,638
You're so beautiful,
so grown up.

664
00:30:57,812 --> 00:30:59,332
I just can't believe
I haven't seen you

665
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:01,555
in what, like, over a year?

666
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:03,296
Yeah.

667
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:12,044
So, um, do you have a boyfriend?

668
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:14,742
Just tryin' to focus on
getting out of school.

669
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:18,485
Oh, well, plenty of time for
boyfriends, you know, later.

670
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:19,878
Mm-hmm.

671
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:31,106
Have you, uh, declared a major?

672
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,629
I'm studying photography.

673
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:35,154
Oh, my God, that's so exciting!

674
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:37,460
Thanks.

675
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:39,288
Uh, Lisa said it
wouldn't be that useful

676
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:40,855
to have any sort of arts degree,

677
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:42,901
but it's the only thing

678
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:45,729
I'm really passionate
about, so...

679
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,776
Well, I think it's brilliant
that you're doing that.

680
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:54,042
I mean, being part of a creative
community is... It's the best.

681
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:56,871
It's the best.

682
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:59,569
It's pretty solitary. It's
not really a community.

683
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:02,877
Well, you know, being
an artist is solitary,

684
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:07,099
but if you're passionate
about it, it's worth it.

685
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:12,104
You know what?

686
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:13,932
I really should get going.

687
00:32:14,106 --> 00:32:15,759
Oh, no, no.

688
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,346
I was just gonna say if you
wanted to stay for dinner.

689
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,850
Yeah, I just stopping
by to say hello.

690
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:22,288
I have to get... I have
to get home for dinner.

691
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:24,182
Well, I mean, can't you
just give him a call

692
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:26,094
and say that you're gonna
have dinner here tonight?

693
00:32:26,118 --> 00:32:27,597
It's just one night.

694
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:31,950
I don't know. Becky
just got home, and I...

695
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:35,954
I mean, Lisa wouldn't
mind, would she?

696
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:38,086
Just one dinner.

697
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,958
One night.

698
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:41,829
I really can't, Shelly.

699
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:45,722
You know, I was... I was
thinking that, you know,

700
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:48,401
since the show is closing,
that I could probably get

701
00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:51,752
a couple days off and
come visit you in Tucson.

702
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:53,928
- What?
- Yeah.

703
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:55,843
The show is closing.

704
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:59,020
I can't talk about it too much.
I'll just dissolve into tears.

705
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:02,893
But, you know, I could
finally have some time off

706
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:04,460
and come visit you in Tucson.

707
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:07,986
I could come to your
graduation if you want.

708
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,902
Um, I'll think about it.

709
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:13,382
Okay.

710
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:16,124
Come give your mom a hug.

711
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:17,865
Mm.

712
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:21,086
Oh, geez.

713
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,479
You know, if you ever
wanna see the show,

714
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:26,178
there's only a couple left.

715
00:33:26,352 --> 00:33:27,918
What?

716
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:29,311
Ugh.

717
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:30,660
Uh, I... I didn't mean it.

718
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:32,749
Just, you know, just
so nice to see you.

719
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:36,536
I... trying to find a
way to see you soon.

720
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,320
Um.

721
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:40,975
Yeah. Little misstep.

722
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:42,194
It's okay.

723
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:43,499
Okay.

724
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:46,502
- See you, Shelly.
- See you.

725
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,489
I have, like, a big girls night,

726
00:35:43,663 --> 00:35:45,752
it was too much fun.

727
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:48,146
I was, like, hurting.

728
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,680
You know what,
like, if I get home,

729
00:35:49,843 --> 00:35:51,061
- like, starving.
- Yeah.

730
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:52,933
- Then I have no dinner.
- Yeah.

731
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:55,675
But normally if I'm starvin',
I could just get food court.

732
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,409
'Cause it's like you
need energy before,

733
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,113
but also... it's...

734
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:00,612
You'd think they could
get our set in place

735
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:01,768
before our damn call times,

736
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:02,942
so we can warm up.

737
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:06,164
Our entire crew is out there.

738
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:10,820
I saw it.

739
00:36:10,994 --> 00:36:13,214
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

740
00:36:15,825 --> 00:36:17,653
It was pretty awesome.

741
00:36:17,827 --> 00:36:20,265
The Dirty Circus was awesome?

742
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:22,397
Yeah, it was really funny.

743
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:24,094
Mm-hmm.

744
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:26,184
And the acts were really
hard and impressive.

745
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:28,186
Sounds like every other circus.

746
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,754
I've never seen a
circus like that.

747
00:36:31,928 --> 00:36:34,279
And that made it awesome?

748
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:36,803
Yeah, kind of.

749
00:36:36,977 --> 00:36:39,022
Got turned down for three shows.

750
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,938
- What?
- Which ones?

751
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,376
Boy, I look too old
for Jungle Island,

752
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,639
Paradise Hedonist,
Paradise Island,

753
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:48,293
whatever the fuck.

754
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:49,598
"Look too old."

755
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:51,092
Like, they were
absolutely looking

756
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,340
for girls who were barely 18.

757
00:36:52,514 --> 00:36:53,514
Like, they were like,

758
00:36:53,602 --> 00:36:55,343
"Did you turn 18 yesterday?"

759
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:57,258
What were the others?

760
00:36:57,432 --> 00:37:00,348
Oh, I'm not stacked enough
for Oz Land or Pin up Girls.

761
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:02,202
No, honey, you don't
even want those shows.

762
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,570
They're so bad.
They're so low class.

763
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:05,745
Low class?

764
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:07,399
What is this?

765
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:08,573
The show is famous!

766
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:09,662
It's a tradition

767
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:10,987
that had its roots in France!

768
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:12,011
Oh, my God!

769
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:14,057
Fucking France show!

770
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,731
I mean, it's the last
remaining descendant

771
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:17,235
of Parisian Lido culture.

772
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:18,995
Shelly, nobody knows
what the fuck that means.

773
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:20,344
Well, just like
the shows in Paris.

774
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:22,196
I mean, you think
85 is a big cast?

775
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,851
There was 160 of us
back in the '80s.

776
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:26,766
American Express did
a travel campaign,

777
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,340
and they flew us
all over the world,

778
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:30,248
and photographed us
in different sites.

779
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:32,511
They shot me on the
Great Wall of China.

780
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:33,903
I was very special.

781
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:35,340
I'm sure, Shell.

782
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:37,255
Super special.

783
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:40,170
Well, I mean, Las Vegas used
to treat us like movie stars.

784
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:42,042
The iconic American showgirl.

785
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:44,087
The Las Vegas showgirl.

786
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,828
We were ambassadors.

787
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:47,439
For style and grace.

788
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:49,876
You know, it's just...

789
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,052
it's the costumes.

790
00:37:52,226 --> 00:37:53,943
I mean, it makes you feel
like you're stepping out

791
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:56,274
of the pages of <i>Vogue</i> magazine.

792
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:58,928
I think that's why women
like to come to the show.

793
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,495
The glamor is undeniable.

794
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:03,106
The glamor. I think I
can deny the glamor.

795
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,561
I mean, maybe
times have changed.

796
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:05,717
Yes.

797
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:07,589
Shell, they've changed.

798
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:09,983
And times are brand
spanking different.

799
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:12,855
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your half-hour call.</i>

800
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:15,293
<i>30 minutes to curtain.</i>

801
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:22,517
Mm-hmm, casting call.

802
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:02,035
Oh, my God, Hannah!

803
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:03,776
What a nice surprise!

804
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,995
Come on in!

805
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:07,649
What are you doing here?

806
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:10,260
I just thought we
could have that dinner.

807
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:20,836
So, what's the plan
after graduation?

808
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,361
I don't know. I think I
might save some more money

809
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:26,276
and then, I kinda just
wanna travel around.

810
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:28,975
Like, I really wanna
go to Europe, but...

811
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:30,890
Oh, that sounds amazing.

812
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:33,022
You've got to do that.

813
00:39:33,196 --> 00:39:35,373
- It's just expensive.
- Yeah.

814
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:38,158
Hey, you know, being a
photographer is just...

815
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:41,161
- it's just hard.
- What?

816
00:39:41,335 --> 00:39:44,251
- It's a hard career path.
- Says who?

817
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,514
Like, everybody.

818
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,429
Really someone said
being an artist is hard?

819
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:51,127
Someone put that dumb
sentence in your head?

820
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:53,695
Yeah. Lisa, for one.

821
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:55,567
Oh, well.

822
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:03,994
That's what parents say when
they want you to get a job

823
00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:06,273
that, like, pays money.

824
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:09,058
Honey, well, she's not
your actual parent.

825
00:40:09,232 --> 00:40:11,060
I mean, she might think she is.

826
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:14,150
But doing a job that
you don't really love,

827
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:15,717
that's hard.

828
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:18,057
You know, when your
calling is out there,

829
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:20,461
just waiting for you.

830
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:24,422
You know, money doesn't make
a boring job that much better.

831
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:27,337
What does Lisa want you to do?

832
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:31,167
Uh, she thinks I'd be great
at, like, graphic design.

833
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:33,561
Well, does that
interest you right now?

834
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:34,823
No.

835
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,044
Well, forget about it.

836
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:39,959
Hard.

837
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:43,658
That's the dumbest phrase anyone
told anybody with a dream.

838
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:48,054
I'll meet you in Paris.

839
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:53,059
- Oh, my God! What was that?
- What?

840
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:54,515
I saw something scurry
across the room.

841
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:55,931
- What, like, a mouse?
- Yes!

842
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:57,213
- No.
- Oh, my God, yes, yes.

843
00:40:57,237 --> 00:40:58,301
They live in the hidey-holes.

844
00:40:58,325 --> 00:40:59,631
That's where the gangsters used

845
00:40:59,805 --> 00:41:00,912
to keep their money
before I moved here.

846
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:02,372
I wish I knew where it was.

847
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:04,592
Oh, my God!

848
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:07,813
- There it is again! There it is.
- Wait, what are you doing?

849
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,243
<i>Let's go for 68.</i>

850
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,463
<i>Go on cue 68.</i>

851
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:51,378
<i>Quiet and blackout.</i>

852
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:52,988
<i>Resepct the process people.</i>

853
00:41:53,162 --> 00:41:54,642
<i>Stay focused.</i>

854
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:01,083
Shelly?

855
00:42:04,304 --> 00:42:05,435
Standby for 771.

856
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,481
Can we get dancers
in their places?

857
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:08,980
Before, I don't know,
before hell freezes over.

858
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:10,745
Thank you.

859
00:42:13,661 --> 00:42:15,010
<i>Thanks, everyone. Great show.</i>

860
00:42:15,184 --> 00:42:16,534
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

861
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,686
Oh!

862
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,732
- Hi.
- Oh, my gosh!

863
00:42:40,906 --> 00:42:42,864
Oh, hey.

864
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:45,563
Hi!

865
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:48,348
I saw the show tonight.

866
00:42:48,522 --> 00:42:50,437
Oh, you did?

867
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:52,265
Well, that was sweet of you.

868
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:55,877
I, um, it means a lot
to me that you came.

869
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:59,185
I wasn't sure if I was
even gonna tell you.

870
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,013
There was barely anyone there.

871
00:43:01,187 --> 00:43:03,058
Yeah, well...

872
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:05,297
I think that was the worst house
we've ever had in the history

873
00:43:05,321 --> 00:43:06,540
of the whole entire show.

874
00:43:06,714 --> 00:43:09,325
What was there, like,
18 people there?

875
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:10,762
I wish I'd known you were here.

876
00:43:10,936 --> 00:43:12,217
I would have done
a little shout out

877
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:13,808
or kind of point or something.

878
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,857
I thought you were just
heading back to the Kelly's.

879
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:22,817
What'd you think?

880
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:25,907
I think I thought it
would be different.

881
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:27,561
Oh, yeah?

882
00:43:27,735 --> 00:43:30,695
Yeah, like harder
dancing or something.

883
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:33,045
Oh, you know, we just
make it look easy.

884
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:36,744
It's kind of just a
stupid nudie show.

885
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:40,661
Well, it's a spectacle
with dancing nudes,

886
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:44,012
but it's certainly
not a nudie show.

887
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:47,015
Dancing nudes, is that,
like, a technical term?

888
00:43:47,189 --> 00:43:49,844
Yeah, yes, it is.

889
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:54,153
What's the point of that show?

890
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:56,024
I mean, what was that?

891
00:43:57,112 --> 00:43:58,548
Why did you invite me?

892
00:43:58,723 --> 00:44:00,812
Maybe you thought
I wouldn't come?

893
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:02,161
I don't know.

894
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:04,990
I don't know why I did come.

895
00:44:05,164 --> 00:44:09,647
Although, uh, I guess, it's
because I just hoped...

896
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:13,259
I wanted to know
that it was worth it.

897
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:15,304
That it was better
than me after all.

898
00:44:15,478 --> 00:44:16,958
What?

899
00:44:17,132 --> 00:44:19,744
That you didn't put this
lame trash above me.

900
00:44:19,918 --> 00:44:21,223
It's not!

901
00:44:21,397 --> 00:44:22,834
I disagree.

902
00:44:23,008 --> 00:44:24,662
Plus, I didn't put
anything above you.

903
00:44:24,836 --> 00:44:26,576
- I provided for you.
- I keep forgetting

904
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,883
that you're not actually
a reasonable person.

905
00:44:29,057 --> 00:44:30,885
That you left me in
the casino parking lot

906
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:33,583
with a Game Boy while you
did two shows a night.

907
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:35,798
I didn't think it was
appropriate for you backstage.

908
00:44:35,934 --> 00:44:37,413
Well, yeah, it wasn't.

909
00:44:37,587 --> 00:44:39,981
I couldn't afford help, Hannah.

910
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:43,898
I just did the best I can.

911
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:46,161
I just did the
best I can, Hannah.

912
00:44:47,336 --> 00:44:49,904
And if you can do what
you love for 30 years,

913
00:44:50,078 --> 00:44:52,254
you know, and be passionate
about your career...

914
00:44:52,428 --> 00:44:54,779
What kind of career is this?

915
00:44:54,953 --> 00:44:59,174
You're in the goddamn back
of 80 topless dancers.

916
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:03,352
This was worth missing bedtime
for most of my childhood?

917
00:45:04,353 --> 00:45:05,877
Was it?

918
00:45:09,794 --> 00:45:11,926
See, this is why I came tonight.

919
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,146
I wanted to see a
reason in all this,

920
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,975
and tonight I finally didn't.

921
00:45:27,681 --> 00:45:29,117
Shelly.

922
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:31,946
Look, I'm sorry, Hannah.

923
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,383
I'm sorry you didn't get
what you wanted from me.

924
00:45:34,557 --> 00:45:37,169
You know, but if you
could forgive me,

925
00:45:37,343 --> 00:45:39,519
anytime, anytime in your life,

926
00:45:39,693 --> 00:45:41,390
I would love that.

927
00:45:41,564 --> 00:45:43,175
But I can't defend
myself anymore.

928
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:44,524
I just can't.

929
00:46:21,474 --> 00:46:23,781
Hey, I'm still here.

930
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:29,221
Sorry, I thought
I saw Shelly go.

931
00:46:30,135 --> 00:46:33,486
- Yeah, I'm going. I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

932
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,576
Are you... are you...

933
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,143
you're Hannah?

934
00:46:38,317 --> 00:46:41,363
Yeah, I know I probably
shouldn't be back here.

935
00:46:42,712 --> 00:46:44,149
Did you come to see the show?

936
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:46,542
Um, yeah.

937
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:47,848
Yeah, what'd you think?

938
00:46:48,022 --> 00:46:51,286
Uh, not really my thing.

939
00:46:56,248 --> 00:46:58,119
She talks about
you all the time.

940
00:47:00,774 --> 00:47:03,255
Yeah, uh, I think
I should get going.

941
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:06,867
Yeah, no, sorry. I didn't mean
to keep you, it's just, uh...

942
00:47:12,568 --> 00:47:14,179
It's good seeing you.

943
00:47:14,353 --> 00:47:15,963
You, too.

944
00:47:30,412 --> 00:47:32,458
Oh, hey, sweetie.

945
00:47:32,632 --> 00:47:34,677
Uh, what are you doing here?

946
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,246
I just, um, wanted to come over.

947
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,857
Okay.

948
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:44,557
Can I come in?

949
00:47:44,731 --> 00:47:48,213
You know, it's just,
um, is everything okay?

950
00:47:48,387 --> 00:47:51,042
I mean, it's just not
a good time right now.

951
00:47:51,216 --> 00:47:54,088
Um, it's just, my
mom, she won't...

952
00:47:54,262 --> 00:47:59,746
she won't answer
my... my... my calls.

953
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:03,924
And... I wanna talk to her.

954
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:06,057
I understand it's hard.

955
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:07,406
Give her time.

956
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,668
Your mom's just sad.

957
00:48:08,842 --> 00:48:11,062
I mean, that you left like that.

958
00:48:11,236 --> 00:48:13,281
I know, but I still
wanna talk to her.

959
00:48:13,455 --> 00:48:14,761
Look, it's a bad time right now.

960
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:16,545
I just... I just
can't do it right now.

961
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:19,722
- I can't.
- Shelly, I'm really scared.

962
00:48:22,334 --> 00:48:25,119
I didn't... I didn't know
that I could never go back.

963
00:48:26,077 --> 00:48:27,677
I didn't know that I
could never go back,

964
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,776
and I'm... and
I'm really scared.

965
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,647
I'm sorry, I just...
I just can't.

966
00:48:31,821 --> 00:48:33,141
Not right now. I
need to be alone.

967
00:48:33,258 --> 00:48:34,650

I want to talk to you.

1019
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:44,013
I can't believe I left the
way I did the other night.

1020
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:46,103
I just feel so terrible.

1021
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:48,279
I just...

1022
00:51:48,453 --> 00:51:50,368
I don't know how I could
do anything I'd done.

1023
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:52,631
I don't know how I missed
out on our life together.

1024
00:51:52,805 --> 00:51:55,938
I just... I don't wanna
leave it on a phone message.

1025
00:51:56,113 --> 00:52:00,291
So could you please, please?

1026
00:52:01,988 --> 00:52:05,034
Please, please, please,
please call me back.

1027
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:30,408
<i>Is this the worst audience ever?</i>

1028
00:52:30,582 --> 00:52:33,237
I mean, I just wanna yell
at them and say, "Wake up!

1029
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:35,369
This is a live performance.
What, are you bored?

1030
00:52:35,543 --> 00:52:39,156
This is breast, and
rhinestones, and joy!"

1031
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:43,116
Oh, God.

1032
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,074
Can you help me with
my shoes, please?

1033
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:48,208
How'd you do this
before I was here?

1034
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:51,168
For 30 years, how'd you
make all your quick changes?

1035
00:52:51,342 --> 00:52:52,982
Oh, I'm glad you feel
so necessary, Jodie.

1036
00:52:53,082 --> 00:52:55,128
I mean, that's
important. That's good.

1037
00:52:56,825 --> 00:52:58,436
Do you hear where we're at?

1038
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,090
Can you help me
with my necklace?

1039
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:03,658
No.

1040
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:07,445
No, I wanna see you
get ready by yourself.

1041
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:09,597
I wanna see what would happen
to you if I didn't help.

1042
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:10,709
Really?

1043
00:53:12,406 --> 00:53:14,539
Okay, now you're
stressing me out.

1044
00:53:14,713 --> 00:53:15,757
Good.

1045
00:53:15,931 --> 00:53:16,971
You're always behind, too.

1046
00:53:17,106 --> 00:53:18,717
Oh, that is bullshit.

1047
00:53:18,891 --> 00:53:20,458
Well, good luck.

1048
00:53:20,632 --> 00:53:22,175
Well, you know what?
We have plenty of time,

1049
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,306
so I'm actually not
even worried about this.

1050
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:24,897
Well, I'm slightly concerned.

1051
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:26,918
I mean, with the wings, it's
gonna be a little tight.

1052
00:53:26,942 --> 00:53:28,181
Okay, well, then just
keep goin'. Stop talking.

1053
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,031
Oh, my God. Stop yelling at me.

1054
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,206
I'm gonna get anxious!

1055
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:32,339
I'm not even yelling.

1056
00:53:32,513 --> 00:53:34,167
Okay, where are my clip-ons?

1057
00:53:34,341 --> 00:53:35,734
I don't know.

1058
00:53:35,908 --> 00:53:38,171
- Did you take them?
- No.

1059
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,347
Ugh. Would you please help me

1060
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:42,262
- with my damn wings?
- Nope.

1061
00:53:42,436 --> 00:53:44,327
You should have thought of
this pointless challenge

1062
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:45,850
before the show, so
I was ready for it.

1063
00:53:45,874 --> 00:53:47,374
Well, here's your
warning for tomorrow.

1064
00:53:47,398 --> 00:53:48,790
- Okay.
- This is good.

1065
00:53:48,964 --> 00:53:50,662
This is character building!

1066
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:53,578
Just what I need is, a lesson
in character from a 19-year-old.

1067
00:53:57,103 --> 00:53:58,887
I got it, got it. I got it.

1068
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:01,020
Yeah, I got it.

1069
00:54:01,194 --> 00:54:03,979
Good! I'm glad you can get
into your costumes alone.

1070
00:54:07,896 --> 00:54:09,550
Shelly, come on.

1071
00:54:10,812 --> 00:54:11,857
Oh, oh, oh.

1072
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:13,467
Oh, no!

1073
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,692
The music is changing.
Jodie, we have to go.

1074
00:54:20,866 --> 00:54:22,911
You're a real asshole,
you know that?

1075
00:54:39,798 --> 00:54:40,973
Hey.

1076
00:54:41,147 --> 00:54:42,366
Hey.

1077
00:54:43,192 --> 00:54:44,803
May I have Ida take
a look at that?

1078
00:54:44,977 --> 00:54:46,283
Oh, no.

1079
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:48,720
They'll probably
dock me again, right?

1080
00:54:48,894 --> 00:54:50,591
Yeah, probably.

1081
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:53,899
Do you know how much
longer you're gonna be?

1082
00:54:54,073 --> 00:54:56,031
Oh. I don't know.

1083
00:54:56,205 --> 00:54:57,468
Not long.

1084
00:54:58,338 --> 00:55:00,384
Well, it doesn't
have to be perfect.

1085
00:55:00,558 --> 00:55:02,386
There's only a few shows left.

1086
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:07,434
You know, I was thinkin'...

1087
00:55:13,092 --> 00:55:14,833
I mean, you, more than anyone,

1088
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:18,576
the end of show might
be kind of upsetting.

1089
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:22,754
Yeah.

1090
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,410
Do you know what's next?

1091
00:55:28,586 --> 00:55:29,891
Nope.

1092
00:55:30,065 --> 00:55:31,458
You?

1093
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:35,462
Probably gonna stay here.

1094
00:55:35,636 --> 00:55:37,464
You know, work with the circus.

1095
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:39,597
Oh, yeah, that's
right. Full schedule.

1096
00:55:39,771 --> 00:55:40,859
Yeah.

1097
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:45,951
I mean, it's a much easier gig
for the money than the R.D.

1098
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:48,345
So, that's nice.

1099
00:55:49,607 --> 00:55:52,305
Oh, that's lucky. I mean,
you'll still be contributing

1100
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:54,742
to your pension and
getting health insurance.

1101
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:56,004
Yeah.

1102
00:55:57,658 --> 00:55:59,878
Um, okay.

1103
00:56:02,054 --> 00:56:03,795
I just wanted to check on you.

1104
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:12,412
You know...

1105
00:56:18,157 --> 00:56:19,680
if it means anything,

1106
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:24,903
you're a real legend,
Shell, you know?

1107
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,832
Okay.

1108
00:56:43,138 --> 00:56:44,531
Hey, Eddie.

1109
00:56:44,705 --> 00:56:45,750
Yeah?

1110
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:50,711
Wanna have dinner with
me one night this week?

1111
00:56:52,321 --> 00:56:53,801
You wanna have dinner with me?

1112
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:55,803
Yeah.

1113
00:56:57,718 --> 00:57:00,982
I mean, well, um, I
mean, yeah, of course.

1114
00:57:01,156 --> 00:57:02,156
That'd be nice.

1115
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:04,595
Great.

1116
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:07,075
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.

1117
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:57,098
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

1118
00:58:57,272 --> 00:58:58,272
- I'm here.
- Hey.

1119
00:59:00,406 --> 00:59:01,668
Hey.

1120
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:04,932
- It's okay.
- Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

1121
00:59:05,106 --> 00:59:06,325
No, you're not.

1122
00:59:06,499 --> 00:59:07,779
Just, you know,
debating dresses.

1123
00:59:07,935 --> 00:59:09,807
I mean, I probably
shouldn't tell you that.

1124
00:59:11,025 --> 00:59:12,461
Oh, funny story.

1125
00:59:13,288 --> 00:59:15,160
I didn't have time
to get my nails done,

1126
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:16,465
so I went to the drugstore,

1127
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,685
and right next to
my nail files...

1128
00:59:19,468 --> 00:59:20,992
- your favorite.
- Oh, thank you.

1129
00:59:21,819 --> 00:59:24,386
That's so... thank you,
that's so thoughtful.

1130
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:26,954
Yeah.

1131
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:34,745
I don't, uh,

1132
00:59:34,919 --> 00:59:36,877
I don't have anything for you.

1133
00:59:37,051 --> 00:59:38,139
It's okay.

1134
00:59:39,227 --> 00:59:40,794
You look nice.

1135
00:59:41,534 --> 00:59:43,580
Thank you.

1136
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:49,803
Do I look nice?

1137
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,892
Yeah. Sorry.

1138
00:59:52,066 --> 00:59:53,938
Yeah, you look... you
look really beautiful.

1139
00:59:54,112 --> 00:59:55,374
Oh, thank you.

1140
00:59:55,548 --> 00:59:57,594
But, well, you always
look beautiful.

1141
00:59:57,768 --> 00:59:59,160
Aw, thanks, Eddie.

1142
00:59:59,334 --> 01:00:01,815
Yeah. It's rare that I actually

1143
01:00:01,989 --> 01:00:04,775
get to see you in
a dress, not, uh,

1144
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:09,431
one of those rhinestone
bustier things, you know?

1145
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,390
I mean, with your
breasts hangin' out.

1146
01:00:11,564 --> 01:00:13,087
Well, I wouldn't say hanging.

1147
01:00:13,261 --> 01:00:15,133
No, no, no.

1148
01:00:16,047 --> 01:00:19,137
But you do, though. You
look really beautiful.

1149
01:00:19,311 --> 01:00:20,355
Even all covered up.

1150
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:26,448
- Maybe we should order.
- Yeah.

1151
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,276
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's order.

1152
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,462
So, how's Hannah?

1153
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,073
Hmm.

1154
01:00:42,247 --> 01:00:43,988
She's just about to
finish up school.

1155
01:00:45,032 --> 01:00:47,034
Wow. Wow.

1156
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:52,518
You know, I wondered
for such a long time,

1157
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:55,086
you know, where she was,
and what she was up to.

1158
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,393
If she, uh, looked
at all like me.

1159
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:00,613
Oh, well. She doesn't.

1160
01:01:00,787 --> 01:01:02,223
No. I know.

1161
01:01:02,397 --> 01:01:04,878
- Thank God.
- Hmm. Mm.

1162
01:01:05,052 --> 01:01:07,272
- What?
- What?

1163
01:01:07,446 --> 01:01:08,882
What'd you say?

1164
01:01:10,014 --> 01:01:11,972
Well, I... I mean, I met her.

1165
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:13,582
- What?
- Yeah, I met her

1166
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:15,237
in your dressing
room the other night.

1167
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,456
What? You introduced
yourself? You met her?

1168
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:20,807
Well, I didn't say...
I didn't say who I was.

1169
01:01:20,981 --> 01:01:23,070
I just, you know, she
asked me what my name was.

1170
01:01:23,244 --> 01:01:24,419
I said Eddie.

1171
01:01:24,593 --> 01:01:26,770
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

1172
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:31,339
So, is she still
living with the Kellys?

1173
01:01:31,513 --> 01:01:34,168
Well, I mean,
they're in college.

1174
01:01:34,342 --> 01:01:35,430
Yeah.

1175
01:01:37,432 --> 01:01:39,521
I always thought
that was gonna be a,

1176
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,175
like, a temporary solution.

1177
01:01:42,046 --> 01:01:44,831
Well, you're not
really in her life,

1178
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:47,834
so I don't understand why
it's any of your business.

1179
01:01:49,053 --> 01:01:50,968
No. I'm just curious.

1180
01:01:51,142 --> 01:01:53,013
Hmm. Well...

1181
01:01:57,104 --> 01:01:58,627
She's best friends
with Becky and Theo,

1182
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:00,586
and Lisa had all the
time in the world

1183
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,849
to devote to her
kids, so, you know?

1184
01:02:03,023 --> 01:02:06,679
Could you have gotten a sitter?

1185
01:02:06,853 --> 01:02:10,596
I made it work, and
that's what matters.

1186
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,380
Well, I was just...

1187
01:02:13,207 --> 01:02:14,774
I was just thinking
maybe, you know,

1188
01:02:14,948 --> 01:02:16,668
you could have gotten
a job where you worked

1189
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,256
the hours she was at school.

1190
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:20,911
I mean, you didn't have
to stay with the show.

1191
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,827
- Of course I did!
- Mm-hmm.

1192
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:27,656
Worked at a supermarket, or
waited tables, or retail.

1193
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:29,286
There's lots of
retail jobs, you know?

1194
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:30,964
I just can't win.

1195
01:02:31,138 --> 01:02:34,141
I mean, God, this is what
women have to deal with.

1196
01:02:34,315 --> 01:02:36,076
You know, all the time, people
are told... they're told,

1197
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,780
"You have to do this,
you have to do that",

1198
01:02:37,884 --> 01:02:39,470
and they'll do the thing
that you didn't want to do,

1199
01:02:39,494 --> 01:02:41,453
take the road that
you should have taken.

1200
01:02:41,627 --> 01:02:42,889
It's so fucking confusing.

1201
01:02:43,063 --> 01:02:44,383
And, Jesus, and,
you know, how...

1202
01:02:44,456 --> 01:02:45,892
Yeah.

1203
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:47,391
How are you saying any
of this when, really,

1204
01:02:47,415 --> 01:02:49,026
you were never there?

1205
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,331
Where were you?

1206
01:02:50,505 --> 01:02:51,985
We weren't even
in a relationship.

1207
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,726
Well, what do you want now?

1208
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:54,596
You wanna be her father
now, all of a sudden?

1209
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,989
No.

1210
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,122
That's not what I meant.

1211
01:02:59,993 --> 01:03:01,778
What do you want with me, Eddie?

1212
01:03:04,606 --> 01:03:06,217
I just wanna be your friend.

1213
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:09,307
Oh, God! Oh, my God,

1214
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:10,801
- this is so embarrassing.
- What?

1215
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,223
Why did I even come?

1216
01:03:12,397 --> 01:03:13,722
- Oh, my God, this is a bad idea.
- Shelly. What?

1217
01:03:13,746 --> 01:03:15,269
This is the worst fuckin' idea.

1218
01:03:15,443 --> 01:03:18,533
Christ! And, like you're in
any position to judge me.

1219
01:03:18,707 --> 01:03:19,947
Like that's what a friend does?

1220
01:03:20,057 --> 01:03:21,580
I didn't mean to
sound like that.

1221
01:03:21,754 --> 01:03:23,321
I love the show.

1222
01:03:23,495 --> 01:03:24,844
I love it.

1223
01:03:25,018 --> 01:03:27,064
I feel so good about
myself in this show.

1224
01:03:27,238 --> 01:03:29,457
And you, and Mary-Anne, and
Hannah can't understand.

1225
01:03:29,631 --> 01:03:32,243
But the costumes, the sets,

1226
01:03:33,026 --> 01:03:35,376
being bathed in that
light night after night.

1227
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:38,379
Feeling seen. Feeling beautiful.

1228
01:03:38,553 --> 01:03:39,903
That is powerful.

1229
01:03:40,077 --> 01:03:41,948
And I can't imagine
my life without it.

1230
01:03:42,122 --> 01:03:44,081
I just think it's
wild that, you know,

1231
01:03:44,255 --> 01:03:46,474
I'm the one who's been on
the stage all these years.

1232
01:03:46,648 --> 01:03:48,737
That I'm the one
people come for.

1233
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:50,435
That I'm the one on the poster!

1234
01:03:50,609 --> 01:03:53,394
And you, you, Eddie, are
gonna go on to this show

1235
01:03:53,568 --> 01:03:55,928
or that show and the producers
will just place you elsewhere

1236
01:03:56,006 --> 01:03:57,834
because you know how
to read a lighting cue.

1237
01:03:58,008 --> 01:04:00,488
You just tell someone
to push a damn button!

1238
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,275
And you're gonna be just fine.

1239
01:04:05,102 --> 01:04:07,626
And I just have to disappear.

1240
01:04:09,149 --> 01:04:10,847
Well, you know what?

1241
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:13,197
I have no regrets.

1242
01:04:14,198 --> 01:04:15,286
None.

1243
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,983
Eat your meat.

1244
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:53,411
There you go.

1245
01:04:54,281 --> 01:04:57,241
You know, when my
grandparents...

1246
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:02,507
Pearl and Bob, retired...

1247
01:05:02,681 --> 01:05:04,901
from the stationery business...

1248
01:05:07,033 --> 01:05:09,862
they drove around the Southwest

1249
01:05:10,036 --> 01:05:12,125
doing square dancing
competitions.

1250
01:05:14,475 --> 01:05:15,868
That's cute.

1251
01:05:16,042 --> 01:05:18,088
We should do that. You and me.

1252
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,352
I thought you
weren't gonna retire.

1253
01:05:22,179 --> 01:05:25,399
We could pick up
flouncy skirts and...

1254
01:05:28,576 --> 01:05:31,579
Shell, I fucked up a little.

1255
01:05:33,799 --> 01:05:35,409
I lost my shirt.

1256
01:05:36,889 --> 01:05:38,499
So what are you gonna do?

1257
01:05:42,677 --> 01:05:44,244
Well, I don't know.

1258
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:48,074
I don't know what to do.

1259
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,383
I...

1260
01:05:53,558 --> 01:05:54,863
I don't...

1261
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:57,040
I can't even...

1262
01:05:57,214 --> 01:05:59,172
I mean, I would... can I...

1263
01:05:59,346 --> 01:06:03,437
I can't even... I
can't fucking even ask.

1264
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:05,439
I can't ask you.

1265
01:06:05,613 --> 01:06:07,485
I can't even do it.

1266
01:06:07,659 --> 01:06:09,226
You have to stay here?

1267
01:06:12,925 --> 01:06:16,015
Yeah, just... I, um...

1268
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:20,411
I've been taking night shifts

1269
01:06:20,585 --> 01:06:23,196
and showering in
the locker room,

1270
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:25,894
and I've been sleeping in my
car for the last couple weeks.

1271
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:27,766
What? You didn't tell me!

1272
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,550
I promise you...

1273
01:06:29,724 --> 01:06:32,162
I promise you I'll be out
of your hair really fast.

1274
01:06:32,336 --> 01:06:33,728
It's okay.

1275
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:35,774
Fuck.

1276
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:02,556

Yeah, uh, we get the idea.

1326
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:04,521
Thank you, Sherry.

1327
01:11:04,695 --> 01:11:05,826
Shelly.

Thank you, Shelly.

You didn't like it?

1330
01:11:16,141 --> 01:11:17,534
Not what we're looking for.

1331
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:21,102
What are you lookin' for?

1332
01:11:22,713 --> 01:11:24,062
Just a different kind of vibe.

1333
01:11:24,236 --> 01:11:26,369
Okay, well, like what?

1334
01:11:26,543 --> 01:11:28,263
I actually have a very
versatile background.

1335
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:30,155
<i>Uh, you've been with
the Razzle Dazzle</i>

1336
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:32,200
<i>for many years, huh?</i>

1337
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:34,377
Yeah. I mean, before that.

1338
01:11:34,551 --> 01:11:35,745
Just tell me what
you're interested in

1339
01:11:35,769 --> 01:11:37,510
and I'll give it to you.

1340
01:11:39,033 --> 01:11:40,470
I mean, you're
lookin' for dancers.

1341
01:11:40,644 --> 01:11:43,386
I'm a dancer. I'm an
experienced dancer!

1342
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,083
<i>We're looking for dance acts</i>

1343
01:11:45,257 --> 01:11:49,827
that are either acrobatic or...

1344
01:11:52,133 --> 01:11:55,180
sexy.

1345
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:57,138
Oh, well, I can do that.

1346
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,880
Um, how about a...

1347
01:12:00,054 --> 01:12:01,854
Salome Dance of the Seven
Veils kind of thing?

1348
01:12:01,882 --> 01:12:04,145
Is that something
you'd be interested in?

1349
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,409
<i>It's gonna be a no for today.</i>

1350
01:12:07,714 --> 01:12:09,344
I mean, you can just write
somebody off like that?

1351
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:10,717
This is how it works?

1352
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:11,999
<i>This is how auditioning works!</i>

1353
01:12:12,023 --> 01:12:14,678
Thank you. Bye, Sherry. Next!

1354
01:12:14,852 --> 01:12:15,983
I worked really hard.

1355
01:12:16,157 --> 01:12:17,333
Please?

1356
01:12:17,507 --> 01:12:19,683
Please, I worked
really, really hard.

1357
01:12:19,857 --> 01:12:21,380
<i>You know what?</i>

1358
01:12:22,816 --> 01:12:25,036
<i>I can tell you worked
really hard, and I'm sorry.</i>

1359
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:27,734
It's just... if you were
a really good dancer,

1360
01:12:27,908 --> 01:12:29,127
it would be different.

1361
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:30,781
But your technique isn't great.

1362
01:12:30,955 --> 01:12:33,044
Okay? You were obviously
hired at the Razzle Dazzle

1363
01:12:33,218 --> 01:12:36,221
because you were beautiful
and young a long time ago.

1364
01:12:37,309 --> 01:12:39,224
<i>I mean, this isn't
news to you, is it?</i>

1365
01:12:39,398 --> 01:12:40,921
Maybe if you'd had some training

1366
01:12:41,095 --> 01:12:42,551
or you'd been with a
company in New York,

1367
01:12:42,575 --> 01:12:43,726
you might have an argument here.

1368
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,883
But, I mean, let's be honest.

1369
01:12:46,057 --> 01:12:47,450
You were hired

1370
01:12:47,624 --> 01:12:49,800
because you were sexy
and you were young.

1371
01:12:49,974 --> 01:12:51,473
I don't know how to
help you if that's...

1372
01:12:51,497 --> 01:12:52,977
if you don't understand

1373
01:12:53,151 --> 01:12:55,153
that's not what you're
selling anymore, baby.

1374
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,025
Next.

1375
01:13:00,071 --> 01:13:02,334
So is this what sexy girls do?

1376
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:04,249
Is this sexy enough for ya?

1377
01:13:04,423 --> 01:13:05,598
Next, please!

1378
01:13:05,772 --> 01:13:07,078
Is this what young
and sexy girls

1379
01:13:07,252 --> 01:13:08,645
- do so easily?
- <i>Goodbye.</i>

1380
01:13:08,819 --> 01:13:09,994
Oh, is that sexy? Yeah?

1381
01:13:10,168 --> 01:13:11,169
<i>Oh, my.</i>

1382
01:13:11,343 --> 01:13:12,170
Shell, come on, let's go.

1383
01:13:12,344 --> 01:13:13,519
<i>Get her out of here.</i>

1384
01:13:13,693 --> 01:13:14,999
- Shell?
- Who's she?

1385
01:13:15,173 --> 01:13:16,348
Shell, come on, let's go.

1386
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:18,437
- Shell, come on, let's...
- Let go of me!

1387
01:13:18,611 --> 01:13:20,178
I'm beautiful.

1388
01:13:20,352 --> 01:13:21,658
I'm 57.

1389
01:13:21,832 --> 01:13:24,878
And I'm beautiful,
you son of a bitch!

1390
01:13:25,052 --> 01:13:26,837
Thank you.

1391
01:13:27,011 --> 01:13:28,099
- Next.
- Shell.

1392
01:13:28,273 --> 01:13:29,273
Go do your audition.

1393
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,188
You're missing your audition!

1394
01:13:30,362 --> 01:13:31,842
I don't care about it!

1395
01:13:32,016 --> 01:13:33,931
You know, you
should have told me

1396
01:13:34,105 --> 01:13:36,542
a hundred years ago to
quit this stupid bullshit!

1397
01:13:36,716 --> 01:13:38,239
- What?
- God!

1398
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,956
You saw it happening.
You saw me losing Hannah!

1399
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:41,697
You didn't even say
anything! You were there!

1400
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:42,896
- What? Look...
- Yes!

1401
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:44,811
We didn't know
what was going on!

1402
01:13:44,985 --> 01:13:46,136
Shell, I... look, we didn't
know what was going on with you.

1403
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,510
Yes, you did.

1404
01:13:47,684 --> 01:13:49,139
You and Jodie want
me to be your mother,

1405
01:13:49,163 --> 01:13:50,687
but I already have a daughter.

1406
01:13:50,861 --> 01:13:52,689
- I have one!
- No, Shell, look, we love you.

1407
01:13:52,863 --> 01:13:54,081
- We...
- I don't love you!

1408
01:13:54,255 --> 01:13:55,735
I don't care!

1409
01:13:55,909 --> 01:13:57,539
I don't care! Look,
what do I have to show

1410
01:13:57,563 --> 01:14:00,740
for the last 30
years of my life!

1411
01:14:00,914 --> 01:14:04,004
I don't even get to keep
a piece of my costume!

1412
01:14:04,178 --> 01:14:05,745
Shell, where are you going?

1413
01:14:05,919 --> 01:14:07,747
I don't know. And I
don't have to tell you!

1414
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:09,116
No, I know. The only
reason... I can drive you...

1415
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,446
Shell, you shouldn't be driving!

1416
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:12,273
I'm not going home!

1417
01:14:32,816 --> 01:14:35,079
Fuckin'... fuck you!

1418
01:14:36,646 --> 01:14:38,648
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1419
01:14:38,822 --> 01:14:40,214
Fuckin'!

1420
01:15:25,259 --> 01:15:27,000
<i>I know this is probably weird</i>

1421
01:15:27,174 --> 01:15:30,787
<i>leaving on a voicemail,
but I just thought</i>

1422
01:15:30,961 --> 01:15:34,704
<i>maybe we could just remember</i>

1423
01:15:34,878 --> 01:15:37,358
<i>this one thing I read somewhere.</i>

1424
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:41,232
<i>You know, our mothers are
not saints or saviors,</i>

1425
01:15:41,406 --> 01:15:43,539
<i>just regular people
doin' the best they can</i>

1426
01:15:43,713 --> 01:15:45,715
<i>with the tools they have.</i>

1427
01:15:45,889 --> 01:15:47,543
<i>I know that's not
a great excuse,</i>

1428
01:15:47,717 --> 01:15:50,241
<i>but I just want you to know</i>

1429
01:15:50,415 --> 01:15:53,244
<i>that I love you,</i>

1430
01:15:53,418 --> 01:15:57,509
<i>however imperfect
that might sound.</i>

1431
01:15:57,683 --> 01:15:59,293
<i>That's just...</i>

1432
01:16:01,426 --> 01:16:03,297
<i>I just wanted you to know that.</i>

1433
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:09,347
<i>And that life is full
of contradictions.</i>

1434
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:13,307
And, you know, this
probably sounds crazy,

1435
01:16:15,919 --> 01:16:18,617
I've always only wanted
the best for you.

1436
01:16:21,838 --> 01:16:25,885
<i>I've always been with you</i>

1437
01:16:26,059 --> 01:16:28,758
<i>and I just wanted
you to be safe.</i>

1438
01:16:28,932 --> 01:16:30,716
<i>Safe and happy,</i>

1439
01:16:31,978 --> 01:16:36,156
<i>and fulfilled, and
follow your dreams.</i>

1440
01:16:37,854 --> 01:16:39,290
<i>Just be you.</i>

1441
01:16:46,427 --> 01:16:47,603
I love you.

1442
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:03,053
Places, please.

1443
01:17:03,227 --> 01:17:05,751
This is your places
call for the last time.

1444
01:17:16,153 --> 01:17:17,807
To the very last showgirls.

1445
01:17:17,981 --> 01:17:19,983
To the very last showgirls!

1446
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:28,252
<i>Places, please.</i>

1447
01:17:28,426 --> 01:17:31,908
<i>This is your places
call for the last time.</i>

1448
01:17:32,082 --> 01:17:34,042
<i>This is your places call
for the final performance</i>

1449
01:17:34,214 --> 01:17:36,260
<i>of The Razzle Dazzle.</i>

1450
01:17:50,927 --> 01:17:51,971
Mom!

1451
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:55,409
Hannah?

1452
01:17:57,368 --> 01:17:59,457
What are you doing here?

1453
01:18:15,255 --> 01:18:17,910
- Hey.
- <i>You're lucky.</i>

1454
01:18:18,084 --> 01:18:20,870
You're probably never gonna
leave this theater, huh?

1455
01:18:21,044 --> 01:18:23,437
Yeah, you're right.
Probably not.

1456
01:18:23,611 --> 01:18:25,744
Your ghost is probably
gonna haunt this theater.

1457
01:18:25,918 --> 01:18:29,443
Yeah, I never
thought about that.

1458
01:18:30,793 --> 01:18:32,335
I can't believe this is
gonna be the last time

1459
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:34,318
I set foot on that stage.

1460
01:18:34,492 --> 01:18:35,711
I know.

1461
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:39,062
You know,

1462
01:18:39,236 --> 01:18:41,020
I think I'm gonna go
to Hannah's graduation.

1463
01:18:41,194 --> 01:18:42,587
Yeah.

1464
01:18:42,761 --> 01:18:45,503
- I might even move there.
- Really? Wow.

1465
01:18:45,677 --> 01:18:46,809
Yeah.

1466
01:18:48,201 --> 01:18:51,335
Or I could stay here
and maybe get a job

1467
01:18:51,509 --> 01:18:54,207
with Annette, cocktailing.

1468
01:18:54,381 --> 01:18:55,905
Cute outfits.

1469
01:18:56,079 --> 01:18:57,863
Well, not like this one.

1470
01:18:58,037 --> 01:18:59,604
Yeah.

1471
01:19:01,301 --> 01:19:04,870
Well, one last chance
to give 'em hell.

1472
01:19:05,044 --> 01:19:06,044
Ha.

1473
01:19:08,004 --> 01:19:09,614
Shelly.

1474
01:19:12,356 --> 01:19:13,923
