<i>What are you eating?</i>

2
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:05,033
I am eating some "toona".

3
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:09,871
<i>"Toona"? You mean "tuna".</i>

4
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:11,573
<i>You're gonna turn into a tuna.</i>

5
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,273
<i>It's weird.</i>
<i>She said she's got no mayo.</i>

6
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,142
<i>- She said she'd run out, but...</i>
<i>- No mayo?</i>

7
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,210
<i>I just...</i>
<i>I refuse to believe that.</i>

8
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,680
<i>I think she's holding out on me.</i>

9
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,715
That's disgusting.
Look, when are you home?

10
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:22,750
<i>Yeah, er, later.</i>
<i>What would you like for dinner?</i>

11
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:24,686
<i>- What can I bring you back?</i>
- Oh, anything.

12
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:27,287
I mean, not "toona", please.

13
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:28,488
<i>Not "toona".</i>

14
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,424
- Tuna.
<i>- Tuna. Love you.</i>

15
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,092
He's wriggling.

16
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,193
<i>Good.</i>

17
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:34,862
<i>Getting that head all the way</i>
<i>down there ready to...</i>

18
00:01:34,963 --> 00:01:36,698
Oh, God,
not yet, I hope.

19
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,834
<i>Are you talking to me</i>
<i>whilst having a wee?</i>

20
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:40,868
What?

21
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,570
<i>A strong-sounding wee?</i>

22
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:44,906
It's the bath.

23
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:46,608
<i>Yeah, that's a poor...</i>

24
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:49,343
Oh, the people
at Number 32 have left.

25
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,378
- <i>Oh, good, good.</i>
- I know. They got...

26
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:53,548
They got in this camper van
with all their stuff.

27
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:55,248
The kids and that dog.

28
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,483
<i>I love the dog.</i>

29
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:57,885
It was hanging out the window.

30
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:58,920
That dog is a nightmare.

31
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,021
<i>I love the dog.</i>

32
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:01,188
<i>- Can we do that?</i>
- No.

33
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,289
<i>Can we do that?</i>

34
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,224
No. Wait, do what?

35
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:05,760
<i>Definitely get a camper van.</i>

36
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,295
No.

37
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,598
No, thank you.

38

One more time.

59
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:48,295
Push.

60
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,112
Hello.

61
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:11,786
Who are you?

62
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:17,258
Mm. What is it?

Aw.

There. Hey, hey.

68
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:41,782
Can you check on it?

69
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,384
It doesn't feel real, does it?

70
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,520
<i>Please refrain from charging</i>

- Did it hurt?
- No.

73
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:52,193
We've got to get
everybody off this floor now.

74
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:54,795
Why are you looking at me
like that?

75
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,263
'Cause you're amazing.

76
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,402
You need to squeeze
the breast into a sort
of burger shape.

77
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:02,736
- Right.
- You haven't peed yet?

78
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,672
- Not yet.
- Aim for the baby's nose...

79
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,107
Okay, yeah, got it.

80
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,576
...you need
to bring baby to you,

81
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:09,443
otherwise you'll end up stuck
in an uncomfortable position.

82
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:11,412
Okay.
Do you have
somewhere to go?

83
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,413
Er...

84
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:14,148
Out the city?
Space for baby?

85
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:15,116
Yes.

86
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,520
What, we can't go home? No?

87
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,355
And then
you push him on,
nose to mouth, okay?

88
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:23,891
Thank you.
Do try and pee.

89
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,626
Yeah, sure, I'll try my best.

90
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,194
And, er, baby'll need
a name before you go.

Bob.
No. You used to be funny.

We love you.

104

She did it. She did it!

105
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,449
I did it.

106
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:25,319

Well, the whole city's
underwater.

178
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,518
They know that.

179
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,621
You must have had an awful time.
We've been ever so worried.

180
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:56,990
Sweetheart, sit down.
Have something to eat.

181
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,693
Oh, thank you.

182
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,094
- He's beautiful.
- I think so.

183
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:02,764
Go and help your son
unpack the car.

184
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,398
No, it's fine, Mum. All done.

185
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:06,768
Should have got out ages ago.

186
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,269
Yeah, but we didn't know
this was gonna happen, did we?

187
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,004
I did warn you.

188
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,272
We were a bit
preoccupied, Dad.

189
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:13,875
Too preoccupied
for the birth of your own son?

190
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:15,944
Oh, right, 'cause you were
there as the bloody midwife

191
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,211
while I was having that one,
were you?

192
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,112
I was involved.
Oh, sorry.

193
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:20,682
Sweetheart,
he was very involved, yeah.

194
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:22,983
- Oh, this looks delicious.
- Well, you must be starving.

195
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,284
Eating for two.
I used to be famished.

196
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,987
And meat. I used to just
want to eat entire cows.

197
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,590
- Do you remember?
- I do.

198
00:16:29,223 --> 00:16:31,325
We've been keeping supplies
for years now.

199
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,360
You lot kept calling me
a hoarder.

200
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:35,095
Who's laughing now, eh?

201
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,130
Don't know how you townies
managed to cope.

202
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,165
Can you give us a hand?

203
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,234
What did you just call us?

204
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,469
Well, stuck that long in London,
what do you expect?

205
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,338
We can't do our jobs
out of London, Dad.

206
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,240
What, engineer? Cutting hair?

207
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:48,510
Your mum's feeding the village,
obviously.

208
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:50,778
Well, everyone's doing
their bit. She doesn't cut hair.

209
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:51,846
Come in!

210
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,682
Well, I mean, I do.
Yeah, to the bloody stars.

211
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:57,785
- Breakfast TV.
- Yeah, to the bloody stars.

212
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:01,154
Erm, we just prep the boxes,
and then this one delivers
them all.

213
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:03,625
Tea?
Oh, no. No, thanks.

214
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:05,894

215
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,227

216
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:09,463
They just got here.
Hey.

217
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:17,204
I... I'll go and start this.

218
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,221
It's her son.

219
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,357
He's not back yet.

220
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:50,939
- How's the ark?
- Er, pretty mouldy.

221
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,440
But Dad says
it has good bones, so...

222
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,677
What happened
to our home?

223
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:01,015
The street was gone.
But, but... we build a new home.

224
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:03,518
Yeah?

225
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,853
Yeah.

226
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,394
Here we go.

227
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:19,701
What do you think?
What do you think?

228
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:30,277
Okay, okay, okay.

229
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:33,815
I know, I know, I know.

230
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,125
Ow, Zeb, ow.

231
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,618
Baby. Baby. Mum.

232
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:16,524
Mum, mum, mum, mum, mum.

233
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,860
I'm sorry yours isn't here.

234
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,198
Has the cork always been here?

235
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:32,172
Where are your posters?

236
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:35,743
Didn't have any posters.
Of course you didn't.

237
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:42,016
What, not even of maps?
Or fish? The periodic table?

238
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,318
You're making me sound so sexy.

239
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,755
I don't remember it
being like this last time.

240
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:50,792
We just fucked last time.

241
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:54,829

Go on.
No, not at all. No, no.

259

- It's just safer that way.
- Easier. He means easier.

260
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:21,474
No, I mean safer.
She's not a child.

I'll stay put in the car.

263

Supplies are low.
Roads are blocked.

264
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:32,887
Ports are flooded.
Runways are flooded.

265
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:34,522
We live on an island.
On an island.

266
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:37,457
Yeah, I know, but...
So, people get panicky.

267
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:41,095
I'm sorry. This...

268
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:46,701
I know this is awful for you.

269
00:22:47,268 --> 00:22:49,537
But I am so happy you're here.

270
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:51,606

271
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:57,245
Hey.

272
00:22:57,612 --> 00:22:59,379
Won't be long, okay?
Hmm.

273
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,117
Bye.

274
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:04,819
Hmm.

275
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:09,824
Anyone seen the shopping bag?

276
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:11,259
No, wait, It's all right.
Found it.

277
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,793
We should head up
the high street.

278
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,961

and you just took it...

286
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:51,933
And they had
this summer romance

287
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:55,303
and they, er,
really like each other, and...

288
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,606
But she's supposed
to go back to Australia,

289
00:23:58,706 --> 00:24:00,308
but she ends up staying and...

290
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:06,180
And he's got this, like,
this gang, the T-Birds.

291
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:11,652
And he needs to look, I guess,
like, er, I don't know,

292
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:13,521
like really cool
in front of them.

293
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:14,588
I mean, he's basically...

294
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:16,524
he's just being
a dick at this point.

295
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,162
Fuck.

296
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:38,212
Hmm.

297
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:44,218
Kick, kick, kick, kick.
Where are you running to? Hmm?

298
00:25:31,432 --> 00:25:32,633
Yeah, they will be back soon.

299
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,871
I just... I...
I wasn't expecting anyone.

300
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:49,150
Is your house...

301
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:52,787
Er, where will you...

302
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:06,200
Er, er, baby. I'm sorry.

303
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,573
I just, erm...
We don't have any food.

304
00:26:25,352 --> 00:26:26,320
Thank you.

305
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:39,100
I know, I know, I know.

306
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,769
I know, I know.
It's fucking awful. I know.

307
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:46,107
I know, I know. Where are they?

308
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,891
I'm sorry.

309
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:42,229
We'll fix this.

310
00:27:44,031 --> 00:27:48,802
We'll go home and you'll
grow tall and strong and kind,

311
00:27:48,903 --> 00:27:50,838
and you won't remember
any of this.

312
00:27:55,476 --> 00:27:57,512
This isn't how
it's supposed to be.

313
00:27:58,012 --> 00:28:02,049
I'm sorry.

314
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:07,955
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

315
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:48,455
I'm so sorry.

316
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:55,863
I will look after you
like you looked after me.

317
00:29:57,031 --> 00:30:00,100
I love you.

318
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:05,105
Do you wanna talk about it?

319
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:10,044
I can't.

320
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:22,323
It wasn't quick.

321
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:32,933
I'm so sorry.

322
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:38,339
I'm so sorry.

323
00:32:42,664 --> 00:32:44,064
You're up. Are you...

324
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,536
Sorry. I was just...

325
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:53,173
Why don't you come in,
let me make you a cup of tea?

326
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,845
- And you must be hungry.
- I'm going for a walk.

327
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:58,178
Well, I don't think
that's a good idea.

328
00:32:58,245 --> 00:32:59,681
I'm going for a walk.

329
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:02,684
Okay.
Grandad's going for a walk.

330
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:06,888
Babe?

331
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:10,959
Your dad, he's, er, he's...
Look, something's not right.

332
00:33:11,058 --> 00:33:12,292
I don't know where he's going.

333
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,328
Huh?
Look, can you take the baby?

334
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:30,043
No!

<i>We need to leave.</i>

338

They want people
to join shelters.

339
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:23,430
No, I'm not joining a shelter.

340
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:27,635
I'm sorry.

341
00:34:28,937 --> 00:34:30,237
I just... I...

342
00:34:31,005 --> 00:34:34,609
I... I just can't.
Too many people.

343
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:36,276
I just...

344
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:40,380
I just can't do it.

345
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:44,384
I don't know
what else there is.

346
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:57,532
I love you.

347
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,335
I love you.

348
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:16,483
Stop pushing!

349
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:19,921
Get back!

350
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:21,723
People will be, er...

351
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:24,224
I don't know, calmer around us
with having a baby.

352
00:35:24,324 --> 00:35:26,159
They trampled on my mum's neck.

353
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:28,630
People are starving to death.
They don't give a fuck.

354
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,931
People give a fuck.
No.

355
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:31,633
No, no, they don't.
I don't believe that.

356
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:34,134
Look, I'm not having
an existential argument with you

357
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:35,670
about the inherent
shittiness of people.

358
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,039
I'm telling you,
they trampled on my mum's neck.

359
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:39,641
That's why I'm saying I'll go.

360
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:43,511
You stay in the car. I'll go.

361
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:47,649
No. You're his food.
You're his whole ecosystem.

362
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:54,254
Just wait. I can do it.
Just give me a minute.

363
00:36:43,938 --> 00:36:46,674
- This is your last load!

364
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:50,645
Stop pushing!

365
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:52,647
Everyone just stay
where you are.

366
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:54,816
- Move back. Move back.
- Stay where you are.

367
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:58,318
Don't make me pull it. I will.
It's a final warning.

368
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,892
We can't raise him
in a fucking car.

369
00:38:11,092 --> 00:38:13,326
We're not raising him in a car.
We're trying to get through.

370
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:14,796
We're not in a shelter
because of me,

371
00:38:14,896 --> 00:38:17,464
and we need to do what's right
for him and for you.

372
00:38:17,532 --> 00:38:21,401
We have to do what is right
for all of us.

373
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:25,372
Hmm?

374
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:33,413
We need to go to a shelter.

375
00:38:34,649 --> 00:38:35,650
Okay.

376
00:39:11,484 --> 00:39:13,386
Ladies and gents,
I can understand...

377
00:39:13,486 --> 00:39:15,056
...you've been waiting
many hours outside,

378
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:17,925
but unfortunately, there are
no more places at this time.

379
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:21,729
We can only accept children
and one primary carer.

380
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:30,705
<i>We're taking children</i>
<i>and one parent only.</i>

381
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,975
Look, it's okay.

382
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:37,945
I'll come back for you,
er, when things are calmer.

383
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:39,981
There'll be food here.

384
00:39:41,282 --> 00:39:43,517
It'll be good
for you both, okay?

385
00:39:43,618 --> 00:39:46,120
Okay, well, no, no, no,
none of us'll go.

386
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:47,622
No, you have to.

387
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:49,523
No, we'll just...
we'll just keep driving.

388
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,125
If you're here, you're safe.

389
00:39:51,626 --> 00:39:53,261
'Cause...

390
00:39:56,097 --> 00:39:57,164
...I can't protect you.

391
00:39:58,766 --> 00:40:00,467
I can't protect you or Zeb,

392
00:40:01,002 --> 00:40:05,840
and... and it will feel good
to just know that you're safe.

393
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,976
I don't give a fuck
what will feel good.

394
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:11,045
We have a baby.
I know.

395
00:40:11,212 --> 00:40:14,949
No, you have a baby.
We're a family.

396
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:18,653
I feel like I'm dying.

397
00:40:23,024 --> 00:40:24,191
I will let you down.

398
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:31,165
We stay together.

399
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:38,839
We stay together.

400
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:04,497
<i>Unknown vehicle</i>
<i>arriving at the gate. Over.</i>

401
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:06,801
<i>So, it's shelter 26.</i>
<i>It's breakfast at 7:00.</i>

402
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:09,937
<i>Er, we have a strict</i>
<i>lights-out policy at 9:00.</i>

403
00:41:10,504 --> 00:41:12,640
Now, you need to check the rota
for any laundry.

404
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:15,509
And at the moment
we don't have any hot water,

405
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:18,112
so it's cold showers only,
I'm afraid.

406
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:21,248
And this is your bed. Okay?

407
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,517
Yeah.

408
00:41:54,749 --> 00:41:58,085
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

409
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:21,175
There we go.

410
00:42:21,442 --> 00:42:24,545
- Come on. There we go.
- Please.

411
00:42:25,346 --> 00:42:27,381
- Baby, baby.
- Just do it.

412
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:29,283
I can't put...
I can't...

413
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:33,621
Come on, baby boy.

414
00:42:39,894 --> 00:42:41,662
<i>We would remind you,</i>

415
00:42:41,729 --> 00:42:44,465
<i>that there is no smoking</i>
<i>inside the building.</i>

416
00:42:46,467 --> 00:42:49,603
You taking it all in? Hmm?

417
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:58,045
What you looking at?

418
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:01,849
<i>Shelter 27,</i>
<i>lunch is now postponed.</i>

419
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,638
Hey. Ooh!

420
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:30,277
You think you're clever?

421
00:43:32,346 --> 00:43:33,548
Have you taken my pillow?

422
00:43:34,048 --> 00:43:36,050
Who the fuck do you think
you are? Have you taken
my pillow?

423
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:38,686
Hey!
Have you taken my pillow?

424
00:43:38,752 --> 00:43:39,753
Will you pack it in?

425
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,821
Sit down.
It's all good.

426
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:43,124
I can see
that's my fucking pillow!

427
00:43:43,224 --> 00:43:45,493
- Pack it in.
- Behave yourselves.

428
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:47,728
I'm telling you,
you've got the wrong guy.

429
00:43:49,063 --> 00:43:51,465
Move your hands off.
That's my fucking pillow!

430
00:43:51,566 --> 00:43:53,934
- And you know full well.
- Lads!

431
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:56,370
- Enough!
- It's my pillow!

432
00:43:56,505 --> 00:43:59,173
Get the fuck off me.
It's just a pillow.

433
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:02,009
Move back!

434
00:44:03,612 --> 00:44:05,179
You two,
behave yourselves.

435
00:44:06,147 --> 00:44:08,315
The whole city's gone under.

436
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:12,887
It's just sewage
and dead animals.

437
00:44:13,588 --> 00:44:15,089
And we almost left it too late.

438
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:17,958
I don't know why.
I just thought we could...

439
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:20,461
I just thought we could sit it
out or something, you know?

440
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:22,597
Mm-hmm.
Everybody did.

441
00:44:23,097 --> 00:44:26,267
How old?
Er, he's three months.

442
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,035
She's five.

443
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:32,940
- She's sweet.
- She's all right.

444
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,909
I'm not gonna throw her
out of a window,

445
00:44:34,975 --> 00:44:36,578
but she's gotta stay cute.

446
00:44:36,645 --> 00:44:38,012
Oh!

447
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:42,249
We've been here a month.

448
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:45,252
There are worse places.

449
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:48,956
Like, actually.
I've been in them.

450
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,126
We were in one before here
and a refuge before that.

451
00:44:52,561 --> 00:44:53,961
That's a lot to cram
in five months.

452
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:58,600
Oh, yeah. She's busy. Got plans.

453
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:01,769
That woman, the woman
in the bed next to me,

454
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:04,606
she had to leave.
Raiders stole all her food.

455
00:45:04,673 --> 00:45:07,408
Too slow. Oh!

456
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:12,346
As soon
as she was born, he bailed.

457
00:45:15,316 --> 00:45:18,319
Took one look at the pair of us
and said, "No, not having that".

458
00:45:20,154 --> 00:45:21,922
I guess I should be
in shock still.

459
00:45:22,022 --> 00:45:23,224
But then all of this happened

460
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:27,094
and I genuinely
couldn't give a shit.

461
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:36,437
He's probably dead.

462
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:39,373
Yeah, he would have panicked.

463
00:45:43,177 --> 00:45:44,378
He can't swim.

464
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,048
He would have been terrified.

465
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:50,884
Absolutely shitting himself.

466
00:45:53,622 --> 00:45:55,089
I hope it was quick.

467
00:45:57,825 --> 00:46:00,427
Where's your, er...
Dead, probably.

468
00:46:01,462 --> 00:46:03,297
I mean, maybe. I don't know.

469
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:08,035
I mean, I don't know.
He isn't here.

470
00:46:19,813 --> 00:46:20,848
You know what? You go.

471
00:46:21,248 --> 00:46:23,417
I'll hold him
and then we can switch.

472
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:24,918
Are you sure?
Yeah.

473
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,627
<i>Lights out at 9:00 p.m.</i>

474
00:46:32,694 --> 00:46:34,094
Thank you.

475
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:44,338
Where is he?

476
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,420
Fuck!

477
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:42,463
Fuck's sake.

478
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:15,963
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

479
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:19,567
For God's sake.

480
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:28,175
Come on. Come on.

481
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:31,078
Are you okay? He needs milk.

482
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,083
- Shut the fuck up.
- No, you shut up, dude.

483
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:38,285
Come here.

484
00:48:57,705 --> 00:49:00,708
Yes!

485
00:49:00,775 --> 00:49:02,476
A little sheep sound.

486
00:49:02,577 --> 00:49:03,878
Ooh!

487
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:07,615
The trees!

488
00:49:07,715 --> 00:49:08,683
What's that?

489
00:49:11,985 --> 00:49:15,590
It's so perfect.

490
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:19,026
She's coming to get you, Zeb.
Here she comes.

491
00:49:21,261 --> 00:49:22,996
There's this commune
on an island.

492
00:49:23,096 --> 00:49:25,299
- Right, course.
- I know.

493
00:49:25,399 --> 00:49:27,067
Of course there's
a fucking commune on an island

494
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:29,637
that's full of rich people
making sourdough.

495
00:49:29,904 --> 00:49:30,939
And my friend is there.

496
00:49:31,004 --> 00:49:34,308
She's one
of the founding members.

497
00:49:35,242 --> 00:49:37,545
That's a thing.
That's how she talks.

498
00:49:37,645 --> 00:49:38,412
Okay.

499
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,048
She used to be
in stocks and shares and...

500
00:49:42,015 --> 00:49:44,451
I don't know
what I'm talking about.
Can you tell?

501
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:47,822
I mean, I used to blow-dry
politicians' hair

502
00:49:47,922 --> 00:49:51,526
before they spoke
about the economy
on breakfast television.

503
00:49:52,694 --> 00:49:54,194
We're doomed.
Yeah.

504
00:49:55,028 --> 00:49:57,532
She had some sort
of epiphany one day.

505
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:01,401
Not like...
like a religious thing.

506
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:04,037
More like, "Oh, fuck.
What am I doing with my life?"

507
00:50:04,104 --> 00:50:06,674
"Like, does this actually have
meaning or..."

508
00:50:07,942 --> 00:50:11,546
Mm. And so she just decides
she's not fucking doing that
any more,

509
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:12,981
and she has all this money,

510
00:50:13,548 --> 00:50:16,951
so, well, she goes
and she sets up this commune...

511
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:20,788
Just have to figure out
how to get there.

512
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:24,391
You should come.

513
00:50:24,592 --> 00:50:25,527
What?

514
00:50:43,011 --> 00:50:49,784
Can we go to sleep now, please?

515
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,285
Keep moving!
Just keep moving!

516
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:26,854
Move! Move! Move!

517
00:51:32,594 --> 00:51:34,629
Come on.
Where are you going?

518
00:51:39,634 --> 00:51:41,803
- Oi, oi, look at this.
- A few more over here.

519
00:51:41,903 --> 00:51:43,470
- Bring that bag.
- I've got this one.

520
00:51:43,538 --> 00:51:44,539
Faster.
Check in there, man.

521
00:51:44,606 --> 00:51:46,975
Check in there.

522
00:51:47,609 --> 00:51:49,510
Where are you going?

523
00:51:55,817 --> 00:51:58,586
Hey! What are they doing?
Please, please!

524
00:51:58,653 --> 00:52:00,655
- Get out!
- They've got babies.

525
00:52:00,788 --> 00:52:01,956
- Just drive.
- Come on.

526
00:52:02,056 --> 00:52:03,691
- Fuck.
- Go, go, go!

527
00:52:18,072 --> 00:52:20,407
Can you slow down? Please?

528
00:52:29,383 --> 00:52:31,251
Actually,
we can get out here.

529
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:36,557
Stop the fucking car.

530
00:52:47,267 --> 00:52:51,338
I'm here. I'm here.

531
00:52:55,409 --> 00:52:57,679
Cunts.

532
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:03,885
He's gonna go back
to the shelter

533
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:06,888
- and we won't be there.
- Try not to think about it.

534
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:10,158
I feel sick.

535
00:53:10,725 --> 00:53:12,292
Yeah,
that's because you're starving.

536
00:53:12,694 --> 00:53:14,227
Have we eaten
everything?

537
00:53:14,662 --> 00:53:16,931
We have
these delicious babies.

538
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,400
They are delicious.

539
00:53:22,335 --> 00:53:24,572
We'll find something.

540
00:53:40,988 --> 00:53:42,389
There's no food.

541
00:53:44,058 --> 00:53:45,660
It's all right. Come on.

542
00:54:01,776 --> 00:54:02,744
Hello?

543
00:54:06,714 --> 00:54:07,648
Hi.

544
00:54:08,381 --> 00:54:10,685
Hi.

545
00:54:11,152 --> 00:54:15,656
I have food.

546
00:54:32,774 --> 00:54:33,674
Here.

547
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:40,848
Thank you.

548
00:54:45,086 --> 00:54:45,987
Mm.

549
00:54:46,053 --> 00:54:49,657
I'll just...
Mm. Thank you.

550
00:54:54,095 --> 00:54:55,696
Where... where are you going?

551
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:59,133
Not sure.

552
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:01,301
- And you're travelling alone?
- I am.

553
00:55:01,803 --> 00:55:03,671
We're heading
to my friend's commune.

554
00:55:04,205 --> 00:55:05,706
Do you know if we're
near the coast?

555
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:08,876
Well, there are communes
on all the islands,

556
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:11,245
so, you want to head
to the northern pier.

557
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:12,580
That's where I got
the boat from, at least.

558
00:55:12,647 --> 00:55:14,749
But...
...she might have stopped.

559
00:55:14,816 --> 00:55:15,583
I... I don't know.

560
00:55:15,683 --> 00:55:17,417
- You've been to one?
- Yeah.

561
00:55:17,518 --> 00:55:19,419
What?

562
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:26,961
No, it's... They're perfect.

563
00:55:27,028 --> 00:55:29,096
It's exactly where you wanna be
with your child.

564
00:55:30,898 --> 00:55:32,066
Why did you leave, then?

565
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:39,006
Because they wanted to forget.

566
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:42,009
And...

567
00:55:42,777 --> 00:55:47,414
I don't want
to forget before, so...

568
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:25,846
It was my fault.

569
00:57:28,516 --> 00:57:30,418
I thought we'd be safer
near a city,

570
00:57:30,618 --> 00:57:32,687
but then we just
didn't get out in time.

571
00:57:37,725 --> 00:57:40,027
It was a bridge. Er...

572
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:43,998
It was strange. It was so...

573
00:57:46,334 --> 00:57:48,569
simple, straightforward. Um...

574
00:57:51,973 --> 00:57:52,940
I was...

575
00:57:54,108 --> 00:57:54,809
at the end.

576
00:57:55,076 --> 00:57:56,744
They were in the middle,
all three of them.

577
00:57:59,613 --> 00:58:01,148
She had both of them...

578
00:58:03,751 --> 00:58:05,920
in her arms,
and then they weren't there.

579
00:58:15,529 --> 00:58:17,198
It was just... just dust.

580
00:58:22,236 --> 00:58:28,075
- Underneath them there was water.
- Water. Rubble.

581
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:33,247
And then there were people
running and screaming.

582
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:42,189
I'm, erm... I'm gonna go back.

583
00:58:44,959 --> 00:58:47,928
I'm going to go back to the city
to where they were.

584
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:56,670
I think it'll be sharper there.
Hmm.

585
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,041
Sharper?

586
00:59:07,114 --> 00:59:10,084
It's fine. I don't speak
to people for days on end.

587
00:59:10,184 --> 00:59:11,218
And then...

588
00:59:13,287 --> 00:59:15,022
when you were dancing
just then...

589
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:24,799
Thank you.

590
00:59:29,503 --> 00:59:30,704
Thank you.

591
00:59:33,508 --> 00:59:34,608
Hmm.

592
00:59:37,812 --> 00:59:39,980
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

593
00:59:43,884 --> 00:59:44,819
Oh.

594
01:00:59,528 --> 01:01:00,861
Good morning.

595
01:01:08,637 --> 01:01:12,306
Why are you so awake?

596
01:01:20,582 --> 01:01:22,049
Again? No?

597
01:01:25,286 --> 01:01:27,855
What's the part where
they say "The passion"?

598
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:29,323
Oh, no, we did that?

599
01:01:43,204 --> 01:01:46,207
This is it.
The northern pier.

600
01:01:58,587 --> 01:02:02,756
What's up here?
Hmm? What's up this way?

601
01:02:04,593 --> 01:02:06,860
He said
wait here until she comes.

602
01:02:08,996 --> 01:02:11,465
Yeah.
And if she doesn't?

603
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,435
She will.

604
01:02:17,606 --> 01:02:20,341
She will. Yeah, she will.

605
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:30,985
She will come.

606
01:02:37,191 --> 01:02:38,225
She will come.

607
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:46,867
Hey.

608
01:02:51,472 --> 01:02:52,540
She will come.

609
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:24,098
Fuck.

610
01:04:43,785 --> 01:04:44,918
Hello!

611
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:51,325
Hello!

612
01:04:51,826 --> 01:04:55,462
Hello! We're here!

613
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:57,866
Something's coming!
Something's coming.

614
01:04:58,132 --> 01:05:00,267
Something's coming!

615
01:05:01,268 --> 01:05:05,272
Something's coming!

616
01:06:03,765 --> 01:06:05,032
Hi!

617
01:06:06,133 --> 01:06:07,434
Oh,
you made it.

618
01:06:07,968 --> 01:06:09,737
Hello. Oh, my God,
you're here.

619
01:06:09,804 --> 01:06:12,473
- My girls.
- How's your baby?

620
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:17,077
She's so cute.
How was your journey?

621
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:43,203
Do you want to go
and have some dinner?

622
01:06:44,271 --> 01:06:45,038
What?

623
01:06:45,573 --> 01:06:47,374
Do you want to go
and have some dinner?

624
01:06:49,376 --> 01:06:50,377
Now?

625
01:06:51,846 --> 01:06:55,583
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
I think so. Don't you?

626
01:06:56,450 --> 01:07:00,087
Well, I don't know you.
I don't know you either.

627
01:07:05,158 --> 01:07:06,426
It could be a disaster.

628
01:07:26,246 --> 01:07:27,949
Are you hungry? We've got food.

629
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:30,050
You can eat
some of my birthday cake.

630
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:33,086
And this is my friend.
Hiya!

631
01:07:33,186 --> 01:07:35,355
Is she coming?

632
01:07:38,325 --> 01:07:39,861
Mine looks better
than yours.

633
01:07:40,193 --> 01:07:41,261
Girls,
make yourselves useful.

634
01:07:41,529 --> 01:07:42,530
<i>Meteorologists</i>
<i>have today announced</i>

635
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:45,265
<i>the worst of the extreme storms</i>
<i>have finally passed.</i>

636
01:07:45,365 --> 01:07:47,301
<i>This long-awaited news</i>
<i>has paved the way</i>

637
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:48,970
<i>for the launch</i>
<i>of the official operation</i>

638
01:07:49,069 --> 01:07:51,138
<i>to begin rebuilding our nation.</i>

639
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:54,008
<i>Bath and other low-lying cities</i>

640
01:07:54,107 --> 01:07:56,578
<i>are already allowing residents</i>

641
01:07:56,945 --> 01:08:00,314
<i>The mayor of London has praised</i>
<i>those who are working tirelessly</i>

642
01:08:00,414 --> 01:08:02,449
<i>to make London safe enough</i>
<i>for civilians</i>

643

646
01:08:10,658 --> 01:08:14,094

647

648
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:18,800

649
01:08:18,866 --> 01:08:19,934
Can you turn that off, please?

650
01:08:20,068 --> 01:08:22,235
<i>...may also aid</i>
<i>the identification of the...</i>

651
01:08:22,369 --> 01:08:23,605
Course.

652
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,875
Can you hand me your bowl,
sweetie?

653
01:08:28,141 --> 01:08:30,444
Thank you. Sorry.

654
01:08:44,892 --> 01:08:47,160
- This is nice.
- Thank you.

655
01:08:47,327 --> 01:08:50,098
I put leeks in
to give it a wee bit...

656
01:08:50,197 --> 01:08:51,733
When we first
got together,

657
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:54,736
I had this breakdown, I guess.

658
01:08:56,336 --> 01:08:58,138
Yeah, my parents had just died,

659
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:01,375
both very suddenly,
like, very close together,

660
01:09:01,976 --> 01:09:03,678
and I became terrified of death.

661
01:09:03,978 --> 01:09:06,881
I mean, irrationally,
completely,

662
01:09:07,081 --> 01:09:09,383
overwhelmed
by the fear of dying.

663
01:09:09,517 --> 01:09:11,919
Doesn't sound irrational.

664
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,790
No, and emotionally,

665
01:09:16,658 --> 01:09:20,695
I mean, of course, emotionally,
it made complete sense.

666
01:09:20,795 --> 01:09:21,896
But logically...

667
01:09:23,363 --> 01:09:25,365
I mean, at that time,
logically, the world,

668
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:29,269
it offered no real threat and...

669
01:09:33,107 --> 01:09:34,676
God, I couldn't get out of bed.

670
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:38,579
He was so kind.

671
01:09:41,783 --> 01:09:44,451
I mean, he looked after me
so brilliantly.

672
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:50,892
We didn't even know each other
that well.

673
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:55,295
We hadn't known each other
long enough to. Just...

674
01:09:57,565 --> 01:09:58,599
I get it.

675
01:09:59,232 --> 01:10:01,435
I went on this mad
"I want a baby" quest.

676
01:10:01,536 --> 01:10:03,738
Yeah.
No, I didn't stop.

677
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,472
I mean,
I didn't grieve properly.

678
01:10:05,573 --> 01:10:08,509
Just head down, get pregnant.

679
01:10:08,576 --> 01:10:10,945
Get through it.
Get through it and...

680
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:17,085
But I think I only wanted one

681
01:10:17,151 --> 01:10:19,386
so I could stop being so afraid
of dying.

682
01:10:23,256 --> 01:10:24,726
You know, so I could have
something of my own

683
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:28,462
that I would die for
in a heartbeat, in a second.

684
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:30,064
Sounds okay.

685
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:33,201
I don't think anyone has a baby
for altruistic reasons.

686
01:10:41,142 --> 01:10:42,476
He was wanted.

687
01:10:43,578 --> 01:10:46,647
A version of him was wanted.

688
01:10:48,182 --> 01:10:50,651
Hmm.

689
01:10:51,652 --> 01:10:53,654
But the fear of death
doesn't go away.

690
01:10:55,255 --> 01:10:56,791
No.
It spreads.

691
01:10:58,226 --> 01:10:59,527
Pulls the baby in.

692
01:11:01,361 --> 01:11:04,065
And now look.

693
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:07,300
What a world.

694
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:11,773
Here, you have
an eyelash on your face.

695
01:11:14,108 --> 01:11:15,676
Make a wish.
You do.

696
01:11:58,586 --> 01:12:00,453
Yeah, so,
work sort of sent me here.

697
01:12:01,022 --> 01:12:04,759
I'm more of a, kind of,
"Build your own hut,
eat and kill some roadkill".

698
01:12:05,358 --> 01:12:07,094
Thank you.
What, eat and then kill?

699
01:12:07,628 --> 01:12:10,330
Yeah, that doesn't...
Yeah. Yeah, eat it to death.

700
01:12:10,565 --> 01:12:12,600
- Normal. The normal way.
- Yeah.

701
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:16,436
Uh, I...
I think that's impressed you.

702
01:12:16,571 --> 01:12:18,840
Yeah.

703
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:21,209
- You've totally won me over. Hmm.
- Yeah.

704
01:12:21,742 --> 01:12:23,911
What about you?
Do you like living here?

705
01:12:24,312 --> 01:12:27,582
Uh, yeah, I love it.
Mm. I, uh...

706
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:30,885
I really like being indoors.

707
01:12:31,786 --> 01:12:37,291
Mm. Like going into shops,
and ordering food from menus

708
01:12:37,357 --> 01:12:39,093
that someone else has cooked...

709
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:40,928
Okay.
...in a cooker.

710
01:12:41,295 --> 01:12:43,331
Or even a microwave. I'm not...

711
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:44,966
Okay.
...I'm not fussy.

712
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,635
Well, we're doomed,
then, really, aren't we?

713
01:12:47,869 --> 01:12:51,005
Yeah. Yeah,
there's... there's no hope.

714
01:12:51,404 --> 01:12:53,941
It's a shame.

715
01:13:12,894 --> 01:13:13,861
You're not here.

716
01:13:15,596 --> 01:13:17,531
Sorry.

717
01:13:23,671 --> 01:13:25,773
Some people find it harder.

718
01:13:28,576 --> 01:13:30,044
They have more to give up.

719
01:13:34,282 --> 01:13:36,951
It is difficult,
but this doesn't work.

720
01:13:37,051 --> 01:13:40,621
It stops working for everybody
if one person isn't present.

721
01:13:47,295 --> 01:13:48,930
It isn't real any more.

722
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:53,968
What you miss doesn't exist.

723
01:13:55,169 --> 01:13:58,339
I'm just... just, like,
having a moment, you know?

724
01:13:58,606 --> 01:14:00,041
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

725
01:14:09,482 --> 01:14:11,752
We're lucky.
Yeah.

726
01:14:38,179 --> 01:14:39,146
Peekaboo!

727
01:14:39,647 --> 01:14:41,148
Girls,
come and eat your soup.

728
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:42,149
It's delicious.

729
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:47,188
Thank you.

730
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:06,528
No. Of course I'm not
gonna leave the baby here.

731
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,162
What, are you fucking insane?

732
01:17:08,262 --> 01:17:10,164
You can't take him with you.

733
01:17:10,532 --> 01:17:11,966
You don't know
what you're going back to.

734
01:17:12,032 --> 01:17:14,101
What if there's no food?
I'm his food.

735
01:17:14,168 --> 01:17:18,038
Not if you fucking starve.
No, no, this is not my place.

736
01:17:19,406 --> 01:17:20,307
This isn't me.

737
01:17:20,374 --> 01:17:21,876
I don't understand
what this means.

738
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:23,744
This collective
fucking rejection

739
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:25,212
of the world and everyone in it.

740
01:17:25,412 --> 01:17:28,449
That is not what we're doing.
No, I have to tell
my son I tried.

741
01:17:28,983 --> 01:17:32,153
That I didn't just hide from it
or pretend nothing happened.

742
01:17:32,253 --> 01:17:33,254
Okay.

743
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,860
Where are you going to go?

744
01:17:40,027 --> 01:17:42,396
Home. I'm going home.

745
01:17:42,763 --> 01:17:45,799
Please don't go.

746
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:47,968
Don't go.

747
01:17:53,274 --> 01:17:54,808
You can't go alone.

748
01:17:56,578 --> 01:17:59,280
I'll be fine.
It's not about you.

749
01:18:00,881 --> 01:18:02,383
This is a commune.

750
01:18:03,017 --> 01:18:05,753
We exist for our community,
for those who opt in,

751
01:18:05,853 --> 01:18:07,656
who choose to be
in our community

752
01:18:07,721 --> 01:18:10,124
and not the individual,
and we need the boat.

753
01:18:23,704 --> 01:18:25,372
I'll take you first thing.

754
01:18:38,953 --> 01:18:42,990
Fuck!

755
01:18:59,507 --> 01:19:00,874
I don't like goodbyes.

756
01:19:04,713 --> 01:19:05,846
Sorry.

757
01:19:17,525 --> 01:19:18,459
You might die.

758
01:19:20,828 --> 01:19:22,162
So might you.

759
01:19:24,298 --> 01:19:26,568
What a fucking horrible thing
to say.

760
01:19:27,901 --> 01:19:31,005
You're a terrible person,
like, maybe the worst.

761
01:19:34,108 --> 01:19:36,243
It just doesn't feel right
being here.

762
01:19:39,813 --> 01:19:41,382
I mean, look at it. It...

763
01:19:43,417 --> 01:19:44,385
it should.

764
01:19:52,727 --> 01:19:54,428
Right, um...

765
01:19:57,965 --> 01:19:59,867
...can you go back inside now?

766
01:20:08,342 --> 01:20:09,376
Okay.

767
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,449
Well, just say goodnight.

768
01:20:17,151 --> 01:20:19,853
- Goodnight.
- Sleep well.

769
01:20:24,224 --> 01:20:25,292
I love you.

770
01:20:36,203 --> 01:20:37,838
I love you, too.

771
01:21:25,452 --> 01:21:29,423
Hey.

772
01:21:34,461 --> 01:21:36,897
Hey, hey, hey.

773
01:21:40,668 --> 01:21:43,904
I know, I know. Time out, right?

774
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:46,340
Hey.

775
01:23:01,081 --> 01:23:03,083
Hello.

776
01:23:45,994 --> 01:23:50,364
Oh, Zeb, you stink. You stink!

777
01:23:50,598 --> 01:23:53,735
Stinky-poo!

778
01:24:01,943 --> 01:24:03,811
Will you carry me now, please?

779
01:24:04,612 --> 01:24:05,713
Huh?

780
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:23,363
Hey, hello.

781
01:24:25,098 --> 01:24:27,902
Hello.

782
01:24:28,201 --> 01:24:31,438
It's just... it's just me.

783
01:24:31,506 --> 01:24:33,575
I mean, I'm... I'm on my own.
It's just us.

784
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:37,679
Can we...

785
01:24:39,313 --> 01:24:43,150
Can we come with you?

786
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:45,720
No.

787
01:24:47,956 --> 01:24:50,357
- Er, please.
- No.

788
01:24:50,758 --> 01:24:52,627
Well, I don't... I...
I don't want anything.

789
01:24:52,727 --> 01:24:54,261
- I just...
- No.

790
01:24:54,762 --> 01:24:56,196
I... I have a baby.

791
01:24:59,499 --> 01:25:01,335
I'm... I'm actually trying
to... to...

792
01:25:01,435 --> 01:25:04,872
No. No!
...to get back to the city.

793
01:25:04,973 --> 01:25:07,041
My son, his name is Zeb.
What's your name?

794
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:08,810
- No, no, no, no.
- Shut up.

795
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:10,177
- No. No.
- I'll sort it. It's okay.

796
01:25:10,243 --> 01:25:11,980
What you gonna do?
I get it.

797
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,014
- Right. Let me go.
- No.

798
01:25:13,113 --> 01:25:14,481
- I can walk.
- Let go of me.

799
01:25:14,582 --> 01:25:17,351
No. What you gonna do?
I can, er, walk. We're walking.

800
01:25:17,451 --> 01:25:19,754
It's fine. It's okay.
We can walk.

801
01:25:19,821 --> 01:25:20,855
Just let go.

802
01:25:21,055 --> 01:25:23,625
Just let go.

803
01:25:23,925 --> 01:25:26,060
She's getting
in the fucking car!

804
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:30,330
No!

805
01:25:30,632 --> 01:25:33,200
Get out! Get out!

806
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:37,237
- Get out!
- Get her out the fucking...

807
01:25:38,539 --> 01:25:41,576
No!

808
01:25:42,710 --> 01:25:44,746
You fucking idiot!

809
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:50,250
You can't tell anyone
I did that.

810
01:25:50,885 --> 01:25:52,319
You look very unimpressed.

811
01:25:52,419 --> 01:25:56,356
You look
very unimpressed.

812
01:26:22,684 --> 01:26:25,653
<i>Coaches are</i>
<i>for clean-up volunteers only.</i>

813
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,690
I repeat, volunteers only.

814
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:31,458
We can only accept
healthy individuals

815

willing to work in exchange
for food and shelter.

816
01:26:35,063 --> 01:26:37,899
You need to have identification.
Please have it ready.

817
01:26:37,999 --> 01:26:38,933
Nearly there.

818
01:26:39,634 --> 01:26:41,536
<i>Line up in single file</i>
<i>along the barriers.</i>

819
01:26:41,536 --> 01:26:44,371
Here we go.

820
01:26:45,205 --> 01:26:46,541
- Baby.
- You're all set.

821
01:26:46,641 --> 01:26:48,375
- Ready for departure.
- Baby.

822
01:26:49,777 --> 01:26:54,214
If you have identification,
please have it ready.

823
01:26:54,448 --> 01:26:55,616
Quick
as you can, please.

824
01:26:55,683 --> 01:27:02,289
Thank you.

825
01:27:02,523 --> 01:27:04,424
This way,
please. Come along now.

826
01:27:11,231 --> 01:27:12,365
Okay,
ladies and gents,

827
01:27:12,432 --> 01:27:14,135
I want you to move forward,
please.

828
01:27:14,234 --> 01:27:16,336
Quick
as you can. Thank you, sir.

829
01:27:38,559 --> 01:27:40,995
<i>No smoking</i>
<i>inside the building.</i>

830
01:27:53,406 --> 01:27:56,409
What do you see?

831
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:05,853
Where am I?

832
01:28:08,055 --> 01:28:13,828
There I am. Again?
Where am I?

833
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:17,765
Where am I?

834
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,536
There I am. There I am.

835
01:28:28,876 --> 01:28:30,711
Where am I?

836
01:28:30,812 --> 01:28:33,948
Where am I, Zeb?

837
01:28:34,849 --> 01:28:36,984
There I am.

838
01:28:38,252 --> 01:28:39,987
Again?

839
01:28:43,858 --> 01:28:45,392
Where am I?

840
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:50,031
Where am I?

841
01:28:51,232 --> 01:28:53,333
There I am.

842

I don't know where I am.

846

Where am I, Zeb?

847
01:30:14,414 --> 01:30:17,885
I don't know.

848
01:30:21,155 --> 01:30:24,158
I don't know.

849
01:30:24,258 --> 01:30:27,995
Mummy doesn't know.

850
01:31:39,367 --> 01:31:40,835
Hello.
Hi.

851
01:32:29,450 --> 01:32:32,686
This is gonna be
a big clean-up, Zeb.

852
01:32:34,255 --> 01:32:35,756
I might need a hand with this.

853
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:40,561
This was yours.
You're too big for that now.

854
01:32:49,303 --> 01:32:50,738
It's still beautiful.

855
01:33:02,216 --> 01:33:06,687
Right.

856
01:33:07,621 --> 01:33:09,623
Would you like
to see the kitchen?

857
01:33:14,095 --> 01:33:17,198
Oh, thank you.
That's okay. You have it.

858
01:33:24,038 --> 01:33:26,073
Are you just gonna
watch me work?

859
01:33:27,341 --> 01:33:28,876
I like your style.

860
01:33:30,111 --> 01:33:33,180
I like your style.

Hello.
