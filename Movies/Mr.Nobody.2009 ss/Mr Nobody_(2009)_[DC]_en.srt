1
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:30,839
Like most living creatures,

2
00:02:31,428 --> 00:02:35,436
the pigeon quickly associates
the pressing of a lever with reward.

3
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:40,538
But when a timer releases the seal
automatically every 20 seconds,

4
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:42,095
the pigeon wonders,

5
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:45,329
"What did I do
to deserve this?"

6
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,341
If it was flapping
its wings at the time,

7
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:52,674
it will continue to flap
convinced that its actions

8
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:55,907
have a decisive influence
on what happens.

9
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:59,725
We call this
"pigeon superstition."

10
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,886
What did I do to deserve this?

11
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:32,228
How's it been going
since the last time?

12
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:42,622
- Do I know you?
- We see each other every week.

13
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,218
I'm Dr. Feldheim.

14
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,853
- And who are you?
- Nobody.

15
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:52,921
Nemo Nobody.

16
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:56,228
That's an unusual name,
don't you think?

17
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:59,999
Sometimes,
people call me Mr. Craft.

18
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:01,167
Who?

19
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,290
C-R-A-F-T.

20
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:09,952
<i>Can't Remember A Fucking Thing.</i>

21
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:19,044
What was the first question
I asked you?

22
00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:24,628
- I don't know.
- Can you tell me how old you are?

23
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,233
I'm 34.

24
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:32,804
I was born in 1975.

25
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:35,740
Would you mind
looking at your hands?

26
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:39,248
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

27
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:44,579
There's a mirror
in front of you.

28
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,891
No. I...

29
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:52,091
What year is this?

30
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:55,277
2009.

31
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:58,495
I'm 34.

32
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,594
I was born February 9th, 1975.

33
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,286
So I guess, it must be
your birthday.

34
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:23,461
I'm 34.

35
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,829
I'm 34!

36
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,321
I've got to wake up!

37
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:35,512
I've got to wake up!

38
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:57,845
Don't, Nemo.
Sun hurts my eyes.

39
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:50,925
Hey, buddy.

40
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,381
Good morning, my little angels.

41
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,040
Time for school, okay?

42
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:01,571
Come on.

43
00:08:01,802 --> 00:08:04,513
Elise, I'm gonna
take the kids to school.

44
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:29,434
- Paul, keep it down.
- My name's not Paul.

45
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:32,918
Paul?

46
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:37,029
Daddy...

47
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,397
Daddy...

48
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:42,820
Daddy...

49
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:46,585
Paul, don't wake your father.

50
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:50,475
Elise.

51
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:53,233
It's me, Jean.

52
00:08:54,844 --> 00:08:58,615
- Am I dead?
- Go back and play Paul.

53
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:04,231
- Who's Elise?
- I don't know anyone called Elise.

54
00:09:05,116 --> 00:09:07,795
You're so tired, Nemo.
You need to rest.

55
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,593
I'll turn the television
on for you.

56
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:11,469
I'm going inside...

57
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:14,711
- The sun hurts my eyes.
- What?

58
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:18,311
The sun hurts my eyes.

59
00:09:30,596 --> 00:09:33,851
Nemo, your friends are here.

60
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:49,245
Hello, Nemo.

61
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:52,753
How are you feeling today?

62
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,738
Do you know who I am?

63
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,449
We're all very worried about you, Nemo.

64
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:10,003
Everyone wants you
be back in the office soon.

65
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:32,190
Mrs. Nobody.

66
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:57,769
<i>This is Julian Marshall.</i>

67
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,952
<i>Live from New New York hospital,</i>

68
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:04,928
<i>where we're going to see the final episode
in our series, "The Last Mortals"</i>

69
00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:11,496
<i>Mr. Nobody is 117 years old
and he has not been telemorized!</i>

70
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:16,518
<i>Nor does he have one of these
marvelous stem-cell compatible pigs.</i>

71
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:20,963
<i>Live on WWB,</i>

72
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:26,485
<i>Mr. Nobody will be the last man
on Earth to die of old-age.</i>

73
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,144
<i>- Mr. Nobody...
- The Last Mortal.</i>

74
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:31,693
<i>The last mortal.</i>

75
00:11:49,212 --> 00:11:50,816
Now, Doctor,

76
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:54,131
no trace of his identity has been
found on the National Records.

77
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:56,944
Nothing about his past.

78
00:11:56,969 --> 00:11:59,153
We do not know
who Mr. Nobody is.

79
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,502
Neither does he.

80
00:12:00,527 --> 00:12:02,848
Our patient's memories
are confused,

81
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,328
<i>but it is not unusual
at his certain stage of illness...</i>

82
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:09,989
<i>for very old memories
to re-emerge in great detail.</i>

83
00:12:11,478 --> 00:12:13,599
Let's try something new.

84
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:17,288
I'm thinking
of an old technique.

85
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:19,518
I can't promise anything.

86
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:23,001
Maybe snatches of memory
will come back.

87
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:25,314
Maybe nothing will happen.

88
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:28,500
Are you willing to try?

89
00:12:36,575 --> 00:12:39,168
You are very relaxed.

90
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:43,654
You hear only my voice.

91
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:47,991
Your eyelids are getting heavy.

92
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:52,377
Your arms and legs
are getting heavy.

93
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,046
I'm going to count to three.

94
00:12:57,303 --> 00:12:59,306
When I say three...

95
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:03,554
you will be asleep.

96
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:05,229
One.

97
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:09,253
Two.

98
00:13:12,212 --> 00:13:15,158
Remember the day you came here.

99
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:21,895
Three.

100
00:13:23,048 --> 00:13:24,344
You're sleeping.

101
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:04,241
SLEEP...

102
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:11,840
Remember even further back.

103
00:14:12,187 --> 00:14:14,071
When I say three...

104
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:15,614
One...

105
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,363
Two...

106
00:14:19,913 --> 00:14:20,973
Three.

107
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:23,927
Remember.

108
00:14:29,532 --> 00:14:32,714
I can remember
a long time ago...

109
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,599
Long before my birth.

110
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:43,441
I was whizzing with those
who were not yet born.

111
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,280
When we're not born yet,
we know everything.

112
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:53,392
Everything that's will happen.

113
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:24,618
When it's your time,

114
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:28,119
the angels of Oblivion
place a finger on your mouth.

115
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,425
Shh.

116
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:32,424
It leaves a mark
on the upper lip.

117
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:36,984
It means that
you have forgotten everything.

118
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:41,379
But the angels missed me.

119
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:53,201
Then you have to find
a daddy and a mummy.

120
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:55,273
It's not easy to choose.

121
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:58,654
Blond and blue eyed.
It's all I'm asking.

122
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,635
Andrew!

123
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,830
It would be nice to the little one
not to be all alone.

124
00:16:01,855 --> 00:16:03,034
You stay here.

125
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:06,087
It's normal to think about babies
when you reach a certain age.

126
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:07,512
Well, for women at least.

127
00:16:07,537 --> 00:16:11,088
- It's the meaning of life...
- Of life. I had not finished yet, darling.

128
00:16:11,113 --> 00:16:12,470
It's the meaning of life.

129
00:16:12,495 --> 00:16:14,698
It's not that we want a kid.

130
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,015
But we slept together.

131
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,104
- It's an important experience.
- It's an important experience, yeah.

132
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:23,688
I think it would help my husband
if we had a child.

133
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:26,562
We'd call him George.
Right, George?

134
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:29,067
We had a dog, but he died.

135
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:50,172
In the end, I chose them
because the lady smelled nice

136
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:51,465
and the man said...

137
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,695
Well, I can tell you how we met.

138
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:58,633
It was meant to be.
Have you heard of the Butterfly Effect?

139
00:17:56,778 --> 00:18:00,195
Once upon a time,
there was a daddy and a mommy

140
00:18:00,697 --> 00:18:03,366
named "The Daddy"
and "The Mommy".

141
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,123
They found a cute little baby

142
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,448
and called it
"The Cute Little Baby".

143
00:18:08,473 --> 00:18:10,822
The little baby was born there.

144
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:13,565
He was born that day,
and not another.

145
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,501
His daddy and his mummy
live at number seven.

146
00:18:17,526 --> 00:18:20,472
Everything you see exists.

147
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,305
We can see it.

148
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:27,957
I can see Mummy's eyes.
But I can't see my eyes.

149
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:34,186
The little baby can see his hands,
but he can not see himself.

150
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:37,423
So, does he really exist?

151
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:39,392
Do I really exist?

152
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,263
Boo.

153
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:46,573
Boo.

154
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:50,123
<i>Eenie meenie minie mo</i>

155
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:52,499
<i>Catch a baby by the toe</i>

156
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:54,851
<i>If he squeals let him go</i>

157
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:57,434
<i>Eenie meenie minie mo</i>

158
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,144
<i>My mother told me
to pick the very best one</i>

159
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:04,906
<i>And you are it</i>

160
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,379
The Mummy has a brush for her hair
and lipstick for her lips.

161
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:19,101
She smells good.

162
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:22,778
The Daddy has a watch
and hair in his arm.

163
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:25,367
The watch goes "tick-tock".

164
00:19:25,392 --> 00:19:29,696
If the baby falls,
the mother claps her hands.

165
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:31,701
She says, "Bravo."

166
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:32,727
Bravo.

167
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:46,154
Why am I me,
and not someone else?

168
00:19:57,122 --> 00:20:01,581
<i>And so, high fresher fronts
moving in tomorrow.</i>

169
00:20:01,606 --> 00:20:04,223
<i>It will bring clear skies
for the whole weekend.</i>

170
00:20:04,248 --> 00:20:07,042
<i>So, get those barbecues out.</i>

171
00:20:20,224 --> 00:20:21,285
Hello.

172
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:26,956
Why do we remember the past,
but not the future?

173
00:20:26,981 --> 00:20:29,912
When you ask Mummy, she says,

174
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,941
- "Stop asking why."
- Stop asking why.

175
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,331
- "It's complicated."
- It's complicated.

176
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:44,637
Yes.

177
00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:57,053
It's okay,
I'm--I'm a journalist.

178
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:03,709
The hospital won't allow interviews.
I just like to ask you a few questions.

179
00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:09,136
A friend of mine's a nurse here.
She helped me get in.

180
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:11,725
What time is it?

181
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:14,211
14:12.

182
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:18,309
Where did you get that?

183
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:21,080
I borrowed it
from the University Museum.

184
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,330
But it still works.

185
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,600
I've got nothing to say to you.

186
00:21:26,794 --> 00:21:29,599
- I'm...
- I'm Mr. Nobody.

187
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:31,943
The man who doesn't exist.

188
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:37,115
Do you remember what the world was like
before quasi-immortality?

189
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:40,089
- What?
- Telemorization.

190
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:42,808
Endless renewal of cells.

191
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:47,492
What was it like
when humans were mortal?

192
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,775
There were cars that polluted.

193
00:21:52,387 --> 00:21:57,691
We smoked cigarettes.
We ate meat.

194
00:21:57,987 --> 00:22:03,620
We did everything we can do
in this dump and it was wonderful.

195
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:08,995
Most of the time,
nothing happened...

196
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,665
like a French movie.

197
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:18,602
And sexually?
Before sex became obsolete?

198
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:23,796
We screwed!

199
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:28,345
Everybody was always screwing.

200
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:33,105
We fell in love.

201
00:22:34,635 --> 00:22:36,991
We fell in love.

202
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,384
What time is it?

203
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:50,535
What was there
before the Big Bang?

204
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,825
Well, you see,

205
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,313
there was no before because
before the Big Bang,

206
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:57,390
Time did not exist

207
00:22:57,415 --> 00:23:02,039
Time is a result of
the expansion of Universe itself,

208
00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:05,487
but what will happen when
the Universe has finished expanding...

209
00:23:05,512 --> 00:23:07,056
and the movement is reversed?

210
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:09,033
What will be the nature of time?

211
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:11,052
If String Theory is correct,

212
00:23:11,077 --> 00:23:14,861
the Universe possesses
nine spatial dimensions,

213
00:23:14,886 --> 00:23:16,890
and one temporal dimension.

214
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:19,606
Now we can imagine that
in the beginning,

215
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,117
all the dimensions
were twisted together

216
00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:24,441
and during the Big Bang,
three spatial dimensions,

217
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:27,282
the ones that we know as
height, width and depth,

218
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:31,651
and one temporal dimension,
what we know as time, were deployed.

219
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:35,647
The other six remained miniscule,
wound up together.

220
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:39,628
Now, if we live in a Universe
of wound dimensions,

221
00:23:39,653 --> 00:23:42,328
how do we distinguish between...

222
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:44,857
illusion and reality?

223
00:23:45,185 --> 00:23:49,074
Time, as we know it, is
a dimension we experience

224
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:51,282
only in one direction.

225
00:23:51,307 --> 00:23:54,961
But what if one of the additional
dimensions wasn't spatial,

226
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,522
but temporal?

227
00:23:57,361 --> 00:24:00,954
If you mix the mashed potatoes
and sauce,

228
00:24:00,979 --> 00:24:05,576
you can't separate them later.
It's forever.

229
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:08,318
The smoke comes out
of Daddy's cigarette,

230
00:24:08,343 --> 00:24:10,665
but it never goes back in.

231
00:24:15,992 --> 00:24:18,113
We cannot go back.

232
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:21,046
That's why it's hard to choose.

233
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:27,009
You have to make
the right choice.

234
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:36,813
As long as you don't choose,
everything remains possible.

235
00:24:45,638 --> 00:24:48,106
- Hello, Nemo.
- Hello, Anna.

236
00:24:48,131 --> 00:24:51,409
- Hi, Nemo.
- Hello, Elise.

237
00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:52,664
- Hello, Nemo.
- Hello, Jean.

238
00:24:56,871 --> 00:25:01,576
For as much as Anna and Nemo
have consented together in holy wedlock,

239
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:05,080
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company.

240
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:09,793
For as much as Elise and Nemo have
consented together in holy wedlock...

241
00:25:09,818 --> 00:25:14,143
Jean and Nemo
have joined themselves...

242
00:25:14,568 --> 00:25:18,576
I pronounce that they be
husband and wife together...

243
00:25:19,662 --> 00:25:24,140
Those who God has joined together,
no one can separate...

244
00:25:44,517 --> 00:25:48,775
Daddy says you can predict exactly
when Mars will be in the sky,

245
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,094
even in 100 years.

246
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,854
But the funny thing is,

247
00:25:53,206 --> 00:25:55,309
that daddy does not know
what will happen to him

248
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:56,957
two minutes from now.

249
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:01,567
Mama!

250
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,723
That's not possible,
no one knows the future.

251
00:27:32,748 --> 00:27:34,541
That's I, I remember it.

252
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:36,639
You remember the past, not the future.

253
00:27:36,664 --> 00:27:38,316
Believe me. I can.

254
00:27:38,506 --> 00:27:42,380
Sometimes things happen and I'm feeling
that they have already happened before.

255
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:48,522
Well, that's deja vu.

256
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:51,834
It happens to everyone from time to time.

257
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:54,477
No! It's because of the Angels of Oblivion!

258
00:27:54,502 --> 00:27:56,933
They did not put their finger on me!

259
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:05,662
Come on!

260
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:10,059
Get it! Grab on!

261
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:12,388
One, two...

262
00:30:51,454 --> 00:30:55,350
Should Mr. Nobody be allowed
to die a natural death?

263
00:30:55,375 --> 00:31:00,449
Should his existence be artificially
prolonged? Make your vote now!

264
00:31:00,886 --> 00:31:03,176
Press X for artificial prolongation,

265
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:06,987
press 0 to let nature run its course.

266
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,223
We'll be back after this!

267
00:31:09,248 --> 00:31:12,082
You too can take a valley
vocation on Mars.

268
00:31:12,107 --> 00:31:15,167
Book before the Union
and save 16,000 units.

269
00:32:29,995 --> 00:32:32,446
Okay, Anna, let's go.

270
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:50,290
Then, the Daddy and the Mummy
kissed all day long.

271
00:33:14,387 --> 00:33:17,215
So, Nemo, have you
made up your mind?

272
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:23,472
Do you want to come with me?
Or do you want to stay with your father?

273
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:37,384
Nemo!

274
00:35:48,911 --> 00:35:51,267
I'm sorry,
I-I don't understand.

275
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:56,340
Did you stay with your father
or go with your mother?

276
00:36:05,051 --> 00:36:10,353
- Daddy, is it my fault?
- Of course not.

277
00:36:10,774 --> 00:36:12,543
It's my fault.

278
00:36:21,372 --> 00:36:25,497
I can give you a good deal
on this type of shoe lace.

279
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:31,855
A very good deal.

280
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:52,983
Remember.

281
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:11,084
Remember.

282
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:16,726
Nemo...

283
00:37:17,138 --> 00:37:18,317
Nemo.

284
00:37:22,395 --> 00:37:24,162
It's time to wake up, darling.

285
00:37:40,137 --> 00:37:43,100
And guess what?
You're going to be late for school.

286
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,676
Nemo, it's me.

287
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:04,741
I bet you haven't done
your homework.

288
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:06,534
Hurry up and finish.

289
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:09,665
I invited someone for dinner.

290
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:12,925
I'm counting on you
to keep your mouth shut!

291
00:38:18,408 --> 00:38:21,472
- How was the trip?
- Uh, it was good.

292
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:26,117
- Have you seen some nice apartments?
- I did. I've seen a couple of nice ones.

293
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:29,738
Nemo, don't stare
at people like that.

294
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,525
It's okay.
It's not a problem.

295
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,196
He has a gift for making people
uncomfortable.

296
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:36,364
It's nothing.

297
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:39,501
It will happen on a Saturday...

298
00:38:40,813 --> 00:38:42,933
You will be behind
the wheel of your car...

299
00:38:44,263 --> 00:38:45,560
You are whistling...

300
00:38:49,649 --> 00:38:51,417
You do not see the crossroads...

301
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,919
All of a sudden,
a train will appear from your left.

302
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:59,272
And you will be crushed.

303
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,769
You're not funny.

304
00:39:13,356 --> 00:39:16,303
Nemo thinks
he can predict the future.

305
00:39:17,714 --> 00:39:21,363
I can. I predicted Dad's accident.

306
00:39:21,388 --> 00:39:24,399
Yeah, I always wondered if you're not
the one who took off the handbrake.

307
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:28,404
No one can predict the future,
no one knows what's going to happen.

308
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,343
I do.

309
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:34,423
Well if you could, you'd know
you were going to get that.

310
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:37,209
I knew you'd say that.

311
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:50,908
Proud of yourself?

312
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:56,380
Why you systematically ruin everything I...

313
00:39:56,877 --> 00:39:59,607
Do you think I have a right to live too?

314
00:40:09,948 --> 00:40:13,148
You could've stayed with your
father if you wanted to.

315
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,943
Everyone, please.

316
00:40:23,596 --> 00:40:26,284
I would like to introduce you
a new student in our class.

317
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:27,937
Her name is Anna.

318
00:40:27,962 --> 00:40:29,459
Please Anna, take a seat.

319
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:32,952
Alright, let's turn to page 215.

320
00:40:32,977 --> 00:40:34,750
It's last night's reading.

321
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:37,805
We're going to talk about
climate and vegetation zones

322
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,497
and the elements of weather
that are involved in each of both zones.

323
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,480
There are five elements that
make up weather as we know it.

324
00:40:45,505 --> 00:40:46,883
Atmosphere pressure...

325
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:04,750
You're going to swim?

326
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,888
- Come on, the water's nice.
- No, I...

327
00:41:11,192 --> 00:41:13,786
Come swim with us.
They're my friends, c'mon.

328
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:16,154
They're idiots.

329
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,378
And I don't go
swimming with idiots.

330
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:24,354
Jerk.

331
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:39,606
What on Earth made me say,
"I don't go swimming with idiots"?

332
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:53,728
Anna.

333
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:55,165
Nemo.

334
00:41:55,701 --> 00:41:56,762
Yeah.

335
00:41:58,021 --> 00:41:59,317
How have you been?

336
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,413
I'm fine.

337
00:42:01,621 --> 00:42:02,800
How are you?

338
00:42:03,715 --> 00:42:05,483
Yeah, good.

339
00:42:05,944 --> 00:42:07,712
Are these your kids?

340
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,510
Yeah.

341
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:19,085
Well, I'll see you around.

342
00:42:20,676 --> 00:42:21,618
Yeah, uh...

343
00:42:22,185 --> 00:42:23,954
I'll see you around.

344
00:42:35,436 --> 00:42:40,621
What on Earth made me say,
"I don't go swimming with idiots"?

345
00:43:08,821 --> 00:43:09,999
You're going to swim?

346
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:12,401
- Come on, the water's nice.
- No, I...

347
00:43:18,102 --> 00:43:19,988
I don't know how to swim.

348
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,281
Sorry?

349
00:43:22,915 --> 00:43:24,566
I don't know how to swim.

350
00:43:26,144 --> 00:43:27,441
That's it.

351
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:30,634
Please don't tell anyone.

352
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,187
Hey, aren't you gonna swim?

353
00:43:35,165 --> 00:43:38,347
No, I've got my period.
I'm gonna stay here.

354
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,331
Nemo will keep me company.

355
00:43:40,356 --> 00:43:41,156
Okay.

356
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,474
Darling? I... I want to
introduce you to someone.

357
00:44:15,658 --> 00:44:18,108
- You've already met Harry.
- Hey.

358
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:22,888
And this is his daughter, Anna.
Anna, this is Nemo.

359
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:35,493
Why don't you shake hands?

360
00:44:54,407 --> 00:44:55,702
How was work today?

361
00:45:16,606 --> 00:45:19,292
I can't believe them.

362
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:21,675
Soon as I wonder
how old they are.

363
00:45:25,544 --> 00:45:27,548
They already slept together?

364
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:29,107
I don't know.

365
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,492
I hope they use condoms.

366
00:45:31,517 --> 00:45:34,664
I do not want to end up
with a little brother.

367
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:37,877
I'd rather die.

368
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,435
Is you mom on the pill?

369
00:45:40,845 --> 00:45:42,023
I have no idea.

370
00:45:43,645 --> 00:45:46,033
We should slip it
into her morning coffee.

371
00:45:46,058 --> 00:45:48,650
It's like her hormones
have gone to her head.

372
00:45:54,703 --> 00:45:56,824
Sometimes I can see the future.

373
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:03,083
It doesn't seem like it can be much fun
knowing what's going to happen.

374
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,930
You're still here.

375
00:46:28,565 --> 00:46:31,393
Did I fall asleep?

376
00:46:33,013 --> 00:46:36,430
Sometimes I don't sleep.

377
00:46:37,822 --> 00:46:39,472
So I think...

378
00:46:41,863 --> 00:46:44,809
I think about how it was.

379
00:46:47,168 --> 00:46:49,879
It's all I have left.

380
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:56,793
What do you see
when you look at me?

381
00:46:57,009 --> 00:47:01,356
A grumpy old man
who never answers questions?

382
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:03,586
Who mixes everything up?

383
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:09,638
Who is kept busy
by getting his meals?

384
00:47:11,363 --> 00:47:13,720
Now that's not me...

385
00:47:17,014 --> 00:47:18,192
Me...

386
00:47:20,792 --> 00:47:22,913
I wear shorts.

387
00:47:25,077 --> 00:47:28,141
I'm nine years old.

388
00:47:29,694 --> 00:47:33,229
I can run faster than the train.

389
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:39,681
I can't feel
my aching back anymore.

390
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:43,533
I'm 15.

391
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:48,450
I'm 15.

392
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,361
And I'm in love.

393
00:47:55,233 --> 00:47:57,118
I'm in love.

394
00:49:20,088 --> 00:49:20,914
Nemo?

395
00:49:22,648 --> 00:49:23,591
Nemo?

396
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,179
Nemo?

397
00:49:34,796 --> 00:49:36,681
Isn't he sleeping in the study?

398
00:49:37,163 --> 00:49:39,520
No, I just looked
and he isn't there.

399
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:43,358
- Anna, have you seen your brother?
- He's not my brother.

400
00:49:54,016 --> 00:49:56,256
Oh, there you are.
Sleep alright?

401
00:50:21,231 --> 00:50:23,589
- Who's that?
- It's me.

402
00:50:25,767 --> 00:50:26,828
It's me, Dad...

403
00:50:27,244 --> 00:50:28,187
Nemo.

404
00:50:29,161 --> 00:50:30,221
Your son.

405
00:50:30,976 --> 00:50:32,744
Of course, son.

406
00:50:33,255 --> 00:50:36,556
- Where were you?
- At the shop, Dad.

407
00:50:37,352 --> 00:50:39,165
I always work at the shop
after school.

408
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:43,680
You know, a boy your age
should get out more.

409
00:50:43,705 --> 00:50:46,962
You can leave me alone, you know.
I-I can manage.

410
00:50:46,987 --> 00:50:48,602
It's no problem, Dad.

411
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:50,979
I like being at home.

412
00:51:20,736 --> 00:51:23,211
There was a card
from your mother in the post.

413
00:51:24,558 --> 00:51:28,658
- You have not read it.
- I know. I'll read it later.

414
00:51:28,683 --> 00:51:30,679
Won't you go
and see her one day?

415
00:51:31,543 --> 00:51:33,899
I haven't seen her
in seven years.

416
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:36,899
If she ever wanted to see me,
she'd know where to find me.

417
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:42,606
I've got everything I need, Dad.

418
00:51:43,192 --> 00:51:44,725
Everything's fine.

419
00:52:19,329 --> 00:52:21,451
After three months,

420
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,969
and six days of travel...

421
00:52:27,298 --> 00:52:29,066
the shuttle was heading...

422
00:52:30,907 --> 00:52:34,679
directly toward
the Cancer nebula...

423
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,735
in line with Uranus...

424
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:42,337
and its five moons.

425
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:06,462
It was finally approaching
Mars and the Colonies.

426
00:53:11,937 --> 00:53:13,351
On board...

427
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:17,999
the computer was monitoring
the passengers' artificial hibernation

428
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:36,553
Elise.

429
00:55:13,096 --> 00:55:14,865
I'm not crazy.

430
00:55:15,294 --> 00:55:17,069
Come on, it's not that bad!

431
00:55:17,094 --> 00:55:20,005
I didn't say anything mean.

432
00:55:22,321 --> 00:55:23,736
Shall we go, Nemo?

433
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,508
- Excuse me?
- Shall we go? He's such a bore.

434
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:49,371
You'll drown.

435
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:59,116
- How do you know my name?
- We go to the same school.

436
00:55:59,977 --> 00:56:03,394
You never noticed me.
You never notice anyone.

437
00:56:09,558 --> 00:56:11,325
D'you have a girlfriend?

438
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:16,224
What? Are you queer?
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

439
00:56:17,251 --> 00:56:18,784
I don't know...

440
00:56:19,591 --> 00:56:21,122
I-I don't want one.

441
00:56:23,982 --> 00:56:25,395
Tell me about yourself.

442
00:56:29,198 --> 00:56:32,273
You used to piss your pants,
everyone knows you're weirdo.

443
00:56:33,685 --> 00:56:35,174
You're always alone...

444
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:40,022
Talk.

445
00:56:42,998 --> 00:56:45,119
Or say something.
Come on...

446
00:56:50,785 --> 00:56:54,084
Gravity on Mars is 0.38.

447
00:56:57,034 --> 00:56:59,627
That's three times
less than on Earth.

448
00:57:01,482 --> 00:57:05,490
The ground is covered
with an iron oxide dust.

449
00:57:13,545 --> 00:57:14,606
You're incredible.

450
00:57:17,489 --> 00:57:21,025
- Raise your hand and say "I swear."
- Why?

451
00:57:21,368 --> 00:57:25,847
Promise me that if I die,
you'll spread my ashes on Mars.

452
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:30,382
It's estimated that travel to Mars
would take six to eight months.

453
00:57:30,407 --> 00:57:31,904
Say "I swear."

454
00:57:36,006 --> 00:57:36,949
I swear.

455
00:57:42,085 --> 00:57:44,206
We were neighbors
when we were little.

456
00:57:47,406 --> 00:57:48,584
It's Elise.

457
00:57:49,374 --> 00:57:50,553
Don't you remember?

458
00:57:51,453 --> 00:57:52,748
Elise.

459
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,671
I had a feeling I've seen you or something.

460
00:57:55,696 --> 00:57:57,565
Yeah, that's called Déjà vú.

461
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:00,625
And the signal from the eyes
goes from the memory...

462
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,194
No, it's not it.

463
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:05,168
Another life then?

464
00:58:06,534 --> 00:58:07,713
Anyway...

465
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:10,734
I remembered you.

466
00:58:24,186 --> 00:58:25,810
We shouldn't.

467
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:29,099
You don't know me
and I am not a good person.

468
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:31,007
Why do you say that?

469
00:58:53,459 --> 00:58:55,963
- Elise, wait!
- I'll call you.

470
00:58:55,988 --> 00:58:58,110
You don't have my phone number.

471
00:59:00,827 --> 00:59:03,420
What happens
when we fall in love?

472
00:59:04,644 --> 00:59:07,803
As a result of certain stimuli,

473
00:59:07,828 --> 00:59:12,068
the hypothalamus releases
a powerful discharges of endorphins...

474
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:16,355
but why exactly that woman
or that man?

475
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,162
Is there a release of
odorless pheromones

476
00:59:19,187 --> 00:59:22,368
that correspond to
our complimentary genetic signal?

477
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:25,927
Or is it physical features
that we recognize?

478
00:59:25,952 --> 00:59:28,039
A mother's eyes...

479
00:59:28,688 --> 00:59:31,752
A smell that stimulates
a happy memory.

480
00:59:32,914 --> 00:59:36,744
Is love...
part of a plan?

481
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:41,047
A vast war plan
between two modes of reproduction

482
00:59:41,072 --> 00:59:45,224
Bacteria and viruses
are asexual organisms.

483
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:48,031
With each cell division,
each multiplication,

484
00:59:48,056 --> 00:59:51,046
they mutate and perfect themselves
much more quickly than we do.

485
00:59:51,071 --> 00:59:55,728
Against this, we respond
with the most fiercing weapon:

486
00:59:55,753 --> 00:59:56,896
Sex.

487
00:59:57,596 --> 01:00:00,776
Two individuals,
by mixing their genes,

488
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:06,364
shuffle the cards and create an individual
who resists viruses better.

489
01:00:06,389 --> 01:00:09,054
The more dissimilar
he or she is.

490
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:15,291
Now, are we unknowing participants in
a war between two modes of reproduction?

491
01:00:18,828 --> 01:00:20,949
Okay everyone,
that's it for today.

492
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:25,249
How was it?

493
01:00:25,566 --> 01:00:27,616
You want to know the truth?

494
01:00:27,641 --> 01:00:29,349
Ok. It was good. It was really good.

495
01:00:33,264 --> 01:00:35,558
- Hey, honey.
- I'm gonna be a little late.

496
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:37,115
That's okay. Don't worry.

497
01:00:37,827 --> 01:00:40,514
- I love you.
- I love you more.

498
01:00:40,539 --> 01:00:42,523
<i>- Me more.
- Me more.</i>

499
01:00:42,548 --> 01:00:44,669
- Okay
- Cheater.

500
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:47,437
Alright, I'll see ya later.

501
01:01:48,047 --> 01:01:50,596
I always liked fish.

502
01:01:50,621 --> 01:01:54,157
I never thought that one day
they would like me too.

503
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,747
You're very relaxed.

504
01:02:00,351 --> 01:02:03,533
Your eyelids are getting heavy.

505
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:06,714
Remember.

506
01:02:08,156 --> 01:02:09,807
Remember...

507
01:02:15,374 --> 01:02:17,613
Remember...

508
01:03:21,992 --> 01:03:22,969
Nemo...

509
01:03:22,994 --> 01:03:23,374
Shit.

510
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:24,603
Anna...

511
01:03:27,343 --> 01:03:30,643
We've got errands to run.
We'll back in an hour.

512
01:03:33,506 --> 01:03:37,632
Anna, cover up!
You're gonna get a sunburn.

513
01:04:55,953 --> 01:04:57,367
I want you.

514
01:04:58,823 --> 01:05:00,237
I want you too.

515
01:05:02,663 --> 01:05:03,489
Forever.

516
01:05:06,933 --> 01:05:08,229
Forever.

517
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:10,872
Whatever happens.

518
01:05:11,503 --> 01:05:13,507
There is no life without you.

519
01:05:14,457 --> 01:05:16,224
No life without you.

520
01:05:40,259 --> 01:05:42,145
You look like my son.

521
01:05:43,321 --> 01:05:44,972
I am your son, Dad.

522
01:05:45,643 --> 01:05:47,764
My son's taller than you.

523
01:06:03,506 --> 01:06:04,507
Elise

524
01:07:09,682 --> 01:07:11,097
Someone just came in.

525
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,260
If I could at least
move my fingers.

526
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,895
Or my eyes.

527
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,464
Do you think he can hear us?

528
01:07:23,202 --> 01:07:25,064
Have you seen any reaction?

529
01:07:25,089 --> 01:07:26,247
I don't know, but...

530
01:07:26,732 --> 01:07:28,476
I've got a feeling that he can.

531
01:07:28,501 --> 01:07:29,766
Who's there?

532
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,196
What am I doing here?

533
01:07:31,722 --> 01:07:34,343
If you can hear me,
move your fingers.

534
01:07:34,368 --> 01:07:35,666
I've got to get out of here.

535
01:07:35,782 --> 01:07:38,257
Go back, before the accident.

536
01:08:09,058 --> 01:08:10,826
I believe one thing.

537
01:08:13,098 --> 01:08:18,282
I believe that we should always say
"I love you" to the people we love.

538
01:08:25,802 --> 01:08:27,098
I love you.

539
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:38,485
Nemo... we shouldn't.

540
01:08:40,118 --> 01:08:41,414
I love Stefano.

541
01:08:43,053 --> 01:08:43,853
What?

542
01:08:44,763 --> 01:08:47,238
You saw him
at the party with me.

543
01:08:49,322 --> 01:08:50,973
He doesn't love me.

544
01:08:52,656 --> 01:08:53,316
And so...

545
01:08:53,341 --> 01:08:54,639
I love him anyways.

546
01:08:55,403 --> 01:08:57,288
I can't help myself.

547
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:59,524
I'm in love with him.

548
01:09:02,325 --> 01:09:03,268
I'm sorry.

549
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:17,562
Dad, I'm getting married.

550
01:09:17,812 --> 01:09:18,637
Oh!

551
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,969
And who is the lucky lady?

552
01:09:21,312 --> 01:09:22,372
No, it's not that.

553
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:26,896
I'm gonna marry the first girl
who dances with me tonight.

554
01:10:05,106 --> 01:10:06,521
Thanks, Nemo.

555
01:10:43,788 --> 01:10:45,085
Nemo.

556
01:10:50,924 --> 01:10:55,048
On that day, I would make
a lot of foolish decisions.

557
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:59,734
One, I will never
leave anything to chance again.

558
01:10:59,759 --> 01:11:02,577
Two, I will marry the girl
on my motorcycle.

559
01:11:03,086 --> 01:11:04,972
Three, I'll be rich.

560
01:11:05,176 --> 01:11:06,944
Four, we'll have a house.

561
01:11:07,338 --> 01:11:08,582
A big house!

562
01:11:08,607 --> 01:11:10,826
Painted yellow, with a garden,

563
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:13,265
and two children,
Paul and Michael.

564
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:16,877
Five, I'll have a convertible--
A red convertible.

565
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:19,341
And a swimming pool.
I'll learn to swim.

566
01:11:19,486 --> 01:11:23,492
Six, I will not stop
until I've succeeded.

567
01:11:44,674 --> 01:11:45,970
Daddy?

568
01:11:48,206 --> 01:11:49,385
Daddy?

569
01:11:53,621 --> 01:11:55,625
Paul, don't wake your father.

570
01:11:56,524 --> 01:11:57,584
Elise?

571
01:11:58,153 --> 01:11:59,921
It's me, Jean.

572
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,737
Who is Elise?

573
01:12:07,632 --> 01:12:09,517
I don't know
anyone called Elise.

574
01:12:10,221 --> 01:12:12,107
Go back and play Paul.

575
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:17,586
Nemo, do I matter to you?

576
01:12:21,364 --> 01:12:22,307
I just...

577
01:12:22,542 --> 01:12:25,133
I just like
to ask you one question.

578
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:28,495
Did you do it on purpose?

579
01:12:31,483 --> 01:12:34,193
I found this
on the bedside table.

580
01:12:35,229 --> 01:12:39,591
There comes a time in life
when everything seems narrow.

581
01:12:39,616 --> 01:12:44,294
Choices have been made
I can only continue on.

582
01:12:44,604 --> 01:12:47,668
I know myself like
the back of my hand.

583
01:12:48,715 --> 01:12:51,401
I can predict my every reaction.

584
01:12:51,426 --> 01:12:53,033
Everything is predictable.

585
01:12:53,733 --> 01:12:58,541
My life has been cast in cement
with airbags and seatbelts.

586
01:12:58,566 --> 01:13:00,482
I've controlled everything.

587
01:13:00,507 --> 01:13:05,103
I've done everything to reach
this point and now that I'm here,

588
01:13:05,355 --> 01:13:07,477
I'm fucking bored.

589
01:13:09,627 --> 01:13:13,045
The hardest thing is knowing
whether I'm still alive.

590
01:13:20,727 --> 01:13:22,965
It is my handwriting.

591
01:13:24,181 --> 01:13:26,184
I don't remember.

592
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:44,606
Jean?

593
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:50,205
What did you say?

594
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,093
I had a weird dream.

595
01:14:15,398 --> 01:14:18,585
Well, it's important for you to understand.

596
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:22,229
In life things don't always turn out...

597
01:14:22,804 --> 01:14:24,648
as we plan them.

598
01:14:25,371 --> 01:14:27,156
Harry and I thought...

599
01:14:29,676 --> 01:14:31,793
Life isn't what we all think it will be.

600
01:14:32,523 --> 01:14:34,532
What are you talking about?

601
01:14:35,781 --> 01:14:36,961
I don't understand.

602
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:39,958
Anna knows already.

603
01:14:42,907 --> 01:14:45,501
Harry and I
are going to separate.

604
01:14:46,977 --> 01:14:48,037
What?

605
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,671
Why?

606
01:14:52,568 --> 01:14:56,221
- You have no right!
- Please, you played your part!

607
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:58,459
I don't know what is going on
between you two

608
01:14:58,484 --> 01:15:00,958
and I don't wanna know.
It's sick!

609
01:15:01,088 --> 01:15:04,012
You're brother and sister,
for God's sake.

610
01:15:04,037 --> 01:15:06,416
We are not brother and sister!

611
01:15:13,126 --> 01:15:14,305
You knew!

612
01:15:15,889 --> 01:15:17,538
And you didn't tell me.

613
01:15:25,344 --> 01:15:26,640
Where are you going?

614
01:15:29,484 --> 01:15:30,899
To New York.

615
01:15:33,146 --> 01:15:35,384
In ten days.

616
01:15:36,924 --> 01:15:39,281
My father found a job there.

617
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:51,767
Wait for me
near the lighthouse...

618
01:15:52,376 --> 01:15:54,499
every Sunday, okay?

619
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:58,609
Until we see each other again.

620
01:15:58,714 --> 01:16:00,952
For life, okay?

621
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,486
It's not over.

622
01:16:13,967 --> 01:16:17,621
You're the first and last person
I'll ever love.

623
01:16:19,264 --> 01:16:20,797
Ten days.

624
01:16:22,879 --> 01:16:23,822
That makes...

625
01:16:25,531 --> 01:16:27,180
14 thousand...

626
01:16:28,089 --> 01:16:29,975
400 minutes.

627
01:16:34,032 --> 01:16:36,743
I wish everything
would stop right now.

628
01:16:39,044 --> 01:16:41,403
Things would stay
this way forever.

629
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:47,118
They say that
if you slow your breathing...

630
01:16:48,289 --> 01:16:50,057
time slows down.

631
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,887
The Hindu say so.

632
01:17:34,743 --> 01:17:39,337
I have to remember the smell
of every part of your body.

633
01:17:48,959 --> 01:17:51,082
We'll meet near the lighthouse.

634
01:18:14,805 --> 01:18:16,809
Anna, it's time to go.

635
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:28,735
I love you.

636
01:19:12,545 --> 01:19:15,491
Anna!

637
01:19:51,136 --> 01:19:51,961
Anna...

638
01:19:53,141 --> 01:19:54,437
Can you hear me?

639
01:20:17,032 --> 01:20:18,800
We must look to the future.

640
01:20:19,605 --> 01:20:21,608
It will be good to move house.

641
01:20:21,878 --> 01:20:23,174
Have a new life.

642
01:20:24,107 --> 01:20:25,523
Will we have a pool?

643
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:28,806
You hate water.
You don't even swim.

644
01:20:29,482 --> 01:20:32,436
- You never know what you want.
- You know what I don't want?

645
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:35,371
So tell me, what is it
you don't want?

646
01:20:37,523 --> 01:20:39,526
I don't want to be like you.

647
01:20:41,995 --> 01:20:43,528
You know nothing about me.

648
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:46,767
I've always loved pools.

649
01:20:49,045 --> 01:20:50,813
When I'm older,
I'll have a pool.

650
01:21:46,771 --> 01:21:47,950
Anna.

651
01:21:49,475 --> 01:21:50,275
Anna.

652
01:21:52,363 --> 01:21:56,252
I feel like I'll be seeing you
at every street corner.

653
01:22:17,961 --> 01:22:20,437
Sometimes I tell myself...

654
01:22:21,126 --> 01:22:23,720
maybe you live
in the same town I do

655
01:22:24,033 --> 01:22:25,801
and I don't know where.

656
01:22:26,134 --> 01:22:29,316
Maybe you're here, very close.

657
01:22:29,999 --> 01:22:33,417
Nemo, do you hear my voice?

658
01:22:35,495 --> 01:22:36,675
Anna!

659
01:22:38,126 --> 01:22:41,208
After 90 days,
the on board computer

660
01:22:41,233 --> 01:22:43,920
is still maintaining
the passengers' metabolism

661
01:22:43,945 --> 01:22:46,384
at the level
of a hibernating frog.

662
01:23:12,642 --> 01:23:14,827
He'd always been fascinated
by the fact

663
01:23:14,852 --> 01:23:18,294
that certain frogs can spend
the winter completely frozen.

664
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:20,618
And that
when spring comes comma,

665
01:23:20,643 --> 01:23:24,838
they defrost
and begin living again period.

666
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:28,512
The on board computer displayed...

667
01:23:28,822 --> 01:23:31,179
"End of hibernation".

668
01:23:45,363 --> 01:23:47,131
<i>Welcome to Mars.</i>

669
01:23:47,636 --> 01:23:52,406
<i>We hope you had a pleasant dream
and a refreshing re-awakening.</i>

670
01:23:52,431 --> 01:23:57,059
<i>Please leave your sleep suits in
your suspended animation cubicles</i>

671
01:23:57,084 --> 01:24:00,467
<i>and make your way
through to the Arrivals lounge.</i>

672
01:24:02,115 --> 01:24:05,366
<i>You will be directed to
the rest and recoveration rooms</i>

673
01:24:05,391 --> 01:24:09,952
<i>to prepare for your first excursion
to the red planet itself.</i>

674
01:24:13,328 --> 01:24:16,033
Probably the worst thing
about being on Mars

675
01:24:16,058 --> 01:24:18,145
is that nothing
will happen there.

676
01:24:18,646 --> 01:24:21,004
Time will seem stole and empty.

677
01:24:22,551 --> 01:24:25,025
That doesn't look
like there's much to do.

678
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:27,287
I hope I brought enough we took.

679
01:24:55,218 --> 01:24:56,161
Day time.

680
01:24:57,761 --> 01:24:59,058
It's day time.

681
01:25:00,899 --> 01:25:01,842
The sun is out.

682
01:25:03,474 --> 01:25:06,302
It's warmer on the right
than on the left

683
01:25:09,945 --> 01:25:14,541
She's different
from the one this morning.

684
01:25:16,556 --> 01:25:18,441
Not the same perfume.

685
01:25:20,778 --> 01:25:22,781
Her hands are soft.

686
01:25:25,061 --> 01:25:26,240
Elise.

687
01:25:28,894 --> 01:25:30,425
Is that Elise?

688
01:25:34,705 --> 01:25:36,945
We sh... We shouldn't.

689
01:25:39,202 --> 01:25:41,323
- I love Stefano.
- Shh.

690
01:25:43,563 --> 01:25:44,859
Don't say anything.

691
01:25:45,962 --> 01:25:47,258
You're the one I love.

692
01:25:49,257 --> 01:25:51,024
You can count on me for Mars.

693
01:25:52,474 --> 01:25:53,652
I promise.

694
01:26:31,609 --> 01:26:33,849
Do you wanna go
for a walk or something?

695
01:26:35,419 --> 01:26:37,540
I don't want anything.

696
01:26:38,507 --> 01:26:39,567
Nothing.

697
01:26:44,439 --> 01:26:47,504
- I'm so horrible.
- No, you're not.

698
01:26:47,712 --> 01:26:51,197
- You're not horrible.
- I can't stand this life anymore.

699
01:26:51,222 --> 01:26:53,813
Think about it, you've got
the most incredible kids.

700
01:26:53,838 --> 01:26:57,457
Stop trying to make me feel better.
I'm actually feeling guiltier.

701
01:27:01,264 --> 01:27:03,622
What's wrong with me?

702
01:27:06,197 --> 01:27:08,319
What is wrong with me?

703
01:27:17,501 --> 01:27:18,561
How's Mom?

704
01:27:19,533 --> 01:27:22,126
She's just a little tired.
She's sleeping.

705
01:27:22,285 --> 01:27:26,765
- She's always tired.
- Yeah, she's always tired.

706
01:27:28,127 --> 01:27:29,423
Is she depressed?

707
01:27:30,117 --> 01:27:31,768
Well, she has ups and downs.

708
01:27:32,493 --> 01:27:33,674
I don't know about you,

709
01:27:33,699 --> 01:27:35,718
but next time Mom
has one of her meltdowns,

710
01:27:35,743 --> 01:27:37,594
I'm gonna go
live somewhere else.

711
01:27:42,718 --> 01:27:46,725
So... who has a joke?

712
01:27:48,157 --> 01:27:48,957
Anybody?

713
01:27:50,862 --> 01:27:51,805
I do.

714
01:27:52,574 --> 01:27:57,406
What's green, small
and goes up and down?

715
01:27:58,057 --> 01:27:59,794
A pea in an elevator.

716
01:27:59,819 --> 01:28:03,438
It's not funny.
Old people humor.

717
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:06,549
Are you gonna be okay?

718
01:28:06,913 --> 01:28:10,685
Of course. Not 'cause Mom's
not okay that I'm not okay.

719
01:28:30,336 --> 01:28:32,222
I can't stand it anymore.

720
01:28:32,744 --> 01:28:36,278
- That noise...
- I'll ask them to keep it down.

721
01:28:37,477 --> 01:28:39,715
But it is Joyce's birthday.

722
01:28:42,991 --> 01:28:44,640
What kind of mother am I?

723
01:28:48,113 --> 01:28:49,056
I gotta get up.

724
01:29:12,850 --> 01:29:14,384
- Are you having a good time?
- Yeah.

725
01:29:14,409 --> 01:29:15,809
Can I tell you one thing?

726
01:29:15,834 --> 01:29:18,014
You're not allowed to be partying
and not have a good time.

727
01:29:18,039 --> 01:29:18,583
It doesn't work that way.

728
01:29:18,608 --> 01:29:20,105
- I know...
- And you know what, Tess?

729
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:21,637
You look beautiful.

730
01:29:21,662 --> 01:29:23,543
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful...

731
01:29:23,568 --> 01:29:25,311
But your friends aren't
dancing enough...

732
01:29:25,336 --> 01:29:28,165
And your mother has to
take care of the situation!

733
01:29:29,153 --> 01:29:30,214
Dancing!

734
01:29:32,699 --> 01:29:33,877
You, over there!

735
01:29:48,304 --> 01:29:50,072
Oh, oh!
This makes me like...

736
01:29:51,576 --> 01:29:52,755
Like a dog!

737
01:30:03,063 --> 01:30:06,009
Now let's get ready.
Take one... two... three!

738
01:30:28,165 --> 01:30:30,285
It was a nice day.

739
01:30:32,819 --> 01:30:35,058
Nicest in a long time.

740
01:30:40,508 --> 01:30:42,369
Okey-dokey.

741
01:30:42,394 --> 01:30:43,839
- Ready?
- Bye, Dad.

742
01:30:44,882 --> 01:30:46,979
Bye. Bye.

743
01:30:47,004 --> 01:30:48,291
- Have fun.
- Bye, Dad.

744
01:30:49,529 --> 01:30:50,472
Bye-bye!

745
01:32:11,132 --> 01:32:12,486
I'm leaving!

746
01:32:12,511 --> 01:32:14,655
I'm leaving! I'm leaving!

747
01:32:42,298 --> 01:32:43,445
Everything will be OK.

748
01:32:44,806 --> 01:32:46,264
That will be all right. Come on.

749
01:32:57,676 --> 01:32:59,294
Do you love me?

750
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:03,447
I could not live without you.

751
01:36:13,803 --> 01:36:15,884
There is no life without you.

752
01:36:21,698 --> 01:36:23,230
Go slowly.

753
01:36:26,409 --> 01:36:28,294
I have to get used to it.

754
01:36:32,411 --> 01:36:37,949
I talked to you so much when you
weren't there. It's so strange for me...

755
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:40,253
to talk to you for real.

756
01:36:57,701 --> 01:36:59,704
I need some time, Nemo.

757
01:37:02,396 --> 01:37:04,518
When we were separated at 15,

758
01:37:04,690 --> 01:37:07,758
I said I would never love
anyone else.

759
01:37:07,783 --> 01:37:08,583
Ever.

760
01:37:10,005 --> 01:37:11,891
I would never become attached.

761
01:37:12,473 --> 01:37:14,594
I'd never see you put anywhere.

762
01:37:14,918 --> 01:37:17,039
I'd have nothing for myself.

763
01:37:20,213 --> 01:37:23,985
I decided
I would pretend to be alive.

764
01:37:28,990 --> 01:37:31,228
And this is
what I've been waiting for.

765
01:37:31,909 --> 01:37:33,912
All this time...

766
01:37:35,931 --> 01:37:40,999
Renouncing all possible lives,
for one only...

767
01:37:42,101 --> 01:37:43,161
With you.

768
01:37:53,198 --> 01:37:54,957
But I'm not used to it anymore.

769
01:37:56,710 --> 01:38:00,537
You know... love... I mean.

770
01:38:04,413 --> 01:38:06,521
I'm afraid of losing you again,

771
01:38:07,139 --> 01:38:09,775
I'm afraid of having to do
without you again

772
01:38:10,201 --> 01:38:11,001
I...

773
01:38:11,757 --> 01:38:13,354
I'm terrified of that.

774
01:38:18,768 --> 01:38:20,455
We need to take some time

775
01:38:21,961 --> 01:38:24,295
And, when will I see you again?

776
01:38:31,783 --> 01:38:33,308
Call me at this number

777
01:38:37,088 --> 01:38:38,218
in two days

778
01:38:42,577 --> 01:38:44,248
I'll meet you at the lighthouse.

779
01:39:27,623 --> 01:39:30,568
You know why I lost Anna?

780
01:39:32,199 --> 01:39:34,673
Because two months earlier

781
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:38,358
An unemployed Brazilian boiled an egg

782
01:39:44,129 --> 01:39:48,177
The heat created
a micro-climate in the room

783
01:39:48,926 --> 01:39:51,437
slight difference of temperature.

784
01:39:54,373 --> 01:39:58,386
And heavy rain, two months later
on the other side of the world

785
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:05,519
that Brazilian boiled an egg
instead of being at work

786
01:40:05,927 --> 01:40:08,586
He would have lost his job
in a clothing factory

787
01:40:08,931 --> 01:40:10,644
because six months earlier

788
01:40:11,015 --> 01:40:13,122
I would have compared
the prices of jeans

789
01:40:13,147 --> 01:40:15,434
and I will have bought
the cheaper pair.

790
01:40:15,825 --> 01:40:17,691
As the Chinese proverb says

791
01:40:18,174 --> 01:40:20,915
"A single snowflake
can bend the leaf of the bamboo."

792
01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:25,766
Jeans production will have
moved to other countries.

793
01:40:34,282 --> 01:40:36,901
I lost every trace of Anna.

794
01:40:40,749 --> 01:40:42,283
I waited for her...

795
01:40:43,747 --> 01:40:44,891
every day.

796
01:42:15,908 --> 01:42:16,708
Anna.

797
01:42:21,341 --> 01:42:22,424
Nemo.

798
01:42:32,677 --> 01:42:33,654
It's back.

799
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:35,140
The fear is back.

800
01:42:35,165 --> 01:42:37,683
I'm sick of pills!

801
01:42:37,708 --> 01:42:40,895
I'm sick of doctors. It's pointless.

802
01:42:41,582 --> 01:42:44,255
I'll do something.
I can't stand it any more.

803
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:46,054
I'm afraid.

804
01:42:46,394 --> 01:42:48,320
I don't know what to do...

805
01:42:52,638 --> 01:42:54,306
I often have this dream.

806
01:42:55,314 --> 01:42:56,946
It's a prehistoric time.

807
01:42:58,806 --> 01:43:00,254
I can hear you screaming...

808
01:43:12,431 --> 01:43:13,861
I chased the bear.

809
01:43:14,883 --> 01:43:16,878
And you're not afraid anymore.

810
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:19,198
But when I wake up...

811
01:43:21,335 --> 01:43:22,958
When I wake up

812
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:24,900
there's no bear

813
01:43:26,385 --> 01:43:28,395
but you're still afraid.

814
01:43:28,892 --> 01:43:30,861
I'm not a bear hunter

815
01:43:31,817 --> 01:43:35,031
I'm an executive of a plant that
manufactures photocopy machines

816
01:43:35,595 --> 01:43:37,065
who just quit his job.

817
01:43:38,792 --> 01:43:39,950
I don't dare to move.

818
01:43:41,805 --> 01:43:42,715
I don't live

819
01:43:44,483 --> 01:43:46,388
All of I do is a disaster

820
01:43:49,244 --> 01:43:51,957
I would so love to be able
to chase the bear away...

821
01:43:52,954 --> 01:43:54,978
and for you not to be afraid anymore.

822
01:43:59,056 --> 01:44:01,776
To what extent are our fears innate?

823
01:44:03,476 --> 01:44:05,645
When we hatch goose eggs
in an incubator,

824
01:44:06,147 --> 01:44:11,127
and then, above the baby birds
pass a form simulating a goose in flight

825
01:44:11,947 --> 01:44:14,367
the birds stretch
their necks and call out

826
01:44:14,815 --> 01:44:16,941
But if we invert the direction
of the silhouette,

827
01:44:18,417 --> 01:44:20,197
it conjures the shape
of a falcon.

828
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:23,034
The response of the baby birds
is immediate.

829
01:44:23,605 --> 01:44:27,344
They will crouch and fear, though
they've never before seen a falcon.

830
01:44:27,662 --> 01:44:29,788
Without any instruction,

831
01:44:30,612 --> 01:44:33,640
an innate fear
helps them to survive.

832
01:44:35,211 --> 01:44:36,263
But in humans...

833
01:44:37,433 --> 01:44:39,427
to what ancient dangers...

834
01:44:40,113 --> 01:44:42,401
might our innate fears correspond?

835
01:45:21,156 --> 01:45:24,641
NEMO... TURN AROUND...

836
01:45:36,554 --> 01:45:37,555
Hey.

837
01:45:38,138 --> 01:45:38,938
Hey!

838
01:45:39,892 --> 01:45:40,826
Excuse me!

839
01:46:26,073 --> 01:46:27,559
Remember...

840
01:46:29,183 --> 01:46:30,559
Remember!

841
01:47:45,184 --> 01:47:46,402
Honey, it's me.

842
01:49:03,751 --> 01:49:05,956
Did Elise die or didn't she?

843
01:49:07,085 --> 01:49:08,133
I don't get it.

844
01:49:09,186 --> 01:49:11,506
You can't have had children
and not have had them.

845
01:49:21,314 --> 01:49:22,284
Hi, Dad.

846
01:49:24,597 --> 01:49:25,397
Hi.

847
01:49:26,459 --> 01:49:27,389
Hey.

848
01:49:29,215 --> 01:49:30,840
I'll be in a minute, guys.

849
01:49:54,373 --> 01:49:57,306
- You're not hungry?
- I don't want anything.

850
01:49:57,962 --> 01:49:59,118
Nothing.

851
01:50:03,149 --> 01:50:04,358
What are you doing today?

852
01:50:05,354 --> 01:50:09,136
I was thinking about taking
the opportunity to wash the car.

853
01:50:15,117 --> 01:50:16,539
What's the deal with that car?

854
01:50:19,028 --> 01:50:20,136
What do you mean?

855
01:50:21,329 --> 01:50:24,813
Why do you such good care of that car
while you leave me here all alone?

856
01:50:27,338 --> 01:50:28,769
What's the problem of the car?

857
01:51:17,991 --> 01:51:20,354
There's no more problem
with the car.

858
01:51:34,841 --> 01:51:35,882
What's wrong?

859
01:51:36,606 --> 01:51:38,347
Why are you looking at me
like that?

860
01:51:39,495 --> 01:51:41,526
Why are you looking at me
like that?

861
01:51:43,771 --> 01:51:44,757
Nemo.

862
01:51:46,531 --> 01:51:48,669
Do I take sugar in my coffee?

863
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:53,768
Can you please answer me?

864
01:51:54,196 --> 01:51:55,197
Nemo.

865
01:51:59,385 --> 01:52:03,201
You don't know me, Nemo.
You've never really looked at me.

866
01:52:10,074 --> 01:52:12,788
You've always been elsewhere.

867
01:52:14,386 --> 01:52:17,617
Do you realize how much
you've hurt me?

868
01:52:26,153 --> 01:52:31,124
I got a call from the lawyer. He
just says you just put everything

869
01:52:31,149 --> 01:52:33,160
you own on my name.

870
01:52:34,324 --> 01:52:36,018
Why, Nemo?

871
01:52:37,415 --> 01:52:39,342
What you're up to?

872
01:52:57,524 --> 01:52:59,630
Are you angling for success?

873
01:52:59,655 --> 01:53:01,534
Then you need a
butterfly fishing rod.

874
01:53:01,559 --> 01:53:04,521
For tension and strength is...

875
01:53:04,546 --> 01:53:07,660
Buy one today, available now.

876
01:53:14,766 --> 01:53:15,767
Jean.

877
01:53:16,772 --> 01:53:18,838
I'm after buy a fishing rod.

878
01:54:06,767 --> 01:54:08,095
Mr. Jones.

879
01:54:10,032 --> 01:54:12,438
- Yes.
- We already have your luggage.

880
01:54:12,463 --> 01:54:14,368
Please, follow me.

881
01:54:14,393 --> 01:54:17,003
I'll take you to the hotel
where you can rest for a while.

882
01:54:17,028 --> 01:54:19,090
The appointment is at 3 PM.

883
01:54:45,692 --> 01:54:47,059
Daniel.

884
01:54:47,874 --> 01:54:49,733
Daniel Jones.

885
01:54:49,758 --> 01:54:52,146
Daniel Jones.

886
01:54:53,553 --> 01:54:56,972
Is your name Daniel Jones?

887
01:54:58,818 --> 01:55:01,370
Of course not!

888
01:55:06,395 --> 01:55:08,695
Daniel Jones...

889
01:55:12,039 --> 01:55:13,040
Hallo?

890
01:55:13,886 --> 01:55:14,887
Daniel?

891
01:55:15,824 --> 01:55:16,825
Yes.

892
01:55:17,163 --> 01:55:19,172
Are you insane?

893
01:55:19,197 --> 01:55:21,832
I told you not to go. They are furious!

894
01:55:21,857 --> 01:55:24,265
They know it's you. Don't stay there!

895
01:55:57,804 --> 01:55:59,541
This is weird.

896
01:56:00,129 --> 01:56:02,367
His shoes are different sizes.

897
01:56:13,736 --> 01:56:15,098
Maybe he shrunk.

898
01:56:15,123 --> 01:56:17,598
Times when you get older,
you shrink.

899
01:56:17,623 --> 01:56:19,282
No one shrinks, that's rubbish.

900
01:56:19,690 --> 01:56:21,361
You got the wrong plug, that's all.

901
01:56:22,264 --> 01:56:24,969
Astronauts shrink two inches
when they come back to Earth.

902
01:56:25,528 --> 01:56:28,832
- Because of gravity or something.
- You think this fellow is an astronaut?

903
01:56:59,369 --> 01:57:02,133
The ground doesn't vibrate
in the same way.

904
01:57:04,683 --> 01:57:06,179
It's a different perfume.

905
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:10,238
How old might she be?

906
01:57:10,731 --> 01:57:12,165
Twenty five?

907
01:57:14,571 --> 01:57:17,447
There are other people too.

908
01:57:26,382 --> 01:57:28,865
Let's begin again.

909
01:57:29,391 --> 01:57:31,090
Fingers on the keyboard.

910
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:36,244
Left hand: A, S, D, F.

911
01:57:37,914 --> 01:57:40,994
Right hand: H, J, K, L.

912
01:58:58,170 --> 01:59:01,644
- What's wrong?
- I was dreaming about Stefano.

913
01:59:04,996 --> 01:59:06,809
He doesn't give a damn about me.

914
01:59:08,569 --> 01:59:09,570
Stefano?

915
01:59:16,324 --> 01:59:17,375
I love him.

916
01:59:19,769 --> 01:59:22,362
I can't see any other explanation
for being in this state.

917
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:26,557
That's the only thing it can be.

918
01:59:28,628 --> 01:59:29,697
I love him.

919
01:59:32,478 --> 01:59:33,757
I know I'm crazy.

920
01:59:36,430 --> 01:59:39,381
Every morning when I wake up,
I open my eyes and I see your face

921
01:59:39,773 --> 01:59:41,375
and I start crying.

922
01:59:44,606 --> 01:59:48,147
I realize that with you,
my life is passing me by.

923
01:59:52,451 --> 01:59:55,478
How can you stay so calm?

924
01:59:55,503 --> 01:59:58,193
How can you bear that?

925
01:59:58,218 --> 02:00:00,076
You're not human.

926
02:00:00,101 --> 02:00:01,680
I don't know what to do.

927
02:00:03,457 --> 02:00:05,290
It's not my fault, right?

928
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:07,646
You're not gonna leave me,
are you?

929
02:00:08,247 --> 02:00:10,186
No, I couldn't live without you.

930
02:00:13,096 --> 02:00:14,594
I've hurt everybody.

931
02:00:15,807 --> 02:00:17,355
I've hurt you.

932
02:00:18,638 --> 02:00:20,179
The children...

933
02:00:21,638 --> 02:00:24,652
- I just can't go on.
- Together we can do it.

934
02:00:25,025 --> 02:00:27,737
If I stay here, you're all gonna
end up drowning with me.

935
02:00:29,138 --> 02:00:30,581
We'll learn to swim.

936
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:32,794
I love you.

937
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:35,925
I love you.

938
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:40,349
I love you.

939
02:01:00,652 --> 02:01:01,852
She left me.

940
02:01:06,929 --> 02:01:09,358
You know what they say...

941
02:01:10,569 --> 02:01:13,257
Everything works out in the end,

942
02:01:15,216 --> 02:01:16,402
even badly.

943
02:01:45,824 --> 02:01:46,624
Hello?

944
02:01:57,617 --> 02:02:00,023
Not too much at the top, thanks.

945
02:02:13,291 --> 02:02:15,461
- How much should that be?
- $20, please.

946
02:02:16,809 --> 02:02:18,287
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

947
02:02:31,347 --> 02:02:34,161
- $20 please, sir.
- Here you are.

948
02:02:34,419 --> 02:02:35,650
Thank you. Bye, sir.

949
02:02:35,984 --> 02:02:38,722
Bye, and have a nice afternoon.

950
02:03:03,175 --> 02:03:06,477
Why does cigarette smoke
never go back into the cigarette?

951
02:03:07,214 --> 02:03:09,517
Why do molecules spread
away from each other?

952
02:03:10,077 --> 02:03:12,428
Why does a spilled drop
of ink never reform?

953
02:03:13,194 --> 02:03:17,257
Because the Universe
moves towards a state of dissipation.

954
02:03:17,843 --> 02:03:19,540
That is the principle of entropy...

955
02:03:19,835 --> 02:03:21,431
The tendency of the Universe

956
02:03:21,914 --> 02:03:24,973
to evolve toward a state
of increasing disorder.

957
02:03:25,613 --> 02:03:26,962
The principle of entropy

958
02:03:27,101 --> 02:03:29,788
is related
to the arrow of time...

959
02:03:30,329 --> 02:03:32,697
A result of the expansion
of the Universe.

960
02:03:32,971 --> 02:03:35,047
But what will happen
when gravitational forces

961
02:03:35,154 --> 02:03:37,665
counter-balance
the forces of expansion?

962
02:03:38,395 --> 02:03:40,996
Or if the energy of the quantum void
proves too weak?

963
02:03:41,756 --> 02:03:45,381
At that moment, the universe
might enter its phase of contraction.

964
02:03:46,033 --> 02:03:47,260
The Big Crunch.

965
02:03:51,536 --> 02:03:53,035
So what will become of time?

966
02:03:56,996 --> 02:03:58,132
Will it reverse?

967
02:04:05,303 --> 02:04:07,017
No one knows the answer.

968
02:04:12,341 --> 02:04:13,318
Where is Peter?

969
02:04:13,343 --> 02:04:17,691
He left an hour ago. I'm replacing
him. I've selected take 3 and take 4.

970
02:04:18,139 --> 02:04:21,318
I prefer that Peter does it. I don't mean
to say you're not good enough.

971
02:04:21,343 --> 02:04:22,344
But...

972
02:04:22,971 --> 02:04:25,372
Drop it. In live you get one take.

973
02:04:25,397 --> 02:04:27,931
If it's bad, you just deal with it.

974
02:04:56,916 --> 02:04:58,485
You know him?

975
02:04:59,419 --> 02:05:01,459
We work together.

976
02:05:02,968 --> 02:05:06,447
If I should die, and you should live,

977
02:05:39,374 --> 02:05:40,883
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

978
02:05:40,908 --> 02:05:43,182
My sincerest condolences.

979
02:05:43,338 --> 02:05:45,281
Peter was a colleague.

980
02:05:45,693 --> 02:05:46,753
Of course.

981
02:05:46,778 --> 02:05:49,720
I've seen your show.
Thank you for coming.

982
02:06:22,988 --> 02:06:24,924
<i>Please take
this opportunity to take</i>

983
02:06:25,089 --> 02:06:27,712
<i>one last close look
at the planet's surface.</i>

984
02:06:28,215 --> 02:06:30,401
<i>from our observation dome.</i>

985
02:06:30,637 --> 02:06:35,124
<i>Your elevator will arrive shortly
in the Mars transit station.</i>

986
02:06:41,387 --> 02:06:43,789
What are we doing
with all those bikes?

987
02:06:44,768 --> 02:06:47,575
They're for export.
Labor is much cheaper here.

988
02:06:48,021 --> 02:06:50,538
China has become
way too expensive.

989
02:06:52,509 --> 02:06:54,894
<i>Please proceed
to the preparation area</i>

990
02:06:55,628 --> 02:06:58,929
<i>where you will be reissued
to your sleep suits.</i>

991
02:06:59,394 --> 02:07:02,701
<i>You will also receive your...</i>

992
02:07:03,179 --> 02:07:03,979
Hi.

993
02:07:05,073 --> 02:07:06,091
I'm Nemo.

994
02:07:07,190 --> 02:07:07,990
Anna...

995
02:07:08,986 --> 02:07:10,155
Nice to meet you.

996
02:07:14,995 --> 02:07:16,340
What brings you to Mars?

997
02:07:17,274 --> 02:07:21,777
I'm measuring the distance between
Mars and Earth at it's greatest.

998
02:07:22,352 --> 02:07:24,575
I study time. You know...

999
02:07:25,129 --> 02:07:28,514
Thing that makes it so that
everything doesn't happen at once.

1000
02:07:32,195 --> 02:07:32,995
And?

1001
02:07:33,121 --> 02:07:35,424
The Big Crunch
will happen in 2092

1002
02:07:35,695 --> 02:07:40,357
and people who can't hang
on that long will get a free run.

1003
02:07:41,711 --> 02:07:42,669
And you?

1004
02:07:43,219 --> 02:07:45,183
I'm just keeping an old promise.

1005
02:07:51,106 --> 02:07:52,107
Hi.

1006
02:07:52,877 --> 02:07:53,878
Hi.

1007
02:07:55,373 --> 02:07:58,176
We ah... met at your husband's funeral.

1008
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:00,061
Right.

1009
02:08:00,682 --> 02:08:03,434
I had the strangest feeling when
I saw you that we have met before.

1010
02:08:04,570 --> 02:08:06,699
It's called Déjà vú.

1011
02:08:06,724 --> 02:08:08,292
That's not it.

1012
02:08:09,139 --> 02:08:10,868
It's as if...

1013
02:08:10,893 --> 02:08:13,149
all of this was in real.

1014
02:08:14,939 --> 02:08:18,823
I'm sorry you must think
that I'm completely crazy.

1015
02:08:19,893 --> 02:08:22,472
I'm not trying to flirt with you.

1016
02:08:22,497 --> 02:08:24,097
I am widower myself.

1017
02:08:24,122 --> 02:08:26,500
I... I'm sorry. I have to go.

1018
02:08:26,525 --> 02:08:28,273
May be some other time.

1019
02:08:33,782 --> 02:08:34,783
Nemo?

1020
02:08:36,128 --> 02:08:39,067
I heard you were dead.
That you drowned.

1021
02:08:39,092 --> 02:08:40,531
Drowned?

1022
02:09:53,762 --> 02:09:56,938
<i>Alert! Alert!
Meteors approaching.</i>

1023
02:09:57,978 --> 02:09:58,983
<i>Don't panic.</i>

1024
02:10:00,672 --> 02:10:02,629
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>

1025
02:10:21,211 --> 02:10:22,480
I wanna wake up.

1026
02:10:24,370 --> 02:10:25,793
I wanna wake up!

1027
02:10:26,433 --> 02:10:28,064
I wanna wake up!

1028
02:10:29,637 --> 02:10:32,509
GAME OVER.

1029
02:10:32,534 --> 02:10:33,852
Are you alright?

1030
02:10:35,890 --> 02:10:37,196
Are you alright?

1031
02:10:38,897 --> 02:10:41,786
When I say three,
you'll be awake.

1032
02:10:42,887 --> 02:10:43,900
One...

1033
02:10:49,018 --> 02:10:50,025
Two...

1034
02:10:56,244 --> 02:10:57,044
Three.

1035
02:11:10,912 --> 02:11:13,095
WAKE UP...

1036
02:11:43,991 --> 02:11:46,144
- Mother.
- Do I know you?

1037
02:11:47,132 --> 02:11:48,914
- It's me!
- What do you want?

1038
02:11:49,177 --> 02:11:50,949
- Henry!
- It's me. Your son, Nemo.

1039
02:11:52,039 --> 02:11:53,645
My son's just here.

1040
02:11:55,678 --> 02:11:59,414
I don't know you. You're mad.
Now go away or I'll call the police.

1041
02:12:00,534 --> 02:12:01,385
Mother.

1042
02:12:01,410 --> 02:12:02,443
Mother.

1043
02:12:19,111 --> 02:12:20,712
What do you see?

1044
02:12:20,737 --> 02:12:22,888
He asks me what I see.

1045
02:12:27,224 --> 02:12:29,538
I say, it's an ink stain.

1046
02:12:30,471 --> 02:12:31,435
He says:

1047
02:12:31,460 --> 02:12:33,630
You have to say more.

1048
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:36,942
I say, it's an ink stain
on a sheet of paper.

1049
02:12:38,317 --> 02:12:39,318
No.

1050
02:12:40,283 --> 02:12:44,078
You have to say, what
goes through your mind.

1051
02:12:48,615 --> 02:12:50,890
It makes me think of an inkwell.

1052
02:12:50,915 --> 02:12:53,471
So then he says: "Ok...

1053
02:12:54,551 --> 02:12:56,172
that's fine".

1054
02:13:10,466 --> 02:13:13,219
You have until tomorrow to vote.

1055
02:13:13,694 --> 02:13:14,671
Vote!

1056
02:13:14,696 --> 02:13:16,727
And win a vacation on the Moon.

1057
02:13:16,752 --> 02:13:18,171
For the whole family.

1058
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:20,906
Win a trip to the Moon!

1059
02:13:21,390 --> 02:13:24,169
Take a swing at a fabulous golf vacation.

1060
02:13:37,224 --> 02:13:40,157
Have they announced
the results of the voting?

1061
02:13:41,187 --> 02:13:42,582
I'm sorry.

1062
02:13:42,607 --> 02:13:45,302
At my age,

1063
02:13:45,327 --> 02:13:49,118
the candles cost more than a cake.

1064
02:13:53,229 --> 02:13:55,683
I'm not afraid of dying.

1065
02:13:55,987 --> 02:13:59,049
I'm afraid I haven't been alive enough!

1066
02:14:02,455 --> 02:14:06,701
It should be written on every
schoolroom blackboard.

1067
02:14:08,490 --> 02:14:11,235
Life is a playground.

1068
02:14:12,804 --> 02:14:14,726
Or nothing.

1069
02:14:21,250 --> 02:14:21,951
Nemo. Leave.

1070
02:14:21,976 --> 02:14:23,614
NOW

1071
02:14:26,087 --> 02:14:29,302
Nemo. Leave. NOW

1072
02:14:36,377 --> 02:14:37,378
Nemo!

1073
02:14:54,341 --> 02:14:57,937
NEMO, READ THE NEWS.

1074
02:15:08,696 --> 02:15:10,438
Tragic car accident
on a country road

1075
02:15:12,308 --> 02:15:14,451
Nemo turn to page 5

1076
02:15:15,274 --> 02:15:17,643
Nemo look at the
end of the street

1077
02:15:20,580 --> 02:15:23,805
NEMO CALL
123 581 1321

1078
02:15:32,459 --> 02:15:35,405
<i>- Hello, who is this?
- Hello, who is this?</i>

1079
02:15:36,104 --> 02:15:37,283
<i>Who is this?</i>

1080
02:15:38,381 --> 02:15:39,849
I was told to call this number.

1081
02:15:40,352 --> 02:15:42,136
My name is Nemo Nobody.

1082
02:15:44,120 --> 02:15:45,674
Is this some kind of a joke?

1083
02:15:46,239 --> 02:15:48,073
No. No, I...

1084
02:15:52,936 --> 02:15:54,274
<i>- Operator?
- Yes?</i>

1085
02:15:54,299 --> 02:15:58,198
I'd like the address to
123 581 1321.

1086
02:15:59,196 --> 02:16:00,440
<i>One moment please.</i>

1087
02:16:02,214 --> 02:16:04,417
<i>12358 Alleway Street.</i>

1088
02:16:32,864 --> 02:16:34,539
<i>Hello, Nemo.</i>

1089
02:16:35,086 --> 02:16:37,139
<i>I'm glad you found me.</i>

1090
02:16:37,798 --> 02:16:40,788
<i>All of this must seem
very complicated to you,</i>

1091
02:16:40,813 --> 02:16:43,308
<i>but it's simpler than you think.</i>

1092
02:16:43,882 --> 02:16:46,218
<i>Careful with the chair.
It is damaged.</i>

1093
02:16:52,898 --> 02:16:56,118
<i>- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.</i>

1094
02:16:58,274 --> 02:17:00,352
<i>I should have
warned you earlier but...</i>

1095
02:17:00,592 --> 02:17:03,204
<i>I couldn't
because of the transcript.</i>

1096
02:17:03,430 --> 02:17:04,430
The transcript?

1097
02:17:05,046 --> 02:17:08,281
<i>The text of our conversation!</i>

1098
02:17:10,609 --> 02:17:13,510
<i>- You can you hear me!
- What you are living now...</i>

1099
02:17:14,367 --> 02:17:15,846
<i>is the past.</i>

1100
02:17:16,973 --> 02:17:18,732
<i>At least, for me.</i>

1101
02:17:20,691 --> 02:17:22,095
<i>I am you...</i>

1102
02:17:23,057 --> 02:17:25,585
<i>70 years older.</i>

1103
02:17:27,257 --> 02:17:31,353
<i>Everything you say, I said
myself when I was young.</i>

1104
02:17:31,567 --> 02:17:35,222
<i>I only had to transcribe
our conversation.</i>

1105
02:17:35,970 --> 02:17:38,313
<i>It's all written right here.</i>

1106
02:17:38,338 --> 02:17:39,847
<i>- I can't...
- Believe it?</i>

1107
02:17:42,117 --> 02:17:43,502
<i>For me...</i>

1108
02:17:44,343 --> 02:17:46,551
<i>...time is inverted.</i>

1109
02:17:47,267 --> 02:17:49,806
<i>I start at the end of the story</i>

1110
02:17:49,831 --> 02:17:51,808
<i>and go toward the beginning.</i>

1111
02:17:52,715 --> 02:17:54,324
I don't understand.

1112
02:17:54,349 --> 02:17:55,951
<i>In this life here,</i>

1113
02:17:56,686 --> 02:17:58,819
you don't exist.

1114
02:17:58,844 --> 02:18:00,662
<i>I don't know why...</i>

1115
02:18:01,081 --> 02:18:03,309
<i>Only the Architect knows.</i>

1116
02:18:04,949 --> 02:18:05,942
The Architect?

1117
02:18:07,098 --> 02:18:08,447
<i>The child...</i>

1118
02:18:09,472 --> 02:18:12,238
<i>The one running after the train.</i>

1119
02:18:13,977 --> 02:18:16,700
<i>Maybe your parents never met.</i>

1120
02:18:20,972 --> 02:18:25,829
<i>Maybe your father died
in a sledging accident.</i>

1121
02:18:27,541 --> 02:18:29,850
<i>Maybe you were one
of the vast majority</i>

1122
02:18:29,875 --> 02:18:34,605
<i>of those whose genetic code did not
reach its final destination.</i>

1123
02:18:38,022 --> 02:18:39,580
<i>Maybe when she died...</i>

1124
02:18:40,534 --> 02:18:42,212
<i>A prehistoric woman...</i>

1125
02:18:42,461 --> 02:18:46,457
<i>She rolled off the line of heritance
to which you belong.</i>

1126
02:18:47,823 --> 02:18:49,357
<i>So for this world...</i>

1127
02:18:52,353 --> 02:18:54,624
<i>You don't exist.</i>

1128
02:18:56,125 --> 02:18:59,081
<i>If the Anna's calculations are correct,</i>

1129
02:18:59,795 --> 02:19:06,411
<i>you need to stay alive
until 2092, February 12.</i>

1130
02:19:07,324 --> 02:19:10,160
<i>5:50 AM.</i>

1131
02:19:42,714 --> 02:19:45,131
I'm sorry, I don't know how long
we haven't been recording.

1132
02:19:45,266 --> 02:19:47,659
I have to submit my story
by tomorrow morning.

1133
02:19:50,101 --> 02:19:52,373
Everything that you say
is contradictory.

1134
02:19:53,886 --> 02:19:57,452
You can't have been in one place
and another at the same time.

1135
02:19:58,301 --> 02:20:02,496
You mean to say
we have to make choices?

1136
02:20:02,973 --> 02:20:04,542
Of all those lives, which one...

1137
02:20:05,996 --> 02:20:07,373
Which one is the right one?

1138
02:20:08,331 --> 02:20:12,022
Each of these lives
is the right one.

1139
02:20:13,647 --> 02:20:18,336
Every path is the right path.

1140
02:20:21,906 --> 02:20:26,209
"Everything could have been
anything else...

1141
02:20:27,644 --> 02:20:32,185
and it would have just
as much meaning."

1142
02:20:34,372 --> 02:20:36,768
Tennessee Williams.

1143
02:20:38,521 --> 02:20:40,779
You're too young for that.

1144
02:20:41,142 --> 02:20:42,781
You can't be dead
and still be here.

1145
02:20:44,423 --> 02:20:45,527
You can't not exist.

1146
02:20:52,211 --> 02:20:53,743
Is there life after death?

1147
02:20:57,259 --> 02:20:58,677
After death...

1148
02:21:02,261 --> 02:21:08,236
How can you be so sure
you even exist?

1149
02:21:18,395 --> 02:21:21,103
You don't exist.

1150
02:21:22,638 --> 02:21:24,242
Neither do I.

1151
02:21:27,416 --> 02:21:33,697
We only live in the imagination
of a nine year old child.

1152
02:21:34,514 --> 02:21:38,756
We are imagined
by a nine year old child,

1153
02:21:39,682 --> 02:21:42,619
faced with an impossible choice.

1154
02:21:52,363 --> 02:21:53,730
Run! Run!

1155
02:21:59,992 --> 02:22:01,196
Nemo!

1156
02:22:06,823 --> 02:22:08,264
Run!

1157
02:22:13,178 --> 02:22:14,282
Run, Nemo!

1158
02:22:17,248 --> 02:22:18,558
Nemo!

1159
02:22:27,390 --> 02:22:28,537
I love you.

1160
02:22:29,373 --> 02:22:30,374
Anna!

1161
02:22:43,537 --> 02:22:44,538
Nemo!

1162
02:22:54,162 --> 02:22:55,732
You're the one I love.

1163
02:23:11,697 --> 02:23:12,860
In chess,

1164
02:23:15,251 --> 02:23:17,970
it's called Zugzwang,

1165
02:23:19,540 --> 02:23:21,937
when the only viable move

1166
02:23:27,439 --> 02:23:29,475
is not to move.

1167
02:23:39,367 --> 02:23:40,909
Come see.

1168
02:24:04,663 --> 02:24:05,482
It's the sea.

1169
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:09,470
The child is taking it apart.

1170
02:24:10,836 --> 02:24:13,094
He doesn't need it anymore.

1171
02:24:14,314 --> 02:24:18,093
Before, he was unable
to make a choice

1172
02:24:19,010 --> 02:24:21,453
'cause he didn't know
what would happen.

1173
02:24:22,252 --> 02:24:25,080
Now that he knows
what will happen,

1174
02:24:27,230 --> 02:24:29,834
he is unable to make a choice.

1175
02:25:35,568 --> 02:25:37,209
Thank you, thank you!

1176
02:25:37,662 --> 02:25:38,474
Thank you.

1177
02:26:14,994 --> 02:26:22,209
This is the most beautiful day
of my life.

1178
02:26:29,843 --> 02:26:30,643
Anna.

1179
02:26:34,508 --> 02:26:35,465
Anna.
