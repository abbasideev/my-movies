00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:27,728
"It is with love that I do this.
God's will be done." Alyce Parker.

2
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,095
Please God, watch
over my babies.

3
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,420
Please just come home again.

4
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,763
- Hey.
- How's it goin'?

5
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:40,034
This way.

6
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,771
Put it down over here.

7
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,268
Can I help you, Mrs. Parker?

8
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:15,820
Mrs. Parker? Mrs. Parker?

9
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,699
Mrs. Parker, can I help you?

10
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:27,036
- You okay? - It's the
dampness, it, uh...

11
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:29,561
gets in my head.

12
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,797
It's gonna get a lot worse
before it gets better.

13
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:32,540
- Snap Pops! - Sorry,
buddy, no Snap Pops.

14
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:37,294
- Snap Pops. - It's the first day
with abstinence. You know the rules.

15
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,339
- Snap Pops.
- Milk or tea.

16
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,673
Sorry, honey, it's only
till after Sunday.

17
00:05:42,698 --> 00:05:46,321
- Why? - Because it's the fast,
which means that we can't eat.

18
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,515
No flesh, no fruit, no grain.

19
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:53,227
Drink your milk,
it'll fill you up.

20
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,985
Now, don't chug it, it's
gonna give you a belly ache.

21
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,996
I don't know what she was thinking,
leaving those clothes out like that.

22
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,053
Her headaches have
been getting worse.

23
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,957
I wish Daddy would let
her see a doctor.

24
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,373
You know how he
feels about that.

25
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,397
Mr Parker? Mr Parker.

26
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,987
Stay here.

27
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,660
Daddy!

28
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,725
Spit it out.

29
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:15,434
- Hey.
- Hi, Doc.

30
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,993
I'm so sorry I'm late.
The roads are a mess.

31
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,205
I'm Doc Barrow.

32
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:36,626
We know. You delivered our baby
brother, Rory, up at the house.

33
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:41,765
- Oh yeah, Rory, little Rory. How
is he? - He's, um... getting big.

34
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:46,036
Good. Where is your father?

35
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:51,857
He couldn't make it.
He's still grieving.

36
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,155
Well I can understand that,
sweetie. It's tough.

37
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:00,043
- They said that she drowned.
- Well, I won't

38
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:03,078
know, hon, until I do
a full examination.

39
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,271
You mean autopsy.

40
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:10,065
Yes, an autopsy. It's the law.

41
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:12,768
You know, I'm so sorry,
it's been a long time, and

42
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:15,482
you've grown so much, I just
can't remember your name.

43
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,830
- Iris.
- Iris. And you?

44
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:21,753
- Rose.
- Iris and Rose.

45
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:27,478
Well, I only need one of you
to make the identification.

46
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,271
I'll do it.

47
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:37,936
- I'll do it. - Okay.
- This way, sweetie.

48
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:40,361
Rose, we'll be right back.

49
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,950
Mr Parker?

50
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:29,059
Mr. Parker, it's wet out here.

51
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,630
She's in a better
place, Mr. Parker.

52
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:44,554
We say that. Do we believe it?

53
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:20,048
Emma Parker. 47 years old.

54
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:28,849
Liver healthy. Moderate calcification
on the left ventricular arteries.

55
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,733
Sign of pill rolling.

56
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:51,079
Atrophy of right
vastus lateralis

57
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:55,250
- suggesting early
onset of Parkinson's.

58
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,440
What about Lamb's Day, Daddy?

59
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,737
We do it the way that
we've always done it.

60
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:30,160
Two days, and we will carry on.

61
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,373
But Mama's gone.

62
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,293
What?

63
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:45,550
- Mama's gone. - It's what
we do, Rose. We continue.

64
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:52,099
Iris is the eldest daughter.
It's her responsibility now.

65
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,822
Tree's down. Creek's
washed out.

66
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,280
Fetch some candles, Rose.

67
00:15:11,826 --> 00:15:14,755
I'll let them know what's going
on down at the trailer park.

68
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:29,052
You're not a'scared, are you?
Are you scared?

69
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,071
Don't be scared.

70
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,647
♪ Jesus gonna be here ♪

71
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:44,598
♪ Oh, He gonna be here soon ♪

72
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:48,166
♪ Jesus gonna be here ♪

73
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:51,317
♪ He gonna be here soon ♪

74
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:54,121
- When is Jesus gonna be here?
- Soon.

75
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:55,704
Yeah, He's gonna be here soon.

76
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,999
That's my boy.

77
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,169
Sing it.

78
00:17:43,394 --> 00:17:45,694
- Shhh.
- Sing it.

79
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,395
Daddy's home.

80
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,803
What is it, boy?

81
00:20:44,428 --> 00:20:46,128
Huh.

82
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,546
Come on, come on.

83
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:16,072
Mr. and Mrs. Kimble, uh... in these
situations, 99 times out of a hundred

84
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:20,236
the missing person is safe, just
can't get to a working phone.

85
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,007
Your daughter's probably at
somebody's house, a friend's

86
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,675
house, just as worried about
you as you are about her.

87
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:30,804
But, uh, she's our only child, and
she never hasn't come home before.

88
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:36,403
I understand that, but I got... I got
roads closed, lines down, bridges out.

89
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:40,037
Let's give it 24 hours. If
she doesn't make contact

90
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,301
by then, we'll, uh, we'll
put out an alert. Okay?

91
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,535
Emily!

92
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,516
I need you to make copies
of that photo, and

93
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,743
put out an MPR on a Valerie
Kimble, all right?

94
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:01,319
I'm on it.

95
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,199
Thank you.

96
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:02,139
I'm sorry, I know it's a
bad time for you, but...

97
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,953
uh, I'm finished with
this place, uh...

98
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:12,515
There's no work, and now this damn
storm washed half the town away,

99
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:19,480
so, we're gonna head down-state to my
brother's and see if we can start over.

100
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,693
I think that's everything.
Good luck, Mr. Parker.

101
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,945
I'm hungry.

102
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,127
Snap pops.

103
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:46,926
It's for you.

104
00:24:48,218 --> 00:24:53,703
- I don't underst... - A
token to... for last night.

105
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,491
"Kindness shall be
met with kindness."

106
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:04,432
- Is that in the Bible?
- It's in mine.

107
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:09,465
- Thank you. - The funeral
is this afternoon.

108
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:13,177
- So soon?
- It's our way.

109
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:19,183
I don't like to ask, I was wonderin' if you
wouldn't mind watchin' my boy for a spell.

110
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:25,356
- Too young for these things.
- Of course I wouldn't mind.

111
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,695
I'd be happy to, Mr. Parker.

112
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:42,174
<i>This is Sheriff Meeks. I'm not
here right now, please leave</i>

113
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:45,501
<i>a message and I'll get back
to you as soon as possible.</i>

114
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,713
Hey, Bob. Doc Barrow here.

115
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,575
I found something strange
this morning, my dog

116
00:25:51,588 --> 00:25:54,293
actually dug it up, I'd
like to show it to you.

117
00:25:54,361 --> 00:26:01,367
I can stop by your place today, if it's
okay. Let me know, please. Thanks.

118
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,856
Where are you, Pumpkin?

119
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:28,920
You're gonna have to take care
of them now. You ready for that?

120
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:34,841
I'm the eldest. That's the way it
works. The way it's always worked.

121
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:38,152
It just... doesn't seem fair.

122
00:26:39,095 --> 00:26:40,517
None of it.

123
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:45,106
That's for me to worry
about, not you.

124
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:54,255
What if we refused to do it?
We just... we just stopped?

125
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:04,163
- He would make us, wouldn't he?
- I just wanna get this over with.

126
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,226
And then we have a whole year
to figure something out.

127
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:20,221
- I just wish we were like
everyone else. - Well, we're not.

128
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,420
- What are you doing? You
know you ain't allowed

129
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:09,622
down here! - I seen
the monster, Daddy.

130
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:21,425
One day, I'll teach you how not to be
afraid of the dark. How'd that be?

131
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:26,681
- Good. - Until
then, you stay out.

132
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:32,561
Don't go where you don't belong.
Okay?

133
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:55,918
- You always need a watchful eye. - I'm
sorry, Daddy. Rose said he was sleeping.

134
00:29:56,086 --> 00:30:03,050
Rose isn't in charge. You are.
All we have is each other.

135
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:08,139
We need to stick together now.
You understand?

136
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:19,025
"And the seed shall become the
tree, which bears the fruit."

137
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,864
- "And feeds the
kindred. Amen." - Amen.

138
00:30:56,313 --> 00:31:04,028
When the Earth has claimed our limbs,
then shall we come home to walk with Him.

139
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:07,114
To the better place He calls us,

140
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:12,244
free from want, and hungry
desires of this Earth.

141
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:21,462
But should some urgent
fate, untimely lot,

142
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,049
bring you to meet your fate,

143
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:31,013
nameless out the haunt that the lone
regions where has drawed no foot of man,

144
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:34,642
commend myself to God.

145
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:42,066
Behold, the Lamb of God, who
taketh away the sins of the world.

146
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,654
- Amen.
- Amen.

147
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,771
He hasn't eaten... since Mama...

148
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,570
Take him home, put him to
bed, let him get some rest.

149
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:28,798
If he wants something to eat, give him
something light, like soup or something.

150
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:35,828
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- I'm sorry, Iris.

151
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:41,208
Thank you for coming, Anders.
It was really sweet of you.

152
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,515
No, no hon... she didn't
suffer at all, no.

153
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,969
We're home, Daddy.

154
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:46,690
She was the first. Now
it belongs to you.

155
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:59,245
December 24th, 1781.

156
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,820
Papa has found our new home.

157
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,664
It is a peaceful place, high on a
mountain overlooking the valley below.

158
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:12,675
The forest is rich with serenity. The
land, it knows not the industry of men.

159
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:18,138
Our harvest dwindles as
winter approaches early.

160
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:22,393
Mother has forgone her rations,
so that the children may eat.

161
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:27,049
Father and Uncle Burnett left
yesterday in search of game.

162
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,995
We pray for their safe
return, as I fear we have

163
00:34:32,008 --> 00:34:35,447
not yet seen the whole
of nature's cruelty.

164
00:34:46,823 --> 00:34:48,483
- Hi.
- Hey.

165
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:50,684
I hope I'm not bothering
you, but uh...

166
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:54,349
I wanted to say that
when my dad died...

167
00:34:55,135 --> 00:35:00,097
it was really hard on our
family. Especially my mom.

168
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,517
Where have you been? I
haven't seen you all summer.

169
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,981
Academy training? Down-state?

170
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:12,401
Yeah, this is my first
official week on the job.

171
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:17,103
- They made you cut your hair,
huh? - Yeah, academy regulation.

172
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:22,890
- You wanna come in? - Um...
- No, it's, uh...

173
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:26,174
it's just... do you
remember a Valerie Kimble?

174
00:35:26,726 --> 00:35:28,586
Mm-hmm.

175
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:32,294
Yeah, well, uh, have
you seen her lately?

176
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:34,372
Hmm-mm.

177
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:38,173
Not since school let out.
She's pretty.

178
00:35:38,228 --> 00:35:43,594
Yeah, well, um, well she's gone missing.
And, uh, it was just before the storm,

179
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:49,350
so I thought that maybe, since she had to
come by this way on her way home everyday,

180
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,575
that maybe someone had seen her.

181
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,891
Well, you could check
up at the trailer park.

182
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:58,031
Only the new girl left,
business has been slow.

183
00:35:58,064 --> 00:35:59,892
Yeah, it's been
slow for everybody.

184
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:03,951
All right, well um, well
I'll go ask her then.

185
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:17,758
I hope this doesn't come off the wrong way,
you know... I thought that maybe, um...

186
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:21,688
maybe after everything calmed
down... uh, we could, you

187
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:25,474
know, we could go to a movie
or somethin' sometime?

188
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,645
- A movie?
- Yeah.

189
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:35,609
Or... or a restaurant, we could go eat,
you know, whatever you want to do.

190
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:44,326
- Ask me again some other time, and
we'll see. Okay? - Yeah, of course.

191
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:49,415
All right. I will... I will...
I'll see you around? I hope.

192
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,049
Not if I see you first.

193
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,670
That's the boy from school
that you liked, isn't it?

194
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,768
He's okay.

195
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,308
Nice haircut.

196
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,629
I don't know what's
keepin' you here, Doc.

197
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:42,009
What you need is a good long
vacation, someplace warm.

198
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:49,141
Shit, if I was you, I'd retire and
stay there. She can stay here.

199
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:54,077
- So what do you think? - Well, it's
been floodin' up at the cemetery.

200
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:56,546
Hell, but Bob, the cemetery
is downstream from me,

201
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:58,961
and you know very well
nothing flows upstream.

202
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,697
- How sure are you, Doc?
- I'm not.

203
00:38:04,165 --> 00:38:08,113
We'd have to send it to
Albany, be tested positive.

204
00:38:08,114 --> 00:38:10,195
That's not gonna happen,
not with the flood.

205
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,413
What are we gonna do?

206
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,249
I got a state of emergency here,

207
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,385
I can't start an investigation
based on a piece

208
00:38:15,398 --> 00:38:17,543
of bone, I'm not even
sure that its human.

209
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,698
- I'm not asking that, Bob.
- I know that.

210
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,069
- Come on, Jim, you know
what this is. - What?

211
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:35,551
- I'm sorry, man. - Aw, it's all
right. - You're probably right.

212
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,775
I'm probably
clutching at straws.

213
00:38:41,328 --> 00:38:47,583
Believe me, when Kimmy disappeared,
we did everything we could.

214
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:51,703
She was just gone. It happens.

215
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:55,466
I wish to God it
didn't, but it does.

216
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:57,991
Yeah...

217
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,967
and the monster lived
happily ever after.

218
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,911
No, he didn't.

219
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:14,372
- What? - The monster's
not happy. He's crying.

220
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:21,306
- What do you mean? - I heard him in
the basement, behind the locked door.

221
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,329
He's in there and he's sad.

222
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:31,743
You hush now, go to sleep, okay?
Good night.

223
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,331
We lost Mrs. Burnett last night.

224
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:06,199
Mother is weakening by the hour, and I
fear that she will not last the winter.

225
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,788
Father returned to us this morning
with supplies of fresh meat.

226
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:29,760
Uncle Burnett continued further east
in hope of reaching the outpost.

227
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:35,098
He has not returned, and I
believe now that he never will.

228
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:41,396
Father says all is forgiven
in the eyes of the Lord.

229
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,941
Daddy.

230
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:50,948
What if we were different?
If we weren't like we are?

231
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:52,416
What?

232
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,743
Come here, honey.

233
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,709
What are we like?

234
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:08,256
It was God chose
us to be this way.

235
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:17,140
If we don't do as he asks,
we get sick from the poison.

236
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:24,690
One by one we'd die. You can't hide
a doubtful mind from him, honey.

237
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:30,362
He knows all, sees all.

238
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:35,409
You're stronger than
you know, girl.

239
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:45,002
I know, Daddy. One more day.

240
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:54,511
- I love you so much. I love
you so much. - I love you too.

241
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,572
Oh! Excuse me.

242
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,864
- Hey, Doc.
- Mr. Anders.

243
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:30,828
What kind of bone
you think that is?

244
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:36,309
- Where'd you find this? - In a
washed-out creek, behind my house.

245
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:40,891
Definitely not a deer. My dad would've
known, he was real good with bones.

246
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:46,563
In my humble opinion, I
believe it's human remains.

247
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:52,944
Well... in that case I take your
word for it, you're a doctor.

248
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,672
Well, I'm here because I
went by to see Meeks, and

249
00:42:56,685 --> 00:43:00,256
told him. He just thinks I'm
some kind of a nut-case,

250
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:04,392
and he may be right. But...
there's been three

251
00:43:04,405 --> 00:43:07,980
people missing from this
town in the last 20 years,

252
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:13,751
- one of which was my daughter. - I know,
I remember. I was on the search party.

253
00:43:14,476 --> 00:43:15,876
Yeah, I know.

254
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,356
But... if you extend the
radius including the towns

255
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:22,641
within 50 miles, there are
30 people or more missing,

256
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:26,937
- none of which have been
found. - I'm just a deputy.

257
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:33,735
Oh, I know, I'm just trying to help out. I
thought, maybe it'd be useful information.

258
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:46,623
Boy, there are good folk
in this town. Nice people.

259
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:52,002
Those girls just put their
mother down, just died recently,

260
00:43:52,486 --> 00:43:54,595
and down here to help out.

261
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:57,330
The father is a bit of a
whacko, if you ask me.

262
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:02,507
Hey guys, on the house. We got the power
back up, but one of our fridges won't start

263
00:44:02,508 --> 00:44:04,982
so we have to eat everything
up before it spoils.

264
00:44:05,082 --> 00:44:07,108
- Could I have a cup of
coffee, sweetie? - Sure.

265
00:44:08,043 --> 00:44:11,471
I'll tell you what, Doc,
how about I come over

266
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:14,923
tomorrow and you can show
me where you found this.

267
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,214
- He woke up sick and
then got all hot. - Oh,

268
00:44:26,227 --> 00:44:29,791
he just has a fever.
Children get fevers.

269
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,134
- Do you have any aspirin?
- Yes.

270
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,684
Can you crush one up in a
glass of milk, please?

271
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:39,006
- Oh, and make sure you crush it
really good. - Is he gonna be okay?

272
00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:42,602
Oh yeah, he'll be fine. We just gotta
get him out of these wet clothes.

273
00:44:43,045 --> 00:44:45,114
Sweetheart, do you have
some fresh things for him?

274
00:44:45,139 --> 00:44:47,100
Uh, yeah, I think.

275
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,355
You poor little thing.

276
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:03,200
You're so sweet.

277
00:45:15,072 --> 00:45:16,399
Ow!

278
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,716
I'm hungry.

279
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,472
What's goin' on?

280
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:34,022
- Eh... he's got a fever. - It's
a wonder we ain't all sick.

281
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,816
All this damn rain
gets in the bones.

282
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:43,949
You a good neighbor, Marge.

283
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,561
I'll see you out.

284
00:45:55,503 --> 00:46:00,215
- Listen, maybe you oughta take him to see
a doctor? - That costs money we ain't got.

285
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:05,670
We ain't used to sickness in this
house. He'll burn it off, be fine.

286
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:08,148
- Good day, Marge.
- You're bleeding.

287
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:21,278
Well, look at that. It must be dried
out from the stove in the shed.

288
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:33,790
It's the Maker,
tellin' us it's time.

289
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:57,272
Mama has gone to the Lord. Now
it is just the three of us.

290
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:02,152
Father has changed greatly
these past few weeks.

291
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,227
He keeps to himself in
a back chamber of the

292
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,158
cave, quoting scripture
and weeping at night.

293
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:12,454
I suspect I know the great
secret father has kept from us.

294
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:18,543
As father's mind unravels, our
survival has now become my burden.

295
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:50,528
It is with love that I do this.
God's will be done.

296
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:56,201
Alyce Parker.
Lamb's Day, 1782.

297
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:13,760
We're gonna have to
call the Kimbles.

298
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,324
Hold this.

299
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,307
Help me.

300
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:46,519
- Help me. - I can't do this!
- I can't...

301
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:50,868
- We have no choice now. - You're
gonna leave me for that police boy.

302
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:55,300
Nothing comes between this
family. Okay? Nothing!

303
00:51:55,946 --> 00:52:00,408
I need you. I can
not do this alone.

304
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:04,579
Please help me, Rose.
Go, please help me!

305
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:50,708
I'm sorry, Mrs. Stratton. I promise
you're going to a better place.

306
00:52:53,837 --> 00:53:00,593
Get off me!

307
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:28,830
Iris, make it stop. Make it stop! Would
you please make it stop. Please!

308
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,374
Please, Iris! Please,
please, please...

309
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,968
- Did you kill the monster?
- Yeah, yeah. Yes I did. Yes.

310
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:24,357
Tell Daddy supper is ready.

311
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,518
Are you okay?

312
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:44,168
I didn't know it was
gonna be like that.

313
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:53,366
I won't do that again.

314
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:57,774
He can't make me.

315
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,117
Nobody can, not even God.

316
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:25,626
- Hi! I came by to see how the little
man is doing. - He's fine. Better.

317
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:31,395
I brought you some lasagna. Have to
use it before it goes bad, so...

318
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:32,900
It's vegetarian.

319
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:40,141
- Sweet of you. - I heard somebody
down in the shed earlier.

320
00:58:40,608 --> 00:58:46,170
It must've been Daddy. He's the
only one allowed down there. Ever.

321
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:50,609
Well, it sounded
like a girl, crying.

322
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,700
I don't know what you think you
heard, but you must be mistaken.

323
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,829
Thanks. Good night.

324
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,250
Good night.

325
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:55,341
Thank you for the
sustenance we receive.

326
00:59:56,885 --> 01:00:03,516
Blessed are the lamb, for
they are his offering. Amen.

327
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:05,643
Amen.

328
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,041
It's good.

329
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:34,130
Your mother would be proud.

330
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:46,892
- Eat your food, Rose.
- Yes, Daddy. It's just hot.

331
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,645
Blow on it.

332
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:04,326
It takes more than a flood to
bring this family to its knees.

333
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:47,036
- It looks like pot glow.
- And what is pot glow?

334
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:49,643
Means it's been boiled.

335
01:01:50,847 --> 01:01:52,712
Listen, you find anything
else you give me a

336
01:01:52,725 --> 01:01:54,601
call. I'll be at my
office at the morgue.

337
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:59,215
- Fuckin' "pot glow."
- Thanks!

338
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:35,709
Iris! Iris, wake up!

339
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,378
Get up.

340
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,662
You should call a girl when
you're gonna make a visit.

341
01:02:57,776 --> 01:02:59,099
Morning, Iris.

342
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:04,838
- What are you doing in my creek, Anders?
- Wastin' my time, gettin' my feet wet.

343
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:08,534
I don't mind so much now
that you're around.

344
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:18,752
- I can get you a pair of my
daddy's socks. - You think so?

345
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,922
I know so. Come on up.

346
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:53,078
So... what are you looking for?

347
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:59,201
I, uh... I probably shouldn't
say, it's nothing.

348
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:04,648
You can tell me. Hell, you were
the first boy I ever kissed.

349
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:11,555
- You prob'ly don't remember though,
do you? - No, no... I remember.

350
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:19,355
So, you can tell me...
what are you looking for?

351
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:34,787
The storm just washed some
things way down creek.

352
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:41,149
- Well, what kind of things?
- Bones.

353
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:49,551
We been findin' bones 'round here since I
was a little girl. Deer and 'coons, mostly.

354
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:55,140
- No, but Doc Barrow thinks that these
are human. - You're just funnin' me.

355
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,893
No, I swear to God,
that's what he thinks.

356
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:04,650
But the sheriff, he's not buyin'
it, so... so I don't know.

357
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,695
Let me get you those socks.

358
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:27,047
Hey, uh... Hey Iris, could
I get a glass of water?

359
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:29,383
Iris?

360
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:51,363
- Jesus! - What are you doing
here, Anders? - Something wrong?

361
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:55,117
No. No, uh, I just
got my socks wet.

362
01:05:55,285 --> 01:06:00,255
- Iris was gettin' me a dry pair
from upstairs. - What is that?

363
01:06:01,132 --> 01:06:04,060
It looks like some
sort of old tooth or

364
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:07,012
something. I found it out
in the creek. Thanks.

365
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:18,686
So, how old are you now, Rose?

366
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:21,079
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen...

367
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:26,231
- You're growin' up.
- It happens.

368
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:29,776
Yes, it does.

369
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:34,948
Catch.

370
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,159
Ah, thank you.

371
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,538
- What's this? - Some kind of
bone, I found it out back.

372
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:45,066
My Daddy would know,
he's good with bones.

373
01:06:46,113 --> 01:06:47,902
So was mine.

374
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:51,483
You know, there's an old family
cemetery up the creek a bit.

375
01:06:51,834 --> 01:06:54,301
We used to go there
when we were little.

376
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:57,971
- There are even some
stones left. - How far?

377
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:01,847
- Not far. Just below the falls.
- Maybe, uh, maybe I should take a look.

378
01:07:01,943 --> 01:07:04,835
This could be from one
of our relatives.

379
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:09,983
- I'll show you where it is.
- Okay, I'd appreciate that.

380
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:14,570
You're growin' up really pretty,
Rose. Just like your sister.

381
01:07:15,195 --> 01:07:17,195
I'll see you later.

382
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:20,757
See you.

383
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:10,377
I think your sister's worried
that I'm gonna steal you away.

384
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:13,213
Are you?

385
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:18,385
Listen.

386
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,014
What?

387
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:35,611
My daddy called them heat bugs.
Means summer is coming.

388
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:45,887
Oh...

389
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,123
Damn it.

390
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:08,560
What?

391
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:16,026
Nothing. Come on,
we're almost there.

392
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:41,802
Some have signs of scorching,
and Y-shaped patterns,

393
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:45,847
indicating a serrated blade.

394
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:51,269
T-structured incisions,
indicating a flat blade,

395
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:55,357
for scraping or fileting
tissue from bone.

396
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:49,536
- This is all your dad's
land, huh? - Mm-hmm.

397
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:53,642
Don't.

398
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:57,395
Why? It's just a flower.

399
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:06,279
I'm not worth it, Anders. I'm
not what you think I am.

400
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:10,152
I don't think you're
anything but a pretty girl,

401
01:12:11,366 --> 01:12:13,985
who I like a lot.

402
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:18,708
- I'm not pretty.
- Yes, you are.

403
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:23,960
- Not inside. - Maybe I
should just take you home.

404
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:21,998
You're filth. Rory's alone.

405
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:25,866
I don't know where your
sister's made off to. You

406
01:14:25,879 --> 01:14:29,589
get your ass home and
look after your brother.

407
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:31,883
Now!

408
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:17,971
Get out of my sight.
Both of you.

409
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:40,884
<i>Hi, you've reached Deputy Anders.
Sorry, I can't get to the...</i>

410
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:49,776
<i>This is Sheriff Meeks. I'm
not here right now...</i>

411
01:15:57,344 --> 01:16:00,256
We'll take the truck
once he's asleep. Then

412
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:03,192
we'll head to the city
and just start all over.

413
01:16:04,067 --> 01:16:08,110
Just stop, okay?
Everything's gonna be okay.

414
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:10,468
You're so beautiful.

415
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:13,810
Okay?

416
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:18,740
You're gonna be fine.
We're gonna be... fine.

417
01:16:21,365 --> 01:16:25,068
Shh... It's okay.

418
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:37,008
Daddy's mad.

419
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:43,306
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
He ​​maketh me lie down in green pastures.

420
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:46,893
He leadeth me in paths of
righteousness for His name's sake.

421
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:51,981
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, I fear no evil.

422
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:56,569
For He is with me. His rod and
His staff, they comfort me.

423
01:16:56,737 --> 01:17:01,324
Surely goodness and mercy...

424
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:39,781
- Hi, Emily.
- Hey, Doc.

425
01:18:39,782 --> 01:18:42,398
- Is Anders in? - Ah,
nope, just me.

426
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:44,497
I've been tryin' to
call him all afternoon.

427
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:46,618
There's a new storm
comin', bad reception.

428
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:47,931
He might be over
at the fireworks.

429
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:51,676
- Is Meeks in? - He's out
on call, accident on 28.

430
01:18:51,677 --> 01:18:54,886
Listen hon, would you... would you
mind watchin' my dog for a bit?

431
01:18:54,951 --> 01:18:57,960
Ah! Oh my goodness!
He's so cute!

432
01:18:58,011 --> 01:19:00,605
- I left something in
Meeks' office, can I get

433
01:19:00,618 --> 01:19:03,223
it? - Oh, yeah, door's unlocked.
Help yourself.

434
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:35,367
- Okay, thanks. You be a good dog,
Zip. - Did you get what you needed?

435
01:19:35,392 --> 01:19:37,392
- Yes, I did. Thank you
so much. - Oh good.

436
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:48,402
- Have you seen Deputy Anders?
- No, not today.

437
01:19:51,795 --> 01:19:53,493
You haven't seen Deputy
Anders, have you?

438
01:19:53,505 --> 01:19:58,304
Emma, I have seen the signs.
We're comin' home to you now.

439
01:19:59,129 --> 01:20:01,224
Comin' home to you now.

440
01:20:03,527 --> 01:20:04,938
Comin' home to you now, sweetie.

441
01:20:05,038 --> 01:20:08,132
- Is Meeks around? - I
haven't seen Meeks in...

442
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:15,018
Father, we have kept our
tradition in its purity,

443
01:20:15,485 --> 01:20:18,696
we seek our reward
in the hereafter.

444
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:43,157
Oh, come on, Kidd. Come
on, buddy, let's go.

445
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:47,967
Come on, let's go. Good boy.

446
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:51,086
Pretty, isn't it?

447
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:57,268
Honey, listen to me. You're gonna
have to be a brave boy, okay?

448
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:04,359
You're gonna have to listen to me, and do
what I say when I say it. Can you do that?

449
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:07,195
All right? That's a
good little man.

450
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:10,531
Get ready for supper.

451
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:26,172
Good boy, Kidd.

452
01:24:35,355 --> 01:24:36,646
Iris.

453
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:47,324
Iris.

454
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:07,476
Father, lift us from this
world of goatishness,

455
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:12,106
together, as one

456
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:16,193
and raise us to righteousness
and heavenly laity.

457
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:22,575
We have kept our
tradition in its purity,

458
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:28,873
and seek our reward in
the hereafter. Amen.

459
01:25:31,034 --> 01:25:36,080
We were lost, like the lambs.

460
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:40,794
But have found the light
that will lead us home.

461
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,642
Let us eat.

462
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:53,905
Iris.

463
01:26:41,565 --> 01:26:43,385
Iris.

464
01:26:43,444 --> 01:26:45,320
- Yes?
- Get the door.

465
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:57,461
- I need to see your father.
- Come in.

466
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:06,303
- Dr. Barrow.
- Mr. Parker.

467
01:27:07,431 --> 01:27:11,091
You hungry, Doc?
We have plenty.

468
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:16,526
- No thank you.
- What's on your mind?

469
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:25,906
- Well, it's rather indelicate. - Leave
me and the doctor have some privacy.

470
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:38,002
Let there be light.

471
01:27:46,662 --> 01:27:49,914
Mind if I smoke, Doc?

472
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:00,301
How long have you had that
hand tremor, Mr. Parker?

473
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:08,949
You didn't come here to discuss
my health, did you, Doc?

474
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:14,580
- No, I didn't.
- What then?

475
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,503
- Have you seen Anders?
- Who?

476
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:23,339
The Deputy. Anders.

477
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:27,885
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

478
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:31,972
- Was he here?
- This morning.

479
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:37,061
But he left.

480
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:53,035
- Is there anything else?
- Yes, matter of fact.

481
01:28:54,454 --> 01:29:01,377
Your wife suffered from a rare
disorder of prion disease.

482
01:29:04,965 --> 01:29:09,464
It's usually found in the
native tribes of New Guinea.

483
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:14,636
And it comes from
eating human flesh.

484
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:24,928
Did you kill my daughter?

485
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:28,212
Mmm... what?

486
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:30,960
Your daughter's
wearing a hair clasp,

487
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:35,144
that was a gift to my
girl when she turned 16.

488
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:41,876
Did you eat my daughter?

489
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:48,324
I been meanin' to ask you, um...

490
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:52,092
are you a religious man, Doc?

491
01:29:52,118 --> 01:29:54,738
Tell me about my daughter.

492
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:59,296
It's not too popular
these days, is it?

493
01:29:59,297 --> 01:30:01,481
Tell me about my daughter.

494
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:06,625
Tell me about my daughter!

495
01:30:06,993 --> 01:30:09,077
Daddy! No!

496
01:30:35,211 --> 01:30:38,009
Son of a bitch!

497
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:54,683
Come here, sweetie.
You're gonna be okay.

498
01:30:54,708 --> 01:30:56,708
Don't you move,

499
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:01,956
you're gonna be all right.
Don't you go anywhere.

500
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:13,801
I'm sorry, honey. I love you.

501
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:17,946
I'm gonna go get your... your
brother and your sister.

502
01:31:24,731 --> 01:31:26,231
Get in.

503
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:30,067
Come on, let's go.

504
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:40,244
Get out, get out!

505
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:55,959
Marge! Marge! Marge! Marge!
Please open up!

506
01:31:56,027 --> 01:31:59,029
Marge! Please open up!
Open up!

507
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:00,681
Marge! Please!

508
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:08,900
What the fuck is happening?

509
01:33:25,768 --> 01:33:27,093
Rory.

510
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:30,321
Come on.

511
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:36,110
Come on. It's all right.
It's okay.

512
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:39,196
I'm sorry. Rory,

513
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:45,661
Please, come on. You don't have to be
afraid of the dark. I'll teach you.

514
01:33:49,154 --> 01:33:52,400
I'll teach you. I'll teach you.

515
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:59,455
- Rose.
- No.

516
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:00,843
- It's okay.
- No.

517
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:05,889
- Come home now.
- No. No.

518
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:12,785
Iris needs you. Iris
needs you, now come on.

519
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:17,734
- Iris?
- Iris needs you.

520
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:22,305
Yeah, she's safe. Come on.

521
01:34:22,530 --> 01:34:24,629
Come on. It's okay.

522
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:30,914
Come on. Yeah, that'a girl.
It's okay.

523
01:34:32,939 --> 01:34:34,939
I'll take care of you.

524
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:41,818
All is forgiven, in
the eyes of the Lord.

525
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:02,440
You look just like your mother.

526
01:36:06,376 --> 01:36:11,654
Shhh... shhh...

527
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:18,272
No reason to cry.
No reason to cry.

528
01:36:21,497 --> 01:36:23,497
Shhh...

529
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:30,826
- I love you, Daddy. - I
love you too, Rose.
