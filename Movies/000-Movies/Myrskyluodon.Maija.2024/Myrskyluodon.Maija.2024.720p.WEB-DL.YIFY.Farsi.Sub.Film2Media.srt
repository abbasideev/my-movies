1
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:26,860
MAYA OF THE STORM SURGE

2
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,120
Come on.

3
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,880
Come in.

4
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,360
Well done, Maija!
- Anna!

5
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,357
Once, when the old man was
plowing a field...

6
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,120
elves appeared to him.

7
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:57,600
The horse suddenly stopped
...and never moved again...

8
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,677
and it didn't help
no trick or gimmick.

9
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,000
That's when Dad remembered that you have to
to peek between the lace and the head.

10
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,277
Then he saw that the field
in the field were a lot of elves.

11
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,400
Come on, Olle.
That's the kind of old folk...

12
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,157
You'd rather read a big book to your children
a book. There are no elves.

13
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,037
Why not?

14
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,200
It is unlikely if anyone
has not seen them.

15
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,357
You shouldn't believe in that,
what cannot be proven.

16
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,240
I have to believe in God too,
even though I have not seen Him.

17
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,957
There are.

18
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,157
The Catechism also says to
to ask the Creator to protect us...

19
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,397
the forest and the sea, and
elves, witches, wolves and others.

20
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,080
Is that so?

21
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,640
Yes, it is. Believe me.

22
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,840
Bay window.

23
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,317
Evening in the house.
- Come on in.

24
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,037
Put the Hindrik fire in the oven,
so we can see the guests better.

25
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,880
Is this your son?
- Yes.

26
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,605
We're not interrupting, are we?
- Please sit down.

27
00:04:05,688 --> 00:04:08,560
It's nice to have some long-distance travellers here.

28
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,637
What's your name?
- Janne.

29
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,797
Janne is the third oldest.
In other words, an empty pocket.

30
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,437
I understand.
I have two sons too.

31
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,080
And then those two.

32
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,520
Oh, right, the wine column?
- Here, have a warm one.

33
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,240
Olof's people already have beer
and a painted table and a silver watch.

34
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:48,837
A real silver watch?
- Yes, it is.

35
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,600
Is this the case?

36
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,840
See.

37
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,840
Maija, we have guests.

38
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,037
I can cover.

39
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,637
Kullskär has been so
the fishing has been so poor lately.

40
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,957
that we have had to go out fishing.
- That's what I've heard.

41
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,200
You can catch fish in the outer archipelago.

42
00:05:13,253 --> 00:05:16,813
I was thinking about going there.
- I see.

43
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,760
Where to?
- To the outer island.

44
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,800
Give it a rest, Janne.

45
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Any other news?

46
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,080
On. The kind of news...

47
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,237
that Telleskar's boat
went down last week...

48
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,517
and all the men with it.

49
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,680
How many men?
- Three.

50
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,920
Josef and both boys.

51
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,040
The will of God.

52
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,037
Give us a happy ending,
give eternal joy.

53
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,157
But everything happens
Thy holy will...

54
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,560
and therefore I declare your wonders.
- Amen.

55
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,480
What do we think of Janne?

56
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,120
What about him?
- He was handsome.

57
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,800
Why do you think such things...

58
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,920
when you like Peris so much?

59
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,520
You can think what you like.

60
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
What are you thinking about?

61
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,640
Nothing.
- You wonder.

62
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,280
No...

63
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,360
I was thinking of words.
- What?

64
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,000
Like the word "good", for example. Good.

65
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,240
And then add "said Boman".

66
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,240
"Good, said Boman."

67
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,077
Who is this Boman?
and what does his "goodness" mean?

68
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,117
Is it different from mine?

69
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,597
And what I need to do to
in a hundred years' time to say:

70
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,360
"said Maija of Vestergård".

71
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,160
Where would I say something?

72
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,640
About this cow? Or the forest?

73
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,240
You really don't think about anything sensible.

74
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,317
You're all... I don't even know.

75
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,160
What is the word that I am?
- Let's have a race.

76
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,957
Who will fill their gullet first?
- Me.

77
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,280
You're not scaredy-cat.
- We'll see about that.

78
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,840
One, two, three, now.

79
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,440
Are you milking?
Are you scaredy-cat? I win!

80
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,437
Done.

81
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,760
Can you see now? Who's the rascal here?

82
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,240
Come on! You'll scare the animals.

83
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,440
Maija. Wake up, Maija.

84
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,637
Come on, get up.
- Why?

85
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,280
Come on. I need your help.
I think you can help.

86
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,957
This has been going on for more than 24 hours.

87
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,397
Sent way too
too late to get help.

88
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,917
What can I do?
- You just do as I say.

89
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,200
You stay calm.
If nothing else, you pray.

90
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,117
Greta, now you're getting a push.

91
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,637
Good. Push.

92
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,197
A little more, Greta!

93
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,760
Good! A little more. There you go.

94
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,920
Maija.

95
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,760
It is in the hand of the Lord how much
we each have days left.

96
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,037
Our Father, who art in heaven.
Hallowed be your name.

97
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,520
Let your kingdom come.
Your will be done.

98
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,117
My life and my death...

99
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,760
in their hands is my Lord my God.

100
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,757
My time, my hair...

101
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:55,080
already read it once...

102
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,920
Just go home.
I'll finish this alone.

103
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,040
I don't want life to be like that.

104
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,720
Birth and death
is something everyone has to face.

105
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,760
Before that, there is no
ready for adult life.

106
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,520
For you they came now then
both at the same time.

107
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,800
What happened?

108
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,960
Is it Per?
- No.

109
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,080
Give him a hug.

110
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,480
Maija!

111
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,997
Veenemo, Veenemo...

112
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,517
show me my future acquaintance.

113
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,800
show my future acquaintance, show me a picture
of the groom, show me my happiness.

114
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,520
Veenemo, Veenemo...

115
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,200
Show...
- Maija.

116
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,800
Did you see anything?
Did you see my picture?

117
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,480
I don't really believe in that.

118
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,800
Do you really believe in those
the veenemas and all that?

119
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,520
What are you bothering with?

120
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,320
Do we have guests?

121
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,240
That's what I'm talking about.

122
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,265
What?

123
00:15:59,348 --> 00:16:01,477
Wouldn't you think now
this other one anyway?

124
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,680
He is older and also more sensible.

125
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,680
Yes, I had thought of him.

126
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,320
Yes, Janne meant Maija.
Very clearly.

127
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,480
Well, what the hell.

128
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,680
We have nothing against Janne.
We can keep it that way.

129
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,120
Go go go.

130
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,600
Maija!

131
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,560
Come back right away! Maya!

132
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,600
Did you say something to him?
- I didn't say anything.

133
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,280
He ran away.

134
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,560
I apologise. He's like that.

135
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,720
No problem.

136
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,757
You will soon become
a ladies' man. Before me.

137
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,477
You will leave here with him.
Somewhere out in the open.

138
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,831
I heard him talking
about it with that Erker guy.

139
00:18:17,914 --> 00:18:19,413
From where?

140
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,237
To what they were talking about,
when they first visited.

141
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,210
Where to? I didn't hear.

142
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:27,320
Not while you were back
in your own worlds.

143
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,720
But that's where he's coming to get you.
Of that I am sure.

144
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,760
He'll be back,
when the divisions of land have been settled.

145
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,600
Then you will get married.

146
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,600
Then you need to be an adult
a woman. And you will spend your wedding night.

147
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,040
It feels like a thorn in the flesh all the time,
when I remember that Janne.

148
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,397
And that I must put him down
a part of my life from now on.

149
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,680
That's how it works.

150
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,120
And when I pray...

151
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,720
...I also pray for forgiveness,
because I am unable to like Janne.

152
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:30,680
And that it would last a long time before
before I have to leave with him.

153
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,560
You'll get used to it.

154
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,760
I certainly do,
Per to propose soon.

155
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,600
To make life go on,
as it should.

156
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,665
How do you know,
how life is supposed to go?

157
00:19:46,748 --> 00:19:48,440
Everyone knows that.

158
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,397
Maija! Keep your head on straight,
so I can get your tresses in order.

159
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,157
I stand still like a candle.
Don't complain there.

160
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,117
This hair needs to be put up
really smooth and beautiful.

161
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,357
Is it now well and truly?
- Yes, thank you.

162
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,600
It's like I'm in a vice.

163
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,680
Be human.

164
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,997
Here's a bridal bag for you.

165
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,080
It's one of my better pillowcases.
Be careful with it.

166
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,240
Now go.
Vallborg is already waiting in the village.

167
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,198
First I would like to
look at myself in the mirror.

168
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,993
Mirroring is a sin.

169
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,240
About.

170
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,280
You're pretty.

171
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,240
Hello.

172
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,120
Don't you have a sewing kit with you?

173
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,280
Mom didn't say to take it.

174
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:44,341
Perhaps he thought that he would not
this wasn't a normal trip to the village.

175
00:21:44,424 --> 00:21:45,866
Could be.

176
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:48,197
Your mother is known to use
every moment to her advantage...

177
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,360
and that's what I learned for sure
to pass on to his daughters.

178
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,800
Let's move the cups,
so there are no stains.

179
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,000
Don't, my good man,
give me everything.

180
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,760
When I give you something,
I give what I feel.

181
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,280
Little girl, there you are
your first nest egg.

182
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,440
Magnus, now congratulate the bride.

183
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,080
Yeah...

184
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,640
Congratulations.

185
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,840
Lisa the Pepper gave it to him for a pittance.

186
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,997
How much was there?

187
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,840
Goodness gracious!

188
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,960
Veenemo, Veenemo,
show me my future bridegroom.

189
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,680
Veenemo...

190
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,037
All the forest and sea fairies
and anyone who hears me now!

191
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,440
Why do I have to?

192
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,000
Girls. Be human.

193
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,920
Anna. Come on,
and we'll go to the coffee machine.

194
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,000
Welcome!

195
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,080
Maija, hi.

196
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Let's go, Erker, for coffee.

197
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
Hello, Maija.

198
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:27,560
You can put this on your shoulders.

199
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,400
Didn't hit the shit, thankfully.

200
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,920
It can be put...

201
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,280
Thank you.

202
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,800
Oh shit.

203
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,680
So that's the kind of sums we're talking about.

204
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,720
It's not going to work.

205
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,000
I know we have no guarantees.

206
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,557
Me and Maija are young
and strong and we will pay you back.

207
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,040
With interest.
- Suitable for.

208
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,997
I will agree to any interest rate.
I'm sure I can pay it back.

209
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,525
How?
- By work.

210
00:27:10,608 --> 00:27:12,597
I sell almost everything I ask for.

211
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,237
I'm at sea from morning till night.

212
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,440
And Myrskyluoto is good
for seal hunting.

213
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,920
According to my calculations, the logs are
paid in five years.

214
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,480
With interest.

215
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,640
Five years.

216
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,477
I decide now
trust Janne's word.

217
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,040
Thank you. You won't regret it.

218
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,400
This helps with the tension.

219
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,040
A wife is made for her husband,
but man was not created for his wife.

220
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,917
The wife must be
in honour of her husband.

221
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,280
as Saar also called it
Abraham as his lord.

222
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,000
Me, Maija...

223
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,280
Maria.

224
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,560
I, Maria Lovisa Mickelsdotter...

225
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,080
I take you, Johan Eriksson.

226
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,680
my husband...

227
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,320
to love you
for better or for worse.

228
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,198
Excuse me.
Can we get under the covers?

229
00:33:48,281 --> 00:33:49,626
Sure.

230
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,920
Damn.

231
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,320
You look like you're being taken to the slaughterhouse.

232
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,040
You look like a woodchuck yourself.

233
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,680
I don't remember,
that it was that much fun.

234
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:52,120
I'm weighed down by poverty, fall...

235
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,520
and the guilt is cold.

236
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:06,920
But I believe, O Jesus.

237
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,880
you will not abandon me.

238
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,840
Your love will save...

239
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,720
and wounds deep heal.

240
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,880
Not a very catchy tune.

241
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,120
Well sorry if you don't like it.

242
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,240
I... have looked at a place for us.

243
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,000
Its name is Myrskyluoto.

244
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,840
You can be there as you like.

245
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,800
What if you don't want to?

246
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,720
I have nothing here.

247
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,600
I will not inherit a farm or a barn.

248
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,840
I need to build something of my own.

249
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,720
Something for us.
- Why all the way there?

250
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,840
Anna, mum and dad, little brothers.

251
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,960
Old Olle and Vallborg will stay here.

252
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,760
Yes.

253
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,320
But you can catch fish there.

254
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,120
There you can create one
the world you want.

255
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,320
Can be put on the floor as a roof
and a shirt as trousers.

256
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,120
And it's beautiful there.

257
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,880
Totally empty and free.

258
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,080
The sea indefinitely.

259
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,360
And wind.

260
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,720
And sunshine.

261
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,440
And that would be just us.

262
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,480
That's all.

263
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,840
Why would anyone put on a shirt?

264
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,720
Why not?

265
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,960
Aren't they great?

266
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,840
And there you can watch the shadows
on the wall, and no one will think you're a fool.

267
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,360
Don't be afraid, Mary.

268
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,200
What?
- Nothing.

269
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,080
Don't be afraid of anything.

270
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,840
Everyone can see.

271
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,720
After all, we are married now.
Have you forgotten?

272
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,120
The house rises up to that.

273
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,717
Look, Maya. Next summer
we will live in a new house.

274
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,400
I will build a pier on the beach.

275
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,240
If we ever get your beer.

276
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,280
We can sleep in the barn,
until the house is ready.

277
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,040
I'll get a rocking chair,
so you can sit in it.

278
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,920
Here we have
a home and a barn in one.

279
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,880
The lady is good and comes in.

280
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,800
Or should I carry both you
and the cow over the threshold?

281
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,440
On top of the door
nail the twigs crosswise.

282
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,123
Why?

283
00:43:38,206 --> 00:43:41,600
They protect the Tulip
from evil spirits. And us.

284
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,880
Okay.

285
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,080
Is it good now?

286
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,200
If it's important to you,
it must be important to me.

287
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,600
We are married, after all.

288
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,320
What are you afraid of?

289
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,280
Maija...

290
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,757
But if such a
comes across you in the field again...

291
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,840
spit is the only thing to do
over your shoulder three times. Like this.

292
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,280
Then you have to run.

293
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,120
What was this? A goblin?
- An elf.

294
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,447
Then there is the hostess of the sea.
It's really horrible.

295
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,240
It has its hair loose, and it floats
in the waves and wants to take your breath away.

296
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,920
That's what you need to be particularly careful of,
because it's more dangerous for men.

297
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,040
But I've been wondering...

298
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,117
that maybe it's just lonely,
long dead soul...

299
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,957
who has had a sad life.

300
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,640
and that's why it's so angry,
that it hurts others.

301
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,717
And of course, the mermaid is dangerous...

302
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,440
but with it helps
throwing salt in the sea.

303
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,997
That's good to know. Thank you.

304
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:47,960
I have not yet told you
about the spirits of the forest and the stones.

305
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,160
Row upwind.
Let's test the nets.

306
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,520
Keep it up.

307
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,800
Not that. There you go.

308
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,960
About. Dad, come and lift.

309
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,440
This is ready.

310
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,280
Not you, Maija.
- Yes, I did.

311
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,760
Let Maija raise.
She's stronger than you think.

312
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,800
You heard what Dad said.

313
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,440
About. Then the following.

314
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,960
Janne.

315
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,237
You have to be careful.
- And catch fish.

316
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,837
You get hungry too, don't you?
- Yes, but...

317
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,597
Janne. Mistress of the sea
is not in a good mood today.

318
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,440
I say to her, "Get lost, bitch".

319
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,600
"I already have a lovely wife,
and I don't care about your temptations."

320
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,120
Promises that you turned back,
if the wind rises at all.

321
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,931
I'd rather eat though
hay than live without you!

322
00:50:00,014 --> 00:50:01,317
I promise.

323
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,200
And throw them to the master of the water
the first fish to appease him!

324
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,600
Janne! Did you hear that?

325
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,440
The Lord bless us and keep us.

326
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,880
The Lord bless us and keep us.

327
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,320
Veenemo!

328
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:17,360
Don't take Janne away from me!
He is my husband!

329
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,160
He's not yours!

330
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,880
Janne...

331
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,317
I didn't realize...

332
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,517
that winters can be so long
and cold even when you're an adult.

333
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,920
I am fully accustomed to
living in a barn.

334
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,680
Maybe I am an animal at heart.

335
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,077
Not next winter though
we can't be in the barn.

336
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,637
even if you turn into a pig.

337
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,600
Why? This is a palace.

338
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,920
It will be the most visible in the world.

339
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,240
That's where your mouth comes in.

340
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,480
And your eyes.

341
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,120
And your lovely hair.

342
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,800
And your peace.

343
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,240
And your certainty.

344
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,480
And your shoulders.

345
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,160
And your strange mind.

346
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,037
And your courage.

347
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:38,280
We need to make many,
so we get all the combinations.

348
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,480
Let's fill this hole -

349
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:57,400
with a small face,
hands and feet.

350
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,477
Children can grow up in a new house
and on these beaches...

351
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,120
under these stars.

352
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,997
Just bring it on.

353
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,077
You don't get the best in town for cheap.

354
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,560
Maija! Come on.
We have a lot to do.

355
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,680
Ma'am, come and taste
the best bagels in town.

356
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,877
God's gaze is on you too.

357
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,637
Hello.

358
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,357
Take a look,
what we have to offer.

359
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,677
Could be a silver box,
with a nice pattern?

360
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,360
Or even a string of pearls?

361
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,757
Well... How much?

362
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,760
Not much. Just three rubles.

363
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,520
Parrot!

364
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,840
A new necklace for the lady.

365
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,680
No! Maya!

366
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,320
Hello.

367
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:59,200
Yes. Nice 1 250.

368
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,240
Yes.

369
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,400
A very fine yarn.

370
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,960
Have you spun yourself?
- Yes.

371
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,360
And stained too?
- Yes. Which I can do now.

372
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,277
Lake cane with flowers, birch leaves,
mushrooms and milk peas...

373
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,877
Right.

374
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,760
Beautiful.

375
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,477
You have an eye for this.

376
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:36,157
950 grams.

377
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,760
250 grams.

378
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,600
So here is...

379
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:55,960
That's about the same as this.

380
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,720
Great. Can you sign there?

381
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,560
A wooden stamp will do, of course,
if you can't write.

382
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,920
There you go.

383
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:48,400
Two rubles and 50 kopecks.

384
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,680
Thank you.

385
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,480
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

386
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,240
Goodbye.

387
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,560
Come on, Maya.

388
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,400
Your expression when the snake was hugged
around your neck.

389
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,800
You were like a fish out of water.

390
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:24,000
I would like to have such a snake
To go with the tulip in the barn.

391
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,960
Maija.

392
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,240
Shall we go back to buying a snake?

393
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,440
Does it apply to you?

394
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,280
The child is not in trouble, is it?
- Why did you take the money?

395
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,400
What money?

396
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,320
My brother-in-law.

397
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,117
I now have our money.
- That's what it is.

398
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,960
That's what I'm asking.
Why you of all people?

399
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,360
Isn't that usually the man's responsibility?

400
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:03,120
We can agree that you too
to wear them from time to time.

401
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:08,840
What do I do with them? I don't know how to
even write my name.

402
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,800
Are you up to it?
- Just do your part.

403
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,600
The new pier is handsome.

404
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,680
A bit pretentious, perhaps.

405
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:47,880
But when you get your beer, you...

406
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,280
And after that? A frigate, huh?

407
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,757
Help is needed.

408
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,920
Shipwreck.
- Where?

409
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:41,120
Near Isokar.
Six men are stranded in the water.

410
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,957
I'm coming! Anyone else coming?
- They've gone to the mainland to fetch...

411
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,840
but it is not certain whether help will arrive in time.

412
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,480
Now it's just us.

413
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,040
Just go ahead.

414
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,120
Blessings of the Lord. Come back.

415
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,880
We managed to save two men.
Four remained in the sea.

416
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,200
Maija!

417
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,160
Dear!

418
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,000
Maija.

419
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:29,120
Hot water. Here you go.

420
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,800
Hot water. Linen...

421
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,840
Towel. Blanket.

422
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,960
Maija.

423
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,480
Maija.

424
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:53,720
Maija! You must not leave me. Maya.

425
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,240
Here, Maya.

426
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,120
Open the south-facing windows...

427
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:16,200
Open the south-facing windows.

428
01:07:16,284 --> 01:07:20,509
Then you pour the glowing
biscuits in a cold bucket of water.

429
01:07:20,592 --> 01:07:22,524
What do you say?

430
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:26,960
Do as I say,
to get the baby out.

431
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,960
Glowing crackers...

432
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,800
Maija...

433
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,520
Very small.

434
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,880
Our girl.

435
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,560
Maria.

436
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:18,240
Maria, come on in.

437
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,280
August and Mikael, come too.

438
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,920
Come on.

439
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:30,480
Look at your new little brother.

440
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,600
Do you want to hold him?

441
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,840
Here you go.
- Book!

442
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,960
Here are some pictures.
- And screamers.

443
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,117
You don't understand yet.
Let me see.

444
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,037
Pictures and letters.

445
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,960
Santa's got something for your mum too.

446
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,480
Let's see.

447
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:57,520
Here you go.
- Thank you.

448
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,920
Now you can get started.

449
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,360
Draw A.

450
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,760
What if I never learn?

451
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,520
Then you must be a bit stupid.

452
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,760
What do you mean?

453
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,358
It says "sheep".

454
01:10:52,441 --> 01:10:54,210
Here's a picture.
- Maria.

455
01:10:54,294 --> 01:10:56,624
Don't you understand, stupid?
- Maria!

456
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:59,797
Don't stare with your dick eyes
or I'll bang you!

457
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,840
Mikael, come here.

458
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,517
I said that because he's stupid.

459
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,200
Mikael.

460
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,717
You know the difference between right and wrong.

461
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,080
That's why I think you're asking
apologize to your sister soon.

462
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,800
You have the same
fierce nature as I do.

463
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:31,160
Yes, because I was born from you.

464
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,600
You certainly are.

465
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,560
Mikael. Mum's little support head.

466
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:07,560
Maria. Take the little ones inside.

467
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,600
Come on.

468
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,637
They intend to destroy
coastal fortifications.

469
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:30,277
Bomarsundin and all.

470
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,677
And everyone who does not them
help them in this, they will slaughter.

471
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,277
That's the Englishman.

472
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,157
Everyone should be
opposing them.

473
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,917
All these gods
from the outer islands will be taken away.

474
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,080
After all, you don't have to help them.

475
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:48,437
I wasn't thinking of taking part.
Not one way or the other.

476
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,997
I am Ålander.

477
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,317
Not a Finn,
not Russian, not Swedish.

478
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:56,757
Must then do
what needs to be done without your help.

479
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:01,037
This is a long war,
that spans almost the entire world.

480
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,157
Here the wars
the Russians and the English.

481
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:07,397
Almost all of Europe
From Crimea to the Baltic Sea.

482
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:11,360
And you think,
you can opt out.

483
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,800
Fuck!

484
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,440
I guess I'll just...

485
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:55,360
This stone is for a farmer...

486
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,920
and this to the mummy.

487
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:03,440
This bird feather is for water.

488
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,920
Jesus gets everything without,
but not a single treasure.

489
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,597
Why doesn't Jesus get the treasures?

490
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:14,160
Because everyone believes
in him anyway.

491
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:22,160
Why don't the eagles make a sound?
Don't they dare?

492
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,840
Why wouldn't they dare?

493
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:28,440
Because they know there is a war on.

494
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:37,037
You put such good gifts on the spirits
and to Jesus you promised without a word...

495
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,440
that we have nothing to worry about.

496
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:21,960
Come and sit here.
Don't look over there.

497
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,960
Come on.

498
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,960
Where to?

499
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:53,840
Shouldn't this be... What?

500
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,160
Come on.

501
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:17,400
"A soldier shoots a man."

502
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:22,200
"The girl is combing her hair."

503
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:26,600
"A man shoots himself."

504
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:31,800
Is that what it says?
- Yes.

505
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,040
Sounds terrible.

506
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:40,240
Can I take it already?
- Please.

507
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,680
You too, Professor.

508
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,280
What?
Do they serve fresh bread here?

509
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,200
Oh, how wonderful.

510
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:16,880
Careful! Goes down the wrong throat.

511
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,320
I'm choking.

512
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,720
I told you.

513
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,040
that bad...

514
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,040
...is a long way from here.

515
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,080
Should I take out more loans?

516
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,997
What do you say?

517
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:56,837
Nothing will come of this stinginess.

518
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,277
Maija, you are...

519
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:02,757
When we came to this cove, you said.
you were going to build a bigger dock.

520
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,117
because one day
we'd have your beer.

521
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:08,640
Kaljaasi... I was only joking.
- Wouldn't that be great?

522
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,240
It came from the back.

523
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,400
Now I think it's time
the time for the last prayer.

524
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,240
You have to leave. Now.

525
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,760
You have to go.

526
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:17,400
I don't have time. I can't get on the boat.

527
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,720
They can see me.

528
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,240
They are killing me.

529
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,077
What will happen to you if I am killed?

530
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,800
No one is killed.

531
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,000
Hide in the barn.

532
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,237
They won't find you.

533
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:42,717
I'll come and tell you then,
when you can leave. At night, maybe.

534
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,397
I can't leave you and the children.
- They're looking for men.

535
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,357
They don't care about women and children.

536
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,560
Now go to the barn.

537
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:10,120
Listen. Now you stay calm.

538
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,717
The Royal Navy
First Lieutenant John Wilson.

539
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,120
This is the sea cadet Harris.

540
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:37,320
I hereby declare this region
in the name of His Majesty.

541
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,360
There are no men on the island, sir.

542
01:20:39,479 --> 01:20:42,879
Where are the men?
Bring them here at once.

543
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:44,517
Where is Dad?

544
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:48,520
Do others live on the island
other than you and your children?

545
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,520
Hello.

546
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,240
Blessings of the Lord.

547
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,917
I see.
Search all the buildings on the farm.

548
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,078
If you can find men,
bring them to me.

549
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:03,357
Yes, sir.

550
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:06,237
Take four men and search the area.

551
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,597
You four, search the area.

552
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,360
Please hurry.

553
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,680
Take action.

554
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,840
It's OK.

555
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,398
Harris, set up a table,
map and chairs.

556
01:21:30,481 --> 01:21:31,860
Yes, sir.

557
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,877
Tables in that room.
- Let's go.

558
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,360
Let's hurry up.

559
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,520
Janne.

560
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,600
Dear Lord.

561
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,720
Are you OK? Are the children?

562
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:03,040
You have to leave. Everyone's asleep.

563
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:08,797
Access to the beach and the boat
and row to the mainland.

564
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,277
There, you could try for Ostrobothnia.

565
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:14,157
I can't take the boat.
- Yes, you can.

566
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:17,277
They discover in the morning that the boat
is gone, and they go after it.

567
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:21,800
Or blame you and the children.
Saboteurs will be hanged.

568
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,400
Then I'll take you.

569
01:23:25,593 --> 01:23:27,197
Back to Souda
before they wake up.

570
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,640
Maija. The journey is too long.
- Come on.

571
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,240
Maija...

572
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,960
Maija. Now the moment has come...

573
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:33,600
when neither of us should be afraid.

574
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,520
No! No.

575
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:52,040
Please come back.

576
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,200
No...

577
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:31,400
I guess even a lousy porridge is better
than none at all, right?

578
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,560
Hey, you.

579
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,160
You just did.

580
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,040
Hello?

581
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,360
For the viisi.

582
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:59,520
He's certainly not very sharp.

583
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,920
Thank you.

584
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:40,200
Now let's just be quiet, let's press
our heads and do as we're told.

585
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:45,240
Nothing bad will happen to us.
Nothing is going to happen to us.

586
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,120
Get out of here.

587
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:56,640
Keep it quiet. Jesus Christ.

588
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:01,600
Mikael, come down from the Millstone!

589
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,520
If you fall from there, you're dead!

590
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,960
Have you been lonely?

591
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,880
Mum...

592
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:27,120
Keep your eyes on the job.

593
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,640
Just keep on gutting.

594
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,640
We are not afraid.

595
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,760
Do you think it will freeze soon?

596
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,400
Sea. Freezing. How soon?

597
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:41,680
Ice. At sea. Ice.

598
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,800
Ice.

599
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,080
When?

600
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,640
Quick.

601
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:57,720
Ice.

602
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,960
Coming soon.

603
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,840
Quick.

604
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,120
Thank you.

605
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,797
Harris, he says,
that the sea will soon freeze over.

606
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,517
Yes, sir. So we're staying
and the others leave.

607
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:21,400
Probably towards the south.
We'll stay on the outpost.

608
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:25,600
We have to be prepared for everything.
- Of course.

609
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,320
About this.
- What does it matter now?

610
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,760
It always matters.

611
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,080
For God's sake.

612
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:40,640
Watch out for small ones.
Don't come out, no matter what.

613
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,440
Let it go!

614
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,440
Let it go!

615
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,957
You don't touch the tulip.

616
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:54,360
Hands off, woman.

617
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:03,720
The cow becomes a good meal for us.

618
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,357
You will not stop us.
We're going to have a feast.

619
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,560
Or do we have to slaughter you too?

620
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,520
Let him go. Now.

621
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:20,997
He will prevent His Majesty
men from doing what they want.

622
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:24,120
And whatever they want,
if you don't mind my asking?

623
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:26,317
Eat a cow.

624
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:29,400
The cow is our only hope.

625
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:36,477
When you ever leave here
and all this terrible stuff is over...

626
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,280
and if I and the children
are still alive.

627
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:43,440
we cannot cope with the following
winter without a cow.

628
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,040
Can he hear me?

629
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:54,360
Does he understand?
The cow is our lifeblood.

630
01:33:56,080 --> 01:34:00,960
Me and the kids will die without it.

631
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:06,360
Let the cow go.

632
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:14,077
With all due respect, sir,
we're going to eat a cow.

633
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:17,206
We want meat, don't we, boys?
- Yes.

634
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,480
Which of you will defy my command?

635
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:27,080
Clear and direct
Lieutenant's order.

636
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:32,840
Who would know if we announced
you were killed in battle?

637
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,560
Arrest him for sedition.

638
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:03,240
Three!

639
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,320
Four!

640
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,200
Five!

641
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:12,640
Six!

642
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,000
Keep going.

643
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:17,280
Seven!

644
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,920
Eight!

645
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,320
Nine!

646
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,560
Ten!

647
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:50,800
Enter.

648
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:01,520
I would like to ask an officer...
Excuse me.

649
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:06,520
Help.

650
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,360
I don't understand.

651
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:21,160
I'll show you.

652
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,320
If an officer would bother.

653
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:27,560
Come on.

654
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:29,400
Out.

655
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,840
Cow...

656
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,720
Cow...

657
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,360
Cow.

658
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,546
I...

659
01:37:54,906 --> 01:37:56,426
Logs.

660
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,360
Me.

661
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:05,520
Water. Wa... water. Me.

662
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:11,040
There's too much work, and the room is
full of men lounging around.

663
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:14,880
Surely they're not all
are incapacitated.

664
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:18,237
You can too, I suppose.
at least do a little something.

665
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:19,877
Is everything all right, sir?

666
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:24,840
A lady apparently
asking for help with her workload.

667
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,480
Are we helping?

668
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:31,158
I don't know if it's worth it
to burden men any more.

669
01:38:31,241 --> 01:38:32,477
Yes, sir.

670
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:35,400
Look how thin I've become.

671
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,840
What's in it for you,
if we die?

672
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:43,120
So who's going to fuck you?

673
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,200
Can I take it?

674
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:28,557
Harris,
draw up a schedule of the day's work.

675
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:31,997
Defying orders or getting out of work
is considered insubordination.

676
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,800
Yes, sir.

677
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:42,520
Ask him about the chores to be done.
- Yes, sir.

678
01:39:42,613 --> 01:39:45,453
Give men a splash
whisky to refresh your mind.

679
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,867
Right away, sir.

680
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,520
Good.

681
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:59,280
We have a new soldier.

682
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:08,320
Your turn.

683
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:11,960
Oh dear.

684
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:21,280
Oh, eleven.
- Very good.

685
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,160
Let's pick up the pace.

686
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:31,840
Let's go.
Bring all your gear.

687
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:38,640
They're going somewhere.

688
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:45,760
I hope they die.

689
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:48,837
They bleed and die.

690
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:51,477
Come on.

691
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:55,240
It's for everyone. Hurry now.

692
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:15,717
The seer and the lord of the sea
and the lady of the sea.

693
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:19,117
the cunning Englishmen
To a watery grave.

694
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:21,997
sink to the bottom,
so they can never get back in.

695
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:23,960
We do not wish anyone dead.

696
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:26,360
Not even the enemy.

697
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,837
Good people don't do that.

698
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,557
I hate them!

699
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:33,637
They came without permission
and forced my father away.

700
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,917
I can only hope for their death.

701
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,840
You are not the kind of person who hopes
the death of others. You're my girl.

702
01:42:41,286 --> 01:42:42,891
Hate destroys the hater.

703
01:42:42,981 --> 01:42:45,933
You don't know,
what kind of person I am.

704
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:10,557
Mikael! What are you doing?

705
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:14,080
Put it away and get out
out of the lieutenant's room.

706
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:03,480
Bring a blanket!

707
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:07,520
Help the boy!

708
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,640
Medic!

709
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:13,000
Sir! Sir!

710
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,920
Help the men.

711
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:22,120
Excuse me.
I didn't mean to. Mom.

712
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:27,960
I killed them.
- No.

713
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:33,000
You have not killed anyone
but the war.

714
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:41,640
No, no. No problem.

715
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,160
Come here, everyone.

716
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:51,680
Now we crossed our arms.

717
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:57,240
The Lord bless and keep you
these fallen ones...

718
01:45:57,400 --> 01:46:00,040
Hello! We could use some help here.

719
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:04,080
I order you to work
In the name of His Majesty.

720
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:08,960
Give me my sword.

721
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,560
Please help!

722
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:20,680
Poor thing.
You're somebody's son too.

723
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,720
Don't be afraid. You'll get better.

724
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:27,299
Don't touch me,
when I'm on duty!

725
01:46:27,383 --> 01:46:28,317
Sir.

726
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,917
It's me. Harris.
- I said back off!

727
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,600
I am a member of the Royal Navy
Lieutenant of the Royal Navy, damn it!

728
01:46:34,684 --> 01:46:39,364
Take him to rest and give him some water.
Check the wound later.

729
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:43,680
The lieutenant will calm down now.

730
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:01,040
Come on. I'll help you.

731
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:26,320
Lying there resting.

732
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:30,920
Tomorrow I will change the bandage.

733
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:35,360
Hopefully the fever will go down.

734
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:54,200
I haven't seen them in years.

735
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:58,600
I miss Janne terribly too.

736
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:03,400
All this is
is just a gap in humanity.

737
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:06,320
The honour of an officer...

738
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,560
...and a royal killing machine.

739
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:18,490
My husbands do not get
see me like this.

740
01:49:18,574 --> 01:49:20,612
If they see me like this,
they will kill me.

741
01:49:20,696 --> 01:49:23,283
Calm down.
- They are animals.

742
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,760
I am an animal.

743
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,400
We are all animals.

744
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:35,680
That's what war does to you,
you know.

745
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,960
Rest now.

746
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,360
Lie down.

747
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,680
Who are you?

748
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,360
Whose island is this?

749
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:58,160
Is your life here?

750
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,440
Maija.

751
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,600
My... my name...

752
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,560
Maija.

753
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:14,000
John.

754
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,600
John.

755
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:40,480
Is that the whole world?

756
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:47,200
I think this is
just a small piece.

757
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:53,120
The world must go on beyond the edges.

758
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:58,720
And then it comes from the other side
towards. Because the world is round.

759
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:00,800
Yes.

760
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:05,600
What does it say?

761
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:09,880
"Madrid".

762
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,840
Madrid.

763
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:34,840
Russian! Come on.

764
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,477
Sir...

765
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:53,400
Come on, Maya. I think you're finally
get your island back.

766
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:10,520
I leave these dice to you.
Have fun and remember me.

767
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:16,277
For you, little lady,
I leave you a piece of the big world.

768
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:18,960
Always keep your eyes on the horizon.

769
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:39,400
Can Dad come back now?

770
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:45,960
Oh.

771
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:01,280
To port, please.

772
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:01,920
Mum?
- No?

773
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:07,480
What are you doing?
- I'm shouting. Scream too!

774
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,120
Come on, let's go.

775
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:24,237
We have to eat.

776
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,880
Come on now! Let's go fishing.

777
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:29,600
But Dad is not here.

778
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:33,200
It's all right.

779
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:36,797
There are pants in the cupboard for you too, Maria.

780
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:39,360
They are easier to work in.

781
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,080
A bit more from that side.

782
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:50,640
About. Pull, August.

783
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:57,600
I'll try.
- You can. There you go.

784
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:04,000
More from that side.
Focus, August.

785
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:10,480
What? Has he been
at sea with children?

786
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:18,440
Dad. I missed him terribly.

787
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,040
My God, how are you
lost weight. And the children too.

788
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:26,320
There is hardly anything left of you.

789
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:31,640
My mother sent me this.
- Yes, here you go.

790
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:40,480
Do you wear trousers now?

791
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:45,280
They are more practical.
You should try.

792
01:56:48,440 --> 01:56:50,200
Come on.

793
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:55,400
Engelsmanni left that behind.

794
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:59,477
You don't understand any of this, do you?

795
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:01,640
Let's throw it away.
- No.

796
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:05,280
It was a gift from a friend.

797
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:17,437
"I thank you, my heavenly Father.

798
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:20,357
Through Jesus Christ.

799
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:24,397
that tonight I'm going to be
from all danger and sin...

800
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:28,277
that my life and all my
all my work may be acceptable to Thee."

801
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:30,077
It goes like water.

802
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:32,600
"Your holy angels
be with me...

803
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:35,920
lest that evil enemy
would gain nothing from me."

804
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:39,680
I wonder if Maria has that sin
so much on her conscience yet?

805
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:44,120
Against the word of the Lord
don't argue.

806
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:46,560
Come and sit down, Mary.

807
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:01,840
Now, here's the thing.

808
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:05,600
that you and the children
are going to Vestergård.

809
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:12,280
We can't leave.
We have to wait for Janne.

810
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:14,917
He'll be here any minute.

811
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,760
Nothing will come of it. You're not going to make it.

812
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:22,760
Janne will be home soon.

813
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:25,800
You don't even know where he is.

814
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:29,840
He is safe and on his way home.

815
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:35,400
Do you have any idea how many men left
and how many were caught?

816
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:40,280
Yes Janne you
Vestergård can also find you.

817
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:46,240
We are waiting for Janne here.
This is our home.

818
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:52,920
I have to go to the milking.

819
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:03,360
Maija. Wait.

820
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,880
Stop this madness.

821
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:10,677
What's crazy about knowing
where you belong and where you want to be?

822
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:15,800
As if you could decide that.
As if any woman could.

823
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:17,840
I can.

824
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:22,360
Janne is not coming back.

825
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:25,400
He must be dead.

826
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:29,117
Here he comes. I've seen it in a dream.

827
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:31,680
Jesus, how childish.

828
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:34,957
He comes because he loves me.

829
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:37,920
Love has nothing to do with it.

830
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:42,880
Go ahead.

831
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:48,840
Say whatever you want to say.
I can see that you want to.

832
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:00,357
You imagine that life is
is nothing but love and play...

833
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:02,960
and that you can decide how it goes.

834
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:06,000
So you have nothing to fear.

835
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:11,440
That you can manage with this creature for your children
and that everything will be fine.

836
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:15,400
I don't imagine such a thing.

837
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,797
But I can decide for myself,
what I want to do.

838
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:24,600
That's the kind of wife Janne wants,
who decides for herself what she wants?

839
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:29,800
Doesn't your Peris tolerate that?

840
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:38,120
You used to laugh a lot.

841
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:45,840
Don't you get it,
that I'm worried about you?

842
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:55,800
See how scared I am?

843
02:00:57,320 --> 02:00:59,960
I always have been.
- You haven't.

844
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:02,520
Yes, I have.
- No, you're not.

845
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:06,160
Yes, I am!
- No, you're not.

846
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:14,360
Yes, I have.
- No, you're not.

847
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:20,357
Give my regards to grandma.
We miss her.

848
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:23,637
I feel really bad
to leave you here.

849
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:26,520
Maija does
as is best for her.

850
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:47,800
I will protect you from the seers
and from the lady of the sea, until the Father comes.

851
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:53,277
I aim at the Millstone every day...

852
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:56,597
so I can see Dad as soon as he comes in.

853
02:01:56,680 --> 02:01:59,997
I have sharp eyes.
- Yes, you do, darling.

854
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:04,637
Soon you will see your father. First
as a tiny dot on the horizon...

855
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:06,557
and soon you'll be on the dock.

856
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:09,280
I'll be watching again today.

857
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:34,560
Poor little thing.

858
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:47,400
What is it?

859
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:50,360
Where is Mikael?

860
02:03:52,120 --> 02:03:56,557
He was on the beach
and watched his father on the millstone.

861
02:03:56,640 --> 02:04:00,637
Then at least I thought I saw,
that he fell into the sea.

862
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:03,557
I did not see,
that he had surfaced.

863
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:09,000
Me, August and Hindrik are looking for
for him, but we couldn't find him.

864
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:43,840
Mikael...

865
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:50,000
Mikael!

866
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:54,400
Mikael!

867
02:04:58,360 --> 02:05:02,840
Mikael!

868
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:30,200
Where is Mikael?

869
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:34,600
It's OK.

870
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:37,600
Now let's sleep.

871
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:40,720
We'll talk more about it tomorrow.

872
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,160
Little boy.

873
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:56,960
The Lord bless him
and keep him.

874
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:02,597
May the Lord make his face to shine upon him...

875
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:04,920
and may he have mercy on him.

876
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:11,080
May the Lord turn his face to him
and give him peace.

877
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:19,200
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.

878
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:19,600
It's a busy time...

879
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:24,000
the passing years...

880
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:32,360
the male knees fade into oblivion.

881
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:37,840
Always bright -

882
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:42,000
the song of souls...

883
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:49,360
the heavenly chord remains.

884
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:02,480
I baptise you, Gabriel Johansson.

885
02:12:04,120 --> 02:12:06,040
Father...

886
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:09,360
The boy's...

887
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:15,600
and in the name of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

888
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:27,277
Yes, he does.
We'll start loading the cargo, you see.

889
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:30,917
Maya, please, we don't do that.
we can't do that. It's a terrible risk.

890
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,597
It's a terrible risk to live on such a meagre income.

891
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:36,160
Such a life
is quickly dislocated.

892
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:38,757
Now I am it,
who is not afraid at all.

893
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:42,797
It's not that difficult
than many other things.

894
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,878
Can I get on board the beer cooler too?

895
02:12:44,961 --> 02:12:46,037
And me?

896
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:47,877
Not just on board.

897
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:51,637
The Father teaches about you
the best fishermen in the world.

898
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:54,280
Yes, such a beer glass would be handsome.

899
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:57,880
Now we have to feed the baby.

900
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:04,520
You start thinking,
how you're going to present it to Saka.

901
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:08,800
Please help Janne.
- Good. Then let's lift.

902
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:16,360
Janne, there is no time for that now.

903
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:23,520
You boys take these.

904
02:13:30,720 --> 02:13:33,197
That's the way to freight
so much stuff...

905
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:36,360
that you do not know
where to put all the money.

906
02:13:36,920 --> 02:13:39,720
As long as you can pay off the loan.

907
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:45,040
The loan will be repaid
and everything will be fine.

908
02:13:46,240 --> 02:13:49,517
You then have to brush ash on the bow.
- Ashes?

909
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:53,397
Everyone knows that the only way
to keep the ship afloat in a storm.

910
02:13:53,480 --> 02:13:55,917
Do you hear, father-in-law, that wife of mine?

911
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:00,037
Calculates loans on a pegboard
and repayments like a rich bourgeois...

912
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:01,437
and the man of the modern world -

913
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:05,157
and then ask to shake the ashes
like an old-world witch.

914
02:14:05,240 --> 02:14:09,200
Go ahead and laugh,
as long as you put the ash on it.

915
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:19,237
The network will be forged,
when it hits the bottom.

916
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:21,160
Maria.

917
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:17,520
Maria, take a look
for your little brother.

918
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:31,917
Where are you going?

919
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:36,397
I'll have to check it out
on the back to see if there are any driftwood.

920
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:38,757
There was such a strong wind today.

921
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:42,120
Driftwood?
- That's right!

922
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:26,085
Get in the sledge.

923
02:17:26,168 --> 02:17:28,446
I'm pulling you.
- No.

924
02:17:28,680 --> 02:17:31,040
You'll never be able to.

925
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:33,520
I can do it.

926
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:38,080
You can't.
- Come on.

927
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:44,000
We will all survive until next spring.

928
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:46,120
Sit here.

929
02:17:51,240 --> 02:17:54,040
Next winter I won't be able to pull you.

930
02:17:54,760 --> 02:17:59,640
Then there is enough money to do so,
you don't know where to put it all.

931
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:04,280
Then we'll have your beer,
and the catch will come.

932
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:10,200
You're as thick as a seal
from all that eating.

933
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:50,517
"Mum combs the girl's hair.
Mommy dresses the boy."

934
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:56,320
I read too.
"Mommy combs the girl's hair."

935
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:02,080
What about this?
- "A man shoots himself. The mother dresses the son."

936
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:13,760
Can't sleep?

937
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:16,120
Did the baby kick?

938
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:20,840
I saw...

939
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:25,400
Come to bed.

940
02:19:39,360 --> 02:19:42,637
You can take a sauna at least once
once a week while I'm away.

941
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:45,160
Let's not waste wood.

942
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:47,520
You are so beautiful.

943
02:19:48,160 --> 02:19:49,960
Am I?

944
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:54,200
Further.

945
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:03,240
And always.

946
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:06,160
And always.

947
02:20:11,133 --> 02:20:15,733
Don't be silly, Maya. The last sandwiches.
- You have a long way to go.

948
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:21,920
We'll be fine.
We have potatoes and herring.

949
02:20:22,720 --> 02:20:26,917
This is the last trade mission.
Then the money will be there.

950
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:30,040
I'll go back to that,
for the little one to be born.

951
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:32,437
I'll take care of Grandpa.

952
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:36,640
Do you have any first
razor yet, August?

953
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:12,400
Maija!

954
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:18,040
Don't forget!
I love you!

955
02:22:42,680 --> 02:22:44,560
Mum.

956
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:54,357
They must have had to
go further away to the shops.

957
02:22:54,440 --> 02:22:56,760
Janne wants a good price.

958
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:10,480
Here they come! I saw two men
coming down the ice towards us.

959
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:19,397
What made me bake in the first place
the last of the flour right now?

960
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:23,360
They get to the ready table
and get fresh bread.

961
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:25,920
I see them!

962
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:29,680
Take care of him.

963
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:47,680
The second is August...

964
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:55,120
And the other is Janne.

965
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:08,960
Maija.

966
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:11,320
Girl darling.

967
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,680
No.

968
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:20,640
Not this one.

969
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:24,240
Excuse me.

970
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:28,560
The father fell into the ice.

971
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:33,800
I tried my best.

972
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:38,360
Mum... Excuse me.

973
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:43,960
I couldn't pull him up.

974
02:24:46,280 --> 02:24:48,800
He sank below the surface.

975
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:46,160
Maija...
- I don't want to!

976
02:25:54,880 --> 02:25:56,960
Well done, Maija.

977
02:25:57,600 --> 02:26:03,520
Good! You'll be fine.
Well done, Mary!

978
02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:13,400
The child is too small.

979
02:26:20,920 --> 02:26:22,800
Maija.

980
02:26:36,480 --> 02:26:38,200
Here we go.

981
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:42,760
The girl has to eat, Maya.

982
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:50,197
We were sure,
the baby would not live.

983
02:26:50,280 --> 02:26:53,000
I issued an emergency response.

984
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:56,600
We baptised him John.

985
02:26:58,880 --> 02:27:00,920
According to his father.

986
02:27:11,160 --> 02:27:14,960
Maija. Everything is ready.

987
02:27:15,480 --> 02:27:17,960
We're off to Vestergård.

988
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:20,480
The goods are packed.

989
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:23,400
This is where you will be.

990
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:28,600
Life on the slipway is too hard.
You can't survive alone.

991
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:32,760
Johanna is so small...

992
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:35,560
and you have other children.

993
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:13,200
Maija!

994
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:19,040
Don't forget!
I love you!

995
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:09,080
We're staying at the Stormy Swamp.

996
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:11,600
Maija...

997
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:14,760
Everything I love is here.

998
02:30:16,720 --> 02:30:19,560
Including those that no longer exist.

999
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:23,920
How could I leave them here?

1000
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:33,520
I'll change into dry clothes.

1001
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:36,640
Who's walking in the wet now.

1002
02:30:38,280 --> 02:30:40,160
Bring Johanna to me.

1003
02:31:22,600 --> 02:31:24,280
For Maija?

1004
02:31:24,800 --> 02:31:27,160
Yes. For me.

1005
02:31:28,960 --> 02:31:31,000
Oh my goodness, Mary.

1006
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:33,760
Why didn't Maija take her father with her?

1007
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:38,037
With his guarantee, maybe,
but for a widow and children...

1008
02:31:38,120 --> 02:31:41,640
This is not my father's business, it's my business.

1009
02:31:42,520 --> 02:31:44,397
The Kalyasa will be ready in the summer.

1010
02:31:44,480 --> 02:31:47,437
and the work continues
just like before Jannen...

1011
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:50,720
After all, Maija has no men for beer.

1012
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:55,720
Janne taught the boys well.
They know how.

1013
02:31:56,320 --> 02:32:00,157
August is already taller than me,
and he has his father's shoulders.

1014
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:04,160
Hindrik is coming up fast behind,
and so is Gabriel.

1015
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:07,520
No.

1016
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:10,597
I would never get my money back.

1017
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:14,317
A house without a host.
Just a female human being and children.

1018
02:32:14,400 --> 02:32:16,680
Just a female human being?

1019
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:19,920
I survived the war.

1020
02:32:20,800 --> 02:32:23,400
The death of my husband and child.

1021
02:32:23,880 --> 02:32:26,480
I have survived hunger
and toil.

1022
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:31,280
How it is less,
because I'm not a man?

1023
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:37,480
How Maija dares
talk to me like that?

1024
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:40,920
I'm not a do-gooder.

1025
02:32:41,080 --> 02:32:44,837
Maija and her children move into her father's home
and stop this kind of madness.

1026
02:32:44,920 --> 02:32:46,960
I'm not crazy.

1027
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:52,800
And I'm not afraid.

1028
02:32:57,080 --> 02:32:59,280
Give him a loan.

1029
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:12,437
Okay.

1030
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:16,437
The maturity of the bond
However, a name is required for the extension.

1031
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:19,960
Someone's name,
the person who has the right to sign.

1032
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:23,200
Will Maija's father write it?

1033
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:55,720
The woman's name is not legally valid.

1034
02:33:56,360 --> 02:33:58,640
It's true in court.

1035
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:01,920
Just like a loan shark.
