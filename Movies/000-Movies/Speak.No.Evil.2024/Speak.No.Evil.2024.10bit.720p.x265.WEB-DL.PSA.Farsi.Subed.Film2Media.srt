1
00:01:53,507 --> 00:01:55,672
Mom, you said ten minutes.

2
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:57,509
No, I said when I've warmed up.

3
00:01:57,645 --> 00:02:00,213
- Mom.
- Agnes, indoor voice.

4
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:01,680
We're not indoors.

5
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:04,552
Yes, but there are
other guests here.

6
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,559
Hey.

7
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:16,300
Is this chair free?

8
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,966
Um, yeah, sure.

9
00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:22,372
Oh. Super. Super.

10
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:37,020
<i>- Signore.</i>
- Oh, thank you. <i>Grazie.</i>

11
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:39,519
That's for you, kid.
Get it down your neck.

12
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:42,260
- Thank you.
- Cheers, my dears. To us.

13
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:47,291
Oh, we're on our holiday now.

14
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:49,531
You want a beer?

15
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:52,501
It's a little early.

16
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:55,107
- But if you want one.
- Nah.

17
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:59,508
Come on. We are getting in it.

18
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:05,012
Please don't give Agnes
any apple juice before bed.

19
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:07,681
<i>- Sì, signora.</i>
- And you've got Hoppy?

20
00:03:07,816 --> 00:03:09,417
- Mm.
- You got my number?

21
00:03:09,553 --> 00:03:10,916
<i>- Sì.</i>
- Okay.

22
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:12,969
- Love you, sweetheart.
- Love you.

23
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,092
Okay. Bye.

24
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,525
- Bye.
<i>- Ciao.</i>

25
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,524
I swear, that bunny.

26
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,230
We need to stage
an intervention.

27
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,698
And start World War Three?

28
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,673
Look, she's with a stranger
in a strange place,

29
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,098
- and he makes her feel safe.
- Yeah, well, she's 11.

30
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:30,239
♪ If everybody wants you ♪

31
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:31,674
♪ Why isn't anybody... ♪

32
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,142
Ben.

33
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:36,742
Can we agree not to sit next
to the Danish couple this eve?

34
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:38,611
If I have to hear
one more word about their

35
00:03:38,746 --> 00:03:40,485
"cooking class."

36
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,662
Today,
we made the ravioli con funghi.

37
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:44,159
You should come
to the class tomorrow,

38
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,718
because I believe
they're making the gnocchi.

39
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:48,359
- Mm.
- Oh, it's gonna be great.

40
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,526
And you will love Giorgio,
who teaches us.

41
00:03:50,661 --> 00:03:52,595
He knows everything
about Italian food,

42
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:56,431
and he even invented some
variations of these courses.

43
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,637
You know,
there's 23 different...

44
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,105
<i>Geez. 46 euros for risotto?</i>

45
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,438
<i>- Dad.
- What?</i>

46
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:04,241
Agnes, keep your voice down.

47
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:05,903
I can't, I can't find Hoppy.

48
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,804
Okay, honey.
Let's calm down, okay?

49
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,577
Did you leave him
in the car or...?

50
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:11,375
No. No, I think
I had him at the church.

51
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,710
All right, all right. Don't
worry. We'll find him, okay?

52
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:15,720
- All right?
- It's okay. Baby, it's okay.

53
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,300
Here, Daddy's gonna find him.
Come on, let's go sit down.

54
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,764
- Let's do some...
- Louise, come on.

55
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:19,935
Ben, I can't handle
another meltdown, okay?

56
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,219
Louise, I'm...

57
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:24,109
Come on. Let's sit down.
Let's do some breathing.

58
00:04:24,157 --> 00:04:26,759
- Fucking bunny.
- Okay. Breathe in.

59
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:29,733
One, two, three.

60
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:30,998
Hold.

61
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:32,832
One...

62
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,305
<i>Coniglio?</i> No? <i>C-Coniglio?</i>

63
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:43,782
No.

64
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,177
<i>Grazie. Grazie.</i>

65
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:53,188
Whoops, sorry. Whoa!

66
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:55,259
Oh. It's so bumpy.

67
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,659
Watch out, watch out,
watch out.

68
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:11,307
Ah!

69
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:12,973
Oh, Dad, look,
they found Hoppy.

70
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:14,717
- Great.
- Oh, yeah, Ant, he recognized him from the hotel.

71
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:16,710
Oh, this is my husband Ben.

72
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:18,677
Yeah, I-I think
I stole your lounger.

73
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:20,385
- Ah, yeah.
- Yeah.

74
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,613
I'm Patrick Field.
This is my wife Ciara.

75
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:23,749
- Hello. Hi.
- Hey.

76
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,390
And, uh, you must be Ant.

77
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,553
Oh, Ant has
some trouble communicating,

78
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:29,292
so he can be a bit insecure.

79
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:30,625
- Hi, Ant.
- That's fine.

80
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,222
- This is Agnes.
- And this is Hoppy.

81
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:34,695
He's my worry bunny.
He smells really nice.

82
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,834
- Oh. - Aw.
- Nice Vespa.

83
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,603
Yeah, isn't she? We got her
from Paulo on the front desk.

84
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,601
- Oh.
- It's an absolute blast. You should try.

85
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:43,267
- Oh, no.
- Can we? Please, Dad?

86
00:05:43,403 --> 00:05:44,913
- Honey, honey, please.
- Oh, wh-what, you don't ride?

87
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:46,773
- I mean, I can take you.
- Yeah.

88
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:49,073
- Uh, do you have helmets?
- I-I promise,

89
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,845
I'll-I'll be
really, really safe.

90
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:52,884
- But legally...
- I won't call the fun police

91
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,049
if you don't.

92
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:55,984
Come on, please?

93
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:58,789
Oh, it's hard
to say no, isn't it?

94
00:05:58,924 --> 00:05:59,924
Uh, okay.

95
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,686
- Okay, give me your...
- Yes. - Yay.

96
00:06:01,822 --> 00:06:03,359
Uh, just hold on tight, okay?

97
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:04,695
Yeah.

98
00:06:04,794 --> 00:06:06,194
- All right, you holding on?
- Yeah.

99
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:07,807
All right, we'll go
nice and slow, okay?

100
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:08,870
- Yes.
- See you guys in a sec.

101
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:10,135
- Hold on tight.
- See ya.

102
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,635
- Bye!
- Here we go. Bye.

103
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,490
She's doing all right.

104
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,139
She's a natural!

105
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,274
Ooh.

106
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,874
No, she'll be fine.

107
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,189
Whoa!

108
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:34,986
That was a bit crazy. Oh!

109
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,755
Nailed it.

110
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:38,221
Yeah.

111
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,938
- That was so much fun.
- Yeah? - You did great.

112
00:06:39,962 --> 00:06:41,577
- Say thank you to Mr. Field.
- Thank you.

113
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,321
- Oh, no. Paddy, please.
- Thank you, Paddy.

114
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:44,733
You got it. Anytime.

115
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,596
So, listen,
have you guys eaten lunch yet?

116
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:48,033
Uh, no, we, uh...

117
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:49,783
No? We were thinking
we were gonna hang out

118
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:51,421
with that really interesting
Danish couple.

119
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,203
- You know the ones?
- Uh...

120
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:54,853
- I'm j-just messing around.
- Oh.

121
00:06:54,877 --> 00:06:57,109
But, uh, seriously,

122
00:06:57,244 --> 00:06:59,613
there is a really nice place
around the corner.

123
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:00,845
So we make the decision

124
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,450
that we're gonna move to London.

125
00:07:02,585 --> 00:07:03,817
Fly over, find an apartment,

126
00:07:03,953 --> 00:07:05,752
you know, I'm hiring
great new people,

127
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:07,520
and then...

128
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:09,291
Global economy tanks.

129
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:11,091
I get a call from Chicago.

130
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:14,027
"Uh, Ben, about that UK office
we wanted you to set up."

131
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:16,367
Aw, man, that's got to be
a kick in the balls.

132
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,267
Yeah. They gave me
a good severance.

133
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:20,566
Yeah? That's redundancy.

134
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:22,402
And, Louise, do you work?

135
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:24,374
I do. Yeah.

136
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:26,571
Uh, I'm, uh, I'm in PR.

137
00:07:26,706 --> 00:07:28,845
Or I-I was. I am...

138
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,440
I, um...

139
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,879
I don't have quite
the-the same network in London.

140
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:36,952
Yeah, we're still
finding our way.

141
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:39,887
But we've decided to stay
in London because we love it.

142
00:07:40,022 --> 00:07:42,256
We're two hours from here
or Paris or Rome.

143
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:44,125
The West Country.

144
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:47,298
- I don't think we've made it out there yet.
- Uh-uh.

145
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:48,673
What? Oh, my.

146
00:07:48,697 --> 00:07:50,229
Right, that's it, then.

147
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:51,874
You have to come and visit.
Really, it's beautiful.

148
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:53,497
Yeah, that'd be great.

149
00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:54,968
Yeah?

150
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,273
Yeah.

151
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,741
Done.

152
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:01,413
- Well, all right, then.
- So what do you got?

153
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:02,787
You got another job
lined up or...?

154
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:04,274
Well, I'm still processing.

155
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,945
Look, I remember,
before I quit my practice, I...

156
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,612
- What was I like?
- Uh, miserable.

157
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:09,882
I was miserable.

158
00:08:10,018 --> 00:08:11,850
- You're a lawyer?
- No, doctor. - Oh.

159
00:08:11,986 --> 00:08:13,617
But now,
do a little bit of work

160
00:08:13,752 --> 00:08:15,430
- with <i>Médecins Sans Frontières,</i> and I'm...
- He is...

161
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,967
- Oh, wow. - Wow.
- He is so much happier.

162
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:18,188
I'm so much happier.

163
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:21,499
Anyway, this tagliata
is delicious.

164
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,595
How's your polenta?
Looks a bit dry.

165
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:24,895
No, it's fine.

166
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,471
So you're a vegetarian?

167
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:29,306
For animal welfare
or personal health?

168
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,740
Yeah, for-for health benefits

169
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,181
and the animal welfare
and the environment.

170
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:33,521
No, no, no.
You don't have to go on.

171
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:34,709
It's-it's the future.

172
00:08:34,845 --> 00:08:36,647
Mom, can we go play
on the swing?

173
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,302
- Uh, yeah.
- Don't you want a dessert?

174
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:39,992
No, no, she's already had
her ice cream for the day.

175
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:41,656
Oh, wow, you guys are tough.

176
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,047
Ant, you can play, but stay
where we can see you, okay?

177
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:45,889
And don't disturb anyone, okay?

178
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,863
Oh, that's all right.
The Italians love children.

179
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:49,895
Not like the French.

180
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,696
It's so great for Ant
to find a friend to play with.

181
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,137
At the hotel,
the other families' kids,

182
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:56,266
they all seem
to know each other.

183
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:57,563
And, well, Ant struggles.

184
00:08:57,699 --> 00:08:59,336
- Um...
- Could I?

185
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:02,172
He, um, he has a condition.

186
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,702
Congenital aglossia.

187
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:05,337
Um, laymen's terms,

188
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:08,074
he was born with a much smaller
tongue than you or I.

189
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,309
- Makes it hard for him to communicate.
- Ah. - Mm.

190
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:13,079
But look, these two,
they're getting on great guns.

191
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:15,513
Shame they can't stay
this age forever.

192
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:17,015
Oh, shit.

193
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:18,949
- The Danes.
- Oh, no.

194
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:20,725
Hey.

195
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,787
He's seen us.
He's totally seen us.

196
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:24,422
Oy. Go with me on this.

197
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:25,558
Torsten.

198
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:27,093
- Yeah. Hi.
- Hey.

199
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:28,839
- Hey, have you guys eaten?
- No, we haven't.

200
00:09:28,863 --> 00:09:30,668
Do you want to come join us?

201
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,700
Actually, we could use
your help with a, uh,

202
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:34,166
- quite important debate.
- Yeah.

203
00:09:34,302 --> 00:09:36,267
Sorry.
This food is so rich.

204
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:38,336
We're debating
toilet paper protocols.

205
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:42,647
So, uh, to scrunch or to fold.
What do you do?

206
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,151
Uh...

207
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,286
I don't know.

208
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:49,554
Oh, all right.

209
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,217
Well, Louise is fold,
Ciara is scrunch,

210
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:53,267
but, you see, Ben and I,
we worry that if you fold,

211
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,759
you risk a puncture and you get
a bit of poo on your finger.

212
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,992
So, what should we do,
get another three chairs?

213
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:00,795
No, no, we were
actually just looking

214
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:02,861
to make a reservation
for later, so...

215
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:04,833
Oh, all right, man. Um, okay.

216
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:07,268
Well, see you guys
back at the ranch.

217
00:10:07,403 --> 00:10:09,099
Yeah.

218
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,671
- Bye, then.
- Cheers.

219
00:10:11,807 --> 00:10:12,807
What?

220
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:14,371
Paddy, you're terrible.

221
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:16,477
- Terrible.
- You do not know the half of it.

222
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,952
A hundred percent, sure.

223
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:26,485
Was it last year or
the year before we went there?

224
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,023
Oh, yeah.

225
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:30,525
Oh, Torsten, you haven't said.
Fold or scrunch?

226
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:31,960
Oh, man.

227
00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:33,606
I know. I'm really sor...
I'm really sorry.

228
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,692
Anyway, sorry, mate.

229
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:36,434
Here we go.

230
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:40,665
<i>Tre, due, uno.</i>

231
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:48,006
To new friends.

232
00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:50,275
To new friends.

233
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:57,852
Oh, God.

234
00:10:57,988 --> 00:10:59,194
Remind me why we live
in London again.

235
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:01,819
Come on. Go inside. Let's go.

236
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,374
All right.

237
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:20,408
Good night, honey.

238
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:22,142
And Hoppy.

239
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:27,718
Hon, you remember our agreement?

240
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,920
Hoppy gets his own room
before Christmas.

241
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:35,254
Right?
You're almost 12 years old.

242
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,690
Love you.

243
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:40,864
I love you, too.

244
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:50,636
I don't think Hoppy's getting
his own room before Christmas.

245
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:53,710
I mean, Louise,
do you think we should worry

246
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,906
- about why the...
- Ben, would you...

247
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,145
She'll hear you.

248
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,181
It's probably better
that she does.

249
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:06,923
Are you okay?

250
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:10,492
I got a call from
the headhunter today.

251
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:12,524
I didn't get it.

252
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,326
Oh.

253
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,960
Honey, I'm sorry.

254
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:24,875
- It's Penny.
- Mm.

255
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,736
Agnes's math tutor.
You want to read it?

256
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,108
No.

257
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:30,441
Goddamn.

258
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,714
Uh, look who wrote us.

259
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:38,053
Your friend.

260
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:44,929
"Ciao, Ben and Louise.

261
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,427
"We so miss our amazing week
together in Italy.

262
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:51,035
"You really must come visit
the farm. What do you say?

263
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:54,098
"A long weekend of Devon air,
fresh food and long walks.

264
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,004
"Ant sends Agnes good vibes.

265
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:57,835
He really misses her."

266
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,274
Very sweet.

267
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,670
Hey.

268
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:04,409
Maybe this will be good for her.

269
00:13:04,544 --> 00:13:08,050
Uh, for us.
You know, change of scenery.

270
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:10,452
Yeah.

271
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:14,422
It's maybe a bit long to spend
with people we barely know.

272
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:15,789
Yeah.

273
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:18,093
You're probably right.

274
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,993
Anyways.

275
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,029
You know what?

276
00:13:25,164 --> 00:13:27,536
I think we should go.

277
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:30,207
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Be fun.

278
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,942
Yeah?

279
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:45,450
Oh, gosh.

280
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:51,923
Look at that.

281
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:54,965
Yeah. Look at that.

282
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,708
<i>Are you sure
we didn't miss the turn or...</i>

283
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:11,411
Well, I don't know. We haven't
seen the-the war memorial yet.

284
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:14,853
Ben, please don't get angry.

285
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:17,955
I'm not angry.

286
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,186
C-Can you call them
or-or ask or...

287
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:25,127
There's still no...

288
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:26,793
Oh.

289
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,631
<i>Oh. War memorial!</i>

290
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,165
<i>Left. Left, left, left.</i>

291
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,545
- Baby.
- Hmm?

292
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,410
We're here.

293
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,657
Get me out of this car.

294
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:04,062
- Hey!
- Hey! - Hey!

295
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:05,769
- You made it.
- Hi.

296
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,169
We thought you were lost.

297
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:08,510
- Oh, no.
- Ah. Well, we thought we were lost.

298
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,167
- No, we didn't.
- Oh, yeah?

299
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:11,936
Good to see you, darling.

300
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:14,743
- Come on. We'll get you in.
- This place is just so...

301
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,773
Oh, wow. Oh, sorry, shoes.

302
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:19,146
Oh, no, you can leave them on.
Don't worry.

303
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:20,985
- Sorry for the mess.
- Oh, no.

304
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,983
- Shall we put your bag in your room?
- Yeah.

305
00:15:23,118 --> 00:15:25,216
- Wow.
- You like it?

306
00:15:25,351 --> 00:15:27,119
Wow, this place.

307
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:28,918
Innit? Let me get you a drink.

308
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,354
Ooh.

309
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:32,825
- Very steep.
- Here we go.

310
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,828
Wow.

311
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:37,029
Cozy.

312
00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:38,196
<i>Cider.</i>

313
00:15:38,332 --> 00:15:40,735
From our very own farm apples.

314
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,040
- No.
- Yeah.

315
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,073
That's the good stuff, right?

316
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,608
Strong.

317
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:52,376
Just you wait till
you try our calvados.

318
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:55,481
It's 150 proof.

319
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:57,983
Ant?

320
00:15:58,118 --> 00:16:00,222
It's Agnes.

321
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,920
Oh. Say hi to Ant, sweetie.

322
00:16:04,056 --> 00:16:06,060
Hi, Ant.

323
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:08,129
Oh, he's just a little shy.

324
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:10,193
Look, Agnes,
we made you a little bed.

325
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:12,335
Do you like it?

326
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,834
Yes.

327
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:15,200
It's great.

328
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:17,041
Ant, it's time for dinner.

329
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,637
- Come down when you're ready.
- Yeah.

330
00:16:24,346 --> 00:16:26,215
Oh, and we got you this.

331
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:28,347
Oh, a candle.
You shouldn't have.

332
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:29,762
This is, uh, Feu de Bois.

333
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:31,685
It's the scent
of a log fireplace.

334
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:33,964
That's good. We can stick it
next to the log fireplace.

335
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:37,291
And for the football fan.
Hut, hut!

336
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:39,161
Ah, Ben, Ben,
you shouldn't have, man.

337
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:40,737
- That's really... Ant.
- Ah, please.

338
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:42,793
Ant, what do we say?

339
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:45,601
That's my boy. Hut!
I'm coming for you, boy.

340
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:47,778
I'm trying to get him to play
more contact sports, you know?

341
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:50,771
It's good...
It's good...

342
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:53,346
- It's good for them, you know? They need that outlet.
- Yeah.

343
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:55,143
God, I used to love
a tear-up, man.

344
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:56,642
What about you?
Do you play ball?

345
00:16:56,777 --> 00:16:58,782
- Yeah, I mean, a little.
- Oh, yeah? Hut.

346
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,416
Wh-Whoa, whoa.

347
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,031
My reactions ain't
what they used to be either.

348
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:05,185
All right.
<i>Rosse Arance di Sicilia.</i>

349
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,618
It's Italian blood oranges.

350
00:17:06,753 --> 00:17:09,021
- But look at the color in the...
- Mm-hmm. - Ooh.

351
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:10,157
Wow.

352
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:12,995
You are VIP guests.

353
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,492
When Paddy heard
you were coming,

354
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:16,934
he butchered Libby,
our prize goose,

355
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,477
and has been hanging her
in the outhouse.

356
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:21,004
She was some bird,
Libby. Regal girl.

357
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,279
Real queen of the farmyard,
you know?

358
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:23,635
I mean, what was she like?

359
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:25,249
- She had personality.
- She had personality.

360
00:17:26,407 --> 00:17:28,509
Ta-da!

361
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:30,404
Libby à l'orange.

362
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:33,711
All right.
The old man's carving forks.

363
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:36,349
Sous chef, if you please.

364
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:39,215
- Just to...
- Raised with love.

365
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,656
Free-range.

366
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,252
Our wheat,

367
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:45,558
our grass, our orchards.

368
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,567
And now, Louise, my love.

369
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,003
Our gift to you.

370
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,905
Oh, God, that is so...

371
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,270
It-It's just a tiny morsel.

372
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:57,612
Um, I'll try it.

373
00:17:57,636 --> 00:17:59,844
Well, we thought, for the lady.

374
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,377
It's the best part of the roast.

375
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:04,013
Really crispy and yet
somehow manages to be soft

376
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:06,480
- all at the same time.
- Mm.

377
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:13,618
Mmm. Mmm.

378
00:18:13,754 --> 00:18:15,403
- It's good, right?
- Mm-hmm.

379
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,387
- It's okay?
- Mmm. Very good.

380
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,826
Can I, uh, can I help out
with anything?

381
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:23,463
Oh, what a gent.
Uh, yeah, that would be great.

382
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:26,731
Uh, serving platters,
second shelf.

383
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,633
Oh, they're just round there.

384
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:32,836
- Ah.
- Thank you.

385
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:53,092
Ant, come on, mate.

386
00:18:53,228 --> 00:18:55,794
Bedtime. Chop-chop.

387
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:59,100
That's my boy.

388
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:01,502
- Kids, right?
- Yeah.

389
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:08,142
Geez.

390
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:09,576
Are those original to the house?

391
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:12,950
Yeah. Keeps the heat in,
keeps the highwaymen out.

392
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,911
Geez, it's so quiet around here.

393
00:19:15,046 --> 00:19:17,252
I mean, do you guys
even have any neighbors?

394
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:18,695
Yeah, all the way
across the valley,

395
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:20,452
but, you know,
we look after each other.

396
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:22,152
Ours are across the hall,

397
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,587
and I don't think
we've ever spoken.

398
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:26,430
Louise, you have a bad neck?

399
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,430
No, uh, it's just something
that flares up sometimes.

400
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:30,738
Medicinal? It's homegrown.

401
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:32,395
No, thank you. I took a pill.

402
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:35,606
Oh, modern medicine.

403
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:37,339
It is amazing.

404
00:19:37,474 --> 00:19:39,502
But too often
we treat the symptom.

405
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,037
We don't treat the cause.

406
00:19:41,172 --> 00:19:45,508
You know, technology's
advanced incredibly,

407
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,251
but emotionally speaking,

408
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,114
we're all still just...

409
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,885
cave dwellers.

410
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:56,159
It's all this perfect life,
Instagram, Facebook bullshit.

411
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,829
Everybody talking
but nobody being honest.

412
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,925
It's left us...

413
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,501
I don't know...
impatient and stressy.

414
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,733
The Internet's been down
a half a day,

415
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:09,701
and I've nearly
bloody killed him, so...

416
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,438
I love it out here.

417
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:14,707
It's like a digital detox.

418
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:16,674
You know, get away from London
for a while.

419
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,158
Yeah.

420
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:19,444
Is he, is he all right?

421
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:20,845
Oh, no, no, he's fine.

422
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,919
- Yeah.
- Um, he'll crash in a minute.

423
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,087
He does this sometimes.

424
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:25,394
It's just part of his condition.

425
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:26,617
He's not in pain?

426
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:28,022
- No.
- Uh, no. - Okay.

427
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:30,561
No, no, no. No pain.

428
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,668
- You know, I'm gonna just check on Agnes.
- Yeah. Yeah.

429
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:34,392
Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

430
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:41,971
He's conked.

431
00:20:42,106 --> 00:20:43,934
Wow.

432
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,859
<i>You should've
said something to him.</i>

433
00:20:56,883 --> 00:20:59,155
They killed Libby,
the golden goose.

434
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,530
I was trying to make an effort.

435
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:02,284
I know. I know.

436
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,157
Oh.

437
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:05,793
- Ew.
- What?

438
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:07,231
Ben.

439
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,200
Do you think
these have been washed?

440
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,035
Oh, I think
we should say something.

441
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,866
No, honey, that is an old stain.

442
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:16,869
Look, we're in the country,
all right?

443
00:21:17,004 --> 00:21:18,885
Our normal isn't their normal.

444
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:22,171
They're just a bit more...
I don't know... unvarnished.

445
00:21:22,306 --> 00:21:24,641
You don't think
it's weird for a doctor

446
00:21:24,777 --> 00:21:26,547
to live in a house like this?

447
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:29,051
Look, this isn't America,
all right?

448
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,783
He does nonprofit work.

449
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:32,683
And they probably choose
to spend their money

450
00:21:32,818 --> 00:21:35,022
on less material things,
you know?

451
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:36,760
Like vacation.

452
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,121
Mm-mm.

453
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:40,589
Do you have any idea what
the inside of Downton Abbey

454
00:21:40,725 --> 00:21:42,965
actually looks like?

455
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,867
It's a shithole.

456
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,335
Hey.

457
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,534
Thank you for making the effort.

458
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,611
You're welcome.

459
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,078
Hello? Oh.

460
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,376
Hi, baby.

461
00:21:57,512 --> 00:21:59,111
I can't fall back asleep.

462
00:21:59,247 --> 00:22:00,892
- Oh, honey. That's all right.
- That's okay. Come on.

463
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,652
Let me get your breathing app
going for you.

464
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,021
No, no, no, I have it here.
Come on. Come in bed, baby.

465
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,083
Come on, come with Mom.

466
00:22:13,928 --> 00:22:15,658
- Can we keep the light on?
- No.

467
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,163
No, honey.

468
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:19,136
Here we go.

469
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:20,633
Okay.

470
00:22:20,768 --> 00:22:24,775
We just need to calm down.

471
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,236
Settle in.

472
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:29,474

got to start slowly.

Cheeky bastard.

- Yeah.

I'm glad you didn't.

495
00:23:34,943 --> 00:23:37,446
An American
who doesn't like guns?

00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,646
Oh, well,
I saw my share growing up.

497
00:23:40,216 --> 00:23:44,654
If unchecked, foxes, they kill
all the ground-nesting birds.

498
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,832
Predator control is essential
to a balanced ecosystem.

499
00:23:46,856 --> 00:23:49,120
- Balanced ecosystem.
- It is. - Mm.

500
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:51,895
Yes, I'm sure
a factory-made firearm is

501
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,028
nature's way of keeping that
delicate balance.

502
00:23:55,164 --> 00:23:56,233
Mm.

503
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:59,437
- Mom?
- Ah. Excuse me.

504
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,904
Look at this.

505
00:24:05,703 --> 00:24:07,740
You... Ant?

506
00:24:07,876 --> 00:24:09,312
Do you think
you could move, honey,

507
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,878
so that Agnes can have a swing?

508
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,144
Uh, oh, hello.

509
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,313
Um, do you mind asking Ant
if he'll move?

510
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:18,769
- Just so that... Agnes wants to have a go.
- Come on, pal.

511
00:24:18,822 --> 00:24:20,261
Just for a second.

512
00:24:20,285 --> 00:24:23,527
Give you a piggyback, yeah?
Come on.

513
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:25,992
Go on.

514
00:24:26,128 --> 00:24:28,097
I'd have felt the back
of my dad's hand by now.

515
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:30,432
Paddy, Paddy. I-It's okay.
You don't, you don't have to.

516
00:24:30,565 --> 00:24:33,169
It's all right, it's all right.
You want to, don't you, mate?

517
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:35,498
Go on. Give Agnes a push.

518
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:37,574
Good boy.

519
00:24:40,107 --> 00:24:43,278
Oh, come on,
that is not a push.

520
00:24:43,414 --> 00:24:46,143
There. That's my boy.

521
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,087
- You flaring up?
- Yeah, it's just a...

522
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,486
- May I?
- Oh.

523
00:24:53,621 --> 00:24:55,955
Go on, loosen your knees.

524
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,830
Oh, wow.

525
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,531
Yeah.

526
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,034
Your levator scapulae
is like a rope.

527
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,034
Can we just...

528
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:11,472
Yeah.

529
00:25:14,378 --> 00:25:16,574
I know what you need.

530
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,143
Cold water therapy.

531
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:21,810
Clinically proven to reduce
inflammation and? Anyone?

532
00:25:21,946 --> 00:25:22,946
Boost the immune system.

533
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:24,555
- Oh.
- Yeah.

534
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,218
W-Well, we didn't bring
our swimsuits.

535
00:25:26,354 --> 00:25:27,828
Oh, that's all right.
You can keep you knickers on.

536
00:25:27,852 --> 00:25:29,621
Oh, what happened?

537
00:25:29,757 --> 00:25:31,390
Oh, um...

538
00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:33,907
Oh, uh, it got a little bit out
of hand last night.

539
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:36,662
I fell off
a ladder, picking apples.

540
00:25:36,797 --> 00:25:38,661
Come on, you lot.

541
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:40,465
Get your kit off.

542
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,165
I promise we'll whack up the
heating in the car afterwards

543
00:25:43,301 --> 00:25:46,973
and we will be warm again
in no time.

544
00:25:49,474 --> 00:25:52,048
You shouldn't be shy, Louise.
Got a great body.

545
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,246
Oh, thank you.

546
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:55,247
Yeah.

547
00:25:55,382 --> 00:25:57,392
Right. Make sure when
you jump out, clear the rocks.

548
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:59,656
All right. Ant, Agnes,
jump with the dads, yeah?

549
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,331
- Ready? In three, two...
- Oh, hold on.

550
00:26:01,355 --> 00:26:04,221
One-one second. Sorry, sorry.
Uh, uh...

551
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,093
- Is it safe? Is it deep enough?
- Uh, yeah.

552
00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:08,137
I've done it hundreds of times,
since I was her age.

553
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:09,829
Yeah, just mind
you clear the rocks.

554
00:26:09,965 --> 00:26:12,937
All right,
in three, two, one, go!

555
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,439
Oh! Whoo!

556
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:21,809
Go on, boy!

557
00:26:21,945 --> 00:26:23,645
- Paddy, can he swim?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

558
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:25,514
Same way I learned:
sink or swim.

559
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:27,946
He'll be fine. Go on, Ant.

560
00:26:28,082 --> 00:26:29,783
Oh, my God,
can Ant... can Ant swim?

561
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,054
Oh, don't worry.
Paddy's got him.

562
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:33,085
Shall we?

563
00:26:33,086 --> 00:26:35,486
Oh, um... uh, y-you go ahead.

564
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:37,388
Okay.

565
00:26:42,064 --> 00:26:43,864
- Come on, Louise!
- Go, Louise!

566
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:45,295
Come on!

567
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:47,145
- Come on, jump, jump, jump!
- Come on, jump!

568
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:50,766
Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

569
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:52,370
Jump! Jump! Jump!

570
00:26:56,173 --> 00:26:58,778
- Oh, God.
- Geez!

571
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:01,051
That's a fucking fire hazard.

572
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:06,687
Look, Louise,
do you want to take a nap?

573
00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:09,855
Yeah, in their dirty bed?

574
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,092
Okay, let's everybody just...

575
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:15,532
I'm sorry.

576
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:18,331
I am trying.
I really, really am.

577
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:20,034
I just...

578
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:22,634
I don't find them
that pleasant to be around.

579
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:24,334
Okay.

580
00:27:24,469 --> 00:27:28,675
Maybe we could use my neck
as an excuse.

581
00:27:28,811 --> 00:27:30,775
To leave?

582
00:27:30,911 --> 00:27:32,380
- Hey.
- Hi.

583
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:33,544
Am I interrupting?

584
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,316
N-No.

585
00:27:35,451 --> 00:27:38,249
Well, Paddy and I would like to
invite you for dinner tonight.

586
00:27:38,384 --> 00:27:40,490
- Ooh.
- Yeah, there's this guy Mike.

587
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,052
He's a bit of a local legend.

588
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:43,594
I mean, rumor is he's a poacher,

589
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,158
but he's an amazing cook.

590
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:47,589
And, um, he has
this little place by the sea.

591
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:50,431
Private room,
like a chef's table type thing.

592
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:51,633
- Oh, wow.
- Mmm.

593
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:52,977
Yeah, and it's super authentic,

594
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:55,031
everything fresh, local.

595
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:57,805
- Um... great.
- Great.

596
00:27:57,941 --> 00:28:00,238
- We-We'd love to.
- Great.

597
00:28:03,878 --> 00:28:07,113
She seems really unpleasant.

598
00:28:08,716 --> 00:28:10,248
Okay, I was j...

599
00:28:12,584 --> 00:28:15,956
Hey, let's...
let's try and reboot.

600
00:28:16,091 --> 00:28:18,060
All right?
Remember what Nadine said?

601
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:21,694
Let's not make the perfect
the enemy of the good.

602
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,999
Oh, I hope
they have French fries.

603
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:29,438
Well, I'm sure
they will have chips,

604
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:31,135
because that's
what they're called here.

605
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:33,971
Oh, wow!

606
00:28:34,107 --> 00:28:35,911
You look like a million bucks.

607
00:28:36,046 --> 00:28:37,726
Thank you. You look lovely.

608
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,448
You know what they say, man.

609
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,378
Happy wife, happy life.

610
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:43,584
We don't actually shop
that often.

611
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:44,984
I mean, our philosophy...

612
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,089
Spend wisely
on the things that last.

613
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,690
Yeah, that last, like, uh,
a watch or a ring or a memory.

614
00:28:50,826 --> 00:28:52,292
Like Italy.

615
00:28:52,427 --> 00:28:54,429
Yeah, and everything's
so disposable now,

616
00:28:54,564 --> 00:28:55,727
so "fast fashion."

617
00:28:55,862 --> 00:28:57,760
Isn't Ant coming?

618
00:28:58,163 --> 00:29:01,437
Hey, Muhj! There he is.

619
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,972
So, Muhjid doesn't speak
the best English,

620
00:29:04,107 --> 00:29:06,037
- but he's a great babysitter.
- Hello.

621
00:29:06,172 --> 00:29:07,877
You're... Oh.

622
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,485
Oh, the... are the kids
not coming with us?

623
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:10,987
Oh, no,
tonight's without the kids.

624
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:12,243
Didn't I tell you that?

625
00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:14,684
Muhj had to flee
the war in Syria.

626
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,451
His hometown, Homs,
just obliterated.

627
00:29:16,587 --> 00:29:17,587
Oh.

628
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:18,816
God, I'm so sorry.

629
00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:20,519
Oh, thank you, sir.

630
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:22,504
Poor bugger, he's stuck
in the asylum system.

631
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,094
Can't officially work.

632
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,124
Don't worry.
He's thoroughly trustworthy.

633
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,093
- Back home, he was a teacher.
- Oh.

634
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:29,458
He's great with kids.

635
00:29:29,594 --> 00:29:31,131
The whole neighborhood
feels the same.

636
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:32,472
And not just 'cause he's cheap.

637
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:34,369
Yeah, and the best part is

638
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:36,111
if there's any monkey business,
we'll get him deported.

639
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,435
- Brother, have a great night.
- Come.

640
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,011
Come with me.
Let me show you. Come.

641
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,610
So do you think
we should leave her with him?

642
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:50,414
We've had nannies before,
and he was a teacher.

643
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:52,253
Come on, Louise.
Let's go have a good time.

644
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:54,629
- Okay. Bye, baby.
- Hey, guys! Coming?

645
00:29:54,723 --> 00:29:57,458
Come. Come, come.

- Are we almost there?
- Very soon.

651
00:30:26,352 --> 00:30:29,490
<i>Wow. Wow, this place.</i>

652
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:31,060
Oh, my God.

653
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,425
Yep, America's that way.
Dinner's that way.

654
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:37,697
The good news is,
we're the only diners tonight.

655
00:30:37,832 --> 00:30:39,164
Oh, it's so cute.

656
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,636
Yep.
Not gonna find this on Yelp.

657
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:46,071
Mike goes out at night on
his own, sources all the food.

658
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:48,237
Incredible chef. He's...

659
00:30:48,373 --> 00:30:49,847
You should taste his game pie.

660
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:51,184
It's like...

661
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:52,476
Amazing.

662
00:30:52,611 --> 00:30:55,111
Um, but just to remember,
I'm a vegetarian.

663
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:57,219
- Wait, yesterday.
- I know.

664
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,161
I'm...
I should have said something.

665
00:30:59,185 --> 00:31:00,384
I just... I...

666
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,188
You guys had gone
to so much trouble...

667
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:03,764
- Oh, it's...
- Oh, mate, mate.

668
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:05,168
I feel like such an idiot.
I'm so sorry.

669
00:31:05,192 --> 00:31:06,622
It was okay. Uh...

670
00:31:06,758 --> 00:31:08,105
- Yeah, it was okay.
- Okay?

671
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:09,394
Really, don't worry about it.

672
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:11,198
Great. But you do still
eat fish, yeah?

673
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:14,570
- Yes.
- Great. But... Fish is not a meat?

674
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:16,138
Of course.

675
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,875
But, you know, it's better
for the environment.

676
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,081
Yeah, but the way
that industrial fishing

677
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:21,506
treats the oceans.

678
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:24,441
That is why I fundraise
for sustainable fishing

679
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:26,180
and for ecolabeling
on packaging...

680
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:28,681
That kind of pescatarianism
is a privilege.

681
00:31:28,816 --> 00:31:31,582
Absolutely, but that's
not a reason not to do it.

682
00:31:31,717 --> 00:31:33,398
What if you can't afford
line-caught?

683
00:31:33,422 --> 00:31:34,932
Well, surely
you're not advocating

684
00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:36,553
we all eat factory meat.

685
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:40,194
Rather than, you know, Libby.

686
00:31:41,997 --> 00:31:44,796
It's... complicated.

687
00:31:44,932 --> 00:31:46,932
Can we agree?

688
00:31:47,568 --> 00:31:50,000
It is. It's complicated.
It is really complicated.

689
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:51,867
And complicated is good.

690
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:53,881
Too many people these days
are afraid of honest debate.

691
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:55,672
Aren't they?
We're all too fucking polite.

692
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:58,911
- Hey. Look at this sucker.
- There you go, eh? - Whoa.

693
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,212
Now, we trust that this is

694
00:32:00,348 --> 00:32:02,044
sustainably sourced seafood,
Mike.

695
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,757
Yeah, well, it's, uh,
it's done with Devon butter,

696
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:05,989
uh, wild samphire,
forest-foraged mushrooms,

697
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,151
cooked in, uh,
sustainable Devon cream, eh?

698
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:09,853
- Fantastic.
- Yeah.

699
00:32:09,988 --> 00:32:11,734
Uh, not the poisonous ones,
right? We can trust you, Mike?

700
00:32:11,758 --> 00:32:13,135
Oh, well, that would be
telling, wouldn't it?

701
00:32:15,327 --> 00:32:17,193
Right. Pot time.

702
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,802
...24, 25...

703
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,975
...26...

704
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:29,191
Under the bed.

705
00:32:29,242 --> 00:32:33,676
...27, 28...

706
00:32:35,283 --> 00:32:37,383
- ...29...
- Whoa.

707
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:41,090
- That's a lot of watches.
- ...30.

708
00:32:42,391 --> 00:32:45,892
Ready or not, here I come.

709
00:32:46,028 --> 00:32:48,262
I don't understand.

710
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:53,663
Hello.

711
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,311
Where are you, little creatures?

712
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:17,723
<i>You know,
they say, you either become</i>

713
00:33:17,858 --> 00:33:20,290
- like your parents or you go the opposite way, right?
- Mm.

714
00:33:20,425 --> 00:33:22,098
I never met mine.

715
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,427
Hey, that's their loss, baby.

716
00:33:24,562 --> 00:33:26,436
Their loss.

717
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:30,670
Mine were, if you'll excuse
the French, a couple of cunts.

718
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,940
So, you went
the other way or...?

719
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:42,316
"They fuck you up,
your mum and dad.

720
00:33:43,418 --> 00:33:46,582
"They may not mean to,
but they do.

721
00:33:46,718 --> 00:33:50,322
"They fill you
with the faults they had

722
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:53,193
"Then add some extra
just for you.

723
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:56,592
"But they were fucked up
in their turn

724
00:33:56,728 --> 00:34:00,629
"By fools
in old-style hats and coats,

725
00:34:00,765 --> 00:34:03,137
"That half the time
were soppy-stern

726
00:34:03,273 --> 00:34:06,406
"And half
at one another's throats.

727
00:34:08,209 --> 00:34:11,012
"Man hands on misery to man.

728
00:34:11,147 --> 00:34:15,184
"It deepens like
a coastal shelf.

729
00:34:16,152 --> 00:34:19,583
"Get out as early as you can,

730
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,888
And don't have
any kids yourself."

731
00:34:23,691 --> 00:34:25,791
Hey.

732
00:34:25,926 --> 00:34:27,592
Baby.

733
00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:32,234
She fucking...

734
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:35,567
She rescued me, this one.

735
00:34:37,336 --> 00:34:38,536
Saved me from the pit.

736
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:40,370
Straightened me out.

737
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:42,038
And it's been what now?

738
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:43,443
17 years.

739
00:34:43,578 --> 00:34:45,945
- 17 years.
- Wow.

740
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:47,110
You get less for murder.

741
00:34:49,618 --> 00:34:53,353
And, you know, we still...
you know, every day.

742
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:55,325
Every day? Oh, my God.

743
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:58,224
Fuck. Ben's lucky
if he gets it once a month.

744
00:34:58,359 --> 00:34:59,689
- What?
- Oh.

745
00:34:59,825 --> 00:35:02,157
Well, you've got to work
at it.

746
00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:03,528
I know.

747
00:35:03,664 --> 00:35:06,233
I mean, sometimes we role-play.

748
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,803
- Yeah.
- No.

749
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,903
- Seriously.
- Yeah.

750
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:12,136
Teacher and student.

751
00:35:12,272 --> 00:35:13,272
Mm.

752
00:35:13,374 --> 00:35:14,743
Rock star and fan.

753
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,879
Strangers at a bar.

754
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,813
Horny waitress and hot customer.

755
00:35:19,948 --> 00:35:21,577
Oh, my God.

756
00:35:21,713 --> 00:35:22,919
- Sir?
- Mm-hmm?

757
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,352
How was your food?

758
00:35:24,487 --> 00:35:26,418
It was tasty,
but I do like more spice.

759
00:35:26,553 --> 00:35:27,855
- Do you?
- Yeah.

760
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,558
Stop it.

761
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:32,628
Well, maybe for dessert, we can
go for something off menu.

762
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,222
Yes, please.

763
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:35,693
Oh, no.

764
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:37,549
Oh, sir, I think
you've dropped your napkin.

765
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:40,165
- I did. Fuck.
- I'll just slip under the table

766
00:35:40,301 --> 00:35:42,799
and sort that out for you.

767
00:35:49,145 --> 00:35:50,741
Okay.

768
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:13,803
We were not really.

769
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,573
Oh, I love this woman.

770
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:18,868
Love her.

771
00:36:19,003 --> 00:36:22,544
What is the biggest
sexual organ in the body?

772
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,614
Mm?

773
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:25,842
The brain.

774
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:28,413
What we can imagine is
infinitely more sexy

775
00:36:28,548 --> 00:36:30,116
- than what we can do.
- Mm-hmm.

776
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:32,255
Just-just keeps it fresh.

777
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:35,922
Which is why we both like
to dine out sometimes.

778
00:36:36,057 --> 00:36:39,160
Yeah. Yeah.

779
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,761
Yeah.

780
00:36:41,897 --> 00:36:42,965
Oh.

781
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:45,066
We think it's healthy. Mm.

782
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:49,903
Mm. Okay.

783
00:36:50,705 --> 00:36:53,272
Oh, my God. I love this tune.

784
00:36:53,407 --> 00:36:55,076
Mike, bang it up, will you?

785
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,912
My dear?

786
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,948
So, she was how old
when they met?

787
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:09,624
Louise, don't go there.

788
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:13,795
♪ Mississippi in the middle
of a dry spell... ♪

789
00:37:14,597 --> 00:37:16,960
- That is punchy.
- Um, Paddy...

790
00:37:17,096 --> 00:37:19,096
- Worth every penny, Mike.
- Paddy. We'll pitch in.

791
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:22,504
Oh, that's very kind of you,
man. We'll get the car, okay?

792
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,836
Thank you, kind sir.

793
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:41,555
Ant, what are you doing?

794
00:37:54,336 --> 00:37:57,104
God. Ant, what did you do?

795
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,534
How did you get those?

796
00:38:08,112 --> 00:38:11,013
Oh, she's an angel.

797
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:46,485
New book?

798
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,052
Yeah. Um, Paddy recommended it.

799
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,026
Wow, you guys should
go off together.

800
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:55,431
What?

801
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,565
Or I could just switch rooms
if you like.

802
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,302
Louise, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

803
00:39:00,437 --> 00:39:02,371
- What?
- Why would you say that

804
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,170
after everything
that we've been through?

805
00:39:04,305 --> 00:39:05,539
Hey, I was joking.

806
00:39:05,675 --> 00:39:07,207
Yeah, no, but you do it
all the time.

807
00:39:07,343 --> 00:39:08,940
You know, b-belittling me.

808
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:10,715
I mean, saying that
I'm lucky to get laid?

809
00:39:10,774 --> 00:39:12,007
Ben, that was a joke.

810
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:13,947
Yeah, but it's not
fucking funny.

811
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:16,089
Not when you're sexting a dad
at your daughter's school

812
00:39:16,113 --> 00:39:17,873
- like a fucking teenager.
- Okay. Okay. Ben.

813
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,952
- Ben, please.
- Well, think about it.

814
00:39:20,088 --> 00:39:22,099
- How does that make me feel when you say that?
- I know.

815
00:39:22,123 --> 00:39:25,857
I know, and I have said that
I am sorry a thousand times.

816
00:39:25,992 --> 00:39:27,724
But I-I don't know
what to do anymore.

817
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:29,491
I mean, it's been six months.

818
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:31,706
- We've been over this with Nadine a thousand times.
- Yeah.

819
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,235
Yeah, that it's my fault.

820
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,610
- No, no, no, no.
- And Aggie...

821
00:39:34,737 --> 00:39:36,043
I take responsibility
for my actions.

822
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:38,567
- But you... you are so angry.
- Yes!

823
00:39:38,702 --> 00:39:42,208
For seeing another man's dick
on my wife's phone?

824
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:44,013
Please. Listen.

825
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,448
I am not excusing that,

826
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,045
but you were angry
long before that, okay?

827
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,146
You are so bitter at the world
for not giving you

828
00:39:50,282 --> 00:39:52,115
what you think you deserve
that-that you don't

829
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,322
see all the things in front of you.

830
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:56,289
You can't turn this all on me.

831
00:39:56,425 --> 00:39:58,257
I moved to London for you.

832
00:39:58,392 --> 00:39:59,624
I upended my life.

833
00:39:59,759 --> 00:40:01,761
I lost my job. I lost my house.

834
00:40:01,896 --> 00:40:05,028
I lost everything
that makes me me, for you.

835
00:40:05,163 --> 00:40:07,433
And when you lost your job,
I agreed to stay

836
00:40:07,568 --> 00:40:09,404
and help you and support you

837
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:10,899
and keep your life
running smoothly

838
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:13,135
so that you could have access
to all of Europe.

839
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:16,138
But where the fuck is
my access to my husband?

840
00:40:16,273 --> 00:40:18,144
You know, I-I don't know
if you're with me

841
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:22,551
because you love me or because
you just can't stand to fail.

842
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:26,885
Look.

843
00:40:27,784 --> 00:40:29,987
Louise, I'm...

844
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:34,325
I do care.

845
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,092
I'm...

846
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:38,963
I'm really trying.

847
00:40:44,835 --> 00:40:47,008
Yes.

848
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:48,272
We both are.

849
00:40:52,181 --> 00:40:54,113
Let's...

850
00:40:54,248 --> 00:40:56,853
please...

851
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:59,588
be friends.

852
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:14,196
Look, I'm sorry.

853
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,168
I'm sorry.

854
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:23,837
Agnes, baby.

855
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,211
Ben.

856
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,920
Ben.

857
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,049
What?

858
00:42:39,051 --> 00:42:41,723
- We're leaving.
- What?

859
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:19,596
Mom? Where's Hoppy?

860
00:43:21,564 --> 00:43:22,991
Uh, I-I don't know.

861
00:43:23,127 --> 00:43:25,167
Did you have him when we left?

862
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:27,131
I don't think so.

863
00:43:45,184 --> 00:43:47,588
<i>Sweetie, he's not there.</i>

864
00:43:47,723 --> 00:43:49,052
<i>I want Hoppy.</i>

865
00:43:49,188 --> 00:43:50,723
Agnes, you got to grow
out of this.

866
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:52,395
You're almost 12 years old.

867
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,558
Ben, it's not helpful. Please.

868
00:43:54,693 --> 00:43:58,025
Listen, when we get home, we'll
ask them to mail him, okay?

869
00:43:58,161 --> 00:43:59,802
He'll get hurt like Ant.

870
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:02,068
Honey, Ant's not hurt.
He was born like that.

871
00:44:02,203 --> 00:44:04,736
- We'll buy another Hoppy.
- No, I need my Hoppy!

872
00:44:04,872 --> 00:44:06,434
Agnes, please calm down, okay?

873
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:08,675
- They're gonna do that to Hoppy!
- Breathe. Agnes!

874
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:10,105
Hey! Enough!

875
00:44:10,241 --> 00:44:12,280
Hey!

876
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,711
Oh, my God!

877
00:44:14,847 --> 00:44:17,518
Oh, Jesus.

878
00:44:17,653 --> 00:44:21,251
Oh. You okay? Are you okay?

879
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:26,495
We can't leave him there.
We can't leave him there.

880
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:28,597
They're gonna do that to Hoppy.

881
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:30,761
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

882
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,833
All right. I'll be right back.

883
00:45:08,968 --> 00:45:10,200
What if they're awake?

884
00:45:10,336 --> 00:45:14,106
Louise, just give me
two minutes, okay?

885
00:45:45,473 --> 00:45:46,876
Okay.

886
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,878
Be right back, okay? Okay?

887
00:46:15,334 --> 00:46:17,604
- No. No.
- Louise, um,

888
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,006
j-just go back to the car.

889
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:20,741
I'll be there in two minutes.

890
00:46:20,872 --> 00:46:23,032
Look, like I said, we didn't
want to, like, wake you...

891
00:46:23,076 --> 00:46:24,341
- What?
- What's going on?

892
00:46:24,476 --> 00:46:26,277
Uh, we've got
a bit of a situation.

893
00:46:26,413 --> 00:46:28,414
Someone was leaving
without saying goodbye.

894
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:32,683
No, look, I was just saying to
Paddy we had such a good time.

895
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:35,855
Well, then I've got to ask
again, wait, why did you leave?

896
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:38,056
Be honest.

897
00:46:38,192 --> 00:46:40,294
Look, look,
some-some things happened

898
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:43,558
that made us feel like it was
best that we head back home.

899
00:46:43,694 --> 00:46:46,435
What things?
Uh, I think we deserve to know.

900
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,863
Mm-hmm.

901
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:51,841
A-Agnes doesn't like
sleeping on the floor,

902
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,239
and so she-she comes
into the room at night

903
00:46:54,374 --> 00:46:56,443
and the-the bed's
really small, so we...

904
00:46:56,578 --> 00:46:59,378
- I'm sorry that our house isn't huge...
- No, it's not...

905
00:46:59,513 --> 00:47:00,992
...and that
Agnes doesn't feel comfortable

906
00:47:01,016 --> 00:47:02,450
- in Ant's room, but...
- No!

907
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:03,586
She was in your bed.

908
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,953
- What?
- Yeah.

909
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:06,361
- Who? What?
- Our daughter was in your bed.

910
00:47:06,385 --> 00:47:07,723
- Yes, I'm sorry. Okay?
- Ciara?

911
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:09,163
Paddy was asleep
for the whole thing.

912
00:47:09,187 --> 00:47:10,719
That's my fault, okay?

913
00:47:10,855 --> 00:47:12,955
Well, I'm-I'm sorry,
but-but that is crossing a line.

914
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,530
- I mean, th-that is not okay.
- Uh, it's my fault. I'm sorry.

915
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,132
I'm-I'm sorry.

916
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:19,735
I... Look, I know I can be
overprotective as a mother.

917
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:22,237
Wh-What does that
have to do with it?

918
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,603
We had a baby daughter.

919
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:27,836
Uh, no.

920
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:30,011
Mary.

921
00:47:30,146 --> 00:47:35,950
And, um, she died
at 12 weeks of a cot death.

922
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:38,681
We would've been
the perfect family.

923
00:47:39,617 --> 00:47:42,619
So hearing Agnes crying,
it just...

924
00:47:43,422 --> 00:47:45,588
Um, so, she was just...
she-she was...

925
00:47:45,723 --> 00:47:48,162
She kept calling for you,
and-and you didn't come,

926
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,899
and she was beside herself,
scratching herself and...

927
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,760
Well, and you weren't
there, so...

928
00:47:52,896 --> 00:47:55,102
Look, you-you know how hard
it is trying to decide

929
00:47:55,237 --> 00:47:57,270
when to intervene
and when to give them space,

930
00:47:57,406 --> 00:47:59,842
and I'm... I'm so sorry
if I got it wrong.

931
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:02,142
I'm so sorry.

932
00:48:02,277 --> 00:48:04,039
- Ciara. I didn't know.
- Like, we are...

933
00:48:04,175 --> 00:48:06,846
Mom! Ant found him!

934
00:48:06,982 --> 00:48:08,343
- Oh, good.
- Oh.

935
00:48:08,478 --> 00:48:10,183
Good boy. Good boy.

936
00:48:12,621 --> 00:48:14,824
- What's he saying?
- I think he's trying to say

937
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:16,520
he's sad
you're leaving because...

938
00:48:16,655 --> 00:48:18,855
'cause he wanted to show you
the chickens.

939
00:48:20,762 --> 00:48:22,363
- Can we?
- Uh...

940
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:24,859
Hey, you remember that time,
the first time you came to stay

941
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:26,641
and you tried to leave 'cause
you flipped out in the night

942
00:48:26,665 --> 00:48:28,799
and you didn't say goodbye?

943
00:48:28,935 --> 00:48:31,303
Eh?

944
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,409
They look sweet together,
don't they?

945
00:48:40,914 --> 00:48:43,117
We wanted another.

946
00:48:43,816 --> 00:48:46,555
But...

947
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,854
after two miscarriages...

948
00:48:50,523 --> 00:48:55,195
Life can be
so fucking unfair. Sorry.

949
00:48:58,098 --> 00:49:00,162
I don't understand.

950
00:49:00,298 --> 00:49:02,635
Ant, I can't read it.

951
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:13,642
- How are your eggs coming along?
- Good.

952
00:49:14,211 --> 00:49:17,052
Let's see.

953
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,788
Oh, these are great.

954
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,517
I think, Agnes,

955
00:49:22,653 --> 00:49:25,526
that yours is the best.

956
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:29,594
Oh.

957
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,264
♪ Close your eyes ♪

958
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,138

965

But it made no sense.

966
00:50:02,194 --> 00:50:04,466
It was gobbledygook.

967
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:05,929
Can I see it?

968
00:50:06,064 --> 00:50:08,466
He ate it.

969
00:50:10,306 --> 00:50:12,234
I think
he's going through a lot,

970
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,176
and we need to be kind.

971
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,273
- Okay?
- No, something's not right with him.

972
00:50:16,408 --> 00:50:17,606
Okay, Agnes,

973
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:19,210
sometimes it's okay
to think things,

974
00:50:19,345 --> 00:50:20,814
but you can't actually say them.

975
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:22,244
Mom, it's not normal.

976
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,545
Agnes, love,

977
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:26,653
do you want to
come help me peel these?

978
00:50:32,126 --> 00:50:34,393
Some nice carrots, hmm?

979
00:50:49,008 --> 00:50:50,741
Sorry, man.

980
00:50:50,877 --> 00:50:52,043
Oh.

981
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:53,945
No, here, give me that.

982
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:56,583
Here we go.

983
00:50:59,816 --> 00:51:02,055
It's not even about
the kill for me.

984
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,620
It's always been about the hunt.

985
00:51:04,756 --> 00:51:06,657
You know?
Getting them in the crosshairs.

986
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:10,194
Luring the fish onto the hook.
That's the game.

987
00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:13,168
That's what I live for.

988
00:51:17,469 --> 00:51:20,439
Look, maybe this isn't my place,

989
00:51:20,574 --> 00:51:24,074
but last night,
we heard you two shouting.

990
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:25,510
I'm sorry, man.

991
00:51:25,645 --> 00:51:28,144
You know, cheating is
really hard to get over.

992
00:51:31,053 --> 00:51:32,053
Louise didn't actually.

993
00:51:32,186 --> 00:51:35,520
It was... it was just text.

994
00:51:36,954 --> 00:51:39,891
Mm. Whatever she did,
thoughtcrime or whatever,

995
00:51:40,027 --> 00:51:42,296
just... who cares?

996
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:44,831
All this...

997
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:48,236
all this in here...

998
00:51:50,139 --> 00:51:52,537
That's gonna eat you alive.

999
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,508
You got to let it out.

1000
00:51:58,347 --> 00:52:00,776
Will you let me
show you something?

1001
00:52:58,067 --> 00:52:59,771
I'm starving!

1002
00:52:59,906 --> 00:53:01,653
- And you do it four times.
- Could eat a horse!

1003
00:53:01,677 --> 00:53:03,023
And then... Do you want me
to show you the first part?

1004
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:04,408
Could eat a Ciara.

1005
00:53:04,543 --> 00:53:06,312
So it's like that. One, two...

1006
00:53:06,448 --> 00:53:09,582
Oy, oy, come on.
Careful, kids. All right?

1007
00:53:09,717 --> 00:53:12,046
You knock over one of
your mother's sculptures

1008
00:53:12,181 --> 00:53:14,221
and there will be hell to pay.

1009
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,677
- Have you shown them these?
- No.

1010
00:53:15,722 --> 00:53:17,758
Guys, have you seen this?
This is Ciara's.

1011
00:53:17,893 --> 00:53:19,490
One of many.

1012
00:53:19,626 --> 00:53:22,095
It's called <i>Mother's Love.</i>

1013
00:53:22,231 --> 00:53:23,460
- Wow.
- Oh.

1014
00:53:23,596 --> 00:53:24,871
- Yeah? Yeah, one of many.
- Oh, God.

1015
00:53:24,895 --> 00:53:27,229
- Ciara, those are stunning.
- Wow.

1016
00:53:27,365 --> 00:53:29,448
- I mean, it's just a hobby.
- Hey, don't put yourself down.

1017
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:31,032
That's my job.
Louise, thank you so much

1018
00:53:31,069 --> 00:53:32,782
- for helping with the cooking.
- Yeah. Of course. - Paddy.

1019
00:53:32,806 --> 00:53:35,476
Mom. Mom. Can Ant and I
show you our dance?

1020
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,216
- Ye...
- Oh. Maybe after lunch, sweetie.

1021
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,914
Actually, Agnes, could you set
the table for me, please?

1022
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,482
Oh, yeah. Go on, Agnes.

1023
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:44,249
Show Ciara how good you are
at setting the table.

1024
00:53:45,652 --> 00:53:47,081
- Ooh.
- Oh, God. - What happened?

1025
00:53:47,217 --> 00:53:48,764
- Honey, honey, run it under the tap.
- Mm, mm, mm.

1026
00:53:48,788 --> 00:53:50,537
- You okay?
- You all right? - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1027
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,641
Hey, um, uh, Paddy, can you
come take a look at this?

1028
00:53:52,758 --> 00:53:54,593
Uh, yeah, sure.

1029
00:53:54,729 --> 00:53:56,798
Thank God there's a doctor
in the house.

1030
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:58,261
I'm not a doctor.

1031
00:53:58,397 --> 00:53:59,928
- What?
- Wait.

1032
00:54:00,064 --> 00:54:02,263
Well, didn't you say
you were a doctor?

1033
00:54:02,398 --> 00:54:04,369
Did I?

1034
00:54:04,504 --> 00:54:06,935
In-in Italy, you...

1035
00:54:08,439 --> 00:54:09,740
Look.

1036
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:12,843
Uh, sometimes
when I meet new people, I...

1037
00:54:12,978 --> 00:54:14,818
I'll get a little bit
self-conscious, you know?

1038
00:54:14,848 --> 00:54:17,482
- He just wants to make a good impression.
- Yeah.

1039
00:54:17,618 --> 00:54:19,647
What do you,
what do you do, then?

1040
00:54:19,783 --> 00:54:21,484
Well, I don't do anything.

1041
00:54:21,619 --> 00:54:23,118
Like, anything?

1042
00:54:23,254 --> 00:54:26,128
No. Well, I don't work.
I don't believe in it.

1043
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:27,705
- Oh.
- Yeah, we get by, right?

1044
00:54:27,729 --> 00:54:29,692
- Mm. Mm.
- Yeah, we sell a bit of marijuana,

1045
00:54:29,828 --> 00:54:31,500
drop a bit of cider
to the locals.

1046
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:33,315
Let's get that fixed.
Where's the plasters?

1047
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:34,398
Oh.

1048
00:54:41,772 --> 00:54:43,944
Oh, my God.

1049
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,512
Look at their faces.

1050
00:54:45,648 --> 00:54:47,709
You should have
taken a picture.

1051
00:54:47,844 --> 00:54:50,251
Of course I'm a bloody doctor.

1052
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,454
- Oh!
- We totally had them.

1053
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,334
- We totally had them, right?
- Well, yeah, I mean...

1054
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:55,785
You fucking asshole.

1055
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,386
Come on. How else
could we afford all this?

1056
00:54:58,521 --> 00:54:59,487
Come here.

1057
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,972
- Here, try that.
- What is this?

1058
00:55:03,996 --> 00:55:05,738
They say it smells like
a rugby club locker room.

1059
00:55:05,762 --> 00:55:07,661
Mmm!

1060
00:55:07,797 --> 00:55:09,063
Yeah, right?

1061
00:55:09,198 --> 00:55:10,912
Agnes, love, you have to eat
your vegetables.

1062
00:55:10,936 --> 00:55:12,340
...I'm increasingly finding

1063
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,746
the simple things in life
bring you joy.

1064
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:15,169
Eat your greens, sweetheart.

1065
00:55:15,304 --> 00:55:18,610
And, Agnes, we don't chew
with our mouths open.

1066
00:55:18,746 --> 00:55:21,482
Gorgonzola,
Camembert, Emmental.

1067
00:55:21,617 --> 00:55:24,285
You can keep it.
Stinking Bishop is number one.

1068
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:26,654
- Never had it.
- Get it. - Agnes?

1069
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,154
Please, could you stop
telling my daughter what to do?

1070
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:30,389
Mmm!

1071
00:55:30,524 --> 00:55:32,055
But she needs to be told, so...

1072
00:55:32,191 --> 00:55:33,602
Yes, but you're not her mother.
I'm her mother.

1073
00:55:33,626 --> 00:55:35,057
Yeah. But you do agree, right?

1074
00:55:35,193 --> 00:55:36,669
That it's disgusting
eating with my mouth open.

1075
00:55:36,693 --> 00:55:38,193
Okay.

1076
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:40,531
Yeah. But it's for
her parents to tell her.

1077
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,404
- Is that the rule?
- Yeah.

1078
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:45,537
Mm. No, Ciara grew up
in the care system.

1079
00:55:45,673 --> 00:55:47,437
All the kids
parenting each other,

1080
00:55:47,573 --> 00:55:48,905
doing what they were told.

1081
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:52,107
I mean, she doesn't know
"the rules." Sorry.

1082
00:55:52,242 --> 00:55:54,012
I didn't mean anything
by it, Louise.

1083
00:55:54,147 --> 00:55:56,157
To be fair, though, you
did cross a line for Louise.

1084
00:55:56,181 --> 00:55:57,624
You don't criticize
other people's children.

1085
00:55:57,648 --> 00:55:59,253
You should say sorry.

1086
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,385
It's okay.

1087
00:56:00,387 --> 00:56:01,387
I'm sorry, Louise.

1088
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:03,892
And to Agnes.

1089
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,124
I'm sorry, Agnes.

1090
00:56:05,259 --> 00:56:06,890
It's okay.

1091
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:10,124
Louise?

1092
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:14,403
There anything
you'd like to say?

1093
00:56:18,569 --> 00:56:21,007
I-I maybe...

1094
00:56:21,142 --> 00:56:22,538
overreacted.

1095
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:24,809
Off we go. It's all good.

1096
00:56:24,945 --> 00:56:26,481
It's all good.
A healthy disagreement.

1097
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:30,085
Teach our kids we can be honest
with each other.

1098
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:32,649
Right, top up.

1099
00:56:33,252 --> 00:56:36,151
Agnes, um, why don't
you and Ant show us your, um,

- Yes.
- Sure.

- Yep.

This is about doing
what is right, okay?

1191
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,372
I mean, y-you should be
offering your son

1192
00:59:37,403 --> 00:59:39,312
some love while he's crying,
not shouting at him.

1193

He's just a kid.

1194
00:59:40,904 --> 00:59:42,237
Just let him dance.

1195
00:59:42,373 --> 00:59:44,507

Ant, go to your room.

standing up to me,

01:00:45,803 --> 01:00:50,177
He'll be so angry, and it would
be better for me and for Ant.

1216
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:51,579
Wait, is it that bad?

1217
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:53,414
If you could just
let him save face.

1218
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:55,011
Like a reminder on your phone

1219
01:00:55,147 --> 01:00:58,819
of an appointment
you can't miss.

1220
01:01:47,429 --> 01:01:50,299
God, he's rubbish, isn't he?

1221
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:11,221
Ant, what is it?

1222
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:57,899
That's your...

1223
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,470
Oh, my God.

1224
01:04:37,805 --> 01:04:40,304
Oh, my God.

1225
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:59,895
I need to get my parents alone.
They'll know what to do.

1226
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:18,045
Dad. Play catch?

1227
01:05:18,912 --> 01:05:21,213
When I finish my coffee.

1228
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,460
Oh, fuck.

1229
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,459
All right, shithead.

1230
01:05:35,858 --> 01:05:39,198
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

1231
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,973
What the fuck?

1232
01:05:48,137 --> 01:05:50,105
Oh, coffee.

1233
01:05:50,241 --> 01:05:52,310
That's a good lad.

1234
01:05:59,015 --> 01:06:01,088
Show me.

1235
01:06:05,562 --> 01:06:08,557
Show me love.

1236
01:06:25,574 --> 01:06:28,577
You're smelling stale, boy.

1237
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:34,486
Oh, fuck.

1238
01:06:37,819 --> 01:06:41,595
Oh, now you want a piggyback.

1239
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,391
You cheeky sod.

1240
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:47,567
Actually, it'll show everyone
we're still friends. Come on.

1241
01:06:47,702 --> 01:06:50,396
Come on. Hop on.

1242
01:06:50,532 --> 01:06:52,266
Oh, fucking hell.

1243
01:06:52,402 --> 01:06:55,069
What have you been eating?

1244
01:06:55,205 --> 01:06:57,544
Come on.

1245
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:27,471
Hey.

1246
01:07:28,172 --> 01:07:30,478
I am so sorry.

1247
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:31,905
I-I just...

1248
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:37,812
I drank way too much,
and I was way out of line.

1249
01:07:40,286 --> 01:07:43,454
I think we all drank too much.

1250
01:07:44,793 --> 01:07:46,056
Where's Agnes?

1251
01:07:46,192 --> 01:07:48,023
Here she is.

1252
01:07:48,158 --> 01:07:49,763
Hey, honey.

1253
01:07:49,898 --> 01:07:51,325
You okay?

1254
01:07:51,461 --> 01:07:54,069
Aggie, what's the matter?

1255
01:07:55,369 --> 01:07:57,031
- Did you cut yourself?
- Oh.

1256
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:59,335
Oh. No.

1257
01:07:59,471 --> 01:08:01,838
Uh, okay, that's fine. Come on.

1258
01:08:01,974 --> 01:08:03,419
- What's going on?
- I'm gonna take you to the bathroom.

1259
01:08:03,443 --> 01:08:06,378
- She got her period.
- Oh.

1260
01:08:07,746 --> 01:08:10,080
Oh. Oh, this is
all totally normal.

1261
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:12,549
Mom, no, it's not.

1262
01:08:14,818 --> 01:08:17,317
Ah! Listen, I need a beer.
Do you want one?

1263
01:08:17,452 --> 01:08:19,287
No, I'm good.

1264
01:08:19,422 --> 01:08:21,154
Whoa! All right.

1265
01:08:21,289 --> 01:08:24,524
All right. Where's this
newfound enthusiasm come from?

1266
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:27,468
Five more minutes, all right?

1267
01:08:28,766 --> 01:08:31,370
Go on, Ben.
Put some heat in that arm.

1268
01:08:32,338 --> 01:08:35,638
Whoop! Fuck. Wow.

1269
01:08:51,653 --> 01:08:53,921
We're gonna leave, right?

1270
01:08:54,557 --> 01:08:56,962
Aggie, we're gonna leave.

1271
01:08:57,098 --> 01:08:59,967
We just need to stay calm.

1272
01:09:00,103 --> 01:09:01,300
- How can I stay calm?
- Okay.

1273
01:09:01,435 --> 01:09:03,164
What about Ant?
We need to take Ant.

1274
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,634
Aggie? Listen.

1275
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:06,412
I need you to be brave, okay?
Can you be brave?

1276
01:09:06,436 --> 01:09:08,036
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1277
01:09:08,172 --> 01:09:10,307
You're gonna stay here,
and you're gonna sit tight,

1278
01:09:10,443 --> 01:09:12,172
and you're gonna lock the door.

1279
01:09:12,307 --> 01:09:14,007
Yeah?

1280
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:16,045
- Mom...
- Aggie.

1281
01:09:16,181 --> 01:09:17,881
Lock the door.

1282
01:09:18,016 --> 01:09:19,550
Okay?

1283
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:37,503
Everything all right?

1284
01:09:37,639 --> 01:09:39,312
Yeah, it'll be fine.

1285
01:09:39,336 --> 01:09:41,635
She just, uh...

1286
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:44,779
got herself into
a bit of a state.

1287
01:09:44,915 --> 01:09:46,514
Ben, she asked for you.

1288
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:49,043
He's always better with her
when she's like this.

1289
01:09:49,179 --> 01:09:50,515
Hmm.

1290
01:09:50,651 --> 01:09:52,719
- Sorry about this, guys.
- No, no, no, no.

1291
01:09:52,854 --> 01:09:53,854
No worries.

1292
01:09:53,953 --> 01:09:55,487
Hey.

1293
01:09:56,222 --> 01:09:57,858
Can we do anything?

1294
01:09:57,994 --> 01:10:00,090
No. It'll be fine.

1295
01:10:00,225 --> 01:10:01,955
Don't worry.

1296
01:10:14,803 --> 01:10:16,544
Okay.

1297
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:18,009
Okay.

1298
01:10:18,611 --> 01:10:21,015
Louise.
Louise, what are you doing?

1299
01:10:21,151 --> 01:10:22,357
Everything okay in there?

1300
01:10:22,381 --> 01:10:24,015
Yeah, we're all good.

1301
01:10:24,151 --> 01:10:25,418
Anything we can get you?

1302
01:10:25,553 --> 01:10:28,388
No, no, no.
We'll just be a minute.

1303
01:10:29,752 --> 01:10:31,955
We can't let on.

1304
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:33,326
Yeah?

1305
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:35,057
We can't look stressed
or scared.

1306
01:10:35,193 --> 01:10:37,665
We just have to go out there
and be completely normal, okay?

1307
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,134
We've been pretending
it's normal since we got here.

1308
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:43,337
This is so not normal.

1309
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:46,268
I can't do this.
I can't go out there.

1310
01:10:48,275 --> 01:10:49,739
Okay. You're right.

1311
01:10:49,874 --> 01:10:51,545
You're right, baby.
It's not normal.

1312
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,047
And you don't have to pretend
it's normal.

1313
01:10:55,182 --> 01:10:57,283
I think that we tell them

1314
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,715
that you had
your first period, yeah?

1315
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:01,785
And-and-and that
you're super freaked out

1316
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,794
and that even your daddy
couldn't calm you down,

1317
01:11:03,818 --> 01:11:05,692
so we just need to get you home.

1318
01:11:05,827 --> 01:11:07,323
Okay?

1319
01:11:07,459 --> 01:11:09,589
Oh, no, no, baby, baby.

1320
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,091
All those tears are good.

1321
01:11:11,226 --> 01:11:13,801
All those anxious thoughts,
you can show them.

1322
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:15,229
- Okay?
- Okay.

1323
01:11:15,364 --> 01:11:16,364
Okay.

1324
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,739
Okay.

1325
01:11:33,717 --> 01:11:36,357
Yeah, all right. See you soon.

1326
01:11:38,591 --> 01:11:40,761
- Hey, how is she?
- Hi.

1327
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:44,193
Oh, she's, uh, well, she's
pretty freaked out.

1328
01:11:44,329 --> 01:11:45,496
Oh, bless her.

1329
01:11:45,632 --> 01:11:47,166
- Yeah.
- It's a big day. - Yeah.

1330
01:11:47,301 --> 01:11:48,700
Yeah, yeah.

1331
01:11:48,835 --> 01:11:52,703
She's just totally overwhelmed
and-and, uh...

1332
01:11:52,838 --> 01:11:55,910
I think it might be best
if we got her home.

1333
01:11:56,046 --> 01:11:58,312
- Yeah.
- Oh. Okay.

1334
01:11:58,448 --> 01:12:01,014
Well, does she want
to lie down or...?

1335
01:12:01,149 --> 01:12:02,680
No. I-I-I think she just,

1336
01:12:02,816 --> 01:12:05,050
she just wants her own bed,
right, sweetie?

1337
01:12:05,186 --> 01:12:06,653
Yeah, I mean, I-I...

1338
01:12:06,788 --> 01:12:08,265
She'll probably just sleep
in the car, to be honest.

1339
01:12:08,289 --> 01:12:09,515
Aw. It's okay, love.

1340
01:12:11,227 --> 01:12:12,525
- Oh.
- Oh.

1341
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,796
She's just feeling
a little self-conscious.

1342
01:12:14,931 --> 01:12:15,931
There's no need.

1343
01:12:16,058 --> 01:12:18,964
- Perfectly natural.
- Yeah.

1344
01:12:19,433 --> 01:12:21,694
Yeah, you're not a girl anymore.

1345
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:23,296
You're a woman now.

1346
01:12:24,165 --> 01:12:27,709
Must have been
a bit of a shock for you.

1347
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,938
Out there.

1348
01:12:31,811 --> 01:12:34,281
- Would you like a drop of brandy?
- No.

1349
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:36,882
I think
we're gonna hit the road.

1350
01:12:37,251 --> 01:12:39,519
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

1351
01:12:39,654 --> 01:12:41,251
You know, we-we had
a really great time.

1352
01:12:41,387 --> 01:12:44,056
Well... well, I hope so.

1353
01:12:44,192 --> 01:12:45,656
I know we can both be...

1354
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:47,270
A bit much.

1355
01:12:47,294 --> 01:12:48,494
Oh, God. No, no. Really.

1356
01:12:48,629 --> 01:12:50,229
- I mean, you-you guys have been...
- Aw.

1357
01:12:50,298 --> 01:12:52,866
Just a breath of fresh air.

1358
01:12:54,129 --> 01:12:58,373
Oh, well, that is
very sweet of you to say.

1359
01:13:10,683 --> 01:13:11,813
You're sure I can't quickly

1360
01:13:11,949 --> 01:13:13,717
make you some sandwiches
for the journey?

1361
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:15,315
Oh, that's so kind of you,

1362
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:18,525
but we'll, uh,
we'll just stop on the way.

1363
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:24,993
Oh, shit. The tire.

1364
01:13:25,128 --> 01:13:26,708
We'll just drive on it.

1365
01:13:26,732 --> 01:13:28,199
No, they're gonna see it.

1366
01:13:28,335 --> 01:13:29,335
We'll be gone.

1367
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:32,034
But they have to open the gate.

1368
01:13:33,104 --> 01:13:36,871
All right, well, uh, again,
thanks so much.

1369
01:13:37,007 --> 01:13:38,476
- You're all set?
- Yep.

1370
01:13:38,612 --> 01:13:40,512
- Yeah. Great.
- Yeah.

1371
01:13:40,647 --> 01:13:42,376
Oh, you're kidding.

1372
01:13:42,512 --> 01:13:44,146
Oh, no.

1373
01:13:44,282 --> 01:13:45,548
Ugh.

1374
01:13:45,683 --> 01:13:48,489
That is bad luck. Come see.

1375
01:13:51,227 --> 01:13:53,391
Yeah. Yeah, you got a nail.

1376
01:13:53,526 --> 01:13:57,092
That is really, really bad luck.

1377
01:13:57,227 --> 01:14:01,268
Well, um, you have a phone?
I can call the AA.

1378
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:03,403
Behave. You don't need the AA.

1379
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:07,170
I can plug this in a jiffy.
Come on.

1380
01:14:07,506 --> 01:14:09,242
No, it's fine.

1381
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:10,772
W-We got an annual membership.

1382
01:14:10,908 --> 01:14:12,205
It's the least I could do, man.

1383
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:14,245
Come on. Come give me a hand
with the kit.

1384
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,110
Won't be a tick.

1385
01:14:24,687 --> 01:14:26,890
Just around here.

1386
01:15:06,432 --> 01:15:08,068
Do me a favor.

1387
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:09,497
Grab that jack.

1388
01:15:27,718 --> 01:15:29,689
Right.

1389
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:32,556
Well, why don't we call it, uh,

1390
01:15:32,691 --> 01:15:34,855
90 for labor, 70 for parts.

1391
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:36,262
Paddy.

1392
01:15:37,429 --> 01:15:38,630
All right, gang.

1393
01:15:38,766 --> 01:15:40,864
- Let's hit the road.
- Yeah.

1394
01:15:40,999 --> 01:15:44,731
Agnes, you, uh,
got everything you need?

1395
01:15:44,866 --> 01:15:46,671
Yep.

1396
01:15:46,807 --> 01:15:48,936
Yeah.

1397
01:15:49,071 --> 01:15:50,837
You absolutely sure?

1398
01:15:50,973 --> 01:15:53,845
- Mom.
- Mm-hmm?

1399
01:15:56,714 --> 01:15:58,413
Um...

1400
01:15:58,549 --> 01:15:59,684
Oh, no.

1401
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,483
How the hell
did he get up there?

1402
01:16:01,619 --> 01:16:03,757
Ant, you do that?

1403
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,892
I just want to be at home.

1404
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:08,728
Well, you can't leave
without Hoppy, right, mate?

1405
01:16:09,297 --> 01:16:11,531
No, we can't.

1406
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:12,987
I was actually doing
the guttering

1407
01:16:13,095 --> 01:16:14,734
just before you guys arrived.

1408
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,630
You know what, mate?
You're taller than I am.

1409
01:16:16,701 --> 01:16:18,234
Longer arms and all that.

1410
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:22,302
I'll hold the bottom.
You get up there and grab it.

1411
01:16:37,493 --> 01:16:40,126
- All good?
- Yeah.

1412
01:16:52,406 --> 01:16:53,536
Whoop.

1413
01:16:53,672 --> 01:16:55,035
Sorry, mate. It slipped.

1414
01:16:55,171 --> 01:16:57,238
Don't worry, I've got you.

1415
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:13,755
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Careful, mate. Careful.

1416
01:17:13,891 --> 01:17:15,128
That's on you.

1417
01:17:15,264 --> 01:17:16,689
You all right?

1418
01:17:16,824 --> 01:17:18,292
Whoa.

1419
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:27,807
Oh, no.

1420
01:17:28,906 --> 01:17:30,743
Oh, I'm so sorry, Agnes.

1421
01:17:30,878 --> 01:17:34,110
I think an animal
must have got to him.

1422
01:17:37,484 --> 01:17:39,051
You all right?

1423
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:40,015
Mm.

1424
01:17:40,016 --> 01:17:41,756
It's okay.

1425
01:17:41,891 --> 01:17:44,952
We'll get him home
and get him all fixed up.

1426
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:46,319
Well, thank you for coming.

1427
01:17:46,455 --> 01:17:48,562
- Oh, say goodbye to Agnes.
- Bye, Ciara.

1428
01:17:48,698 --> 01:17:52,029
Come here, big man.
Hug it up. Yeah.

1429
01:17:52,999 --> 01:17:54,228
We won't leave you.

1430
01:17:54,364 --> 01:17:56,163
You be safe on those roads,
all right?

1431
01:17:56,299 --> 01:17:57,735
- Ant?
- Hey, you don't get away.

1432
01:17:57,870 --> 01:18:00,006
Come here.

1433
01:18:02,939 --> 01:18:04,404
Yeah.

1434
01:18:11,013 --> 01:18:12,280
All right.

1435
01:18:12,415 --> 01:18:15,716
Well, next time
you guys are in London,

1436
01:18:15,852 --> 01:18:16,986
just give us a...

1437
01:18:17,122 --> 01:18:18,485
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

1438
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:20,332
Yeah, you guys let us know
when you get there.

1439
01:18:20,356 --> 01:18:23,764
You could send me a...
little text.

1440
01:18:28,699 --> 01:18:30,766
Absolutely.

1441
01:18:31,035 --> 01:18:32,867
Except you won't, will you?

1442
01:18:33,003 --> 01:18:35,069
I'm sorry?

1443
01:18:35,672 --> 01:18:39,813
You're still not being
completely honest, are you?

1444
01:18:46,147 --> 01:18:48,514
No, we're not.

1445
01:18:49,217 --> 01:18:50,783
We've been lying to you.

1446
01:18:50,918 --> 01:18:53,453
I mean, we're not gonna
invite you to London, are we?

1447
01:18:53,588 --> 01:18:55,624
We're never gonna
see you again because

1448
01:18:55,759 --> 01:18:57,698
Ben and I,

1449
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:00,295
we won't be together.

1450
01:19:01,702 --> 01:19:05,366
I betrayed Ben with someone else

1451
01:19:05,502 --> 01:19:10,605
because I was deeply unhappy
in my marriage.

1452
01:19:11,441 --> 01:19:13,439
And, uh, I've apologized,

1453
01:19:13,574 --> 01:19:15,409
but it has become clear
this weekend

1454
01:19:15,545 --> 01:19:21,921
that maybe Ben and I
can't get past this.

1455
01:19:25,689 --> 01:19:27,355
Wow.

1456
01:19:28,494 --> 01:19:30,162
Honesty.

1457
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:31,591
Finally.

1458
01:19:32,728 --> 01:19:36,403
We believe honesty is the
first step to fixing things,

1459
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:37,964
and we think you can.

1460
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,907
Ben told me he wants to.

1461
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:43,837
Ben loves you very much, Louise.

1462
01:19:45,576 --> 01:19:47,773
I'm sorry. I don't know
why I said all that.

1463
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:49,312
No.

1464
01:19:49,447 --> 01:19:51,914
No, it's good to get it
all out.

1465
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:53,448
I think we should go.

1466
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:55,714
Yeah, we'll send you
the bill for the therapy.

1467
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:58,488
And we'll see you both
in London.

1468
01:19:58,623 --> 01:20:00,127
Yeah.

1469
01:20:00,763 --> 01:20:05,261
Ant, could you get
the gate for us?

1470
01:20:07,797 --> 01:20:09,529
Ant!

1471
01:20:14,073 --> 01:20:15,507
No need, mate.

1472
01:20:27,686 --> 01:20:29,549
All right.

1473
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:45,599
All right, everybody,
just stay nice and calm.

1474
01:20:45,734 --> 01:20:48,035
- What about Ant?
- We're gonna come back for him.

1475
01:20:48,171 --> 01:20:49,703
We can't leave him.

1476
01:20:49,839 --> 01:20:51,973
Baby, if we don't get away,
we can't help him.

1477
01:20:52,109 --> 01:20:54,047
Okay? You understand that?

1478
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:57,810
All right. Just smile and wave.

1479
01:20:57,946 --> 01:21:00,283
Bye.

1480
01:21:10,191 --> 01:21:11,392
Dad! Dad, stop!

1481
01:21:11,527 --> 01:21:13,796
- What?
- He-he threw Ant in the lake!

1482
01:21:13,931 --> 01:21:16,101
Shit!

1483
01:21:18,469 --> 01:21:21,068
Goddamn it!
All right, take the wheel.

1484
01:21:21,204 --> 01:21:23,636
- Just drive!
- Ben!

1485
01:21:31,313 --> 01:21:33,448
Mom, stop!

1486
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:45,361
Ant!

1487
01:22:09,952 --> 01:22:13,021
What do we want here?
We want... pay and transfer?

1488
01:22:13,156 --> 01:22:15,589
200 grand. Fucking tasty.

1489
01:22:15,724 --> 01:22:19,428
Uh, make transfer,
pay new payee and done.

1490
01:22:19,563 --> 01:22:22,465
You're never gonna
get away with this.

1491
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,271
Mike's already got a buyer
for your car.

1492
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:28,709
Next week, you're gonna send
an email to your landlord

1493
01:22:28,844 --> 01:22:30,442
saying you're moving home.

1494
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:32,588
You'll send another to the
school saying the same thing.

1495
01:22:32,612 --> 01:22:34,572
You don't know your neighbors,
got no fucking job.

1496
01:22:34,646 --> 01:22:37,681
Nobody's gonna miss you
in a place like London.

1497
01:22:38,317 --> 01:22:39,887
Look, you can have
whatever you want.

1498
01:22:40,022 --> 01:22:41,688
Just please don't hurt
my family.

1499
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:43,103
Oh, your perfect fucking family?

1500
01:22:43,157 --> 01:22:44,853
You don't even love 'em, mate.

1501
01:22:44,989 --> 01:22:47,304
If you did, you'd have left him
in the pond with his parents.

1502
01:22:47,328 --> 01:22:49,090
Don't worry, mate,
you'll be with them soon.

1503
01:22:49,225 --> 01:22:53,297
Full amount. Transfer.

1504
01:22:57,201 --> 01:22:59,699
Why are you doing this?

1505
01:23:01,842 --> 01:23:04,539
Because you let us.

1506
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:10,615
You fucking people.

1507
01:23:10,884 --> 01:23:13,148
With your gas-free Teslas

1508
01:23:13,284 --> 01:23:16,216
and your... line-caught tuna.

1509
01:23:16,852 --> 01:23:20,289
Giving yourself a gold star
because you made friends

1510
01:23:20,425 --> 01:23:23,459
with a couple
with a disabled kid.

1511
01:23:26,097 --> 01:23:29,201
Makes me fucking sick.

1512
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:32,702
Agnes, love.

1513
01:23:33,171 --> 01:23:35,067
Roll that sleeve up, yeah?

1514
01:23:36,037 --> 01:23:38,812
It's-it's all right.
It's all right.

1515
01:23:38,948 --> 01:23:40,580
It's just veterinary ketamine.

1516
01:23:40,716 --> 01:23:41,946
Not gonna kill her.

1517
01:23:42,081 --> 01:23:43,680
It's better to sedate.

1518
01:23:43,816 --> 01:23:46,982
Otherwise, they wriggle around
and make a right bloody mess.

1519
01:23:47,117 --> 01:23:48,485
Ant will tell you.

1520
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:50,149
It's just, except he can't.

1521
01:23:50,285 --> 01:23:52,551
Ciara, please.

1522
01:23:52,686 --> 01:23:54,725
No, you can't let him do this.

1523
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:59,462
It was her
who first wanted a kid.

1524
01:23:59,598 --> 01:24:02,733
Just never seems to work out,
does it, love?

1525
01:24:02,868 --> 01:24:04,338
Maybe this time.

1526
01:24:04,473 --> 01:24:05,966
Yeah.

1527
01:24:10,108 --> 01:24:11,139
Look, Paddy, please.

1528
01:24:11,275 --> 01:24:13,377
Hands behind your back.

1529
01:24:30,425 --> 01:24:31,825
Louise.

1530
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,608
Louise, please don't leave me
here with him.

1531
01:24:33,632 --> 01:24:35,272
- Ant!
- You've seen how he hurts me.

1532
01:24:35,365 --> 01:24:36,564
I'm a victim here, too.

1533
01:24:36,699 --> 01:24:38,397
Please, please, please.
I was his first!

1534
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:40,073
I was Agnes's age!

1535
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:42,636
Please, you've got
to believe me!

1536
01:24:42,772 --> 01:24:44,172
Please don't leave me here
with him!

1537
01:24:44,238 --> 01:24:45,474
Fuck her.

1538
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:47,614
- Come on. Come on.
- Please! Louise, please!

1539
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,545
Come on.

1540
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:52,247
Get in.

1541
01:25:00,994 --> 01:25:01,994
Oh!

1542
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:03,625
Shit. Who is it?

1543
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,795
- Shit! Shit!
- Oh, my God!

1544
01:25:12,367 --> 01:25:13,368
In the house!

1545
01:25:13,503 --> 01:25:15,340
There's a landline in the house!

1546
01:25:19,814 --> 01:25:21,709
Bolt the shutters!

1547
01:25:28,354 --> 01:25:30,351
- The fuck!
- Paddy.

1548
01:25:30,486 --> 01:25:31,486
Fuck off!

1549
01:25:31,553 --> 01:25:33,288
This is your fucking fault.

1550
01:25:33,423 --> 01:25:35,461
You nearly fucking shot me!

1551
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:40,365
Baby, I need you with me.

1552
01:25:52,406 --> 01:25:54,275
Paddy, mate!

1553
01:25:54,544 --> 01:25:55,915
Mate, they're in your house.

1554
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:57,448
They're going nowhere.

1555
01:25:57,583 --> 01:25:59,083
Mate, I don't mind
providing services

1556
01:25:59,218 --> 01:26:01,219
and taking my share, but this...

1557
01:26:01,355 --> 01:26:03,817
- They see your face, Mike?
- Yeah.

1558
01:26:03,952 --> 01:26:07,425
Then you are in this,
you like it or not.

1559
01:26:07,961 --> 01:26:09,559
Okay.

1560
01:26:09,694 --> 01:26:12,731
Um, um, uh, telephone,
telephone! Come on.

1561
01:26:12,866 --> 01:26:14,567
Thank you.

1562
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:16,701
Um...

1563
01:26:16,836 --> 01:26:18,030
Okay.

1564
01:26:18,165 --> 01:26:21,366
Oh, no, fuck!
It's, um, uh, nine-nine-nine.

1565
01:26:26,208 --> 01:26:27,678
Anything?

1566
01:26:27,813 --> 01:26:30,316
- Uh-huh.
- Emergency. Which service?

1567
01:26:32,647 --> 01:26:34,148
What? What?

1568
01:26:35,418 --> 01:26:36,418
It's gone dead.

1569
01:26:36,551 --> 01:26:39,358
- Um...
- Fuck.

1570
01:26:42,127 --> 01:26:44,264
Okay.

1571
01:26:47,801 --> 01:26:49,536
Ben?

1572
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:50,898
Look.

1573
01:26:51,034 --> 01:26:52,948
If we got out there
and then down into the woods,

1574
01:26:52,972 --> 01:26:55,317
- I mean, in the dark, they...
- No. L-Louise, they have guns.

1575
01:26:55,341 --> 01:26:56,970
Okay? They-they hunt at night.

1576
01:26:57,105 --> 01:27:00,308
Okay, if they get inside,
they are gonna kill us.

1577
01:27:00,577 --> 01:27:02,478
Louise, I don't know what to do.

1578
01:27:02,613 --> 01:27:04,043
I don't know.

1579
01:27:04,179 --> 01:27:05,951
I... I don't know.
I'm so sorry, Louise.

1580
01:27:06,086 --> 01:27:07,251
I-I should... I... Fuck.

1581
01:27:07,387 --> 01:27:08,851
I-I should've listened to you.

1582
01:27:08,986 --> 01:27:10,433
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay!

1583
01:27:10,457 --> 01:27:11,597
Like, I should have
not let us come.

1584
01:27:11,621 --> 01:27:12,797
I... We shouldn't have stayed.

1585
01:27:12,821 --> 01:27:15,422
Ben! Stop it!

1586
01:27:15,558 --> 01:27:17,424
Listen to me.

1587
01:27:17,559 --> 01:27:19,831
Look at your daughter.

1588
01:27:20,133 --> 01:27:22,632
Your family needs you.

1589
01:27:29,938 --> 01:27:31,543
Dad, I don't like it.

1590
01:27:31,678 --> 01:27:33,478
- Okay.
- Look, it's okay, honey.

1591
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:36,277
They're just trying
to scare us. All right?

1592
01:27:36,412 --> 01:27:38,013
It's okay, guys.

Louise. Louise.

1603
01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:25,731
Look, the thatched roof
above the barn.

1604
01:28:25,866 --> 01:28:29,101
If we could light that on fire,
then someone might see it.

1605
01:28:29,236 --> 01:28:30,899
Oh, my gosh.

1606
01:28:31,034 --> 01:28:33,603
- Is it gonna work?
- Oh, God, I don't know.

1607
01:28:33,739 --> 01:28:36,205
It's 150 proof, but...

1608
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:37,773
I don't know.

1609
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:40,407
- All right.
- Okay. Okay.

1610
01:28:40,542 --> 01:28:43,080
Oh, God. Fast. Go.

1611
01:28:43,215 --> 01:28:46,353
Ben, go! Jesus!

1612
01:28:50,684 --> 01:28:52,087
Okay.

1613
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:58,035
- Jesus! Oh! Oh, my gosh!
- Oh, shit! Louise!

1614
01:28:58,059 --> 01:28:59,896
- Oh, no, Ben! Pick it up!
- Throw it! Oh!

1615
01:29:00,966 --> 01:29:02,713
All right, shoot the gun,
and I'll throw it.

1616
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:04,276
- It's our last shot.
- Just shoot the gun, okay?

1617
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:05,801
Okay!

1618
01:29:12,374 --> 01:29:14,073
Oh, fuck!

1619
01:29:15,346 --> 01:29:17,080
Okay, go. Go, go.

1620
01:29:24,322 --> 01:29:26,592
Did you get it?

1621
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:30,357
Yeah, honey. Help's on the way.

1622
01:29:30,993 --> 01:29:34,500
Okay. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

1623
01:29:36,667 --> 01:29:38,330
Fuck!

1624
01:29:40,205 --> 01:29:41,750
Mate, your fucking car's
on fire. Let's finish it, eh?

1625
01:29:41,774 --> 01:29:43,169
We've got them
on the hook, Mike.

1626
01:29:43,304 --> 01:29:44,885
I told you, you should
just top them first thing.

1627
01:29:44,909 --> 01:29:46,469
Why do you do this,
play with your food?

1628
01:29:46,545 --> 01:29:47,776
You're like my mum's cat.

1629
01:29:47,912 --> 01:29:52,386
You go and you get
on that roof, yeah?

1630
01:29:59,424 --> 01:30:01,388
Okay, you guys sit tight.

1631
01:30:01,523 --> 01:30:03,025
You, too, Hoppy.

1632
01:30:03,161 --> 01:30:05,893
Now, you don't move
and you don't make a sound

1633
01:30:06,028 --> 01:30:08,735
until you hear
my voice again, okay?

1634
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,701
Okay.

1635
01:30:51,444 --> 01:30:53,579
Ben, mate?

1636
01:30:56,579 --> 01:30:58,279
That you in there?

1637
01:30:59,015 --> 01:31:01,414
You gonna give me
a little dance, Ben?

1638
01:31:02,517 --> 01:31:05,150
You gonna step up or are you
gonna let us shit all over you

1639
01:31:05,286 --> 01:31:08,926
like that fellow
on your wife's phone?

1640
01:31:09,062 --> 01:31:10,121
Ben?

1641
01:31:10,257 --> 01:31:13,465
If it was just
you and him, right,

1642
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,365
you've got a gun
against his head,

1643
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,736
what would you do?

1644
01:31:27,276 --> 01:31:30,576
Oh, you've blown up my car,
you cheeky cunt.

1645
01:31:30,712 --> 01:31:31,946
What was that?

1646
01:31:32,082 --> 01:31:34,515
You're gonna have to pay
for that, Ben.

1647
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:36,655
Coming in, Ben!

1648
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:04,683
It's the roof.

1649
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:08,588
Ben.

1650
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,089
Honey.

1651
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:50,525
Ant!

1652
01:32:51,761 --> 01:32:53,463
Where are you, boy?

1653
01:32:53,599 --> 01:32:55,899
I know you can hear me!

1654
01:33:03,643 --> 01:33:06,580
Oh, you fuck.

1655
01:33:54,628 --> 01:33:57,624
Not gonna pretend I'm not angry.

1656
01:34:17,616 --> 01:34:20,284
Fuck!

1657
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:28,225
Ah, ya fuck.

1658
01:34:58,218 --> 01:35:00,358
Paddy!

1659
01:35:05,465 --> 01:35:07,331
Where is she?

1660
01:35:07,467 --> 01:35:09,164
Through there.

1661
01:35:11,406 --> 01:35:12,535
Check the cupboard.

1662
01:35:12,671 --> 01:35:14,466
Okay.

1663
01:35:37,091 --> 01:35:38,898
Ant, love?

1664
01:35:39,033 --> 01:35:41,367
If you make some noise
and show us where you are,

1665
01:35:41,503 --> 01:35:42,966
we'll go easy on you.

1666
01:35:43,102 --> 01:35:45,701
No reason we can't
keep you both.

1667
01:35:45,836 --> 01:35:47,100
Don't...

1668
01:35:47,235 --> 01:35:48,641
and I'm gonna put you feet first

1669
01:35:48,777 --> 01:35:51,043
through the fucking
wood chipper!

1670
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,439
Let's go up.

1671
01:36:44,062 --> 01:36:46,866
You fucking...

1672
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:49,730
Go! Go, go, go!

1673
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:53,502
Go! Go! Go!

1674
01:36:53,637 --> 01:36:54,575
Oh, shit!

1675
01:36:54,576 --> 01:36:56,810
Go, go. Right there.

1676
01:36:59,910 --> 01:37:01,240
Water.

1677
01:37:01,375 --> 01:37:03,075
Oh, fuck. Water!

1678
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:04,884
Come on, kids. Go in.

1679
01:37:06,016 --> 01:37:08,118
Go in. That way, that way!

1680
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:45,158
Holy shit.

1681
01:37:49,095 --> 01:37:51,059
Just grab his keys.

1682
01:37:51,194 --> 01:37:53,493
- What? What?
- His car keys.

1683
01:37:58,398 --> 01:38:00,436
Through the loft. The loft.

1684
01:38:00,572 --> 01:38:02,106
Come on.

1685
01:38:07,045 --> 01:38:09,249
Can you see?

1686
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:10,384
I can see.

1687
01:38:10,451 --> 01:38:11,650
Look, look.

1688
01:38:11,785 --> 01:38:13,650
You... you have to do this.

1689
01:38:13,786 --> 01:38:14,986
You have to go now.

1690
01:38:15,121 --> 01:38:16,684
You got to get after them,
all right?

1691
01:38:16,819 --> 01:38:19,886
This is your fuckup, love.
You go fix it or it's over.

1692
01:38:20,021 --> 01:38:21,394
Give me it.

1693
01:38:26,763 --> 01:38:28,660
Upstairs.

1694
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:33,434
Oh.

1695
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,076
Okay. Oh, thank God.

1696
01:38:39,208 --> 01:38:41,640
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh.

1697
01:38:45,686 --> 01:38:47,151
Dad!

1698
01:38:49,417 --> 01:38:50,417
Are you okay?

1699
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:53,489
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

1700
01:38:53,625 --> 01:38:55,020
Come on.

1701
01:38:55,156 --> 01:38:56,757
There you go.

1702
01:39:10,438 --> 01:39:11,480
- All right. All right.
- No.

1703
01:39:11,504 --> 01:39:13,111
All right, just be careful.

1704
01:39:13,847 --> 01:39:15,778
- Okay.
- Okay.

1705
01:39:15,913 --> 01:39:17,984
Get on the ladder.

1706
01:39:41,675 --> 01:39:43,309
Ciara?

1707
01:39:43,444 --> 01:39:44,876
Ciara!

1708
01:39:45,011 --> 01:39:46,878
- Dad! Help me!
- Aggie!

1709
01:39:47,013 --> 01:39:48,748
- Dad, please!
- I got you!

1710
01:40:01,190 --> 01:40:03,396
I got you. I got you.

1711
01:40:08,868 --> 01:40:11,697
Oh, God. Are you okay?

1712
01:40:38,665 --> 01:40:40,231
Oh, my God.

1713
01:41:07,392 --> 01:41:10,294
All right.
Go hide behind the car.

1714
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:13,066
Hey, go through the yard.

1715
01:41:19,606 --> 01:41:20,606
Hey.

1716
01:41:32,851 --> 01:41:34,484
Go. Go.

1717
01:41:34,619 --> 01:41:37,786
Take Ant back to the car.
I'll be right behind you.

1718
01:41:38,355 --> 01:41:39,851
We go together.

1719
01:42:01,309 --> 01:42:03,446
Oh, God.

1720
01:42:06,015 --> 01:42:07,414
Ciara?

1721
01:42:07,549 --> 01:42:10,183
Hey! Hey!

1722
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:11,883
You throw that gun, Ben.

1723
01:42:13,388 --> 01:42:15,194
No.

1724
01:42:17,191 --> 01:42:18,994
Oh, baby.

1725
01:42:19,129 --> 01:42:21,464
Ciara, my darling?

1726
01:42:24,369 --> 01:42:26,837
Ciara. Oh, my darling.

1727
01:42:26,973 --> 01:42:29,237
Oh, please. Please.

1728
01:42:29,372 --> 01:42:31,502
Do whatever you want to us.

1729
01:42:31,638 --> 01:42:34,008
But please...

1730
01:42:34,143 --> 01:42:35,808
This peach?

1731
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:38,784
You think I'm gonna hurt her?

1732
01:42:40,681 --> 01:42:43,147
You took my Ciara away from me.

1733
01:42:44,184 --> 01:42:47,285
She's all I've got
to take care of me now.

1734
01:42:50,524 --> 01:42:52,825
But I promise you both...

1735
01:42:54,597 --> 01:42:56,328
...we'll look after each other.

1736
01:42:56,463 --> 01:42:58,329
- No!
- Fuck!

1737
01:43:06,207 --> 01:43:07,875
Oh, God!

1738
01:43:21,156 --> 01:43:22,459
Okay.

1739
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:40,906
Ant, come on.

1740
01:43:42,815 --> 01:43:43,944
Ant.

1741
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,911
Come on.

1742
01:43:51,090 --> 01:43:53,556
That's my boy.
