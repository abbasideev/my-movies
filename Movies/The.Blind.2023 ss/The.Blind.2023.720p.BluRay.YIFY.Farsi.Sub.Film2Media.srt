1
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,681
- I would say the biggest hurdle for me,

2
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,384
is gettin' past the
embarrassment of it all.

3
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:30,390
It's hard to talk about who I used to be

4
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,096
Not a day goes by

5
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:39,968
that I'm not grateful,

6
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,270
I mean, I mean to my bones

7
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,473
about how my life turned around.

8
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,281
- Shoot.

9
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,753
We've been into some pretty
dark places together.

10
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,290
I mean,

11
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,595
you turned it around,

12
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,898
made a life for yourself.

13
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:18,305
I guess I just wanted to know

14
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,176
how you did that?

15
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,053
- You hear these rare stories, you know?

16
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,855
Of how the impossible happened.

17
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,258
Well,

18
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:42,195
this is one of those stories.

19
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:16,463
Hey!

20
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:54,035
It was the 1950s, but if
you pulled up to our yard,

21
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,838
you would've thought it was the 1850s.

22
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,906
That's how poor we were.

23
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,743
Dad spent most of his time
workin' in the oil fields.

24
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:03,644
I wish you didn't always have to go.

25
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:06,279
- Hell, that's life, Phil.

26
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,849
It's time you grew up.

27
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,521
Take care of things around here.

28
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:15,957
You got it?

29
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,991
- Yes, sir.

30
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,365
- Who's a man?

31
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,669
- I'm a man.

32
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:31,105
Mama provided a different
set of challenges.

33
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,876
- When she had one of her spells,
- Mom, stop it!

34
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,043
- Get outta here!
- You'll go back

35
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:36,878
to the hospital again!

36
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,311
- Get out!

37
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,479
- All we could really
do is get outta the way.

38
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:40,447
- No one's takin' me to the hospital.

39
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:41,949
- You gotta calm down!

40
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,416
Please!

41
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:44,886
- Get outta here!

42
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:45,920
Go!

43
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,992
- I started at a
young age, a very young age.

44
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,929
Come to the woods and bringin'
back somethin' you could eat.

45
00:04:56,664 --> 00:05:00,535
Squirrel, ducks, quail,
doves, whatever was there.

46
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,004
The woods became my home.

47
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:07,041
Sometimes I would just
sit there for hours,

48
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:08,242
listen to the woods.

49
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:12,747
They would talk and I
would try and talk back.

50
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,886
I could get lost in them.

51
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,056
They were my refuge.

52
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:30,131
But sooner or later, the real
world always comes knockin'.

53
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,279
- No, no!

54
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,847
No, no!
- Phil!

55
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:21,349
They're takin' her away again!
- You can't make me!

56
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,885
You can't make me, you can't!

57
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:25,152
No!

58
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:26,220
Phil!

59
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:27,288
Phil, don't let 'em take me!

60
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,990
- She ain't done nothin' wrong!

61
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:31,391
- Judy, Judy!

62
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,094
Phil, Phil, Phil!

63
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:38,266
- Mom!

64
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,233
- Phil!

65
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:41,369
Phil, Phil!

66
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,457
- She was gone for months at a time.

67
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:05,860
Mama?

68
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:07,862
While they tried the
only medicine they had,

69
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:10,965
shock treatment.

70
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:12,900
Mama?

71
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:25,579
- Why does she keep doin' this stuff

72
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,447
if she knows they'll lock her up?

73
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:29,884
- She can't help it.

74
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,786
It's in her blood or somethin'.

75
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:34,454
- We got that blood in us?

76
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:37,725
- Don't know,

77
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,894
but we'll always look out
for each other, won't we?

78
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,063
- You mean that, Phil?

79
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,132
- Of course I do, Jan.

80
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:48,502
Si, go get some taters
from under the house.

81
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:49,704
- Nah, nah, nah.

82
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,939
Hey, last time that possum ran after me,

83
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:54,642
his teeth were like this big.

84
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:01,549
- I didn't know it at the time,

85
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,352
but just up the road a few miles lived

86
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:05,619
a girl who would soon become

87
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:08,756
the most important person in my life,

88
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,226
Kay Carroway.

89
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,494
- Oh, damn it!

90
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:15,963
- Language, Mom!

91
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:17,531
- Kay, pick up your toys,
they nearly killed me,

92
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,166
and then you go get those over there.

93
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,868
- Compared to us,
- Stay on your feet,

94
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:22,269
- Kay was rich.
- gonna be stockin'

95
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:23,337
the store tonight, and I
can't do it without you.

96
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:24,538
- Oh-

97
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:25,673
- They owned the general store in town,

98
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:28,042
so we equated that with filthy rich.

99
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,312
- Y'all could close stores on
Sundays and come to church.

100
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,347
It'd be good for your soul, Daddy.

101
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:35,950
- Sunday's our best day, Katie-bug.

102
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,552
You may say a prayer for us,

103
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,121
especially about sellin'
them three roasts today

104
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:43,124
before I have to throw 'em
out and lose money on 'em.

105
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:44,925
Hey?

106
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,028
Don't you get caught readin'

107
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:49,930
them pioneer books in church again.

108
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,300
Just in case.

109
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,236
"Little House on the
Prairie," new edition.

110
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,771
- I don't have this one.

111
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:57,738
- I know.

112
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:58,839
Says there's all kinds

113
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,541
of new maps and drawings in there.

114
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:01,876
- Thanks, Daddy.

115
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:07,715
- Kay wasn't like the other kids.

116
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,216
They judged us.

117
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,018
She didn't.

118
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:22,797
I guess she saw somethin' else.

119
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,902
- Look like the riff-raff's
blowing in from the field.

120
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,271
- Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves.

121
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,774
- Wowie, look at this.

122
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:35,342
What are these called?

123
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:36,444
- Hubcaps.

124
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,945
- Dang!

125
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:40,114
- Pa's truck ain't never had these.

126
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,918
Must be a load of
millionaires here in town.

127
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:48,722
- Turns out there was somethin'

128
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:51,025
besides huntin' I was actually good at.

129
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,127
I was born with it.

130
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:57,131
That's how I became the
high school quarterback.

131
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,240
Down, set, hut!

132
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:24,458
Hey, way to play fellas.

133
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:25,560
- You gotta stop runnin' like that.

134
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,161
You put me out of a job.

135
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,462
- Pretty sure you gotta get on the field

136
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:31,031
before you can lose that job, son.

137
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:33,033
- Talk about your pioneer man, Kay.

138
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,669
Maybe he'll walk you off
the field after the game.

139
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,371
- Phil Robertson, the quarterback?

140
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:38,873
You gotta be kiddin' me.

141
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,474
- I seen the way he looks at you.

142
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:42,643
- Hey, Phil
Robertson, can I get a statement?

143
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,579
- Nah, nah.

144
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,280
You wanna talk to Si Robertson right her

145
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:47,549
Real hero of the game.

146
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:48,617
- Si Robertson?

147
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,351
Did you even play?

148
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:51,952
- Boy, did I even play?

149
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:53,721
I was so fast like lightning,

150
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:54,922
that's why it probably didn't even feel

151
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,690
like you saw me out there on that field.

152
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,692
- Miss Kay Carroway.

153
00:10:58,826 --> 00:10:59,994
- Hey, Phil.

154
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:00,828
- Hey.

155
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,397
Look, I know we don't know
each other all that well,

156
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:07,268
but think maybe I could walk
you off the field tonight?

157
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:08,169
- I'd like that.

158
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,471
- Okay.

159
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:11,939
So we walked off the field together

160
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,941
and she offered me a ride home.

161
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:16,043
I didn't even have the luxury of goin'

162
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:18,479
on my first date without
at least one third wheel.

163
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:19,914
- And that's when I went down to pet

164
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,551
what I thought was a
dog, and no way, okay?

165
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,785
Turned out it was a five-pound squirrel.

166
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,253
- Sorry about this.

167
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:28,322
- I mean, I really do despise beavers,

168
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:31,725
but I also respect their
work ethic and determination.

169
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,364
- You're gonna stay in the car.

170
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:39,634
- What do you mean?
- This is my date,

171
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:40,834
so you're stayin'.

172
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:42,504
- I'll be skin and bone if I don't eat.

173
00:11:42,637 --> 00:11:43,804
- I hate to break it to ya,
honey, but you already are.

174
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:45,873
- Hey Jack, I am wastin' away.

175
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:46,974
- All right, fine, fine.

176
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,375
Quit your yappin'.

177
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,376
I'll get you somethin',
but you're stayin' here.

178
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:50,411
- All right.

179
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:54,982
All right.

180
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,453
- Sorry about that.

181
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,434
- I know girls are supposed to act

182
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:14,735
like they don't eat
nothin' on these dates,

183
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,438
but I am absolutely starvin'.

184
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:18,339
Hey, Rachel?

185
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:19,873
- Hey, Kay.

186
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,775
- Could I get two muffy
sandwiches and a large fry?

187
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:22,810
What you want? I can pay.

188
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:23,777
- Hey, no, come on.

189
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,247
You drove, I got this.

190
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,285
Uh, you know, I don't really
eat after the games anyway,

191
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,255
so I think I'm just gonna
get something for Si, so.

192
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:36,290
- You know what?

193
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,791
I changed my mind.

194
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,460
Could you just gimme one of
those single grilled cheeses,

195
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:41,862
and Rachel, you owe me
a fry from last week,

196
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:43,464
so don't go cheatin' out on me again.

197
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:45,065
- Okay.

198
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,234
- Fries are for skinny bones.

199
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:51,805
- In those days,

200
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:52,906
it was a nightmare dealin' with Mama.

201
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,542
- Where is it?

202
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:57,579
- When she was good, she was
great. Funny, sharp, kind.

203
00:12:57,712 --> 00:12:59,179
- Ma, what are you lookin' for?

204
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:00,548
- The money.

205
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:02,016
Where's the money?

206
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,183
- I keep tellin' you,
we ain't got no money.

207
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,587
At least not in the way you're sayin'.

208
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,755
- Oh no, from your pa.

209
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,055
He's been sendin' it.

210
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,890
- But when it wasn't her day-

211
00:13:10,024 --> 00:13:11,225
- I got back
from the hospital and-

212
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,260
- Life was hell for all of us.

213
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,396
Yes, Mama, and Pa did send it.

214
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,564
We've been usin' it.

215
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:17,831
Jan needed actual clothes for school,

216
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:20,000
Si needed shoes for football.

217
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:22,537
Everything around us costs money.

218
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:26,940
- Why are you wearing that?

219
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,375
Why are you all dressed up?

220
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,580
- 'Cause I got a date tonight.

221
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,916
- You got a date?

222
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,553
Oh, baby, with who, huh?

223
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,557
- Kay Carroway.

224
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:47,394
- Carroway?

225
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:52,066
That rich family in town?

226
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:55,903
Well, that's nice.

227
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:03,210
You gonna leave me, Phil?

228
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:04,912
You gonna leave me, Phil?

229
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,280
Is that what you're gonna do?

230
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,381
- I'm not leave-
- You gonna leave me?

231
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:08,882
- I'm not leavin'!

232
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,689
- Don't go.

233
00:14:14,823 --> 00:14:15,824
Don't go.

234
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,492
Don't go like your father.

235
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,169
- Hey.
- Hey, you ready to go?

236
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:31,872
- What's wrong?

237
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:33,508
- Nothin'.

238
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:35,109
Everything's fine.

239
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:36,276
- No, I can tell you look
like you've seen a ghost.

240
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,311
What...

241
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,247
- Oh, my Mama's been
actin' up again is all,

242
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:41,915
but it's fine, we got our date tonight.

243
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,150
It's...

244
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,721
There's just a lot goin' on.

245
00:14:46,855 --> 00:14:49,758
- Hey, whoa, it's okay.

246
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,526
We can figure it out together.

247
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:53,460
- No, no, all right?

248
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:54,863
You shouldn't...

249
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,463
No, you're not gonna have
to deal with any of this.

250
00:14:56,598 --> 00:14:58,098
- Hey, who needs another
muffy at Fertitta's?

251
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,601
I've got an idea.

252
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,539
- Thank you again for bringin' all this.

253
00:15:04,672 --> 00:15:06,473
- Well, just because my
parents own a grocery store

254
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:08,610
don't mean I know how
to cook anything in it.

255
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:10,812
- Well, honey, that I can teach.

256
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,212
Always start with some butter here.

257
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,014
- baby, okay?

258
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:15,683
Give us a snack, all right?

259
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:16,984
No one-
- Coca-Cola?

260
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,119
Dang, she is rich.
- Jan!

261
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,354
- Where's the tea?

262
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:23,591
Hey, grab me somethin', would ya?

263
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:24,826
- Hey, I hear that.

264
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,460
You steal a bite before it's ready,

265
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,061
I'm gonna swat you upside
the head with this spatula.

266
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:32,700
Hand me those beans, will ya?

267
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:35,369
Okay, so make sure this is lump free.

268
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:37,104
- Smells good.
- Thank you,

269
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,406
now get out.

270
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,943
Okay, take one of these and make sure

271
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,446
that's against the knives.

272
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:48,415
Soaked up with flour.

273
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,184
However you wanna do that.

274
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:52,019
I do it kinda messy, but some people...

275
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,992
- Kay, thank you for tonight.

276
00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:01,863
It really meant a lot to my mama,

277
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:05,499
and though she probably won't admit it,

278
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:09,737
she really misses my pa
when he's on the job.

279
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:11,238
- Yeah, yeah.

280
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,807
You know, she seemed okay.

281
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:16,678
- There's this other
side to her, you know?

282
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:17,912
And you can't predict it.

283
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,379
It just kinda-

284
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:21,415
- You ain't never have
to be ashamed of that.

285
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,486
- Wait, shh, shh.

286
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,888
- What is it?
- Hear that?

287
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,259
That's a pintail.

288
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,035
- You love it out here.

289
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:44,004
- I do.

290
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,140
- It is beautiful.

291
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,518
- We can get a place out here, you and I

292
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:58,285
a little shack up on the river

293
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,487
and I could spend my days fishin'.

294
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:02,824
I...

295
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,194
I'm sorry.

296
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,230
A girl like you definitely
don't wanna spend

297
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,533
her time like that.

298
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:16,403
- My dad used to read me
pioneer stories every night.

299
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:18,038
- What's a pioneer story?

300
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,542
- You know, like movin' out
west, livin' off the land,

301
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:22,977
makin' your own butter, that kinda thing

302
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:26,046
There's always a good love story too.

303
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,481
I used to go to bed dreamin'

304
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,651
about how amazin' that
kinda life would be.

305
00:17:29,784 --> 00:17:34,187
So, yeah, a little place by the
river would be just the thing.

306
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:39,293
- You really are the perfect
woman, Miss Kay Carroway.

307
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,833
Kay fell right in with my family.

308
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:48,570
In my mind, we were a perfect fit.

309
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:53,508
- Phil has been an All-State
quarterback this year.

310
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:54,943
They've been saying he's gonna

311
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,410
get lots of offers from colleges to play

312
00:17:56,544 --> 00:18:00,213
- Football is such a rough sport to me.

313
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:01,849
Seems like a waste of time.

314
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:05,252
I mean, are they gonna pay
you a lot of money to play?

315
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,722
- I'm sure they got scholarships and suc

316
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:09,057
Am I right, Phil?

317
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,558
- Oh, yes, Sir.

318
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:11,793
Yes, Ma'am.

319
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,328
- See, there you go, Wanita.

320
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:18,332
- You know, that reminds me.

321
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:22,169
Kay, guess who came into the store today

322
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,540
Mrs. Watson.

323
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:28,743
Now, her boy is nearly
outta medical school.

324
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:30,578
A doctor, you know?

325
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:34,314
And I remember, oo, he
used to come around.

326
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,551
He had eyes for you.

327
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,656
- Wanita, you look like
you're runnin' empty there.

328
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:44,458
Well, so is my beer.

329
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,961
I would love another.

330
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:48,161
- Phil, wait!

331
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,296
I'm sorry about my Mama.

332
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,531
Phil!
- You ain't gotta

333
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:52,165
be polite anymore, Kay.
- Please!

334
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,234
Just, I'm sorry about my Mama, okay?

335
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:56,236
- This not gonna work.

336
00:18:57,672 --> 00:19:00,173
It's huntin' season.
- No.

337
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,643
- I gotta go.
- No.

338
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:12,553
- So, you just broke up
with her just like that?

339
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:14,889
- It was huntin' season.

340
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,928
- That's a bad move.
- Yep.

341
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:23,765
One of many.

342
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:29,037
- How'd you get her back then?

343
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,940
- Hey!

344
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:35,076
Now!

345
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,347
- Phil!

346
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:15,917
Phil, it's Kay!

347
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:30,665
- The death of Kay's
father came out of nowhere

348
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:33,233
and left a big hole in her family.

349
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:36,604
Kay,

350
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:39,874
I love you.

351
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:42,910
I'm sorry for runnin' off like that.

352
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,247
It wasn't long after her daddy died

353
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,382
that her mama spiraled down quickly.

354
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:51,652
She fought a hard battle with alcohol,

355
00:20:51,786 --> 00:20:53,855
and the alcohol eventually won.

356
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:55,723
I was all she had,

357
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:58,893
but in a lot of ways she was all I had.

358
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:00,661
- Wait.

359
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:02,496
You think it's right that we're doin' th

360
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,431
when we ain't married?

361
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:12,707
- I, Phil Robertson promise to
love and be with you forever.

362
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:18,411
- I, Kay Carroway promise to
love and be with you forever.

363
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,586
- So after all that,

364
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,454
because of my skillset
throwin' a football,

365
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:29,957
I headed off to Louisiana Tech.

366
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:32,827
- Great game, boys!

367
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,029
- Kay was only a junior
in high school at the time,

368
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:37,297
but we had a baby on the way,

369
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,001
and it was pretty rough on Kay.

370
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:44,471
Tried to balance takin' care of my famil

371
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:49,644
and school and football,
but it was too much.

372
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:52,747
Eventually I had to quit football.

373
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,582
- You ever think about that, man?

374
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:56,284
You coulda been big.

375
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,419
I'm talkin' like cereal box big.

376
00:21:59,554 --> 00:22:00,922
Wheaties big.

377
00:22:01,722 --> 00:22:04,258
"The" Terry Bradshaw was your number two

378
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,860
"The" Terry Bradshaw.

379
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:10,298
- I say it worked out pretty good for hi

380
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,699
- Yeah, I'd say so.

381
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,835
Hey, you and him get along?

382
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:19,339
- Can I take
this thing off now, Phil?

383
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:20,407
- No.

384
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,642
- Can I at least sit up?

385
00:22:21,776 --> 00:22:23,343
- I told ya if you wanna come out here,

386
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:24,979
this is how it's gonna be.

387
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:28,082
- Yeah, I thought you were jokin

388
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:30,151
- I never joke about fishin'.

389
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:32,385
Can't be givin' away my secret spots,

390
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,754
not even to you.

391
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,025
All right, take it off.

392
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,459
- Yeah?
- Yeah, now.

393
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:42,330
- Woo!

394
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:43,698
Got my hair all messed
up and everything, man.

395
00:22:43,831 --> 00:22:45,299
- You're fine.

396
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:47,134
Take a look.

397
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:49,871
Sorta special.

398
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:55,142
- Yeah, that's called a fish.
- Woo hoo!

399
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:01,282
- I think my release is
gettin' a lot better.

400
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:03,284
I've been hangin' around
after practice every day,

401
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,585
workin' on it.

402
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:07,454
- You really love football,
don't you Bradshaw?

403
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:09,023
- Yeah, I do.

404
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:10,625
More than anything.

405
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:12,326
Just feels like it's part
of my blood or somethin'.

406
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,662
- I feel like that with huntin'.

407
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:16,964
That's why I ain't playin'
next year.

408
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:17,999
- What?

409
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:19,533
Are you serious?

410
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:20,801
NFL scouts have been
watchin' you all year long.

411
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:22,236
Everybody knows you'll go pro.

412
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,470
- Nah.

413
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:25,106
I'm done.

414
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:26,908
It's your turn.

415
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,177
- You think I'm ready?

416
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:31,646
- Of course you're ready.

417
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,547
No one can throw a bomb
down the field like you.

418
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:35,850
You're the Blonde Bomber.

419
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:38,152
- The Blonde Bomber?

420
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:43,591
Guess that's better than
the name you gave Johnson.

421
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:45,026
- What, you mean Old Stubby?

422
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:46,894
- Why you gotta
do him like that, Phil?

423
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:48,896
- It ain't my fault he got
them stubby little legs.

424
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,399
- Shoot.
- So, I lost my scholarship,

425
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:54,568
but still managed to finish college.

426
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:57,972
It was easy enough to
find a job in those days.

427
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,274
The hard part was findin'
one that paid enough.

428
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:04,111
Our family was growin'.

429
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:05,313
Hey, boys!

430
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,380
And so were the bills.

431
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:07,480
Aw, I missed you boys.

432
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:09,449
Come here, come here.

433
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:15,022
How you been, huh?

434
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:17,158
Boy, you gettin' heavy.

435
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,458
Those feet smell?

436
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:20,261
Boy, they smell bad!

437
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:21,494
You need to take a shower.

438
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:24,899
I'm gonna say hi to Mama, okay?

439
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:36,010
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

440
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:38,379
How was your day, hm?

441
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:41,481
- It was good, until Alan tried to stick

442
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:42,984
a crayon up Jase's nose.

443
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:45,619
- Did it fit?

444
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:47,521
- Hey! Phil!

445
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:00,568
How's it lookin'?

446
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:05,740
- I can feed you out in the woods.

447
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,642
I just need to make
sure we got enough money

448
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,678
to keep a roof over our heads.

449
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:21,055
I just don't wanna be gone
all the time like my dad was.

450
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:22,256
- You won't.

451
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:30,865
You got two degrees from Louisiana Tech.

452
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:33,768
You can do just about anything

453
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:37,204
you set your mind to, Phil Robertson.

454
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:43,611
Hey,

455
00:25:45,514 --> 00:25:47,081
I'm proud of you.

456
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:49,750
I love you.

457
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:52,686
- And I love you.

458
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,431
- I wouldn't change anything about us.

459
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,199
We gonna make it.

460
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:09,504
- Stick with me, Miss Kay.

461
00:26:09,637 --> 00:26:12,907
I'll put that long green in your pockets

462
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:18,679
Kay was definitely nervous

463
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:21,348
about me havin' a job interview in a bar

464
00:26:21,482 --> 00:26:22,450
- Was that me?

465
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,118
Was- the bar interview was me?

466
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,152
- Yeah,

467
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:28,756
it was you.

468
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:30,658
- Ah, I had a feelin'.

469
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:38,699
Yeah, sorry about that.

470
00:26:42,303 --> 00:26:43,337
Good to see ya, Frank.

471
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:46,373
Oh, oh, oh.

472
00:26:46,508 --> 00:26:47,875
- Keep your hands to yourself, Big Al.

473
00:26:48,008 --> 00:26:49,210
- You know I can't.

474
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:52,713
Oh, hey, Sally, why don't you go ahead

475
00:26:52,847 --> 00:26:54,748
and grab me a shot of whiskey?

476
00:26:54,882 --> 00:26:57,384
Hey, you know, make it two.

477
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,419
One for my friend Phil here.

478
00:26:58,553 --> 00:27:00,020
Hey, make it quick.

479
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:04,325
- You got it.
- He's just catchin' up.

480
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,227
- Thank you, Mr. Bolen.

481
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,261
- Mr. Bolen?

482
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:10,297
You must be lookin' for my daddy.

483
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:12,366
You can call me Big Al.

484
00:27:13,434 --> 00:27:16,337
- Okay, sure, Big Al.

485
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:18,372
- Ah.

486
00:27:18,507 --> 00:27:22,176
So, Phil, tell me about yourself.

487
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,579
- I got a wife and three
kids I need to support

488
00:27:24,712 --> 00:27:27,715
and teachin' always seemed
like a respectable thing to do.

489
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:29,884
- No, no, no, no.

490
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:32,186
I don't mean that shit.

491
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:35,557
I mean, tell me about you.

492
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:38,392
What kinda man is Phil Robertson?

493
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,429
- Well, I love to hunt.

494
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:44,965
- Now, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout.

495
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:48,469
Huntin's sure good up
around Junction City.

496
00:27:48,603 --> 00:27:50,539
Keep you real busy on the weekends.

497
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,973
Somethin' to relieve the
stress of the teacher man.

498
00:27:53,107 --> 00:27:54,008
- Hm.

499
00:27:58,312 --> 00:27:59,346
- Need a smoke?

500
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,115
- Oh, I don't really smoke.

501
00:28:05,186 --> 00:28:08,422
- Man, you got a sense
of humor, Phil Robertson.

502
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:22,136
Hell, I knew we were
gonna get along just fine

503
00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:24,271
the moment I shook your hand.

504
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,277
Thank you, Sally.

505
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:33,280
Hey, and you best keep these comin'.

506
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:35,550
We got a lot to celebrate tonight.

507
00:28:35,684 --> 00:28:36,784
- All right.

508
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:39,286
- That's it?

509
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,255
Did I get the job?

510
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:06,480
My name is Mr. Robertson.

511
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:13,887
If y'all could turn your
handbooks to page 45...

512
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:23,264
- Hey, there's my guy.

513
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:26,166
How 'bout a drink,
celebrate the first day?

514
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,235
- I can't.

515
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:30,639
Miss Kay's got a special
dinner waitin' for me tonight.

516
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:31,573
- Yeah, of course she does.

517
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:32,906
She's a classy gal.

518
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,141
Well, you ain't a dang derelict.

519
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:36,410
I'm just talkin' about one drink.

520
00:29:36,544 --> 00:29:37,746
- Hey, Fred.

521
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:39,780
- You didn't hear nothin', Fred.

522
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,319
- One drink?

523
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:46,420
- One drink.

524
00:29:47,488 --> 00:29:48,523
Come on, then.

525
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:31,165
- Woo!

526
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:33,367
- Yes!
- Woo!

527
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:48,616
- All right.
- Woo!

528
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,718
- Line 'em up!

529
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:13,701
- This is as fresh as it
comes, Appaloosa catfish.

530
00:32:13,835 --> 00:32:15,969
That's the filet mignon of the river.

531
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:19,072
- Jan!
- Hi, Kay.

532
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:20,974
- It's good to see you, sweetheart

533
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:22,376
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, Jan.

534
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,578
- How you doin'?

535
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:24,679
- I'm good, how are you?
- It's good to see you.

536
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:25,946
- You too.

537
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:26,881
- Hey, hey, how you doin'?
- Hey.

538
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:27,981
- I'm Al.

539
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:30,585
You must be one of Kay's friends.

540
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:33,220
I know Phil ain't got
no good lookin' friends.

541
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:35,222
Well, except for me, of course.

542
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:37,525
- That's my sister.

543
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:40,994
- Okay, okay.

544
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:42,429
Oh, yeah, okay.

545
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:43,330
All right.

546
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:45,365
I mean, I was just bein' friendly.

547
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:46,668
- Why don't you be friendly

548
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:49,136
in that direction over there, Al?

549
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:51,104
- Okay.

550
00:32:52,072 --> 00:32:53,842
- Sorry about him.
- No, I'm good.

551
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,910
Hey, congratulations on your new job.

552
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:57,044
I'm so proud of you.

553
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:58,412
- Thanks, Jan.

554
00:32:58,546 --> 00:33:00,280
- Did Kay tell you we took the boys

555
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:01,850
to church last weekend?

556
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:02,951
They seemed to really enjoy it.

557
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,018
You should come with us next time.

558
00:33:05,854 --> 00:33:08,121
- Yeah, well, I like to spend

559
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:10,859
my Sunday celebratin' God in other ways.

560
00:33:11,626 --> 00:33:15,864
Who needs a pew when you
can be out in His creation?

561
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:18,733
- Hey, y'all, how 'bout a toast, huh?

562
00:33:19,968 --> 00:33:21,603
To my man Phil Robertson here,

563
00:33:21,736 --> 00:33:26,574
the newest remedial English
teacher at Junction City High.

564
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:29,042
He ain't smart but he pretty.

565
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:33,080
- I can't do, I can't deal.

566
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:35,048
- Four ducks?
- Yeah, four ducks.

567
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:36,216
- Four ducks.

568
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,384
One bullet can't take down four ducks.

569
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,953
- Oh, it can if you're Phil Robertson.

570
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:40,855
- Who's this new friend with him?

571
00:33:40,989 --> 00:33:42,590
- That's Al.

572
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,260
He's from his work.

573
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:48,228
He runs their school.
- Oh, okay.

574
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:50,665
- Yeah, it's that easy.

575
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:53,033
- Woo ee!
- Woo!

576
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:56,303
- Ow!

577
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:04,444
Woo!
- Told you boys.

578
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:07,682
One thing I'm better at
than fishin' is shootin'.

579
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,383
- You okay?

580
00:34:09,517 --> 00:34:10,585
- Yeah.
- This here

581
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:14,288
is some genuine Three Creeks moonshine.

582
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:16,925
- All right.

583
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:29,537
- Daddy?

584
00:34:31,906 --> 00:34:33,206
You goin' huntin'?

585
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:35,142
- You bet ya.

586
00:34:36,744 --> 00:34:37,645
- Can I come?

587
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:41,381
- You don't know the woods.

588
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:43,985
You don't know huntin'.

589
00:34:44,117 --> 00:34:46,588
- You could teach me.

590
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:55,597
- Go back to bed.

591
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:04,271
The next few years were a
bit of a blur, I must admit.

592
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,413
- You said you know the guy
that owns this property?

593
00:35:13,548 --> 00:35:15,349
- Yeah, I met him once.

594
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:16,651
- Well, I met his sister.

595
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:23,457
- It was that feeling again,

596
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:25,693
being pulled in multiple directions.

597
00:35:27,895 --> 00:35:29,931
Huntin', partying, family.

598
00:35:30,064 --> 00:35:33,333
The drinkin' began to
overtake everything else.

599
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:37,371
"Airplanes follow duck."

600
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:42,777
I thought it was freedom to my worries,

601
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:45,445
but it didn't free me from 'em.

602
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,082
It just made me forget about them.

603
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:09,604
She just will not leave me alone.

604
00:36:11,204 --> 00:36:13,975
- I've heard of worse problems than that

605
00:36:14,108 --> 00:36:15,076
And all I could think was,

606
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:17,111
"Man, I gotta lay off the sauce."

607
00:36:18,445 --> 00:36:19,446
- They respected Phil Robertson.

608
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,215
They know Phil Robertson was a man.

609
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:23,417
Who's a man?

610
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:30,892
You're so beautiful, Marleen.

611
00:36:43,805 --> 00:36:46,674
- You wasn't
callin' them ducks in, Phil.

612
00:36:46,808 --> 00:36:49,911
You was commandin' them to come in.

613
00:36:50,778 --> 00:36:51,979
- Back again?

614
00:36:52,113 --> 00:36:53,480
You don't even have the
decency to hang around here?

615
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:54,549
I'm cookin' you dinner,

616
00:36:54,682 --> 00:36:55,850
I'm cleanin' up after the kids-

617
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:58,351
- Keep your mouth shut!

618
00:36:58,485 --> 00:37:00,353
- What, you can't even have
a conversation with me?

619
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:08,029
- Y'all don't need this.

620
00:37:10,198 --> 00:37:12,066
Class dismissed.

621
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:22,342
- Who's a man?

622
00:37:27,115 --> 00:37:30,250
- I was hell-bent
on doin' things my own way.

623
00:37:31,052 --> 00:37:32,019
I always had been.

624
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:37,125
So, when I had to figure out other ways

625
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:38,793
to provide for the family,

626
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:41,963
I went back to the places
that have always provided,

627
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:44,165
the woods, and the river.

628
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:06,453
- Take care.
- Oh.

629
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:10,558
- Miss Abaleen.

630
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:14,095
- Phil Robertson.

631
00:38:14,228 --> 00:38:15,295
You been stayin' outta trouble?

632
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:16,564
- Yes, Ma'am.

633
00:38:16,697 --> 00:38:17,865
- How's your mama?

634
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:21,869
- She doin' just great.

635
00:38:22,003 --> 00:38:23,738
- Kay and the kids?

636
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:24,806
- It's all good.

637
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:25,840
Hey?

638
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:28,408
Got a fresh catch for ya.

639
00:38:28,543 --> 00:38:30,144
- You back on the water?

640
00:38:30,278 --> 00:38:31,411
I thought I heard you teachin' down

641
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:33,247
at that school in Junction City?

642
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,348
- Yeah, yeah.

643
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:40,387
Sabbatical, you know?

644
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:42,890
Just a short break.

645
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:45,760
- I got myself plenty for the shop today

646
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:48,863
You know I don't like
throwin' out no unsold fish.

647
00:38:49,597 --> 00:38:51,398
- This here's as fresh as it comes.

648
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:54,367
You could put this on
special right up front.

649
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:59,406
Caught no more than an hour ago.

650
00:39:03,244 --> 00:39:04,645
Have a look.

651
00:39:05,445 --> 00:39:06,814
- Mm hm.

652
00:39:19,794 --> 00:39:20,628
- I appreciate you-

653
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:22,230
- Mm hm.

654
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:24,999
- You best make sure Miss
Kay and the boys get this.

655
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:26,100
- Yes, Ma'am.

656
00:39:26,234 --> 00:39:27,400
Absolutely.

657
00:39:36,277 --> 00:39:37,377
Do.

658
00:39:38,746 --> 00:39:40,882
I'm ashamed to say most of that money

659
00:39:41,015 --> 00:39:43,684
I was makin' didn't go
to Kay and the kids,

660
00:39:43,818 --> 00:39:46,020
but we always found a way to make more.

661
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,895
Hey, if nothin' else, we were creative.

662
00:39:54,962 --> 00:39:57,798
- All right, y'all, all bets are in.

663
00:39:57,932 --> 00:40:01,002
Got a rivalry as old as time.

664
00:40:02,036 --> 00:40:05,039
Man versus machine!

665
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:06,941
Steel versus muscle!

666
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:11,212
Rubber versus some bare feet.

667
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:13,915
- Mm hm!
- Yeah, Phil!

668
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:16,717
- All right.
- Let's go, come on!

669
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:18,219
- Let's get
this show on the boat!

670
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:21,689
- Come on, Phil!

671
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,627
- On your mark,
- You got this, buddy!

672
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:30,364
- get set,

673
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:34,869
go!

674
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:43,911
- What you doin' there?

675
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:44,912
- Woo!

676
00:40:47,848 --> 00:40:49,784
- Just like old times, gentlemen.

677
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:53,554
Don't give me that sour look
like I'm tryin' to cheat ya.

678
00:40:53,688 --> 00:40:55,823
It's Hank's car and he bet against me.

679
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:58,025
You think he hamstrung his own bet?

680
00:40:58,726 --> 00:41:01,295
Hey, come on, now, pay up.

681
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:02,897
Fair and square.

682
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:06,567
Hey, don't be bitter.

683
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:07,935
You and I both know Hank's car

684
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:09,637
ain't got the gun to come even close

685
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:12,573
to outrunnin' you if you
only give him 20 yards.

686
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:17,044
You give him 25, he's got you smoked.

687
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:23,684
- Well, that's their fault
for not askin' for 25.

688
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:27,755
- Man, ever since I known you,

689
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:29,190
you ain't never changed.

690
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:30,624
- Hey, Phil?

691
00:41:30,758 --> 00:41:32,259
Double or nothin'.

692
00:41:34,061 --> 00:41:35,563
- Hold my beer.

693
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:46,240
Hey, Babe.

694
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:51,545
- Guess you decided to finally come home

695
00:41:52,413 --> 00:41:54,248
- I know it's late, I was...

696
00:41:55,316 --> 00:41:57,084
I was, uh,

697
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:00,187
workin'.

698
00:42:01,255 --> 00:42:03,124
- Sell some fish?

699
00:42:03,257 --> 00:42:04,658
- Yep.

700
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:14,835
- What is this?

701
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:17,905
- That's money I made.

702
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:20,541
- Well, how much fish you sell?

703
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:21,942
- What do you mean?

704
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,945
- There's $11 here.

705
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:31,719
- I know, I musta spent
some of it, all right?

706
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:37,591
- Phil, we have three hungry boys.

707
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:41,562
You put all this pressure on
me to stretch a few dollars.

708
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:45,366
It is embarrassing havin' a line

709
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:47,701
of people behind me in
the grocery store waitin'

710
00:42:47,835 --> 00:42:50,971
for me to put stuff back
because I can't afford it.

711
00:42:51,105 --> 00:42:53,040
- It's fine.

712
00:42:53,174 --> 00:42:54,575
We're fine.

713
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:56,677
The kids are fine.

714
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:02,049
- I don't think we are, Phil.

715
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:10,257
- Hm, I told you boys, I'm blessed.

716
00:43:10,391 --> 00:43:11,926
I cannot lose.

717
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:13,961
- Jesus don't be playin' no dice.

718
00:43:14,095 --> 00:43:15,396
Only person who can play dice

719
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,364
like that is the devil ,

720
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:22,236
which will explain why you
riskin' your neck in this bar.

721
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:23,437
- Hm.

722
00:43:24,071 --> 00:43:26,440
Nah, it's 'cause I like the
music and the company better.

723
00:43:26,575 --> 00:43:28,543
- Mm.
- If you went next door,

724
00:43:28,676 --> 00:43:30,845
you'd think they closed the
bar and opened up a morgue.

725
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:33,380
- Really?

726
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:36,350
Well, I heard that the
owners are lookin' to sell.

727
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:38,352
- Really?

728
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:42,524
Well, it just so happens
I'm in need of a job.

729
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:45,493
- I said they were sellin',

730
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:47,194
not hirin'.

731
00:43:49,564 --> 00:43:50,664
- They here now?

732
00:43:59,707 --> 00:44:01,108
Jim Perkins?

733
00:44:01,242 --> 00:44:02,143
- Yeah.

734
00:44:03,578 --> 00:44:04,613
- Phil Robertson.

735
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:06,480
Nice to meet you.

736
00:44:06,615 --> 00:44:07,549
I heard y'all might be interested

737
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:09,183
in doin' a little business.

738
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:12,086
- What, you wanna buy the bar?

739
00:44:12,753 --> 00:44:13,921
- Well, thought we could talk about

740
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:16,357
a bit more of a creative strategy.

741
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:20,227
Hold on.

742
00:44:21,028 --> 00:44:22,730
Hold on.
- Phil!

743
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:27,935
- Keep 'em closed.

744
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:30,938
Come on.

745
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:32,740
- Can I open them?
- Not yet.

746
00:44:33,908 --> 00:44:37,278
Just a little further, little further.

747
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:41,849
Keep 'em closed.

748
00:44:44,752 --> 00:44:45,786
Stand here.

749
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,788
Don't open 'em till I tell ya.

750
00:44:47,922 --> 00:44:49,658
- Why does it smell like urine?

751
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:55,696
- Hold on.

752
00:44:58,567 --> 00:44:59,300
- Phil?

753
00:45:01,435 --> 00:45:02,937
- Okay, open 'em.

754
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:12,614
- It's a bar.

755
00:45:15,816 --> 00:45:16,717
You bought a bar?

756
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,486
- Sort of.

757
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:22,624
- Phil, we can't afford a bar.

758
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:27,394
I can't even afford groceries.

759
00:45:27,529 --> 00:45:28,963
- Don't worry about that.

760
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:30,931
Look at this.

761
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:36,770
This is a new start for us as a family.

762
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:37,871
You been complainin' about money,

763
00:45:38,005 --> 00:45:40,207
we'll make some more money here.

764
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:43,244
You been complainin' about
not spendin' time together,

765
00:45:43,377 --> 00:45:46,313
well, we'll all be here as a family.

766
00:45:48,782 --> 00:45:49,718
- I don't know, Phil.

767
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:50,951
- Hey,

768
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:53,254
I'll make it up to you.

769
00:45:55,624 --> 00:45:58,459
Kay, I'm gonna make it up to you.

770
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,430
I know things didn't work
out with the teachin' job,

771
00:46:03,565 --> 00:46:04,932
and I was tired.

772
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:07,569
I wasn't treatin' this family well.

773
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:14,341
But this is a fresh start for
the Robertson family, okay?

774
00:46:15,276 --> 00:46:17,278
Alan and Jase, they can even help.

775
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:26,420
- Look, I know you're a good man.

776
00:46:26,554 --> 00:46:27,988
I fell in love with that.

777
00:46:31,925 --> 00:46:34,028
But it's the drinkin'.

778
00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:38,198
How's bein' in a bar gonna help with tha

779
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:42,570
- 'Cause I'll be workin', not drinkin'.

780
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:47,509
Look, you'll keep an eye
on it, I'll keep on it.

781
00:46:50,077 --> 00:46:52,446
I'm gon' make this
work, I want it to work.

782
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:59,353
You know you're the only one for me.

783
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:12,333
I love you.

784
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:22,976
- I love you.

785
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,814
First thing we gotta do

786
00:47:25,946 --> 00:47:27,515
is get that pee smell outta here though,

787
00:47:27,649 --> 00:47:29,416
'cause that is horrible.

788
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:32,953
- I agree.

789
00:47:33,087 --> 00:47:35,155
I thought I had it figured out (chuckles

790
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:37,891
Finally I had arrived.

791
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:39,694
A way to spend time with my family,

792
00:47:39,828 --> 00:47:42,129
makin' more money, and still get to hang

793
00:47:42,262 --> 00:47:44,965
with my buddies and run
with them all night long.

794
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:47,901
- Daddy, when have I dried enough glasse

795
00:47:48,035 --> 00:47:49,169
- That's the point.

796
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:50,938
They drink 'em, we clean 'em,

797
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:54,709
and the whole cycle starts all
over again till closin' time.

798
00:47:54,843 --> 00:47:56,076
You're doin' great, keep goin'.

799
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:59,179
Hey, get some more peanuts in here.

800
00:47:59,913 --> 00:48:00,849
- Okay.

801
00:48:00,981 --> 00:48:02,650
- Hey, Phil, get over here.

802
00:48:02,784 --> 00:48:05,152
I got a couple of friends I would like

803
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:07,254
to introduce you to.

804
00:48:10,257 --> 00:48:14,128
- Miss Kay, I'm dyin' here.

805
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:15,764
- Hold on, Billy.

806
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,197
Don't think I don't see you there actin'

807
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:18,666
like you haven't already
drank the Mississippi

808
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,635
and spent your paycheck tonight.

809
00:48:26,641 --> 00:48:28,942
- Why don't you
scoot on over a little bit.

810
00:48:30,477 --> 00:48:31,880
- I'm tired of your disrespect!

811
00:48:32,012 --> 00:48:33,615
- What is disrespectful about askin' you

812
00:48:33,748 --> 00:48:35,650
to spend one day with your family?

813
00:48:35,784 --> 00:48:36,818
- That's all you do!

814
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,687
Nag, nag, nag, nag, nag!

815
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:41,321
- The boys wanna see their daddy!

816
00:48:41,455 --> 00:48:43,892
- Oh, don't use your boys to guilt me!

817
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,029
- Don't act like I don't
know what you've been up to.

818
00:48:49,163 --> 00:48:51,131
You been out drinkin'
that moonshine again.

819
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:52,366
I can see it in your eyes.

820
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:54,268
- What the hell does that matter to you?

821
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:56,805
- 'Cause it makes you
act like a wild animal.

822
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:58,071
- Oh, you wanna see a wild animal?

823
00:48:58,205 --> 00:48:59,541
Here you go!

824
00:49:28,536 --> 00:49:32,874
- Uncle Si!

825
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,177
- Come here, boys!

826
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:40,380
What about it?

827
00:49:40,515 --> 00:49:41,616
Oh, man.

828
00:49:42,517 --> 00:49:43,885
Oh, look at you.

829
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:46,253
Man, y'all growin' faster than
green grass through a goose.

830
00:49:46,386 --> 00:49:47,755
- We missed you, Uncle Si.

831
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:49,089
- Oh, buddy, I missed you, too.

832
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:50,859
I missed you, too.

833
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:51,960
Where's your mama?

834
00:49:52,092 --> 00:49:53,561
- Inside.
- Miss Kay!

835
00:49:57,565 --> 00:49:58,867
- You can't catch me, Jase.

836
00:50:00,635 --> 00:50:03,671
- Get him, Alan!
- Tag, you're it.

837
00:50:06,574 --> 00:50:09,376
- Tag.
- Oh, I got you back.

838
00:50:09,511 --> 00:50:11,245
- He becomes the devil, Si.

839
00:50:12,145 --> 00:50:14,147
- Mm hm.

840
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:16,183
- I've seen it in his eyes.

841
00:50:18,953 --> 00:50:20,454
But it ain't him.

842
00:50:21,923 --> 00:50:24,692
You know that ain't your brother.

843
00:50:26,561 --> 00:50:29,664
- Yeah, well, maybe not,
but I mean, come on,

844
00:50:29,797 --> 00:50:31,231
you don't deserve this.

845
00:50:32,567 --> 00:50:34,702
You're raisin' three boys on your own.

846
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:41,174
- I don't know what I deserve.

847
00:50:44,244 --> 00:50:48,148
Besides, what would
leavin' do to the boys?

848
00:50:49,249 --> 00:50:50,618
They love their daddy.

849
00:50:50,752 --> 00:50:52,386
- Go long, Jase!

850
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,420
- Okay.

851
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:57,792
- I know it sounds crazy, Si,

852
00:50:59,994 --> 00:51:02,630
but I just know deep in my heart

853
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,535
this family is gon' work out.

854
00:51:18,947 --> 00:51:19,847
- Well,

855
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:22,917
you know he ain't gonna change,

856
00:51:23,051 --> 00:51:24,652
not unless he stops drinkin'.

857
00:51:26,754 --> 00:51:27,655
- I know.

858
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:37,230
But you know, my Nanny
told me that someday

859
00:51:38,198 --> 00:51:40,602
you gonna have to fight for your marriag

860
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:47,207
When things get tough, that's what you d

861
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:51,913
You fight.

862
00:52:02,189 --> 00:52:05,560
- Excuse me, ladies, gimme one second.

863
00:52:09,363 --> 00:52:10,464
Hey, Phil?

864
00:52:14,102 --> 00:52:15,670
There's someone here to see you.

865
00:52:25,747 --> 00:52:27,280
- Who's responsible for this?

866
00:52:27,414 --> 00:52:29,884
- Do you know where you'd
go if you die tonight?

867
00:52:30,885 --> 00:52:31,653
- Jan?

868
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,354
- Hi, Phil.

869
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:36,323
- What you doin' here, Jan?

870
00:52:36,456 --> 00:52:38,559
- Well, you ain't returned
my calls in forever,

871
00:52:38,693 --> 00:52:40,628
so I thought I'd check in on you.

872
00:52:41,663 --> 00:52:43,330
- This your new boyfriend?

873
00:52:43,463 --> 00:52:47,367
- Phil Robertson, this
is Pastor Bill Smith.

874
00:52:48,102 --> 00:52:50,905
- How you doin' there, Phil?

875
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:53,407
- What ya sellin' preacher man?

876
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:58,311
- Naw, we ain't sellin'
nothin', just offerin'.

877
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:01,115
Just God and the good news.

878
00:53:03,518 --> 00:53:05,620
- Don't you read "Times Magazine?"

879
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:07,755
God is dead.

880
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:12,392
- Yeah, that's not been my experience.

881
00:53:13,393 --> 00:53:17,065
But I have been in here less than maybe

882
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:20,535
a minute or two and I can already see

883
00:53:20,668 --> 00:53:23,137
you got one mighty chip on your shoulder

884
00:53:29,644 --> 00:53:31,713
- I should knock you out right here.

885
00:53:32,513 --> 00:53:33,948
- You can try.

886
00:53:34,082 --> 00:53:34,982
- Oh.

887
00:53:36,684 --> 00:53:38,086
Tall words from a preacher man

888
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:40,855
who can't do nothin' about it.

889
00:53:42,056 --> 00:53:43,858
- Jesus says I got to forgive you,

890
00:53:46,194 --> 00:53:50,098
but that don't mean he
won't forgive me, too.

891
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,331
- Phil.

892
00:53:52,734 --> 00:53:56,303
- Jan, why you bringin' a
preacher man around here?

893
00:53:57,772 --> 00:54:01,374
- Well, I heard you might be needin' one

894
00:54:03,711 --> 00:54:05,813
- Preachers ain't welcome 'round here.

895
00:54:07,782 --> 00:54:08,750
- Let's go, Jan.

896
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,953
He ain't ready yet.

897
00:54:12,086 --> 00:54:13,187
How you doin', Ma'am?

898
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,287
Excuse me.
- Jan, you should stay.

899
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:15,957
Have a drink.

900
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:17,759
- I'm gonna be prayin' for you.

901
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:22,496
- Then you'll be wastin' your time.

902
00:54:23,698 --> 00:54:25,733
- All right then.

903
00:54:25,867 --> 00:54:27,869
All right, God bless yourself.

904
00:54:35,475 --> 00:54:36,778
- You put her up to it.

905
00:54:36,911 --> 00:54:38,045
- I didn't.

906
00:54:38,179 --> 00:54:39,814
I swear, I didn't know
she was comin' around.

907
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:41,549
- Don't lie to me.

908
00:54:41,682 --> 00:54:43,785
I saw the way she was lookin' at you.

909
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:48,455
This is just you tryin' to control me.

910
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:49,389
All of you.

911
00:54:49,524 --> 00:54:51,826
- Phil, please, please.

912
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:54,529
- I swear to God, you better
hold that tongue of yours.

913
00:54:54,662 --> 00:54:56,197
- Phil, you're hurtin' my arm.

914
00:54:56,329 --> 00:54:58,431
- If I found out you been tellin'
people about our business-

915
00:54:58,566 --> 00:55:00,400
- Phil, you're hurtin' me.

916
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:19,687
- What'll it be, boys?

917
00:55:19,821 --> 00:55:20,888
Hm?

918
00:55:21,022 --> 00:55:23,390
- Hey, sweetheart, that
pie recipe she gave me,

919
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:25,325
my boys, they go crazy for it

920
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:26,694
They do.

921
00:55:27,695 --> 00:55:28,663
- Where you been?

922
00:55:28,796 --> 00:55:30,631
Pretty late for grocery shoppin'.

923
00:55:30,765 --> 00:55:32,733
- Well, when am I supposed to go?

924
00:55:32,867 --> 00:55:34,602
Been at the bar all day, Phil.

925
00:55:34,735 --> 00:55:36,469
- You were with him, weren't ya?

926
00:55:36,604 --> 00:55:38,539
- What are you talkin' about?

927
00:55:38,673 --> 00:55:39,472
- That guy from the bar.

928
00:55:43,044 --> 00:55:44,245
- Phil, I'm tired.

929
00:55:44,377 --> 00:55:46,514
It's been a long day and you been drinki

930
00:55:46,647 --> 00:55:48,516
through most of it.

931
00:55:48,649 --> 00:55:51,519
- My drinkin' ain't got
nothin' to do with it.

932
00:55:51,652 --> 00:55:54,222
How long you been
runnin' 'round on me, hm?

933
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:56,724
Answer the damn question.

934
00:55:57,692 --> 00:56:00,161
- I ain't runnin' around on you.

935
00:56:00,895 --> 00:56:02,462
- I know you're lyin'.

936
00:56:04,065 --> 00:56:06,399
- Phil, I ain't havin'
this conversation now.

937
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:07,702
Not when you're drunk.

938
00:56:07,835 --> 00:56:09,136
- I ain't the problem.

939
00:56:10,104 --> 00:56:11,272
You're the problem.

940
00:56:11,404 --> 00:56:13,107
You're ruinin' my life!

941
00:56:13,241 --> 00:56:14,575
- Oh, yeah?

942
00:56:14,709 --> 00:56:18,079
Well, you been ruinin' mine for 10 years

943
00:56:21,315 --> 00:56:22,415
- Get out.

944
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:26,254
Get out and take your kids with you.

945
00:57:02,523 --> 00:57:03,858
- Good Lord, Phil.

946
00:57:05,826 --> 00:57:07,628
I can't hardly believe that.

947
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,937
- I can't believe the thought
of what I did most days.

948
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:22,877
But that was a point
where I'd lost it all.

949
00:57:25,413 --> 00:57:26,514
Kay,

950
00:57:28,716 --> 00:57:29,817
the boys,

951
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:32,219
the bar.

952
00:57:34,088 --> 00:57:34,989
Bingo.

953
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:37,925
Just like that.

954
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,423
- Kay, what's happenin'?

955
00:58:09,557 --> 00:58:10,925
What's goin' on? Come in.

956
00:58:11,058 --> 00:58:11,959
Come on in.

957
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:29,610
- Thanks.

958
00:58:34,548 --> 00:58:36,584
- You can stay as long as you want.

959
00:58:39,754 --> 00:58:41,655
- I can't trouble you like that.

960
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:44,792
- Trust me, it's no trouble at all.

961
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,929
- You're not worried
about Phil findin' out?

962
00:58:50,898 --> 00:58:52,199
- He kicked you out.

963
00:58:57,805 --> 00:59:00,408
Why don't you go freshen up?

964
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:01,909
I'll listen for Willie.

965
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:10,985
- Thank you, Jan.

966
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:13,054
- Of course.

967
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:11,205
- Are you okay, Mama?

968
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:15,644
Mama?

969
01:01:15,776 --> 01:01:16,877
- Hey.

970
01:01:17,912 --> 01:01:19,380
What's goin' on?

971
01:01:19,514 --> 01:01:20,848
- It's Mama.

972
01:01:24,418 --> 01:01:27,421
- Okay, okay, just go
back to bed, all right?

973
01:01:27,556 --> 01:01:28,289
Back to bed.

974
01:01:28,422 --> 01:01:29,323
I'll check.

975
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:35,062
Kay?

976
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:44,939
Kay, are you all right?

977
01:02:22,276 --> 01:02:26,313
- I was thinkin' about
somethin' real stupid.

978
01:02:34,556 --> 01:02:36,390
I was about to do it.

979
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:44,498
I just kept thinkin' about
those boys.

980
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,506
I'm their mama.

981
01:02:53,675 --> 01:02:56,711
I can't just leave 'em alone.

982
01:02:56,844 --> 01:02:58,345
- No, you can't.

983
01:03:04,686 --> 01:03:09,323
- I really believed it was
gon' work out with Phil.

984
01:03:11,058 --> 01:03:12,359
I really did.

985
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:22,102
But it's over.

986
01:03:24,872 --> 01:03:27,441
I just don't know what to do.

987
01:03:34,248 --> 01:03:35,149
- Well,

988
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:42,557
you can start by gettin'
up off the bathroom floor.

989
01:03:48,663 --> 01:03:54,101
When I was little, and
Mama was in the hospital,

990
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:57,971
and Daddy was on the oil rigs,

991
01:04:00,374 --> 01:04:03,010
I used to cry myself to sleep every nigh

992
01:04:05,846 --> 01:04:06,947
And then

993
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:10,184
one Sunday,

994
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:14,723
I heard the preacher down at church sayi

995
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:16,957
that at some point in our lives,

996
01:04:18,225 --> 01:04:23,263
we are all going to
feel desperately alone,

997
01:04:25,399 --> 01:04:30,371
like we're the only soul
in the whole entire world,

998
01:04:30,505 --> 01:04:34,241
and that that would be
the most important moment

999
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:36,343
in our whole entire lives

1000
01:04:37,579 --> 01:04:42,383
because when we realize that with Jesus,

1001
01:04:43,984 --> 01:04:46,019
we ain't never alone.

1002
01:04:48,922 --> 01:04:50,023
So,

1003
01:04:52,059 --> 01:04:54,995
I stopped cryin' myself to sleep at nigh

1004
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:59,266
and I started prayin' instead.

1005
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:04,438
I'll watch the boys tomorrow.

1006
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,542
There's someone you gotta go see.

1007
01:05:23,056 --> 01:05:24,992
- Hey, that was a good one.

1008
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:26,160
I appreciate ya.

1009
01:05:26,293 --> 01:05:29,564
God bless ya, I'll see ya on Wednesday.

1010
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:40,474
- Pastor Smith?

1011
01:05:40,608 --> 01:05:41,876
- Yeah?

1012
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:43,110
- Hi.

1013
01:05:43,812 --> 01:05:44,978
I'm Kay Robertson.

1014
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:47,649
- Right.

1015
01:05:47,782 --> 01:05:49,349
Jan told me you might stop by.

1016
01:05:49,483 --> 01:05:51,051
It's good to see you again, Miss Kay.

1017
01:05:51,185 --> 01:05:52,453
It's been a bit.

1018
01:05:53,187 --> 01:05:56,658
- I'm really sorry about my husband.

1019
01:05:58,459 --> 01:06:01,428
The first time at the bar-

1020
01:06:01,563 --> 01:06:02,764
- Would it surprise you if I told you

1021
01:06:02,897 --> 01:06:04,532
I get that reaction a lot?

1022
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,202
- I guess not.

1023
01:06:09,102 --> 01:06:10,370
- How's your husband?

1024
01:06:16,611 --> 01:06:19,079
- He kicked us outta the house yesterday

1025
01:06:20,347 --> 01:06:21,683
Me and my three boys.

1026
01:06:25,854 --> 01:06:27,387
- Sorry to hear that.

1027
01:06:30,257 --> 01:06:32,459
- Look, Jan said to come talk to you,

1028
01:06:34,228 --> 01:06:36,430
maybe you might be able to help us out.

1029
01:06:37,866 --> 01:06:42,302
But I don't really know
what I'm doin' here,

1030
01:06:43,403 --> 01:06:46,039
or what even to say and...

1031
01:06:52,412 --> 01:06:57,284
I guess I got into some
trouble last night,

1032
01:06:59,152 --> 01:07:00,187
thinkin' about some things

1033
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,256
I shouldn't have been thinkin' about.

1034
01:07:04,726 --> 01:07:05,627
And...

1035
01:07:06,995 --> 01:07:08,295
I'm really sorry.

1036
01:07:08,428 --> 01:07:10,163
You must be so busy.

1037
01:07:10,297 --> 01:07:11,699
- It's not a problem.

1038
01:07:13,735 --> 01:07:14,636
Truly.

1039
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:19,172
You know, Miss Kay, it's the strangest

1040
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:20,340
thing you should come by.

1041
01:07:20,474 --> 01:07:23,343
I was just now right now in a meetin'

1042
01:07:23,477 --> 01:07:25,145
and we was talkin' about what

1043
01:07:25,279 --> 01:07:26,681
to do with one of our little places

1044
01:07:26,814 --> 01:07:28,282
that just became vacant.

1045
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:32,452
In fact, it's right over there.

1046
01:07:33,086 --> 01:07:34,689
It's right across the street.

1047
01:07:35,422 --> 01:07:36,524
Now, does that sound like somethin'

1048
01:07:36,658 --> 01:07:38,826
you and your boys might be interested in

1049
01:07:44,498 --> 01:07:47,267
- I don't know what to say, Pastor Smith

1050
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:49,571
- Just Bill is fine.

1051
01:07:51,706 --> 01:07:54,576
Or Pastor Bill if you wanna be formal, h

1052
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,078
- Come on.

1053
01:08:06,486 --> 01:08:08,590
- So we live here now?

1054
01:08:09,524 --> 01:08:10,424
- Yeah.

1055
01:08:11,826 --> 01:08:13,061
This is a gift.

1056
01:08:13,928 --> 01:08:15,964
We're gonna take real
good care of it, you hear?

1057
01:08:26,007 --> 01:08:29,276
- Kay got a job
and took care of the boys.

1058
01:08:29,409 --> 01:08:30,812
She was determined to make somethin'

1059
01:08:30,945 --> 01:08:32,446
of a life for them.

1060
01:08:34,616 --> 01:08:38,019
As for me, I finally had my freedom,

1061
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:42,189
but it certainly didn't feel
like I thought it would.

1062
01:08:44,525 --> 01:08:45,425
- Phil!

1063
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:50,364
Phil, you in there?

1064
01:08:55,202 --> 01:08:56,904
As I live and breathe.

1065
01:08:57,605 --> 01:09:00,173
Man, I got a call from Nancy
down at the sheriff's station.

1066
01:09:00,307 --> 01:09:01,876
They found your truck completely totaled

1067
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:03,578
but couldn't find your body.

1068
01:09:05,613 --> 01:09:07,280
I done a lotta crazy things in my life

1069
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:08,950
but I ain't never done smashed

1070
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:10,518
my truck up good enough to be canned

1071
01:09:10,652 --> 01:09:12,352
and put on the shelf in it.

1072
01:09:15,155 --> 01:09:16,691
- Who's a man?

1073
01:09:19,894 --> 01:09:21,261
- Hell, I'd offer to help you clean up,

1074
01:09:21,395 --> 01:09:24,098
but this is a lost cause.

1075
01:09:27,135 --> 01:09:28,603
This a gar hole, son.

1076
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:33,373
- What's the day?

1077
01:09:34,575 --> 01:09:36,077
- Sunday.

1078
01:10:08,042 --> 01:10:10,210
- Mama, can we take those?

1079
01:10:10,812 --> 01:10:11,579
- No, Alan.

1080
01:10:11,713 --> 01:10:12,847
Those are for kids that don't get

1081
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,682
no presents at Christmas.

1082
01:10:17,417 --> 01:10:18,519
Okay.

1083
01:10:19,754 --> 01:10:20,521
But just a few.

1084
01:10:20,655 --> 01:10:22,156
Leave some for the other kids.

1085
01:10:55,156 --> 01:10:56,224
- Get outta here!

1086
01:10:56,356 --> 01:10:57,457
Go!

1087
01:11:00,595 --> 01:11:03,898
- She can't help it, it's
in her blood or somethin'.

1088
01:11:04,031 --> 01:11:06,200
- We got that blood in us?

1089
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:07,602
- Don't know, but we'll always

1090
01:11:07,735 --> 01:11:10,605
look out for each other won't we?

1091
01:11:10,738 --> 01:11:13,074
- You mean that, Phil?

1092
01:11:13,207 --> 01:11:14,675
- Of course I do, Jan.

1093
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:29,422
- Are we there yet?
- Are we there yet?

1094
01:11:29,557 --> 01:11:30,658
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

1095
01:11:30,792 --> 01:11:33,027
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

1096
01:11:33,161 --> 01:11:34,896
- Uncle Si, how much further?

1097
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:36,197
- Oh, Lord.

1098
01:11:36,329 --> 01:11:37,397
What did I say?

1099
01:11:37,532 --> 01:11:39,133
- If we come, no complainin'.

1100
01:11:39,267 --> 01:11:41,035
- Uh huh, what are you doin', Alan?

1101
01:11:41,169 --> 01:11:42,937
Jase, what's he doin'?

1102
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:44,005
- Complaining.

1103
01:11:44,138 --> 01:11:45,940
- That's right, uh huh.

1104
01:11:49,409 --> 01:11:52,379
Phil, it's Si, are you in there?

1105
01:11:59,419 --> 01:12:01,321
- You made it back.

1106
01:12:06,828 --> 01:12:07,728
- I did.

1107
01:12:10,064 --> 01:12:10,965
I did.

1108
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:14,068
It's good to see ya.

1109
01:12:15,468 --> 01:12:17,138
Look, I knew I'd find you out here,

1110
01:12:17,271 --> 01:12:18,539
but maybe I shoulda called,

1111
01:12:18,673 --> 01:12:21,542
givin' ya time to clean
up the place a bit.

1112
01:12:23,611 --> 01:12:26,714
Ya ain't gotta live like
no wild man anymore, Phil.

1113
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,589
- It's better for me out here.

1114
01:12:34,722 --> 01:12:36,891
- Oh, Phil, how's that?

1115
01:12:37,892 --> 01:12:39,527
- I don't have to be anything but me.

1116
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:42,163
- Well, that may be true,

1117
01:12:42,296 --> 01:12:44,464
but hey, I think you should come back.

1118
01:12:44,599 --> 01:12:45,700
You know?

1119
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:48,703
Work on some things.

1120
01:12:51,906 --> 01:12:53,440
- And what work would I need?

1121
01:12:53,574 --> 01:12:57,410
- Well, I been hearin'
about a lotta things.

1122
01:13:01,448 --> 01:13:02,449
Ain't much from fit to talk about

1123
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:05,385
in front of little ears, though.

1124
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:06,954
- Daddy?

1125
01:13:08,589 --> 01:13:09,991
- Al?

1126
01:13:10,124 --> 01:13:11,025
Jase?

1127
01:13:12,693 --> 01:13:15,029
What you doin' here, boys?

1128
01:13:16,664 --> 01:13:17,765
Come on, now.

1129
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:21,401
Ain't ya gonna give your pa a hug?

1130
01:13:21,535 --> 01:13:22,502
What?

1131
01:13:22,637 --> 01:13:24,138
What, you don't recognize me?

1132
01:13:24,272 --> 01:13:27,375
- Hey, Jase, hey, hey, hey,
hey, it's okay, it's okay.

1133
01:13:27,508 --> 01:13:28,876
You all right?

1134
01:13:30,511 --> 01:13:33,047
- I think y'all should leave.

1135
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,181
- Yeah.

1136
01:13:34,315 --> 01:13:36,717
- Say hi to your mama for me, boys.

1137
01:13:36,851 --> 01:13:39,687
- You change your mind-
- I'll see ya around, Si.

1138
01:13:40,621 --> 01:13:41,589
- Come on, boys.

1139
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:55,403
- All right, boys, hungry?

1140
01:13:55,536 --> 01:13:57,305
- Eat, eat!
- Yeah.

1141
01:13:59,206 --> 01:14:01,075
- Alan, you wanna lead us?

1142
01:14:01,976 --> 01:14:03,077
Good boy.

1143
01:14:05,579 --> 01:14:08,382
- Dear Jesus, I miss my daddy.

1144
01:14:08,516 --> 01:14:10,051
Please make him a good man.

1145
01:14:11,419 --> 01:14:12,485
- Amen.

1146
01:14:14,989 --> 01:14:15,890
All right.

1147
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:18,458
What do you want?

1148
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:20,328
Some of this?

1149
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:21,595
- They're yum.

1150
01:14:21,729 --> 01:14:24,999
- All right.

1151
01:14:25,132 --> 01:14:26,400
- Thank you.

1152
01:15:12,947 --> 01:15:16,250
- You're the only girl for me.

1153
01:15:17,585 --> 01:15:20,054
- You gon' make a good dad.

1154
01:15:20,855 --> 01:15:22,289
I'm proud of you.

1155
01:15:23,657 --> 01:15:24,825
I love you.

1156
01:16:24,785 --> 01:16:27,054
- I can't.

1157
01:16:27,188 --> 01:16:28,089
I can't!

1158
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:30,791
I can't!

1159
01:17:47,968 --> 01:17:50,037
- You drunk right now?

1160
01:17:57,211 --> 01:17:58,746
- Nope.

1161
01:18:10,724 --> 01:18:13,727
I think I saw him, Miss Kay.

1162
01:18:17,798 --> 01:18:19,266
- Who?

1163
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:23,237
- The devil.

1164
01:18:31,812 --> 01:18:34,381
I think he might be me.

1165
01:18:43,157 --> 01:18:45,292
I'll quit drinkin' this time.

1166
01:18:45,426 --> 01:18:47,161
I promise.

1167
01:18:47,294 --> 01:18:48,195
- No.

1168
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:52,933
I'm done with promisin'.

1169
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:00,241
- Kay!

1170
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:03,010
I'm sorry.

1171
01:19:03,744 --> 01:19:05,112
I messed it all up.

1172
01:19:05,246 --> 01:19:06,313
Miss Kay!

1173
01:19:10,552 --> 01:19:11,452
- Phil,

1174
01:19:15,724 --> 01:19:17,091
you need help.

1175
01:19:20,294 --> 01:19:22,796
More help than me and
the boys can give ya.

1176
01:19:27,468 --> 01:19:29,169
You need to change.

1177
01:19:36,544 --> 01:19:37,512
- Miss Kay,

1178
01:19:40,114 --> 01:19:42,249
I'll do anything for you and the boys.

1179
01:19:46,588 --> 01:19:47,488
Anything.

1180
01:19:50,592 --> 01:19:51,492
I swear.

1181
01:20:09,443 --> 01:20:10,811
Gimme a minute.

1182
01:20:10,944 --> 01:20:12,846
- It's really okay, Phil.

1183
01:20:17,851 --> 01:20:18,952
Uh...

1184
01:20:21,889 --> 01:20:23,123
You know,

1185
01:20:24,858 --> 01:20:26,728
it's beautiful out back.

1186
01:20:26,894 --> 01:20:27,796
You wanna?

1187
01:20:27,928 --> 01:20:28,730
How 'bout you meet me out there?

1188
01:21:06,701 --> 01:21:07,434
- Nah.

1189
01:21:09,269 --> 01:21:11,706
Not quite sure what to say.

1190
01:21:12,741 --> 01:21:15,476
- Just say whatever's
on your mind, Phil.

1191
01:21:29,557 --> 01:21:31,125
- I guess it were...

1192
01:21:35,329 --> 01:21:38,399
Everything I ever touch is goin' to hell

1193
01:21:41,135 --> 01:21:44,672
- You know what I would do if everything

1194
01:21:44,806 --> 01:21:46,574
I touched went to hell?

1195
01:21:50,077 --> 01:21:51,178
- What's that?

1196
01:22:06,026 --> 01:22:08,429
- I'd quit touchin' things.

1197
01:22:16,437 --> 01:22:20,040
Do you know what most
stories have in common?

1198
01:22:23,377 --> 01:22:26,980
Most of 'em are about

1199
01:22:29,149 --> 01:22:31,418
climbin' the mountain,

1200
01:22:32,085 --> 01:22:34,556
becomin' a God,

1201
01:22:36,825 --> 01:22:39,226
provin' just how good you are,

1202
01:22:40,093 --> 01:22:42,229
that you're good enough.

1203
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:50,738
It's a whole different story.

1204
01:22:56,376 --> 01:23:00,447
This is about God comin'
down from the mountain,

1205
01:23:02,316 --> 01:23:07,221
comin' to you, tellin' you,

1206
01:23:08,322 --> 01:23:12,159
"Phil, you ain't got nothin' to prove."

1207
01:23:18,365 --> 01:23:20,501
Hey, that chip on your shoulder,

1208
01:23:22,369 --> 01:23:25,072
shame you've had your whole life.

1209
01:23:27,976 --> 01:23:30,344
It don't mean nothin' to Him.

1210
01:23:31,546 --> 01:23:33,113
In fact,

1211
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:39,721
He come down to take that away.

1212
01:23:48,563 --> 01:23:51,666
- That sounds too good to be true.

1213
01:23:53,133 --> 01:23:54,234
- Oh,

1214
01:23:56,871 --> 01:23:59,373
it's too good for all of us.

1215
01:24:03,076 --> 01:24:04,712
- How's it happen?

1216
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:08,248
- You got to die, Phil.

1217
01:24:13,655 --> 01:24:16,658
And then you need to be born again.

1218
01:24:30,237 --> 01:24:31,405
- I'm ready.

1219
01:24:43,985 --> 01:24:46,153
- Your daddy's lived a hard life.

1220
01:24:49,122 --> 01:24:50,324
That ends today.

1221
01:24:52,961 --> 01:24:54,662
We gon' bury that old man.

1222
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,335
This dirty river water represents a grav

1223
01:25:02,269 --> 01:25:07,441
But, a new man is gonna rise up.

1224
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:11,512
Phil, from this day forth,

1225
01:25:11,646 --> 01:25:14,214
who's gonna be the lord in your life?

1226
01:25:14,348 --> 01:25:15,817
- Jesus Christ.

1227
01:25:17,284 --> 01:25:19,119
- With that confession,

1228
01:25:19,252 --> 01:25:20,922
I baptize you in the
name of the Father, Son,

1229
01:25:21,055 --> 01:25:24,792
and Holy Ghost for the
forgiveness of your sins.

1230
01:25:38,673 --> 01:25:39,574
You ready?

1231
01:26:15,943 --> 01:26:17,377
All right brother!

1232
01:26:20,313 --> 01:26:21,015
Woo!

1233
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:34,595
- Good boy.

1234
01:26:38,066 --> 01:26:39,399
- I know.

1235
01:26:39,534 --> 01:26:41,234
- Daddy?
- Hm?

1236
01:26:41,368 --> 01:26:43,037
- When do you have to leave?

1237
01:26:43,171 --> 01:26:44,105
- What you mean?

1238
01:26:44,237 --> 01:26:45,372
- Don't you got somewhere to be?

1239
01:26:45,506 --> 01:26:48,375
- I ain't got nowhere to be.

1240
01:26:48,509 --> 01:26:50,611
You good with that?

1241
01:26:50,745 --> 01:26:51,478
All right.

1242
01:27:04,926 --> 01:27:06,493
- Mm, smells good.

1243
01:27:25,479 --> 01:27:27,849
Hey, Jase, lemme see that.

1244
01:27:35,455 --> 01:27:36,824
Thanks, buddy.

1245
01:28:02,617 --> 01:28:06,053
- You gonna buy Jase a
new one now you broke it?

1246
01:28:06,187 --> 01:28:08,790
- I didn't break it, just fixin' it.

1247
01:28:15,362 --> 01:28:18,065
You know, I had a moment today.

1248
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:23,037
Maybe bein' sober for the
first time in a long time.

1249
01:28:25,907 --> 01:28:28,009
Lots of people make duck calls, right?

1250
01:28:28,142 --> 01:28:29,844
They sound like ducks, sure,

1251
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:32,013
but pintails sure don't
sound like a mallard,

1252
01:28:32,146 --> 01:28:36,918
just as much as I don't
sound like you when I talk.

1253
01:28:37,051 --> 01:28:37,785
- So what?

1254
01:28:37,919 --> 01:28:38,953
- "So what?"

1255
01:28:48,629 --> 01:28:50,463
- Thanks for bein' here today.

1256
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,968
Meant a lot to the boys.

1257
01:29:01,108 --> 01:29:02,109
- I've been tryin'.

1258
01:29:06,547 --> 01:29:08,082
- You been tryin'.

1259
01:29:11,552 --> 01:29:14,454
- I know it ain't been perfect.

1260
01:29:16,356 --> 01:29:17,457
- No.

1261
01:29:19,594 --> 01:29:23,865
Truth is, I been fightin'
for us for 10 years.

1262
01:29:26,734 --> 01:29:28,569
I just had nothin' left in me.

1263
01:29:31,939 --> 01:29:34,609
Then I saw you get baptized in that rive

1264
01:29:34,742 --> 01:29:36,644
and I was

1265
01:29:37,612 --> 01:29:39,146
I was full.

1266
01:29:40,214 --> 01:29:41,616
I was so full of joy.

1267
01:29:47,555 --> 01:29:49,090
My heart was so full,

1268
01:29:52,526 --> 01:29:55,029
and I had this little voice.

1269
01:29:58,266 --> 01:30:00,868
This naggin' voice sayin'

1270
01:30:01,002 --> 01:30:03,871
it's just gonna start all over again.

1271
01:30:05,539 --> 01:30:07,575
And you was gonna break our hearts.

1272
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:11,679
- I'm sorry, Miss Kay.

1273
01:30:13,581 --> 01:30:14,682
Truly.

1274
01:30:17,118 --> 01:30:20,487
I never wanna put you through that again

1275
01:30:25,993 --> 01:30:28,729
- You remember why you quit football?

1276
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,135
- It was huntin' season.

1277
01:30:35,736 --> 01:30:37,405
- Well, partly 'cause you are stubborn

1278
01:30:37,538 --> 01:30:39,140
as an ox stuck in mud.

1279
01:30:43,044 --> 01:30:46,479
But the other part, that
was 'cause you wanted

1280
01:30:46,614 --> 01:30:48,716
to take care of us.

1281
01:30:50,117 --> 01:30:54,487
Take care of your family
just like you always had.

1282
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:58,659
Now look, I know you're gonna stumble.

1283
01:30:58,793 --> 01:31:01,762
I know it ain't gon' be perfect.

1284
01:31:04,398 --> 01:31:06,901
But maybe if you just keep that in mind,

1285
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:13,074
how much you really do love your family.

1286
01:31:14,108 --> 01:31:15,009
- Yeah.

1287
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:19,947
Maybe it might be right
to get away from it all.

1288
01:31:20,715 --> 01:31:22,950
Old friends, temptation.

1289
01:31:26,053 --> 01:31:28,255
We'll get ourselves a little place.

1290
01:31:28,389 --> 01:31:30,558
I could fish the river.

1291
01:31:32,026 --> 01:31:36,097
- Well now, that might be an idea, Phil.

1292
01:31:40,701 --> 01:31:42,203
Merry Christmas.

1293
01:31:43,804 --> 01:31:45,573
- Merry Christmas, Miss Kay.

1294
01:32:17,104 --> 01:32:21,275
Before I came along, everyone
thought the duck calls people

1295
01:32:21,409 --> 01:32:22,910
were makin' were great,

1296
01:32:23,044 --> 01:32:27,548
but truth is, they were missin' somethin

1297
01:32:27,681 --> 01:32:28,949
They looked the same.

1298
01:32:29,083 --> 01:32:30,418
You know, one duck call
looked like another,

1299
01:32:30,551 --> 01:32:35,790
but on the inside, somethin' had changed

1300
01:32:41,495 --> 01:32:42,897
Turns out,

1301
01:32:45,699 --> 01:32:48,035
that could make all the difference.

1302
01:33:04,752 --> 01:33:05,853
- Phil?

1303
01:33:06,587 --> 01:33:07,321
Phil?

1304
01:33:09,723 --> 01:33:11,692
There he is.

1305
01:33:14,228 --> 01:33:16,163
My man.

1306
01:33:16,297 --> 01:33:17,465
- Keep it down.

1307
01:33:17,598 --> 01:33:19,100
Everyone's still sleepin' in there.

1308
01:33:19,233 --> 01:33:21,502
- Well, they're missin'
out on the best fish, then.

1309
01:33:21,635 --> 01:33:23,370
We come to get ya, get your things.

1310
01:33:23,504 --> 01:33:25,239
It's a day after Christmas tradition.

1311
01:33:25,372 --> 01:33:26,607
We'll hit the water,

1312
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:29,076
and head to State Line
Road for a party after.

1313
01:33:31,078 --> 01:33:33,047
- I ain't drinkin' anymore, boys.

1314
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:38,352
The Phil you come lookin'
for is dead and buried.

1315
01:33:43,057 --> 01:33:45,493
- Dang, you startin' to scare me, Phil.

1316
01:33:45,626 --> 01:33:49,430
Look, it's been ages
since you partied with us.

1317
01:33:49,564 --> 01:33:50,565
Come on, now.

1318
01:33:50,698 --> 01:33:52,633
You know it's gon' be a grand time.

1319
01:33:52,766 --> 01:33:54,768
Get your freedom back for a night.

1320
01:33:55,836 --> 01:33:57,004
Well?

1321
01:33:57,671 --> 01:33:58,806
What's it gonna be?

1322
01:33:59,773 --> 01:34:00,774
Who's a man?

1323
01:34:49,423 --> 01:34:50,324
- Daddy?

1324
01:34:50,457 --> 01:34:53,360
- Shh, wake your brother.

1325
01:34:53,494 --> 01:34:54,862
Put your warm clothes on.

1326
01:34:54,995 --> 01:34:57,698
Your mama said it was okay.

1327
01:34:57,831 --> 01:34:58,567
Come on.

1328
01:35:11,613 --> 01:35:12,980
Come on, boys.

1329
01:35:16,817 --> 01:35:18,786
Stay close to Daddy.

1330
01:35:20,487 --> 01:35:21,255
Good boy.

1331
01:35:25,859 --> 01:35:30,632
Shh.

1332
01:35:32,099 --> 01:35:33,300
Look right there.

1333
01:35:40,374 --> 01:35:41,710
You try.

1334
01:35:45,846 --> 01:35:46,747
You try boy.

1335
01:35:57,424 --> 01:36:01,462
I started taking the kids
to the woods a lot more,

1336
01:36:01,596 --> 01:36:04,131
teachin' 'em about huntin'.

1337
01:36:04,265 --> 01:36:08,502
I'm just down here, fishin', huntin',

1338
01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:11,472
tryin' to sell these duck calls.

1339
01:36:14,275 --> 01:36:16,777
In the end I guess Kay
got her pioneer lifestyle

1340
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:21,148
and I got my family back,

1341
01:36:23,951 --> 01:36:25,419
not because I deserved it.

1342
01:36:28,188 --> 01:36:29,557
Lord knows I didn't.

1343
01:36:33,227 --> 01:36:35,896
But that's the thing I learned about God

1344
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:41,068
We don't have to be good enough

1345
01:36:43,804 --> 01:36:45,472
'cause he's good enough for us.

1346
01:36:47,174 --> 01:36:49,009
I finally figured it out.

1347
01:36:50,978 --> 01:36:52,379
Just took a little time.

1348
01:37:02,056 --> 01:37:03,257
- Yeah, well,

1349
01:37:06,193 --> 01:37:09,196
seems like I might not have
as much time as I thought.

1350
01:37:12,966 --> 01:37:14,468
- How so?

1351
01:37:19,406 --> 01:37:21,975
- Well, I ain't told
anybody else this but,

1352
01:37:25,446 --> 01:37:26,447
it's my heart.

1353
01:37:34,522 --> 01:37:36,123
I got a aneurysm.

1354
01:37:40,829 --> 01:37:45,165
Doctor said it could be two years,

1355
01:37:46,867 --> 01:37:47,635
two months.

1356
01:37:47,769 --> 01:37:48,869
Heck,

1357
01:37:50,904 --> 01:37:52,005
two days.

1358
01:37:54,743 --> 01:37:56,210
Any moment, really.

1359
01:38:04,284 --> 01:38:08,889
- You called me up and
asked me to tell you

1360
01:38:10,324 --> 01:38:14,662
what I'd heard, how I got out,

1361
01:38:14,796 --> 01:38:16,263
made a life for myself.

1362
01:38:20,067 --> 01:38:24,171
Well, that's the secret, I didn't do it.

1363
01:38:27,274 --> 01:38:30,578
Only God can pull off a move like that

1364
01:38:32,847 --> 01:38:34,616
because of Jesus.

1365
01:38:36,316 --> 01:38:38,520
Stop always makin' it only about me.

1366
01:38:39,888 --> 01:38:40,855
That's what I finally learned,

1367
01:38:40,988 --> 01:38:43,357
how to give my life away.

1368
01:38:46,059 --> 01:38:47,394
Funny thing is, once I gave it up,

1369
01:38:47,529 --> 01:38:49,363
that's when I got it all back.

1370
01:38:50,598 --> 01:38:53,200
Everything I been chasin' all these year

1371
01:38:55,235 --> 01:38:56,538
Funny how that works.

1372
01:38:59,473 --> 01:39:02,577
How you gotta come to the end of yoursel

1373
01:39:04,211 --> 01:39:05,979
to find the beginning of God.

1374
01:39:12,219 --> 01:39:13,655
- I gotta tell you, Phil,

1375
01:39:18,626 --> 01:39:20,595
that's startin' to make a lotta sense.

1376
01:40:06,173 --> 01:40:07,474
- Come on, boys.

1377
01:40:08,843 --> 01:40:11,646
- Hey.

1378
01:40:16,885 --> 01:40:18,887
- Oh, gravy?
- Gravy.

1379
01:40:32,332 --> 01:40:33,902
- We're happy to have you.

1380
01:40:34,034 --> 01:40:35,269
- Thank you.

1381
01:40:38,171 --> 01:40:39,273
- Hello.

1382
01:40:40,107 --> 01:40:41,475
- Thank y'all for comin'.

1383
01:40:44,077 --> 01:40:46,014
Why don't we say a little prayer?

1384
01:40:50,618 --> 01:40:51,519
- Father,

1385
01:40:52,286 --> 01:40:55,155
we thank you for another
great day on planet Earth,

1386
01:40:56,724 --> 01:40:59,393
for the bunch of ducks
we killed this mornin',

1387
01:41:00,127 --> 01:41:01,696
and the grub on this table.

1388
01:41:03,698 --> 01:41:06,734
In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

1389
01:41:08,402 --> 01:41:09,671
- Amen.

1390
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:11,606
- Y'all dig in.

1391
01:41:26,219 --> 01:41:27,120
- Who got that apple butter?

1392
01:41:31,491 --> 01:41:34,696
Stop hoggin' the corn down
there, will you pass it down?

1393
01:43:31,713 --> 01:43:33,748
- Y'all have just witnessed

1394
01:43:33,881 --> 01:43:37,685
what happens when Satan controls a man.

1395
01:43:38,653 --> 01:43:42,322
You've seen it in living color.

1396
01:43:42,456 --> 01:43:46,027
It's embarrassing and shocking,

1397
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:49,864
but y'all saw the initial me.

1398
01:43:50,497 --> 01:43:53,701
The acts of the sinful nature are obviou

1399
01:43:53,835 --> 01:43:57,237
Y'all just saw the acts
of the sinful nature.

1400
01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:58,740
They're obvious.

1401
01:43:58,873 --> 01:44:02,977
Jesus beat death for us, removed our sin

1402
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:07,515
cleans us up and guarantees
he'll raise ya from the dead.

1403
01:44:07,648 --> 01:44:10,618
I wanna remind ya of the
gospel I preach to ya,

1404
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:14,756
which you received, I did, 50 years ago.

1405
01:44:15,890 --> 01:44:19,459
And on which you've
taken your stand, I did.

1406
01:44:20,327 --> 01:44:24,732
I'm standin' on the death barrel
and resurrection of Jesus.

1407
01:44:24,866 --> 01:44:29,771
You really can have love, joy, peace,

1408
01:44:30,538 --> 01:44:33,273
patience, kindness, goodness,

1409
01:44:33,406 --> 01:44:36,778
faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.

1410
01:44:36,911 --> 01:44:40,882
You can have those
qualities for your own life

1411
01:44:41,549 --> 01:44:44,652
if you come to Jesus through faith,

1412
01:44:44,786 --> 01:44:46,554
believe he died before he was buried

1413
01:44:46,687 --> 01:44:48,189
and raised from the dead.

1414
01:44:48,321 --> 01:44:51,959
He's seated at the right
hand of the Father right now.

1415
01:44:52,093 --> 01:44:53,795
It's a wonderful thing,

1416
01:44:53,928 --> 01:44:59,366
and I highly recommend you
just start walking by faith.

1417
01:45:01,501 --> 01:45:05,206
My question is, you got a better story?

1418
01:45:05,338 --> 01:45:06,674
I'd love to hear it.

1419
01:45:06,808 --> 01:45:11,378
We could be wrong, but I doubt it.

1420
01:45:32,633 --> 01:45:33,935
A lotta people said,

1421
01:45:34,068 --> 01:45:38,105
"If you played ahead of Bradshaw at Tech

1422
01:45:39,307 --> 01:45:40,908
and he went on to win four Superbowls,"

1423
01:45:41,042 --> 01:45:44,645
they said, "Man, what in
the world happened to you?"

1424
01:45:47,248 --> 01:45:50,918
I really don't know what
to tell 'em except Bradshaw

1425
01:45:51,052 --> 01:45:54,055
went after the books and
I went after the ducks.

1426
01:45:54,822 --> 01:45:57,390
And I think we're both pretty happy, so.
