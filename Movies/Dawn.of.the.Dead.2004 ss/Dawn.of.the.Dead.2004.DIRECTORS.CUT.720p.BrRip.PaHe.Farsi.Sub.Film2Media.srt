I'm gonna see if the doors
over this way are locked.

I'll check down there.

219

go down that direction,

All right. Okay.

222
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,335
Maybe it's better
you stay here with the gun.

223
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,713
Andre and I will check around.

224

There is no place else.

Well, it's tough shit,

256
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,496
'cause this is our place
and you can't stay here.

257

Yeah. And you
already trashed Metropolis.

Well, these are
all your problems, not mine.

If I put my foot up your ass,
would that be your problem?

Hey, asshole, I'm the one
pointing the gun at you.

264
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,899
He is a cop, CJ.

00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,000
Might be good

353
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,002
to let them know we're alive.

354
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,352
We can get some paint
from Case Hardware.

355
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,147
Use some office doors
to board up the weak spots.

356
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,978
That's a solid plan.

357
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,067
CJ, is it?

358
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,610
- Yeah.
- All right, CJ.

359
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,831
[clears throat]
All right, everybody listen up.

360
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,162
I'm gonna give everybody
a job to do

361
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,000
and I expect you
to do all of it.

362
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,003
I don't want to see
any half-assin'.

363
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,835
Why don't you can start
by cleaning up that mess

364
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,545
you made in Metropolis.

365
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,299
Hey, CJ, look!

366
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,555
Terry.

367
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,849
Take a look at Ben Cozine.

368
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,183
Hey, Ben.

369
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,234
Ben!

370
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:23,402
Christ.

371
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,645
Look at him.

372
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,155
[Ben screeching]

373
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,823
[Bart] Look, he's a twitcher.

374
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,905
TV says you gotta shoot 'em
in the head.

375
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,616
TV said a lot of things
that aren't true.

376
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,165
Well, fuck the fucker.
I told him not to go downstairs.

377
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,678
[Ben screeches]

378
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,188
Let's go.

379
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:02,104
Let's get to work.

380
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,778
[whispering] Holy shit.

381
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,451
[growling]

382
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:14,783

383
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,996
[echoing gunfire]

384
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:27,963
[man 1] Let's do it.

385
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,469
[man 2] All right,
let's pick him up, then.

386
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:31,845
All right.

387
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:35,221
Ready? One, two, three. [groans]

388
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,721
[man 1] One two, all right?

389
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,929
[both] One, two.

390
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,683
- [thud]
- [distant growling]

391
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,143
What are they?

392
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,526
I don't know.

393
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,146
Why are they coming here?

394
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,069
[Kenneth]
Memory, maybe. Instinct.

395
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,201
Maybe they're coming for us.

396
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,412
[echoing gunfire]

397
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,036
- [distant growling]
- [gunfire]

398
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,208
[Ana] Look over there.

399
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,661
There's someone on the roof.

400
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,839
[CJ] Yeah, his name's Andy.

401
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,297
He's alone.

402
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,387
He may as well be on the moon.

403
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,722
[Ana] Poor guy.

404
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,852
What's he pointing at?

405
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,351
[helicopter approaching]

406
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,854
- Helicopter.
- Hey, it's coming.

407
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,733
- [man] Fuckin' A, man!
- [all shouting]

408
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,157
[all] Hey!

409
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,570
[man] Where's he...?

410
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,496
[Ana] Please... What's he doing?
What's he...?

411
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,419
No.

412
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,664
No, I mean, they saw us, so...

413
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,505
They're gonna be
coming back, baby. Don't worry.

414
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,211
They're gonna send somebody,
something.

415
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,546
[Ana] It's safe here.

416
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,471
We'll just wait for them
to come back.

417
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,618
I don't want anybody
sneaking around

418
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,990
and stealing shit.

419
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,491
<i>Comprende?</i>

420
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,417
[lock clicks]

421
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,874
Sweet dreams.

422
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:33,877
[chuckling]

423
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,052
Those assholes
are gonna get us killed.

424
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,222
[Michael sighs]

425
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,011
We have to do something.

426
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,012
I'm not doing anything to create
problems for Luda and me.

427
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,730
The helicopter's
coming back soon.

428
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,058
I hope so.

429
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,022
What's that supposed to mean?

430
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,855
It means it might come
and it might not. We don't know.

431
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,574
[speaking in Russian accent]
What do you mean, not come back?

432
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,868
You said it was coming back!
We have to get to hospital.

433
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,492
Hey, baby, listen, listen.
Don't worry, okay?

434
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,323
This guy, he...
he doesn't know shit.

435
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,034
All right? It's coming back.

436
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,581
Hey, my man, you know,
I hear you talking a lot.

437
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,336
You know,
you're always saying something.

438
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,965
Who the fuck are you
that we should listen, huh?

439
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,796
Were you like Special Ops?
Were you in the Marines?

440
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,506
What the fuck do you do?

441
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,431
I sell televisions at Best Buy.

442
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,599
[chuckling]

443
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,730
[Andre] Wow.

444
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,945
Hey, Officer,

445
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,365
how do you like following a guy
that sells TVs?

446
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,702
About as much as I like
following a guy who steals them.

447
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,240
I'm not following anyone.

448
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,663
I'm going to Fort Pastor
to get my brother.

449

<i>They seem to need

<i>Some basic skills remain.</i>

451
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,382
<i>They don't seem to have much,
if any, reasoning power.</i>

452
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,058
<i>And how does this spread?</i>

453
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,386
[CJ] These guys
are so full of shit.

454
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,429
They're saying
the same damn thing all day.

455
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,015
Tell me something
I don't know, asshole!

456
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,400
<i>I've just been informed
that we're going off the air...</i>

457
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:17,981

She was coming over tonight.

00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,704
I would have
tapped that shit for sure.

466
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:36,711
Bart, dude,
everybody's dead, okay?

467
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,167
Your mom's dead.

00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,881
You think I feel
like I deserve to be here?

529
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,587
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, I don't.

530
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,260
And I'm cool with that.

531
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,141
But, you see, that's not it,

532
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,303
'cause I feel like I'm here
for another reason.

533
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:04,688
I feel like I'm here
to bring that baby on this earth

534
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,403
and give it everything
that I never had.

535
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:16,278
I just want the opportunity
to change things.

536
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,787
[Muzak continues playing]

537
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,209
[Muzak stops]

538
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,229
Shit!

539
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,687
[gunshot]

540
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,907
CJ!

541
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,322
How did you get out?

542
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,199
Who gave you permission
to loot the goddamn stores?

543
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,575
What are we gonna do
about that truck?

544
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,783
We're not gonna do anything
about that truck.

545
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:02,912
There's people in it.

546
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,584
Yeah? And how do you know
they're not fucked up

547
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,128
like everybody else out there?

548
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,376
Well, for one thing,
they're driving a truck.

549
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,083
- [gunfire]
- Oh, and shooting guns.

550
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,668
If we start letting people
in here,

551
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,344
we're gonna
let the wrong ones in

552
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,547
and then I'm dead,
and I don't want to die.

553
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,679
- Who are the wrong ones?
- Nobody here is sick.

554
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,640
I intend on keeping it that way.

555
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,765
I just think...

556
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,433
I did not ask
for your opinion, lady!

557
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,436
If you want to argue,
argue with this.

558
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,234
- [Michael] Hey, take it easy.
- Shut your fucking mouth.

559
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,403
Get the gun out of my face.

560
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,607
You can't turn them away, CJ.
You'll kill them.

561
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:37,531
Tough shit. Self-defense.

562
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,455
- I'm not killing anybody.
- Know what? I'll kill you.

563
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,498
No, no, Stop it, CJ.
Don't do this.

564
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,746
Shut up!

565
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,327
I'll kill each
and every one of you

566
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:47,457
to stay alive,
you hear me?

567
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,709
Get the fucking gun
out of my face!

568
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,836
Oh. You got quite
a mouth on you.

569
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,043
Somebody should show her
how to use it.

570
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,555
Is there a holding cell
in there?

571
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,938
Yeah. Back of the security room.

572
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:07,435
That's real good, man.

573
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,566
You're gonna get us all killed,
dumb-ass!

574
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,352
Fucking traitor.

575
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,271
- Get off me.
- [Andre] Hey.

576
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,489
I hope you got a good plan.

577
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:19,322
Come on.

578
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,950
[distant growling]

579
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:36,881
- Hey! Hurry!
- Through here. Down here.

580
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,267
[Michael] I can't see
a damn thing.

581
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:45,560
[Andre] Me, either.

582
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:49,231
[truck back up alert beeping]

583
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:50,808
Why is he backing up the truck?

584
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,819
[crash]

585
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,154
- Through here!
- Hey!

586
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,332
Shit.

587
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,286
What the fuck?

588
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:12,420
We gotta go out there.

589
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,707
You better throw that bullshit
right out of your head.

590
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,134
I'm not going back out there.
That's not part of the plan.

591
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,632
Change of plan.
I'm gonna open the door.

592
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,588
- No.
- Okay.

593
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:23,682
One, two...

594
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,429
- Don't do it, man.
- ...three.

595
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,854
Come on, man.

596
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:30,639
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

597
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,983
[growling]

598
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,695
- [Andre] Shoot 'em in the head!
- [gunshot]

599
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,948
I don't see anybody.

600
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,535
- Get back inside. They're fine!
- Get back inside!

601
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:44,907
Here you go.

602
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,619
There are six more people
inside the truck!

603
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,167
- Andre, look!
- [growling]

604
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:56,339
[gun clicks]

605
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,684
[moaning]

606
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:08,885
[woman] Thank God.

607
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,222
I couldn't stay
in that fucking truck anymore.

608
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:15,980
[Ana] All right, anybody
who's injured,

609
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,231
let's get you into Metropolis,

610
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,108
right away,
I'll take a look at you.

611
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,655
Let me take a look at her.

612
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,739
Can you help me...
What's your name? Sorry.

613
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:26,741
Uh, Glen. Yeah, sure.

614
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:29,243
Just give me a second
to collect myself, okay?

615
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,541
- Thanks.
- [Ana] Okay.

616
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,289
If you want to wait for me
in there,

617
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,915
I'll take a look at your leg.

618
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:37,213
Can you hold this?

619
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:38,916
Yeah. We're just going
right there.

620
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:41,127
Oh, my arm.

621
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,507
It's okay, ma'am. We'll make you
nice and comfortable.

622
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:45,965
The rest of you, we've got
plenty of food and water.

623
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,260
- Help should be along soon.
- [chuckles]

624
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,016
Help? Did you hear that
from the same jackass

625
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,764
who told us
to go to St. Verbena?

626
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,815
- The church downtown?
- Yeah.

627
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,063
It's the first place I went.

628
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,235
Some dipshit on the radio
said it was safe there.

629
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:00,358
He was wrong.

630
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,194
Is that where
you picked them up?

631
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,366
Well, I got this call on the CB
from that guy Glen,

632
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,535
saying all these folks
were in the chapel.

633
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,113
He's a priest?

634
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:11,782
No, he plays the organ.

635
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,788
I was in the neighborhood
so I picked them up.

636
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,086
Well done.

637
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:18,963
Thanks.

638
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,757
Hey, I'm sorry, excuse me,

639
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,585
when you two fellows
are done blowing each other,

640
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,137
maybe Davy Crockett
can tell us the deal here.

641
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,508
Well, we haven't heard much
since the TVs went down...

642
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,936
- Excuse me. Whose rig is that?
- It's mine.

643
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,728
- You mind if I borrow it?
- I'm not using it, officer.

644
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,105
- Keys?
- They're in the cab.

645
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,528
The truck's not gonna make it
to Fort Pastor.

646
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,775
No, forget the truck.

647
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,733
That place is fucked, man.
Bloodbath city.

648
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:47,113
How do you know?

649
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:48,694
We just came from there.

650
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,238
Is everyone there dead?

651
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,618
Dead-ish.

652
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,452
Is everyone there dead?

653
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:59,083
Yeah. In the sense
that they all...

654
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,710
sort of fell down and then...

655
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,883
- I'll look for myself.
- You're not gonna make it.

656
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,337
- ...got up and...
- I'll get as far as I can.

657
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,466
Right now it's about one foot...

658
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,843
...started eating each other.

659
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:10,594
- I'll take my chances.
- Don't be an idiot.

660
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,813
Please. There's people here
right now could use your help.

661
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,146
Fuck y'all.

662
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:27,403
It's nice to see that you've all
bonded through this disaster.

663
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,908
[distant growling]

664
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,721
[chuckles]

665
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,395
Hey. You, uh, need anything?

666
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,851
No, we're fine.
Don't worry about us.

667
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,151
He's got a bite on his hand.

668
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,321
Yeah.

669
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:56,238
- She's cold.
- [labored breathing]

670
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,493
That's good, right?

671
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,621
- [moaning]
- I don't know. It's weird.

672
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,248
I've never seen an infection
this bad

673
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:04,671
that didn't come with a fever.

674
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:08,758
That guy's arm looks
pretty bad over there.

675
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,380
You should probably
check it out.

676
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,093
All right.
Stay with her for a minute.

677
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,182
Here, let me take
a look at that.

678
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:21,980
I'm fine, really.

679
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,773
They don't hurt much at all.

680
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,316
Tucker could use you
more than I could.

681
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,269
His ankle's cut pretty bad.

682
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,316
I'm just gonna
clean it up a bit.

683
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,777
[Terry] You okay?

684
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,911
Ma'am, can I get you something?
Like a glass of water?

685
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:39,411
[deep gasps]

686
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,493
Ana! Ana, come here!

687
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:09,770
Anyone know her name?

688
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,736
Died without a name?

689
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,493
Damn.

690
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,326
Guys, do you wanna move
into the other room?

691
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,915
Holy shit!

692
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,377
[screams]

693
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,386
[thud]

694
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,468
[gasping]

695
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,061
Holy shit.

696
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:47,645
Holy shit.

697
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,321
I think it's the bites.

698
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,276
Frank said she was
walking on her own

699
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,157
when she got in the truck
five hours ago.

700
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,363
The bites killed her.

701
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,198
The bites brought her back.

702
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:04,290
How do you know?

703
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,327
I watched it happen.
I felt her pulse, she was gone.

704
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:08,703
Then...

705
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,581
Yesterday I saw
the same thing to somebody else.

706
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:16,135
I think that's why
it spread so fast.

707
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:20,264
All right.

708
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,478
So who else
in the group is bitten?

709
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,142
Frank for sure.

710
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:28,894
What about the one
with the foot?

711
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:31,651
Tucker? He says no, he fell.

712
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,646
So it's Frank. Tall guy, right?

713
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,231
Right. So we have to
quarantine him

714
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:37,653
right away.

715
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,575
Where exactly do we do that?

716
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,157
I don't know. There must be
some place to keep him in here.

717
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,409
Then what?

718
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,536
I don't know. But...

719
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,582
It's too dangerous
to keep him around here.

720
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,713
I'm sorry,
what are we talking about here?

721
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:57,419
Are we talking about
killing him?

722
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,303
Would you rather we waited
for him to die

723
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:00,505
and then he tries to kill us?

724
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,386
Yes. No. You can't kill him.

725
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,842
- Ana...
- He's got a daughter!

726
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,017
I'm sorry.

727
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,680
I don't think there's
any other choice.

728
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,105
He's right.

729
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,897
You can't do this.
What if I'm wrong?

730
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,657
You've seen it happen before.

731
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:25,239
Frank?

732
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:27,749
Michael's coming to shoot you.

733
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,376
What are you talking about?

734
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:31,874
You're infected.

735
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,456
You're going to become
one of them.

736
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,130
[Frank] Is this true?

737
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:40,379
Are you here to kill me?

738
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,927
You've been bitten.
It's only a matter of time.

739
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,759
No. No. No.

740
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,719
Leave my dad alone. Go away.

741
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,600
You can't do this.

742
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,691
You have to understand
that she's lost everyone.

743
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,186
Her mother,

744
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,067
her two brothers.

745
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,070
[sobbing]

746
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,151
I'm all she's got.

747
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,452
Well, Michael,
what are you waiting for?

748
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:09,790
[Frank's daughter sobbing]

749
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,660
Go ahead. Kill him.

750
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,546
Hey, kill Tucker, too.

751
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,041
Wait a minute. I was never bit.

752
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:19,463
We can't be sure.

753
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:21,344
Do it, Michael.

754
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,007
Are you sure it's the bite?

755
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:26,887
No.

756
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,681
She's sure.

757
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,900
I'm sorry.

758
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,175
[clicks teeth]

759
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,798
- Hey.
- Hi.

760
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,092
Are you okay?

761
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,301
Mm.

762
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:11,728
Let me see your arm.

763
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:14,014
It hurts.

764
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,107
It's already starting to heal.

765
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,653
Andre, I can't have baby here.

766
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:20,979
Why not?

767
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,485
People have been having babies
for millions of years,

768
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,114
all on their own, no hospitals.

769
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:27,576
Wait.

770
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,079
- Oh, yeah. [chuckles]
- It's moving.

771
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,497
I felt it.

772
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,917
We gotta come up with a name
for this baby.

773
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,039
I want Russian name.

774
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,287
Don't start that again.
African name.

775
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:39,668
- Please?
- Come here and give me a hug.

776
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,677
[Frank] Sweetie.

777
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,264
I'm so proud of you.

778
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:59,692
I couldn't ask for anything more
in a daughter.

779
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,116
I love you.

780
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:15,625
[daughter] I love you too.

781
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,175
Time to go, honey.

782
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,467
No.

783
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,847
Terry, come on, man,
open the door.

784
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,175
Shut up.

785
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:15,472
[CJ] Come on, man,
don't tell me to shut up.

786
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:16,768
Just come open the door.

787
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:19,689
I got you this job. Come on.

788
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,582
You want...

789
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,415
every...

790
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,252
single second.

791
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,660
[sighs] Ana.

792
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:19,658
I'm glad you didn't do it.

00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:28,549

[mumbling]

804
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,174
All right, I'm gonna skip
to the top three.

805
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,504
Number three,
"He listens to me."

806
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:40,716
Number two,
"He tells me he loves me."

807
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:42,805
And number one.

808
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:48,227
Well, it's trust.
Number one is trust.

[chuckling] Holy shit.

812
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,107
He got him.

813
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,453
So, who do we have next?

814
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,626
[man] Uh...

815
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:13,005
Yeah. Burt Reynolds.

816
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,708
Tell him, uh...
tell him to get Burt Reynolds.

817
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,259
[chuckles]

818
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,608
[man] My goodness.

819
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,561
Man, he's good.

820
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,363
It barely even looked like him.

821
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,362
Oh, oh... um...

822
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,118
Rosie O'Donnell.
Tell him to get Rosie.

823
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,320
Yeah, Rosie.

824
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,701
Nah, too easy.
Give him something hard.

825
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,200
You guys had really
rough childhoods, didn't you?

826
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:50,710
A little bit rocky?

827
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:53,129
Hey, sweetheart,

828
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,377
let me tell you something.

829
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,633
You, uh, you have my permission,

830
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,380
if I ever turn into
one of those things,

831
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,050
do me a favor,
blow my fucking head off.

832
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,972
Oh, yeah, you can count on that.

833
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,352
I guess the first time
I knew I was gay...

834
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,271
I was 13.

835
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:17,440
This guy...

836
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,113
Todd,

837
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,152
he was building a deck
in our backyard...

838
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,737
Uh, uh, Okay.

839
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,202
Just, please, stop.

840
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:34,287
[chuckles] I remember he had
the most astonishing blue eyes.

841
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:36,873
Oh, my God! I'm in hell.

Hey, Andre, how's Luda doing?

845
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:48,305
She's fine.

846
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:50,219
Hey, where's that lemon stuff?

847
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,096
It's all gone.

848
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,098
Steve likes to put
it in his booze.

849
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,568
Try the vanilla stuff.

850
01:00:58,822 --> 01:00:59,903
All right.

851
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:01,489
I'd like to drop by

852
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,524
and check on her,
and just see how she's doing.

853
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,109
No, thanks. She's fine.

854
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,570
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

855
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,497
It's okay, hon. We understand.

856
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,324

01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,360
And before that,
I worked in a stationery store.

860
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:40,857
And I drove a snowplow.

861
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,155
Fixed copiers.

862
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,112
God, it's such a shame

863
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,740
that this whole end-of-the-world
thing's holding you back.

864
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:51,368
[all laugh]

865
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:54,534
- Okay, worst job.
- Oh.

866
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:01,503
I know which job
I was the worst at.

867
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,501
It was being a husband.

868
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:04,798
That's not a job.

869
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:07,426
- [Michael] It sure is.
- [all chuckle]

870
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,633
You guys just haven't met
the right girl.

871
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:12,685
Yeah, I tried it
three times and...

872
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:15,179
I got pink slips every time.

873
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,023
What were you best at?

874
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,238
Being a dad.

875
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:30,278
I think I was best at that.

01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,955
- [gasps and screams]
- [gun cocks]

877
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:42,915
- [man] Everybody calm down.
- [woman] Are they inside?

878
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,466
[Michael] No. Does this place
have generators?

879
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,795
[screaming]

880
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,509
Shh. Okay, shh.

881
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,937
Shhh. It's all right, baby.

882
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,436
- [screaming]
- Shh.

883
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:15,573
Baby, please.
You got to be quiet, okay?

884
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:18,701
It's gonna be all right.

885
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:20,662
Our baby is on the way.

886
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,208
It's coming.

887
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:25,834
That's it.

888
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,882
It's in employee parking
level three.

889
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,426
They keep them in a pen
near the parking shuttles.

890
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,340
Have fun.

891
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,018
Hey, wait a minute.
You're coming too.

892
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:37,766
No, I'm not.

893
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,438
I said I'd tell you
where the generators are.

894
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:40,605
I never said I'd show you.

895
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,774
Did you think I'd just leave you
two up here?

896
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,353
You come with me
or you go back in that cell.

897
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:52,364
All right.

898
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,029
I ain't going anywhere
without a gun.

899
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,957
You're not getting a gun.

900
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:00,910
Trust.

901
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,583
The primary ingredient
in any relationship.

902
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,300
Have at 'em, cowboy.

903
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,258
[whispering] Asshole.

904
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,388
Bart, get the chains.

905
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:26,314
[loud noise]

906
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:29,734
You ready to roll?

907
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:31,615
You're coming with us?

908
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,317
No, you're coming with me.

909
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:35,703
I've done this before.

910
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,327
Know how to use that?

911
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,160
This one's the dangerous end,
right?

912
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:48,085
Now it is.

913
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,217
[chuckles]

914
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,941
[door closes]

915
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:15,238
This is level one.
We gotta walk down to three.

916
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,108
[distant noise]

917
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,080
[distant thud]

918
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,625
[distant growl]

919
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:10,797
What the fuck was that?

920
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:12,545
I just saw something.

921
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:14,919
You didn't see shit, Bart.
Shut the fuck up.

922
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:16,174
[loud noise]

923
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:26,855
[distant noise]

924
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:29,399
Oh, shit. Here it comes.

925
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,152
[panting sound]

926
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:37,904
[panting]

927
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,280
Jesus Christ.

928
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:41,908
It's a fucking dog.

929
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,576
Come here, boy.

930
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:44,956
[whimpers]

931
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:49,586
At least we know nothing's
down here

932
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:50,753
or it would've eaten him.

933
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,672
See? I told you I saw something.

934
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:53,920
[dog barking]

935
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,127
[Michael] What's wrong, boy?

936
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:59,551
There's nothing wrong.
That dog's just fucked up.

937
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,465
[screaming]

938
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:10,982
[growling]

939
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:14,483
[louder growling]

940
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:15,942
Run!

941
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:22,077
Wait, CJ! Wait up! Wait!

942
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:24,447
It's locked!
It's fucking locked!

943
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,246
[screaming]

944
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,001
[Kenneth] Come on, let's go!

945
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,267
CJ!

946
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:03,698
I'm out!

947
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:15,797
CJ! Matches!

948
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:27,305
[howling]

949
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:44,076
[howling stops]

950
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,165
Breathe.

951
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,542
You're doing good. Breathe.

952
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:57,123
- [deep guttural breathing]
- You're doing good, baby.

953
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:26,697
I'm sorry.

954
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:48,758
[gasps]

955
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:03,363
[howling]

956
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:35,145
[gasps]

957
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:38,224
[baby music playing]

958
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,991
- Thanks.
- Okay. That's the last.

959
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,831
I'm gonna go check on Luda.
I haven't seen her in a while.

960
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:00,412
- I'll go.
- You sure?

961
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,088
Yeah. I'll take them
some candles.

962
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,211
Okay.

963
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:04,587
Let me know
if they need anything.

964
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,009
Okay. I'll have a smoke
on the way.

965
01:11:06,888 --> 01:11:08,299
- See you.
- Bye.

966
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,881
[Luda groans]

967
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:13,634
It's coming.

968
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:18,938
I see it.

969
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:23,151
[ripping sound]

970
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,408
[sizzling]

971
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,677
[flies buzzing]

972
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,060
Guys?

973
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,279
Oh, my God.

974
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,415
It's a girl.

975
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,082
- [growling]
- [gasps]

976
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,666
[gasping]

977
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,142
You want to kill Luda?

978
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,222
You want to kill my family?

979
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:45,981
[Luda continues growling]

980
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:53,074
[Andre screams]

981
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:08,669
[groaning]

982
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:24,973
[groans]

983
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,114
Norma! Come on, Norma.

984
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,370
What happened?

985
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:43,496
The son of a bitch shot me.

986
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,461
Get away from her.

987
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,797
Wait. Just wait.

988
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,797
She died of the gunshot.

989
01:13:58,476 --> 01:13:59,592
She wasn't bitten.

990
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:02,644
She's gonna wake up though,
right?

991
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:06,897
[Ana] No.

992
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:10,819
No, if she was one of them,
she'd be up by now.

993
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:30,872
[exhales deeply]

994
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,932
- Terry?
- [Terry] Yeah.

995
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:46,392
Hold this.

996
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,480
[squealing]

997
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,861
Oh, God.

998
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:08,831
[echoing gun blast]

999
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,348
Somebody should say something.

1000
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:27,687
Yeah.

1001
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:29,101
Glen?

1002
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:30,898
No.

1003
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:33,227
You worked in the church.

1004
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:36,862
I played the organ.

1005
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,906
Come on,
you must have heard the priest

1006
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,484
say something
about life and death.

1007
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,160
It was a job.

1008
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:45,246
I don't believe in God.

1009
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:48,367
I don't see how anyone could.

1010
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,207
Somebody should say something.

1011
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,046
There's nothing to say.

1012
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,259
I've been to a lot of funerals.

1013
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,181
I've folded the flag

1014
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,352
and given it to a lot of
wives and fathers and kids,

1015
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,101
and I told them how sorry I was.

1016
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:13,266
But that's not what
I was really feeling.

1017
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,061
In the back of my mind,

1018
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,193
I was always saying,
"Better them than me."

1019
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,742
But I don't believe that now.

1020
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,286
Because now I realize

1021
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,410
that there are some things
worse than death

1022
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:30,163
and one of them is sitting here
waiting to die.

1023
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:36,293
I don't want to die here.

1024
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:45,974
I saw a couple of buses
in the garage.

1025
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:48,010
We could fix them up,
we could reinforce them,

1026
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:49,970
then get as far from here
as possible.

1027
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:51,725
And then what?

1028
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:53,523
Oh, I have an idea. Um...

1029
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:57,110
While we're at it,
why don't we swing by the marina

1030
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:59,153
and hop in my boat
and take it

1031
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:01,864
for a pleasure cruise,
you jackasses.

1032
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,317
Wait a minute.
That's a good idea.

1033
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:05,448
There's islands in the lakes,

1034
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,904
there's not a lot of people
on them.

1035
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,154
I was kidding.

1036
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:10,411
How far is the marina?

1037
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,208
[chuckling] Oh, my God.

1038
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:14,377
You're serious?

1039
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,542
I think it's a damn good idea.

1040
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:19,082
How about the rest of you?

1041
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:21,383
Kenneth?

1042
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,424
Yeah, it's a good idea.

1043
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,801
We have to pick up Andy.
He's part of the group.

1044
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:28,099
[chuckling] Excuse me.

1045
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,972
Not to shit
on anyone's riff here

1046
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,224
but let me see
if I grasp this concept, okay?

1047
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:35,273
You're suggesting that we take
some fucking parking shuttles,

1048
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,271
and reinforce them
with some aluminum siding

1049
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:38,977
and then head over
to the gun store

1050
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:40,403
where we watch
our good friend Andy

1051
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:41,650
play some cowboy-movie,

1052
01:17:41,866 --> 01:17:43,573
jump-on-the-wagon bullshit.

1053
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:45,951
Then we're gonna drive
across a ruined city

1054
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:47,278
through a welcome committee

1055
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,737
of a few hundred thousand
dead cannibals,

1056
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:50,492
all so we can sail off
into the sunset

1057
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,074
on this fucking asshole's boat?

1058
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:54,208
And head for some island

1059
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,911
that for all we know
which may not even exist?

1060
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:58,334
Yeah.

1061
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,381
Pretty much, yeah.

1062
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:06,262
Yeah.

1063
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:09,557
Okay.

1064
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:13,936
I'm in.

1065
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:18,062
["Hangman's Song"
by Tyler Bates playing]

1066
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,665
We have 12 of these
shotgun shells,

1067
01:19:24,218 --> 01:19:26,335
twenty-six of those
pussy.9-Mils,

1068
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:29,592
and 16 of those.357 Magnums.

1069
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,014
Yeah, well,
that's still not very much,

1070
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:34,058
so hopefully we'll get
to the dock

1071
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,681
and there won't be
too many of them.

1072
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:36,852
Hm.

1073
01:19:37,064 --> 01:19:38,851
Nice to see you busting
your ass today.

1074
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:41,942
[chuckling] Oh, that's sarcasm.
That is awesome.

1075
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:44,857
Yeah, you know,
I would love to help

1076
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:46,153
but, uh...

1077
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,815
a captain never works
alongside his men.

1078
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:50,742
[mimics whip sound]

1079
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:52,364
You guys have a good one.

1080
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,705
What a total dick.

1081
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:58,750
Guys, where did Chips go?

1082
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:00,627
Chips?

1083
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:01,919
Where'd you go, Chips?

1084
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:04,248
I can't find him. Chips?
Come here. Come on, Chips!

1085
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:07,174
- [mockingly] "Come on, Chips!"
- [woman] Where'd you go, honey?

1086
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:08,467
- Come on, boy.

- [gasps]

1088
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:12,847
Oh, there you are. Come on.

1089
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,766
There's my boy. Don't you
ever leave me again, okay?

1090
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:16,968
Ever, ever.

1091
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:47,082
Hey. Kenneth wants everyone
upstairs for a meeting.

1092
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:49,384
Come in here first.
I want you to see this.

1093
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:56,349
When those things
are on the side of the bus,

1094
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,676
this'll get them off.

1095
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,141
Cool, huh?

1096
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:03,647
Wow.

1097
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:06,188
That might be
the most romantic thing

1098
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:07,519
anyone's ever shown me.

1099
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:09,274
[Michael chuckles]

1100
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:14,276
I'm trying here.

1101
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:17,494
Yeah, I know.

1102
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:35,676
It's not just about
him starving, Steve.

1103
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,803
If we go to pick him up and
he doesn't have his strength,

1104
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:40,135
then we're gonna be
carrying him. It's...

1105
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:41,469
She's right.

1106
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,429
[man] He's a hell of a shot too.
We're gonna need him.

1107
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:45,106
I'm not saying
we don't need him.

1108
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:47,058
There's no point
in arguing about this.

1109
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:48,188
We need a solution.

1110
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:49,611
We need to get some food
over there.

1111
01:21:49,822 --> 01:21:50,858
I have an idea.

1112
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:53,611
We draw straws and the loser
runs across with a ham sandwich.

1113
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:54,816
[mock laughter]

1114
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:56,151
[Ana] Could you be
a bigger prick?

1115
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,986
I think so
but that's irrelevant.

1116
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:00,572
My question to you is
what's your plan?

1117
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:02,081
Come on!

1118
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:05,577
- [whistles]
- [overlapping chatter]

1119
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:06,627
I got it.

1120
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:07,920
We've got to get over there
anyway...

1121
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:10,169
- Shut up!
- ...more ammunition, all right?

1122
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:13,589
I have an idea.

1123
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,091
Stop, it's hurting him!
No! He's not safe!

1124
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:18,263
Nicole, they're not interested
in him, I promise.

1125
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:20,057
Okay, they want us, okay?

1126
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:22,093
Chips is gonna be fine.

[whistling]

1129
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:33,939
See? Look, he's walking
right by them.

1130
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:35,490
They're not even
paying attention to him.

1131
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:39,535
[Kenneth] The walkie's
in the bag?

1132
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,032
[man] Yeah.

1133
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,542
Let me see. Let me see!

1134
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:49,580
[Andy blows whistle]

1135
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:53,541
- [Chips barks]
- [Nicole] There he is.

1136
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,592
Good boy. Good boy, Chips.

1137
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,389
- Okay, he's there, he's in.
- Give me those.

1138
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:04,765
Oh, man.

1139
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,812
- What? What?
- No.

1140
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:09,933
No. Oh, man. They got him.
They got him!

1141
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:13,065
[gunfire]

1142
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:22,204
I'll try him on the radio.
Andy. Andy, do you copy?

1143
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:24,539
Andy, can you hear me?

1144
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:27,704
Andy?

1145
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:31,333
<i>[Andy] Can you hear me? Hello?</i>

1146
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:32,709

<i>I'm dinged up pretty bad
but I think I'm gonna be okay.</i>

1148

Where are you hurt, Andy?

1149
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:40,464
<i>Goddamn,
those bastards bite hard.</i>

1150
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:45,013
<i>I just have to stop
the bleeding.</i>

1151
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:47,016
<i>- It's really going.
- [Chips barks]</i>

1152
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:49,769
<i>Easy, boy. Easy. Is this Ken?</i>

1153
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:51,850
<i>Is that you, man?</i>

1154
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:55,354
Yeah, it's me, brother.

1155
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:57,905
<i>Hey, man,
good to hear your voice.</i>

1156
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:00,324
<i>I guess we're gonna meet
up-close pretty soon, huh?</i>

<i>Ah, Jesus. He got me good.</i>

1159
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:07,581
You just hang in there.

1160
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:09,830
<i>- You got the food, right?
- [Andy] Yeah.</i>

1161
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:12,453
- Do we tell him?
- [Chips barks]

1162
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:14,539

Oh, my God, it's Nicole!

[tires screeching]

1167
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:29,729
Shit.

1168
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:40,318
That idiot's going after
the fucking dog.

1169
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,033
She made it! She's in!

Nicole, how's Andy looking?

1173
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:58,587
<i>[Nicole] I don't know.
There's a lot of blood in here.</i>

1174
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:00,543
<i>It's everywhere!
There's blood everywhere!</i>

1175
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,754
Wait a minute, I see him.
He's on the roof.

1176
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:05,340
He's writing something.

1177
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:07,137
What's it say?

1178
01:25:08,895 --> 01:25:10,011

out there.</i>

<i>- [Chips barks]
- [Nicole] Chips, be quiet!</i>

1184

Tell her to get
the hell out now!

1185
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:23,199
Honey, listen to me.
You need to find

1186
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:24,491
a place to hide.
Can you do that?

1187
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:26,615
<i>[Nicole] What do you mean?
What's going on?</i>

1188

<i>- [growling]

No! Tell her to get out!

[static noise]

We need to do something. Now.

1199
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,436
Tucker, listen, when we
come back through here

1200
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:01,567
we may have company.

1201
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:02,693
You need to stay here

1202
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:04,365
and make sure
that fire door stays open.

1203
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,408
Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Uh...

1204
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:07,781
Why does he stay here

1205
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:09,077
while I go
on the suicide mission

1206
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:11,497
to rescue Terry's already
dead girlfriend?

1207
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,074
Fuck you, man.

1208
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:14,249
We don't know that.

1209
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:16,248
Either way,
we've gotta get over there

1210
01:26:16,463 --> 01:26:18,420
and get the guns
to get out of this parking lot.

1211
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:19,918
Michael, it's okay.

1212

- Yeah.

Steve, don't fuck this up.

1214
01:26:24,638 --> 01:26:25,799
Yeah. Totally.

That's it.

1218
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:14,931
[Michael] Are you sure?

1219

I ain't a plumber but I'd say
we're at the end of the line.
