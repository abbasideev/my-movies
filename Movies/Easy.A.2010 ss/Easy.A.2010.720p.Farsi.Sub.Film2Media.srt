1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,379
The rumors of my promiscuity
have been greatly exaggerated.

2
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:10,341
I used to be anonymous,
invisible to the opposite sex.

3
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:12,301
If Google Earth were a guy...

4
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:15,513
...he couldn't find me if I was
dressed up as a 10-story building.

5
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:19,392
Pretty cutting-edge stuff, huh?
A high school girl feeling anonymous.

6
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,020
Who am I? What does it all mean?
Why am I here? Blah.

7
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:26,440
But don't worry,
this isn't one of those tales.

8
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:28,568
Though it sure started out that way.

9
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:31,445
And then it changed pretty quickly
when I started lying...

10
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:34,240
...about some very personal things.

11
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:38,202
So let the record show that I,
Olive Penderghast...

12
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:43,124
...being of sound mind,
and below-average breast size...

13
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,459
...swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

14
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:48,713
...and nothing but the truth.
Starting now.

15
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:51,966
And what better way
to share my private thoughts...

16
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:54,051
...than to broadcast them
on the Internet?

17
00:01:54,553 --> 00:01:57,555
So here it is. Part one.

18
00:01:58,557 --> 00:02:02,727
The shudder-inducing and cliched,
however totally false account...

19
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:07,106
...of how I lost my virginity
to a guy at a community college.

20
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,111
Let me just begin by saying
that there are two sides to every story.

21
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:15,198
And this is my side, the right one.

22
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:17,116
George is not a sexy name.

23
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:19,202
George is what you name
your teddy bear...

24
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:21,704
...not the name you wanna
scream out during climax.

25
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:24,624
And by that, I assume you mean?

26
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,335
The stable and self-perpetuating
end stage...

27
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:29,378
...in the evolution
of a plant community.

28
00:02:29,546 --> 00:02:31,214
- Right.
- Why, what were you thinking?

29
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:35,301
The same. But I don't say it out loud
lest someone get the wrong idea.

30
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:38,387
I think you know innuendo
is attached to everything these days.

31
00:02:38,555 --> 00:02:40,598
Innuendo? What...?
Whatever do you mean?

32
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:44,268
Rhiannon, Olive, go hit the books.
They don't hit back.

33
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:48,981
Also, hugs not drugs.
Mess with the bull, get the horns.

34
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:51,734
And any other cliches
you can come up with.

35
00:02:52,653 --> 00:02:54,362
Bye, Mr. Griffith.

36
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:55,821
Bye.

37
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:58,449
- Watch your mouth.
- Sorry.

38
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:00,952
Mr. Griffith is my favorite teacher.

39
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:03,079
Although,
after all the trouble I caused...

40
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:05,498
...I don't know if I'm still
his favorite student.

41
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,124
You know, these are bad for you.

42
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:10,795
It leads to unwanted pregnancy,
all sorts of things.

43
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:14,799
Mismatched tires on your vehicle,
which is nonexistent.

44
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:19,262
And here is where the trouble began.
The lie that started the whole thing.

45
00:03:19,429 --> 00:03:23,307
Please, please, I'm begging you.
I will pay you. I'll pay you.

46
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:25,309
Rhi, I cannot go camping
with you, okay?

47
00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:27,186
I'm sorry, but I have a date.

48
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:29,981
- Okay? I told you.
- With who?

49
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:33,484
- You don't know him.
- And neither do you, you selfish bitch.

50
00:03:33,652 --> 00:03:35,987
Yes, I do.
He goes to college with my brother.

51
00:03:36,154 --> 00:03:37,738
Okay. What's his name, then?

52
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:40,741
Rhiannon is what you'd call
a strong personality.

53
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:43,202
She asked me to come camping
with her family...

54
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,288
...and I don't know why
I didn't wanna go.

55
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:48,666
A little because I didn't feel like
hanging out with her all weekend.

56
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:52,169
But mostly because her parents are
the weirdest people I have ever met...

57
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:54,630
...and I live in California.

58
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:57,341
I ate dinner at her house once
and I swore, never again.

59
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:59,802
- This is interesting.
- Patchouli burger.

60
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,054
We grew it in our victory garden.

61
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:03,681
You want some dessert?

62
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:06,309
No, thank you.
I'm trying to watch my figure.

63
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:08,269
Well, I'm not.

64
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,230
So I lied and told her I couldn't go...

65
00:04:11,398 --> 00:04:14,483
...because I had a date with a friend
of my brother's named George.

66
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:17,737
Let's just face it, there is no such thing
as a sexy George.

67
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:19,322
Yeah, well, mine is...

68
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:22,992
...so I think we should just
put this conversation to bed.

69
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,912
Fine, don't go camping with us.
Just know I hate you, bitch.

70
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:29,415
Go get your chocolate milk.

71
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:32,710
- Do you want one?
- No.

72
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:35,504
And here's how I really spent
the weekend.

73
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,515
That's the worst song ever.

74
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:36,440
But on Monday, when Rhi asked me
how my weekend was...

75
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:39,276
He was charming, you know?
He was a real gentleman.

76
00:05:39,444 --> 00:05:42,696
And it feels like I got a love
and I know that it's all mine.

77
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:45,616
Okay, okay. Wait, wait.
So are you going to see him again?

78
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:49,078
No. No, probably not. You know,
it was just one of those weekends.

79
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:50,830
A whole weekend?

80
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:52,498
Yup.

81
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,626
- Wait a minute. You didn't have...?
- What?

82
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:57,795
No. No, of course not.

83
00:05:57,963 --> 00:06:01,132
You liar.
You totally lost your V-card to him.

84
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:02,925
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

85
00:06:03,093 --> 00:06:05,636
- Tell me everything.
- Rhi, I'm not that kind of girl.

86
00:06:05,804 --> 00:06:08,139
The kind that does it,
or the kind that does it...

87
00:06:08,306 --> 00:06:10,641
...and doesn't have the balls
to tell her friend?

88
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,476
- What?
- I want every detail.

89
00:06:12,644 --> 00:06:13,978
- Rhi.
- Now, bitch.

90
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:16,063
You know, you call me "bitch" a lot.
Okay?

91
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:19,358
- It's not a term of endearment.
- I want every detail. Now, shitface.

92
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:21,485
You're not heading
in the right direction.

93
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:23,070
Tell me.

94
00:06:23,238 --> 00:06:24,822
Fine.

95
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,366
We did it.

96
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:28,659
Yes!

97
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:31,120
Finally.
Now you're a super slut like me.

98
00:06:31,288 --> 00:06:33,747
I don't think letting Peter Hedlund
motorboat you...

99
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:37,001
...behind a Bed Bath & Beyond
really makes you a super slut.

100
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:40,463
There were a lot of people walking
past. Someone could've easily seen.

101
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:44,341
Whatever. This isn't about me,
this is about you.

102
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:45,551
What'd you let him do?

103
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:50,639
It was normal. You know?
Nothing freaky.

104
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:53,058
I don't know why I did it.

105
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:55,686
I guess maybe it was because
it was the first time...

106
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:58,314
...I had sort of felt superior to Rhi.

107
00:06:58,482 --> 00:07:01,859
But I just started piling on lie after lie.
It was like setting up Jenga.

108
00:07:02,027 --> 00:07:03,527
Do you know, like, Glade candles?

109
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:07,031
Those kind, but they were, like,
sexy Glade candles.

110
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,909
- He was sweet. He was...
- Of course.

111
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:17,291
What the hell are you looking at,
Sister Christian?

112
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,835
Just a couple of admitted whores.

113
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:24,924
Marianne Bryant is the secretary
of the student council...

114
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:27,510
...chairman of the Orange Blossom
dance committee...

115
00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:29,887
...and president of
the Cross Your Heart Club...

116
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:33,098
...a club dedicated to shoving
their beliefs down people's throats.

117
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:34,725
Obviously they don't care.

118
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:37,853
Last year's cause celebre was
the changing of the school mascot.

119
00:07:40,398 --> 00:07:42,107
Give it up for your Blue Devils!

120
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,276
Blue!

121
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:46,820
Blue Devil!

122
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:50,741
Yeah.

123
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:53,744
Yeah!

124
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:57,831
How can we exhibit school pride
when we're conveyed to others...

125
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,625
...as Satan worshippers?

126
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:03,254
Now, thankfully,
we're the much less intimidating...

127
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,590
Give it up for the Woodchucks!

128
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:09,051
Hey! Go, Woodchucks!

129
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:11,512
Woodchucks!

130
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:20,145
I liked Todd much better
when he was topless.

131
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:23,482
Yeah, but even dressed as a
woodchuck, I still fantasize about him.

132
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,276
Woodchucks.

133
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:30,114
Now Marianne had
a new cause celebre.

134
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:31,782
Me.

135
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,410
Which brings us to part two.

136
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:38,330
The accelerated velocity
of terminological inexactitude.

137
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:43,168
Which is really just my obnoxious way
of saying that lies travel fast.

138
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:47,965
And, boy, did my terminological
inexactitude accelerate with velocity.

139
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:50,009
Did you hear about Olive?

140
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:12,698
No way.

141
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:23,167
- She's not a virgin anymore?
- I can't believe it.

142
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:25,169
- Olive lost her virginity.
- Yeah.

143
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:29,506
Maybe next time a certain somebody
will be a little more careful...

144
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:31,383
...what she says in the water closet.

145
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:34,678
Yeah, about that? It's...
That's actually not what you think.

146
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:37,014
Can I talk to you alone
for a second?

147
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:40,309
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

148
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:44,229
Bye, Nina.

149
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:49,234
What you heard in the bathroom
the other day wasn't true at all.

150
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:52,863
- It's actually a funny story.
- Olive. That's your name, right?

151
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:56,367
Yeah, yeah. And you're Marianne.

152
00:09:56,534 --> 00:09:58,911
We've had nine classes together
since kindergarten.

153
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:02,081
Ten, if you count Religion
of Other Cultures, which you didn't...

154
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:04,208
...because you refused to go.

155
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:07,044
Yeah. Listen, I'm not the one
that you have to answer to...

156
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:08,629
...for your depraved behavior.

157
00:10:08,797 --> 00:10:11,674
There's a higher power
that will judge you for your indecency.

158
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:13,717
Tom Cruise?

159
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,303
I hope for your sake
that God has a sense of humor.

160
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:20,099
Oh, I have 17 years' worth
of anecdotal proof he does.

161
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:22,184
You've made your bed.

162
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:25,020
I just hope for your sake
that you've cleaned the sheets.

163
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,732
- Did I just get saved?
- I missed you.

164
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,067
Oh, you too.

165
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:32,611
So Marianne spread the rumor.

166
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:36,115
For the first time ever, my sexual
exploits were the talk of the school.

167
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:38,742
Oh, you know what? I'm wrong.
It was the second time.

168
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,911
The first time was back
in 8th grade...

169
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:44,748
...when all I wanted was a kiss from
this guy I had always had a crush on.

170
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:48,168
Todd and I were thrown together
in Seven Minutes of Heaven.

171
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:53,006
Luckily we had a super romantic
song from our youth to set the mood.

172
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:56,093
I think this is the part...

173
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:58,929
...where you're supposed to
stick your tongue in my mouth.

174
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:00,639
That's what I've heard, anyway.

175
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:03,016
Just give me a second, okay?

176
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:05,936
According to my watch,
you have 382 of them.

177
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:07,354
- How do you do that?
- What?

178
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:09,815
Add so fast.
And you also talk like a grown-up.

179
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:13,277
Don't worry, I'm not nearly as smart
as I think I am.

180
00:11:14,612 --> 00:11:19,283
So if we didn't do anything,
could you still tell people we kissed?

181
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,579
Absolutely.

182
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:25,914
- Thanks, Olive.
- Sure, Todd.

183
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:28,959
I actually didn't wanna lie that time.

184
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:31,754
When people thought
I'd kissed someone, they didn't care.

185
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:34,006
But when they thought
I slept with someone...

186
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:36,633
Hey, Olive. How's it going?

187
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:39,470
I'm swell,
Guy-I've-Never-Talked-to-Before.

188
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:41,555
Thanks for asking.

189
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:46,977
All I could think to myself was,
"Great, now I'm a tramp."

190
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:49,146
I'm gonna have to get
a lower-back tattoo...

191
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:51,607
...and pierce something
not on my face.

192
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:54,276
You guys know that
I was here all weekend, right?

193
00:11:54,444 --> 00:11:55,861
- Yeah.
- Yes, you were upstairs.

194
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:57,571
- Yeah.
- You would testify to that?

195
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:59,698
- Yeah.
- I would take a bullet for you.

196
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,617
You know that.
Right between the eyes.

197
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:04,077
Man, I would slit my throat...

198
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:06,163
...rather than say something
to someone...

199
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:08,999
...that you didn't want me to say.
- That's not necessary.

200
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,960
- But that is comforting.
- That's how I am, how I roll.

201
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:13,879
That's how I do, as they say.

202
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:17,591
- I like the pants.
- Thank you. They're Costco.

203
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,635
You can have them
when you get taller.

204
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:22,304
- I'm never gonna go through puberty.
- Course you will.

205
00:12:22,472 --> 00:12:24,348
But we're a family of late bloomers.

206
00:12:24,516 --> 00:12:27,267
I didn't until I was 14. Nor did Olive.

207
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:29,353
Why does that matter? I'm adopted.

208
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:33,232
What? Oh, my God. Who told you?

209
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:36,777
Guys, we were gonna do this
at the right time.

210
00:12:36,945 --> 00:12:37,986
Listen to me.

211
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:41,281
Sometimes, even when a man and
a woman love each other very much...

212
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:43,116
...like your mother and I used to...

213
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:45,994
...their insides just don't cooperate
with each other.

214
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:47,412
So, what's going on, honey?

215
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,707
Why do you want us to take a bullet
if anyone asks if you were here?

216
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,210
It's nothing. It's just the rumor mill.

217
00:12:53,378 --> 00:12:56,547
What's the rumor mill churning out
these days? Anything interesting?

218
00:12:56,714 --> 00:12:59,758
You know, not really. Not really.
It's a little low on grist.

219
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:02,719
Clever wordplay. I like it.
You must be related to me.

220
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:05,055
- Only by marriage.
- Give it to me.

221
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:07,558
So, what we're all gonna take away
from this:

222
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:10,435
- I was here all weekend, right?
- Yes, yes, yes.

223
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:13,897
Remember how I told you
Google Earth couldn't find me...

224
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:16,191
...if I was dressed up
as a ten-story building?

225
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:20,153
Well, the next day it could find me if I
was dressed as a crack on a sidewalk.

226
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:22,573
That's the beauty of being
a girl in high school.

227
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,243
People hear you had sex once
and, bam, you're a bimbo.

228
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:28,954
I really didn't mean for the lie
to put me on the map...

229
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:32,291
...but I gotta admit,
I kind of liked being on the map.

230
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:36,712
So, clearly Nathaniel Hawthorne
is a complex writer.

231
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,505
Even I had trouble with him.

232
00:13:38,673 --> 00:13:41,758
I read him originally when I was 5,
but I struggled.

233
00:13:41,926 --> 00:13:44,887
So I'm gonna break it down for you.
I'm gonna throw some rhymes.

234
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:47,055
Anson, drop me a beat.

235
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:48,932
- What?
- Give me a beat.

236
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,976
Push it up.

237
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:54,730
Yeah, adultery, vengeance

238
00:13:54,898 --> 00:13:57,232
Crimes of passion

239
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,443
Kill the beat.
I'm not gonna rap for you.

240
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:01,653
It's pandering
and it's been done before...

241
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:04,948
...in every bad movie
you've ever seen. Okay.

242
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:07,743
Ironically, we were studying
The Scarlet Letter.

243
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:09,786
Now, isn't that always the way?

244
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:13,123
The books you read in class always
have some strong connection...

245
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,126
...with whatever angsty
adolescent drama is going on.

246
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:19,254
Except for Huckleberry Finn.
I don't know any teenage boys...

247
00:14:19,422 --> 00:14:22,007
...who have ever run away
with a big, hulking black guy.

248
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:24,635
For those who haven't read
The Scarlet Letter...

249
00:14:24,802 --> 00:14:28,472
...or for those who said you did
but didn't, here's all you need to know.

250
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,475
This girl, Hester Prynne,
has an affair with a minister...

251
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:35,479
...is besmirched and made to wear
a red A for "adulterer."

252
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:37,940
The town realizes
she was too harshly judged...

253
00:14:38,107 --> 00:14:40,984
...and she's really a good person,
and she dies a saint.

254
00:14:41,152 --> 00:14:42,986
A whole bunch
of other stuff happens too.

255
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:46,698
If you have a test on it, rent the movie,
but make sure it's the original...

256
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:50,494
...not the Demi Moore version where
she talks in a fake British accent...

257
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,412
...and takes a lot of baths.

258
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,501
To say that one was freely adapted
is a bit of an understatement, guvnor.

259
00:14:57,669 --> 00:14:59,670
What we have to realize...

260
00:14:59,837 --> 00:15:03,131
...is that Hester lived
in an entirely different time.

261
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:09,513
A time when the worst crime a woman
could commit was in fact adultery.

262
00:15:10,306 --> 00:15:11,348
Nina.

263
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:13,475
I think Hester Prynne was...

264
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:16,186
Excuse my language.... A skank.

265
00:15:16,354 --> 00:15:18,814
A skank? So you don't think
she was a victim at all?

266
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:21,191
Why should I?
She brought it on herself.

267
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:27,030
Perhaps you should embroider a red A
on your wardrobe, abominable tramp.

268
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,034
Perhaps you should get a wardrobe,
you abominable twat.

269
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:35,205
Not my best line,
but it was provocative enough...

270
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:37,874
...to land me in the principal's office.

271
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:47,718
Seems as if someone's
on a downward spiral.

272
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:51,430
Seems as if someone's
practicing the mundane activities...

273
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,765
...she'll be saddled with
the rest of her life.

274
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:56,727
I hope you at least had the good sense
to use protection.

275
00:15:56,894 --> 00:15:58,353
Why? Your parents didn't.

276
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:01,231
- You're going to hell.
- Just as long as you won't be there.

277
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,233
I can assure you I won't.

278
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:05,736
Good.

279
00:16:10,241 --> 00:16:14,119
I don't care who started it.
Just work it out.

280
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,750
Penderghast.

281
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:23,962
So why am I just meeting you?

282
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,715
Language like this would've
warranted a visit years ago.

283
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:30,927
This is the first time I've done anything
remotely misbehavioral.

284
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:32,220
This is foul.

285
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:34,639
I know. I am so...
I'm really, really sorry.

286
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:37,100
Sorry you said it
or sorry you got caught?

287
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:39,227
Sorry I said it, honestly.

288
00:16:39,395 --> 00:16:43,023
And sorry I got caught a little bit too,
but mostly just sorry I said it.

289
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:47,110
If you use a word like this again in my
school, it'll be your last. Understand?

290
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:48,320
Yes, sir. Yes.

291
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:50,947
I mean, this isn't one of
those progressive schools...

292
00:16:51,115 --> 00:16:53,617
...where teachers are called
by their first names...

293
00:16:53,785 --> 00:16:56,411
...and students
are partners in learning...

294
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,539
...and there's a fundraising auction
at the end of the year...

295
00:16:59,707 --> 00:17:02,959
...where the more creative parents
put on musical skits...

296
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,128
...about the community garden.

297
00:17:05,797 --> 00:17:08,006
This is public school.

298
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:12,594
If I can keep the girls off the pole and
the boys off the pipe, I get a bonus.

299
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:15,305
Now, if you're sent to me
one more time...

300
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:18,850
...you're gonna be out on your fantail.
Now, am I making myself clear?

301
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:20,143
Yes, sir.

302
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,104
- Good.
- I think so.

303
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:26,191
I mean, I got a little lost in the middle,
but I found my way back.

304
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,151
Detention after school tomorrow.

305
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,321
Now, out.

306
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,035
Even though it was my slutty alter ego
that said a bad word in school...

307
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:39,454
...it was my ass that got in trouble...

308
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:42,624
...which was a place my ass
had never been before.

309
00:17:47,672 --> 00:17:49,256
Hey, Olive.

310
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,217
Oh, my God. The illusion is shattered.

311
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:55,846
They put you in the gas chamber if you
take your head off at Disney World.

312
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:58,682
I think they just fire you.
You're thinking of Disneyland.

313
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,684
- Disney World is more liberal.
- Oh, yeah.

314
00:18:00,852 --> 00:18:03,728
I always forget Disney World
went blue in the last election.

315
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:05,772
Are you going
to Melody Bostic's party?

316
00:18:06,023 --> 00:18:07,524
I hadn't planned on it.

317
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:10,735
Me neither. My cousin's getting
married. It's a rehearsal dinner.

318
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:13,530
See you. Stay excellent.

319
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:15,031
You too.

320
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,491
- What's up, kid?
- Woodchuck.

321
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,995
Please tell me the rumors are true.

322
00:18:20,163 --> 00:18:22,622
Yes. Yes. I am a big, fat slut.

323
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:26,251
No, the one where you got suspended
for calling Nina Howell a dick...

324
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,503
...and punching her in the left tit.

325
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:32,174
I worry about the way information
circulates at this school.

326
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:35,510
Rhi? I need to tell you something.

327
00:18:35,678 --> 00:18:38,555
Like the exact moment
you turned into such a badass?

328
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:40,557
- I think I'm in love with you.
- Okay.

329
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:43,393
Tell me you left a mark
on that scrunched-up face of hers?

330
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:45,395
- It's not true.
- It wasn't the left tit?

331
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:48,398
It was the right one.
I always pegged you for a southpaw.

332
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:51,151
Can you listen to me
for one second, please?

333
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:54,529
Okay. It didn't happen.

334
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:58,575
Oh, yeah, right. Your secret's safe
with me, you little sex monkey.

335
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:05,207
I got sent to the principal today.

336
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:07,459
Did you win a medal or something?

337
00:19:07,627 --> 00:19:08,668
Not exactly.

338
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:13,423
I used inappropriate language
in English class.

339
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:16,593
Although we're reading a book
that I personally deem...

340
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:20,597
...inappropriate for our age group,
so I actually felt it was quite apropos.

341
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:22,015
What did you say?

342
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,269
Let's just say
it was an inappropriate word.

343
00:19:26,437 --> 00:19:27,771
Well, what did it start with?

344
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:30,315
A snide comment
from a snotty girl in my class.

345
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:33,860
No, I mean what letter
did the word start with?

346
00:19:34,028 --> 00:19:35,654
- T.
- Oh, T.

347
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:40,283
- T? Let us think. T, T, T.
- T. All right, T. Yeah, T.

348
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:44,788
- T, T, T.
- T, T, T.

349
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,801
- Guys.
- Noun, adjective or verb?

350
00:19:57,969 --> 00:20:01,096
Noun. It's definitely slang.
Think British.

351
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:03,139
Tallywhacker? Termagant?

352
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:08,895
You're just saying sounds.
Those are sounds.

353
00:20:09,063 --> 00:20:11,982
- Spell it with your peas.
- Yeah, spell it with your peas. Do it.

354
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:13,817
- I will take that challenge.
- Do it.

355
00:20:13,985 --> 00:20:15,318
I like that. All right.

356
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:17,779
So does this have anything to do
with the rumor...

357
00:20:17,947 --> 00:20:19,990
...that you mentioned the other night?

358
00:20:20,157 --> 00:20:23,451
Do you need to talk to us
about something, sweetie?

359
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:25,578
What's a twit?

360
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:27,497
That's an A, honey.

361
00:20:27,665 --> 00:20:29,916
It'll get you sent
to the principal's office.

362
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:31,251
Sit down.

363
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:33,962
We're lucky that this
is not a common occurrence.

364
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,172
What would my punishment
have been otherwise?

365
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,926
- Bed without supper, I guess.
- But I'm already finished.

366
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:43,346
- No dating. No dating.
- Yeah, no dating.

367
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:45,515
- No dating for you, young lady.
- No dating.

368
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:47,934
I think my complete lack of allure...

369
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:50,687
...already kind of
shot that horse in the face.

370
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:54,024
I wouldn't know how to be grounded
more than you know how to ground.

371
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:56,526
That's right. Love you. Come here.

372
00:20:56,694 --> 00:21:00,405
And I bet that girl was acting
like exactly what you called her.

373
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:01,698
Oh, you have no idea.

374
00:21:03,868 --> 00:21:06,369
I got a B-plus
on my spelling test today.

375
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:10,123
That's good, honey, but everything
has spell check these days, so...

376
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,458
Just kidding.

377
00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:15,628
Where are you from originally?

378
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,756
So the next day I had detention...

379
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:21,217
...which, thanks to recent budget cuts,
meant cleaning.

380
00:21:21,385 --> 00:21:23,803
I was looking forward to
getting all this behind me.

381
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:26,556
I had done the crime.
I was gonna do the time.

382
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:28,933
And that would be that,
but that...

383
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:31,895
Aren't there, like,
child labor laws against this?

384
00:21:32,063 --> 00:21:33,188
Not in high school.

385
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:37,525
The principal's like the captain
of the ship in international waters.

386
00:21:37,693 --> 00:21:39,319
He can even marry people.

387
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:42,989
We haven't talked in a while.
How have you been, Brandon?

388
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:46,826
Fabulous. I'm crushing it.
Everything according to plan.

389
00:21:46,994 --> 00:21:48,995
I wanna be in detention.

390
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:50,413
Yeah, why are you here?

391
00:21:50,581 --> 00:21:54,042
From the blood I saw gushing out of
your nose, I thought you were bullied.

392
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,587
Principal Gibbons is a homophobe,
which is why I called him a fascist.

393
00:21:57,755 --> 00:22:01,091
- So the rumors are true.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

394
00:22:01,258 --> 00:22:03,885
I meant about
Gibbons being a fascist.

395
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:08,431
So, what's with your new look?
Very whore couture.

396
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:11,935
Oh, haven't you heard?
I'm the new school slut.

397
00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:15,688
You know, I did hear something.
I also heard he was twice your age.

398
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:18,441
Oh, no, no, no.
No, he was a freshman in college.

399
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:20,735
I also heard he gave you crabs.

400
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:23,613
- People suck.
- Tell me about it.

401
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:27,200
He's not real.

402
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:31,955
- What?
- The guy I slept with. I made him up.

403
00:22:32,123 --> 00:22:34,124
Wait, you started the rumor?

404
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,334
Indirectly, I guess sort of.

405
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:40,797
Or actually, no.
No, not really. No, I didn't.

406
00:22:40,965 --> 00:22:43,925
Well, but you're perpetuating it.
That's really messed up.

407
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:45,218
Excuse me?

408
00:22:45,386 --> 00:22:48,471
You're not even a real slut.
You just want people to think you are.

409
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:50,140
It's pathetic.

410
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:55,145
No offense, but you could probably
learn something from me, Brando.

411
00:22:55,312 --> 00:23:00,024
Are you saying that I should
act straight so people will like me?

412
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:03,987
That's groundbreaking. You should
teach a course at The Learning Annex.

413
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:07,240
It could be called "The Painfully
Obvious with Olive Penderghast...

414
00:23:07,408 --> 00:23:08,700
...the Fake School Slut."

415
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:11,995
I was just suggesting that
maybe these kids we call peers...

416
00:23:12,163 --> 00:23:14,831
...are onto something.
You know, like Marianne Bryant.

417
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:19,961
Maybe that whole stuck-up,
Jesus-freak thing is an act. You know?

418
00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:22,505
No, I think she's just
a stuck-up Jesus freak.

419
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:25,925
And there are some of us who are
just trying to blend in to the crowd.

420
00:23:26,093 --> 00:23:29,095
Well, then you've gotta do
everything you can to blend in...

421
00:23:29,263 --> 00:23:31,014
...or decide not to care.

422
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:34,934
I can't decide if you're a genius
or a lunatic.

423
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:39,105
Well, don't they sort of go
hand in hand?

424
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,985
- So you heard any word from George?
- Nope.

425
00:23:44,153 --> 00:23:48,865
I told you, that was a one-night stand,
which is now over.

426
00:23:49,033 --> 00:23:51,117
You're being pretty cavalier
about this.

427
00:23:51,285 --> 00:23:53,703
Aren't you supposed to be
eternally in love with him?

428
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:57,540
Yes, I believe so. If I was a Gossip Girl
in Sweet Valley with traveling pants.

429
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:02,045
But no, I'm not.
So I could really care less.

430
00:24:02,213 --> 00:24:04,380
So Brandy Carter
was telling Vanessa Hodges...

431
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:07,383
...that you were with three guys
in a Jacuzzi.

432
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:09,469
Sounds like a lot of work.

433
00:24:09,637 --> 00:24:13,181
I guess that's still better than
getting it on with some old dude.

434
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:14,682
Who said that?

435
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,811
Do you know that Brandon kid?
That's what somebody told him.

436
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:20,063
Isn't he a homo?

437
00:24:20,856 --> 00:24:22,065
Yeah.

438
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:30,031
Speak of the devil. Hello.

439
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:32,909
I was just talking about you
with my friend, Rhiannon.

440
00:24:33,077 --> 00:24:36,496
You know Rhiannon.
She's perpetually angry.

441
00:24:36,664 --> 00:24:38,748
She curses like a Somali sailor. Bi...

442
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:41,376
- Yeah. That's the one.
- "Bi..."? "Bi..."? What's "bi-"?

443
00:24:41,544 --> 00:24:44,212
- Okay.
- I wanna know what "bi..." is.

444
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,089
Hello, what's "bi..."? What is "bi..."?

445
00:24:46,257 --> 00:24:48,341
- Bye.
- "Bi..."? What is "bi..."?

446
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:51,511
Bedazzling personality?
Beautiful, beautiful soul?

447
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,264
- Big tits.
- That's my identifier?

448
00:24:55,182 --> 00:24:56,683
Yes!

449
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,603
All right, well, that was Brandon. He
needs to talk to me about something.

450
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:03,648
- Probably wants to borrow an outfit.
- Whatever, Big Tits.

451
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:05,358
Heck, yeah!

452
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,944
Big tits!

453
00:25:08,112 --> 00:25:10,905
The next day,
things took a turn for the scandalous...

454
00:25:11,073 --> 00:25:13,032
...which brings us to part three.

455
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,953
A lady's choice
and a gentleman's agreement.

456
00:25:30,593 --> 00:25:32,969
Hi. Is there an Olive here?

457
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:35,305
There's a whole jar of them
in the fridge.

458
00:25:35,472 --> 00:25:37,640
I'm sorry,
I must have the wrong address.

459
00:25:37,808 --> 00:25:39,142
Just kidding. Come on in.

460
00:25:40,102 --> 00:25:43,229
Any friend of Olive's
is a friend of our daughter's.

461
00:25:43,856 --> 00:25:45,398
Olive, sweetie.

462
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:47,650
There's a young man
here to see you.

463
00:25:47,818 --> 00:25:51,487
He said something about asking
for your hand in marriage.

464
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:53,948
Oh, happy day, Mama!

465
00:25:54,116 --> 00:25:56,451
Oh, I thought I was gonna have
to spend my dowry...

466
00:25:56,619 --> 00:25:59,454
...on booze and pills
to numb the loneliness.

467
00:25:59,622 --> 00:26:01,956
A gentleman caller, hurray!

468
00:26:02,124 --> 00:26:04,459
- What's that?
- Olive has a boy in her room.

469
00:26:04,627 --> 00:26:05,793
- A boy?
- A boy.

470
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:08,171
- Wow, a boy.
- A boy.

471
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:10,006
A boy?

472
00:26:10,174 --> 00:26:12,008
A boy.

473
00:26:13,135 --> 00:26:16,512
Welcome.
This is where the magic happens.

474
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,348
And by magic I mean nothing.

475
00:26:18,515 --> 00:26:20,141
- Do you wanna go out with me?
- What?

476
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:22,977
Well, I mean, like,
do you wanna be my girlfriend?

477
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:28,608
Brandon, just a couple hours ago
you told me you were Kinsey Six gay.

478
00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:31,527
True, but you said I should
pretend to be straight, so...

479
00:26:31,695 --> 00:26:33,529
Yeah, I didn't mean with me.

480
00:26:33,697 --> 00:26:38,660
I mean, you're a nice guy and all,
but you're not really my type.

481
00:26:38,827 --> 00:26:40,620
Yeah, you're not really
my type either.

482
00:26:40,788 --> 00:26:43,706
Yeah, I know that. I got that V
where you'd rather see a P.

483
00:26:43,874 --> 00:26:45,541
Do you wanna
have sex with me or not?

484
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:47,669
Oh, my God, dude.

485
00:26:47,836 --> 00:26:49,295
You completely missed the point.

486
00:26:49,463 --> 00:26:52,215
- That's not what I was saying.
- I know what you were saying.

487
00:26:52,383 --> 00:26:54,884
I should act straight
till I get out of this hellhole.

488
00:26:55,052 --> 00:26:57,220
Then I can be whoever I wanna be.
I get that.

489
00:26:57,388 --> 00:27:00,223
You know that I didn't have sex
with a college guy, right?

490
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:02,141
I just told everybody I did.

491
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:05,895
Actually, I told one person I did.
And you know how these things work.

492
00:27:06,063 --> 00:27:07,230
It's like wildfire.

493
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:10,983
So you're saying
I shouldn't really have sex?

494
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:14,862
I should just say I had sex
with someone. A girl.

495
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,407
Yes. Yes.

496
00:27:24,832 --> 00:27:26,416
Oh, no.

497
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:29,794
- Wai... Just...
- Oh, no, no, no.

498
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:33,089
- No way! No way!
- Just wait. Wait, wait. Stop it, stop it.

499
00:27:33,257 --> 00:27:35,591
- Absolutely not.
- Think about it. Think about it.

500
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:38,010
- We could help each other out.
- No.

501
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:40,763
You wanna maintain
this floozy facade.

502
00:27:40,931 --> 00:27:44,100
I don't wanna get pushed into shit
every day. It's a win-win-win.

503
00:27:44,268 --> 00:27:46,436
How do you know I like
being thought of as a floozy?

504
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:48,688
Because at least
you're being thought of.

505
00:27:48,856 --> 00:27:51,899
Just one good imaginary bonk.

506
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:54,610
You are on crack. All right?
And not the good kind.

507
00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:56,112
It doesn't have to be a bonk.

508
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,781
It could be an imaginary butterbean,
lemon squeeze...

509
00:27:58,949 --> 00:28:02,160
- I don't know what any of that means.
- That's because you're a virgin.

510
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,454
You know what?
This is not the answer at all.

511
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:07,707
- I'll pay you whatever you want.
- I don't want your money, Brandon.

512
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,876
Just do what I did
and make someone up.

513
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:11,919
Who's going to believe me?

514
00:28:13,714 --> 00:28:17,884
You don't understand how hard it is,
all right? I'm tormented.

515
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:22,263
And every day at school
is like I'm being suffocated.

516
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:24,807
And sure, we can sit
and fantasize all we want...

517
00:28:24,975 --> 00:28:27,435
...about how things
are gonna be different one day...

518
00:28:27,603 --> 00:28:29,479
...but this is today and it sucks.

519
00:28:29,646 --> 00:28:32,857
There's only one way around it.
You were smart enough to think of it.

520
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:35,610
So please, just help me.

521
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:39,447
Because I can't take another day
of this. I don't know what I'll do.

522
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:49,832
I don't do anything half-assed.
All right?

523
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,501
It'll have to be a public event.

524
00:28:51,668 --> 00:28:54,086
Melody Bostic is throwing
a party tomorrow night.

525
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:58,174
All of your tormentors will be there.
You and I are going together. All right?

526
00:28:58,342 --> 00:29:02,512
You have to do everything I say and
tell everyone that I am sensational.

527
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:05,807
- Thank you so much for doing this.
- Just...

528
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:09,644
...you know, make sure you're ready
to live with the consequences.

529
00:29:10,854 --> 00:29:14,774
- What the hell is a lemon squeeze?
- It's like a backwards melon bag.

530
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:17,985
How don't I know any of this?

531
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:22,532
The next night was the party
at Melody Bostic's house.

532
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:25,034
She is the most popular girl
in school.

533
00:29:25,202 --> 00:29:27,745
It's partly because she's pretty
and has perfect hair...

534
00:29:27,913 --> 00:29:30,832
...but mostly because her parents
let her have these parties...

535
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:33,459
...every time she catches them
doing it in the pool...

536
00:29:33,627 --> 00:29:36,754
...which is every week, apparently.

537
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:39,882
Brandon and I showed up
when it was in full swing.

538
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:43,177
I borrowed a dress from my mom,
Brandon borrowed a jacket from me...

539
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:45,263
...and we put on a little show.

540
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,099
Hey, Olive and Brandon.

541
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:49,559
What's up?

542
00:29:49,726 --> 00:29:53,104
I hope you don't mind, but we had
a few pre-cocktail-party cocktails...

543
00:29:53,272 --> 00:29:56,357
...like, before the cocktail party
with cocktails.

544
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,195
Listen, here's the sitch,
Melody Bostic.

545
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:05,992
Brandon was just in the middle
of telling me this really funny thing...

546
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,326
...which is really funny.

547
00:30:07,494 --> 00:30:11,289
And I was wondering if there's,
like, a room where we could go...

548
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,750
...where he could finish telling me
that thing that's funny...

549
00:30:14,918 --> 00:30:16,210
...if you know what I mean.

550
00:30:16,378 --> 00:30:17,670
You can use my room.

551
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,590
Down the hall to the left.

552
00:30:21,842 --> 00:30:24,093
Cool.

553
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,346
Is that Olive with Brandon?

554
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:29,432
I know. What the hell, right?

555
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,309
You guys are my buddies.

556
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:33,102
I'm drunk, bitches. What's up?

557
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,770
I love your room!

558
00:30:34,938 --> 00:30:37,273
My sheets. Put a towel down.

559
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:41,152
- Olive's gonna do a gay dude.
- Thanks. Close the shades.

560
00:30:45,949 --> 00:30:47,366
- What are you doing?
- Relax.

561
00:30:47,534 --> 00:30:51,203
Jesus, what is with you gays? Are you
really that repulsed by lady parts?

562
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:53,623
What do you think I have down there,
a gnome?

563
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:03,716
So nice. What is that, lavender?
It's pretty.

564
00:31:03,884 --> 00:31:06,594
What are you doing? Can you...?
Can you come here, please?

565
00:31:06,762 --> 00:31:08,930
Jacket off. Come on.

566
00:31:09,097 --> 00:31:12,725
All right. Come on.
Chop-chop. All right.

567
00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:15,269
Now grunt.
Grunt and make it convincing.

568
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:19,982
I said grunt, not whine. Just grunt.

569
00:31:24,154 --> 00:31:26,656
Moan, you know? Like, sex noises.

570
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:29,825
God, you are pathetic.

571
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:39,502
Good. Good.

572
00:31:41,838 --> 00:31:44,215
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

573
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:46,175
Oh, yeah.

574
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:48,636
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

575
00:31:52,641 --> 00:31:55,309
- You don't have to be so aggressive.
- You don't like that?

576
00:31:55,477 --> 00:31:57,520
- No, I don't like that.
- You don't like that?

577
00:31:57,688 --> 00:31:58,980
How about that?

578
00:31:59,147 --> 00:32:00,982
- Little better.
- Yeah, you like that.

579
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:02,858
I like that.

580
00:32:03,026 --> 00:32:05,987
- This guy, he's gay, no?
- I think he's gay.

581
00:32:06,154 --> 00:32:08,656
- Don't stop!
- Keep going.

582
00:32:08,824 --> 00:32:11,033
- Don't stop.
- I'm not gonna stop.

583
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:12,493
I'm not gonna stop.

584
00:32:12,661 --> 00:32:14,036
Now you try. You try.

585
00:32:14,204 --> 00:32:18,374
I'm gonna turn you around
and take you from the back.

586
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:21,043
That's not gonna make people
think you're straight.

587
00:32:21,211 --> 00:32:25,381
Never mind that gayness
because I'm a straight guy. Roar!

588
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:31,387
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

589
00:32:31,555 --> 00:32:33,723
- That's awesome! That's perfect!
- Yeah!

590
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,516
That's what I'm talking about!

591
00:32:35,892 --> 00:32:39,020
Do you smell that?
Do you smell us?

592
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:41,897
Did he just say it smelled?

593
00:32:43,734 --> 00:32:45,067
Isn't it supposed to smell?

594
00:32:45,235 --> 00:32:47,028
You're not supposed
to comment on it.

595
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:51,657
- It doesn't really smell that bad.
- Oh, yeah. Yes, God!

596
00:32:51,825 --> 00:32:54,869
- Don't stop. Yeah!
- Don't stop. It's too much fun.

597
00:32:55,037 --> 00:32:57,163
- You ready for the grand finale?
- Yeah. What?

598
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,626
Oh, yeah.

599
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:04,003
Yeah.

600
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,051
Come on.

601
00:33:10,218 --> 00:33:11,886
Oh, my God.

602
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:17,725
Go forth, my son.
You're a man now.

603
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:20,394
Hey.

604
00:33:21,897 --> 00:33:23,064
Thank you.

605
00:33:26,193 --> 00:33:29,195
Seriously, thanks.

606
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:38,913
- Here.
- What is this?

607
00:33:39,247 --> 00:33:40,331
Evidence.

608
00:33:45,504 --> 00:33:48,714
What's up?

609
00:33:53,637 --> 00:33:55,262
Hey, man.

610
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:56,806
How was she?

611
00:33:56,973 --> 00:34:02,061
Well, well, let's just say
I'll be walking funny tomorrow.

612
00:34:02,229 --> 00:34:04,063
What?

613
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:07,316
- I'm drunk. What's up, bitches?
- Yeah!

614
00:34:19,121 --> 00:34:21,831
- Whoa, hey.
- Todd, hi.

615
00:34:21,998 --> 00:34:24,458
I thought you were at
your cousin's rehearsal dinner.

616
00:34:24,626 --> 00:34:27,336
It was a quick rehearsal.
I only had one line.

617
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:29,004
That was a joke.

618
00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:31,632
I know.

619
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:33,926
Yeah, sorry. How's it going?

620
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,846
You know, I'm...

621
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,181
- I'm here.
- Can I get you a beer?

622
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:41,684
That rhymed. I liked it.

623
00:34:42,144 --> 00:34:43,602
Yeah.

624
00:34:52,946 --> 00:34:55,030
- I'm gonna go.
- You sure?

625
00:34:55,198 --> 00:34:59,201
- Yeah. Bye.
- See you at the salt mines.

626
00:34:59,536 --> 00:35:01,203
Maybe this is gonna sound stupid...

627
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:04,790
...and, believe me, it's not like
I was expecting, you know, fireworks...

628
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:07,501
...or a string quartet or anything...

629
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,088
...but I always thought pretending
to lose my virginity...

630
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:13,007
...would be a little more...

631
00:35:13,175 --> 00:35:15,301
...I don't know, special?

632
00:35:16,386 --> 00:35:19,096
Judy Blume should've
prepared me for that.

633
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,189
That is so beautiful.

634
00:35:28,356 --> 00:35:29,815
Never had one lesson.

635
00:35:29,983 --> 00:35:32,443
That boy from yesterday
just dropped this off for you.

636
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:36,864
Well, put it in the pile of gifts
from my other suitors.

637
00:35:37,032 --> 00:35:39,825
- Thanks.
- He seems like a nice kid.

638
00:35:39,993 --> 00:35:42,036
He seemed a little incredibly gay.

639
00:35:42,204 --> 00:35:44,663
A dyed-in-the-wool homosexual,
that boy is.

640
00:35:44,831 --> 00:35:48,083
I just want you to know
your father and I are totally supportive.

641
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:50,628
We love you no matter
what the sexual orientation...

642
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:52,504
...of your opposite-sex sex partner.

643
00:35:52,672 --> 00:35:53,923
We're not dating, Mom.

644
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,884
And don't worry about
not making us grandparents...

645
00:35:57,052 --> 00:35:59,970
...although we were kind of hoping
you'd get knocked up...

646
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:02,514
...so we'd have a second shot
at raising kids.

647
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:04,892
Really do it right this time.

648
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,229
- Bye now.
- I dated a homosexual once.

649
00:36:08,396 --> 00:36:11,607
For a long time, actually.
A long time.

650
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:15,486
Dear God, dear Lord, tell me you did
not marry and have children with him.

651
00:36:15,654 --> 00:36:17,196
No.

652
00:36:17,364 --> 00:36:18,405
No, no, no.

653
00:36:18,573 --> 00:36:20,616
Your father is as straight
as they come.

654
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:23,118
A little too straight,
if you know what I mean.

655
00:36:23,286 --> 00:36:25,788
I don't. Can you shut the door, please?

656
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:31,502
Okay, door's right over there.
Keep going.

657
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,048
- Take it down.
- Go take that out to Dad. Nice.

658
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:46,809
"Just in case you don't shop at Target.
Then you can go screw yourself.

659
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:48,560
Brandon."

660
00:36:56,653 --> 00:36:57,695
Hi, Rhi.

661
00:36:57,862 --> 00:37:01,115
Is it true you got with Brandon
at Melody Dipshit's party?

662
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:03,701
Is that what people
are saying happened?

663
00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:06,829
That's what everyone
is saying happened.

664
00:37:06,997 --> 00:37:09,873
Well, then I guess that...
I guess that's true.

665
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,960
Just because you lost your virginity
doesn't mean you can go...

666
00:37:13,128 --> 00:37:16,839
...throwing your cat at everybody.
- I'm not throwing my cat at everybody.

667
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:20,009
I had to hear from Jackie Rudetsky.

668
00:37:20,176 --> 00:37:21,844
Do you know
how embarrassing that is?

669
00:37:22,012 --> 00:37:26,348
Finding out you slept with some
gay dude from Jackie Rudetsky?

670
00:37:26,516 --> 00:37:27,891
Must've been embarrassing.

671
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:29,810
Why didn't you tell me
you were going?

672
00:37:29,978 --> 00:37:31,979
I would've come with
and held your hair.

673
00:37:32,147 --> 00:37:34,273
Are you really making this
about you right now?

674
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:38,027
- You're starting to get a reputation.
- You're coming off as a little pious.

675
00:37:38,194 --> 00:37:39,903
You're pissing me off
more than usual.

676
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:42,031
I think it's a best friend's duty...

677
00:37:42,198 --> 00:37:46,535
...to let her know that everyone, and
I do mean everyone, is calling her...

678
00:37:46,703 --> 00:37:48,287
...a dirty skank.

679
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,207
Well, do you think I'm a dirty skank?

680
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:55,294
You know, I didn't wanna believe it,
but I guess it's true.

681
00:37:55,462 --> 00:37:58,213
That is your identifier.

682
00:37:58,381 --> 00:38:00,799
And you're a jealous virgin.

683
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:02,134
So...

684
00:38:04,012 --> 00:38:06,055
People thought I was a dirty skank?

685
00:38:06,222 --> 00:38:09,391
Fine, I'd be the dirtiest skank
they'd ever seen.

686
00:38:31,748 --> 00:38:33,415
Shit.

687
00:38:38,254 --> 00:38:41,507
Is everything all right? It sounds like
you're having sex in here...

688
00:38:41,674 --> 00:38:45,260
...which can't be true, due to the fact
that you have a homosexual boyfriend.

689
00:38:45,428 --> 00:38:47,846
He's not my boyfriend.

690
00:38:48,014 --> 00:38:51,725
Hey, no judgment.
All God's children. It's fine.

691
00:38:51,893 --> 00:38:54,603
I was gay once for a while.

692
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:57,940
No big deal. We all do it. It's okay.

693
00:38:58,108 --> 00:39:00,025
Dad, can you just
shut the door, please?

694
00:39:00,193 --> 00:39:01,276
You all right, buddy?

695
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:05,114
Yeah.

696
00:39:06,116 --> 00:39:07,699
Give them hell.

697
00:39:52,996 --> 00:39:54,830
- Hey, Anson.
- Hey.

698
00:39:54,998 --> 00:40:00,502
I just realized the funniest thing.
My name is an anagram for "I love."

699
00:40:01,129 --> 00:40:03,505
What's a...? What's an anagram?

700
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,965
Look it up, big boy.

701
00:40:06,176 --> 00:40:07,509
What's your problem?

702
00:40:07,677 --> 00:40:09,261
You wanna know
what my problem is?

703
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:13,265
No. That was a rhetorical question.
I don't wanna know anything from you.

704
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:15,434
We are not friends anymore.

705
00:40:15,602 --> 00:40:17,394
We are officially over.

706
00:40:17,562 --> 00:40:19,021
Oh, rats.

707
00:40:19,189 --> 00:40:23,400
I want my Juicy sweatshirt back. It was
too loose around your chest anyway.

708
00:40:23,568 --> 00:40:25,611
Burn.

709
00:40:25,987 --> 00:40:27,696
- Stop.
- What?

710
00:40:47,383 --> 00:40:49,051
What are you doing?

711
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,845
Nothing.

712
00:40:55,517 --> 00:40:58,018
Don't forget, tomorrow's Earth Day.

713
00:40:58,728 --> 00:41:02,397
Guys, we have a problem:
Olive Penderghast.

714
00:41:02,565 --> 00:41:04,233
- We need to pray for her.
- Amen.

715
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,985
But we also need to
get her the hell out of here.

716
00:41:07,153 --> 00:41:08,195
Amen.

717
00:41:08,363 --> 00:41:10,572
You heard what happened
at Melody Bostic's.

718
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,617
- I was there. I heard the whole thing.
- That's not something...

719
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:16,745
...you need to advertise, Kurt.
- Sorry. But I was.

720
00:41:16,913 --> 00:41:21,083
I tried to witness to her, but this girl
is defiant to any type of help.

721
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:23,919
Anybody here think they can
talk to her, get her to see...

722
00:41:24,087 --> 00:41:26,129
...what she's doing is wrong?

723
00:41:28,758 --> 00:41:32,010
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry, you guys. This is so stupid.

724
00:41:32,178 --> 00:41:35,514
No, it's not, Marianne. It's real.

725
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:36,765
- It's real.
- Yeah, it is.

726
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:38,809
Jesus tells us to love everyone.

727
00:41:38,977 --> 00:41:43,564
I mean, even the whores and
the homosexuals, but it's just so hard.

728
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:48,277
It's so hard because they keep
doing it over and over again.

729
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:51,029
Make me a promise.

730
00:41:51,197 --> 00:41:53,782
Make God a promise,
right here and right now...

731
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,910
...that we will remain
pure and chaste until marriage.

732
00:41:57,078 --> 00:41:58,120
We promise.

733
00:41:58,288 --> 00:42:01,623
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

734
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:06,169
I love you guys. God loves you guys.
Now, let's change lives today.

735
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:08,380
- Micah?
- Let's do it.

736
00:42:32,947 --> 00:42:35,115
I didn't know what they
were so upset about.

737
00:42:35,283 --> 00:42:38,160
I put an A on my wardrobe
just like they asked.

738
00:42:38,328 --> 00:42:41,663
Maybe it was because I was wearing
clothes that were two sizes too small.

739
00:42:41,831 --> 00:42:43,165
Hey, Olive!

740
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:48,045
You left your glass slipper
at the party the other night.

741
00:42:48,212 --> 00:42:51,465
Yeah, and I got pumpkin
all over my dress too.

742
00:42:52,467 --> 00:42:54,843
Nice. Solid joke.

743
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:57,554
It sucks because we could've
revisited Melody's bedroom.

744
00:42:57,722 --> 00:42:59,806
Oh, my God,
that was Melody Bostic's house.

745
00:42:59,974 --> 00:43:02,684
- Yeah.
- I can't believe you remember that.

746
00:43:02,852 --> 00:43:06,355
Well, yeah, come on. Who doesn't
remember their first almost-kiss?

747
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:10,484
Hey, Olive.

748
00:43:10,652 --> 00:43:12,361
Evan. Hey, what's rocking?

749
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:14,029
Can I talk to you for a second?

750
00:43:14,197 --> 00:43:15,906
Yeah, what's up?

751
00:43:16,366 --> 00:43:18,909
Don't get mad, but Brandon told me
what you did for him.

752
00:43:19,077 --> 00:43:22,871
Oh, well, rest assured,
it was equally as thrilling for me.

753
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,831
No, he told me the truth.

754
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:28,085
I was just hoping
you could do the same for me?

755
00:43:28,586 --> 00:43:30,003
Goodbye, Evan.

756
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:32,964
Wait, wait. I can pay you.

757
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:35,926
I am about six seconds away
from slapping you so hard...

758
00:43:36,094 --> 00:43:39,137
...your teeth will bleed.
- Can you do it in front of everyone?

759
00:43:40,932 --> 00:43:43,433
I don't need your permission,
you know.

760
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:46,895
What?

761
00:43:47,063 --> 00:43:49,690
I mean, at the rate you're going...

762
00:43:49,857 --> 00:43:52,025
...I don't see how people
won't believe it.

763
00:43:52,193 --> 00:43:54,611
- Are you threatening me?
- I'll give you 100 bucks.

764
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:56,196
You are repugnant.

765
00:43:57,073 --> 00:43:58,448
That's the problem.

766
00:44:00,076 --> 00:44:01,076
Never mind.

767
00:44:02,245 --> 00:44:04,246
I'm sorry I asked.

768
00:44:11,045 --> 00:44:13,130
I knew it wouldn't work.

769
00:44:13,673 --> 00:44:15,006
I'm just a fat piece of shit.

770
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:18,510
When will high school end already?

771
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,934
Shit.

772
00:44:26,102 --> 00:44:30,564
I want a $100 gift card deposited
into my locker by noon tomorrow.

773
00:44:30,732 --> 00:44:33,942
Preferably to the Gap, but I will
also take Amazon. com or OfficeMax.

774
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:38,113
Actually, make it OfficeMax.
I have my eye on a label maker.

775
00:44:38,281 --> 00:44:40,907
We did not have sex, okay?

776
00:44:41,075 --> 00:44:44,119
I let you fondle my chest,
and it was a glorious moment for you...

777
00:44:44,287 --> 00:44:47,456
...unmatched by anything
you've experienced, including cake.

778
00:44:47,623 --> 00:44:48,665
Got it?

779
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:51,793
Wait a minute.
A hundred bucks for second base?

780
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:54,421
- Yeah.
- Doesn't that seem a little steep?

781
00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:58,300
Can we throw in, like, some
butt action or some pants rubbing?

782
00:44:58,468 --> 00:45:01,052
- What are you, 9?
- Whatever. Are you in?

783
00:45:03,097 --> 00:45:05,265
- Whatever.
- Deal, then.

784
00:45:06,058 --> 00:45:07,559
Thanks, Olive.

785
00:45:07,727 --> 00:45:09,352
You know, the sad thing is, Evan...

786
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,982
...if you'd been a gentleman
and maybe asked me on a date...

787
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,358
...I might've said yes.

788
00:45:15,526 --> 00:45:18,153
Really?
Do you wanna go out with me?

789
00:45:18,321 --> 00:45:19,863
Not now I don't, shit-dick.

790
00:45:23,493 --> 00:45:27,162
It should come as no surprise that the
rumor I was soliciting sex for money...

791
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,581
...spread around the school
faster than...

792
00:45:29,749 --> 00:45:33,418
Well, faster than the first rumor
about me spread.

793
00:45:36,464 --> 00:45:38,298
Guys, come over here.

794
00:46:05,034 --> 00:46:07,202
She'll do stuff for money.
Around the world...

795
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:10,539
But for people who knew the truth,
I was open for business.

796
00:46:10,706 --> 00:46:15,168
And whether I liked it or not,
I had a lot of customers.

797
00:46:16,379 --> 00:46:18,713
Phil Lord gave me
100 bucks from Best Buy...

798
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:22,384
...so he could tell people
we hooked up behind the library.

799
00:46:22,552 --> 00:46:25,303
I got $50 from T.J. Maxx
so that Eric Ling could say...

800
00:46:25,471 --> 00:46:28,098
...we got it on during Chemistry.

801
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:32,018
Ninety dollars from Panda Express
so Ryan Dukes could tell people...

802
00:46:32,186 --> 00:46:35,897
...I showed him mine,
but he did not show me his.

803
00:46:36,065 --> 00:46:38,358
Chris Miller,
big spender that he is...

804
00:46:38,526 --> 00:46:42,070
...gave me $40 worth of movie passes
for my pretend cowbell.

805
00:46:42,238 --> 00:46:44,531
They had an expiration date
and were only good...

806
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:46,533
...at the stupid foreign movie theater.

807
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:52,706
Hi. One for
Der Scharlachrote Buchstabe.

808
00:46:52,874 --> 00:46:55,834
But even that is better
than Sanjay Chandrasekhar.

809
00:46:56,002 --> 00:47:00,130
Seriously? A coupon? Twenty percent
off to Bath & Body Works?

810
00:47:00,298 --> 00:47:03,466
Is that how much our imaginary tryst
meant to you?

811
00:47:03,843 --> 00:47:05,427
I fake rocked your world.

812
00:47:05,595 --> 00:47:08,096
- It's all I can afford.
- How's that my problem, amigo?

813
00:47:08,264 --> 00:47:11,266
I knew he wasn't Latino,
but for some reason all these shady...

814
00:47:11,434 --> 00:47:13,727
...backdoor deals
had me talking like Carlito.

815
00:47:14,103 --> 00:47:16,229
- Beat it, ese.
- Okay.

816
00:47:16,397 --> 00:47:18,356
Whatever happened to chivalry?

817
00:47:18,524 --> 00:47:21,443
Does it only exist in '80s movies?

818
00:47:21,611 --> 00:47:25,697
I want John Cusack holding
a boombox outside my window.

819
00:47:25,865 --> 00:47:28,491
I wanna ride off on a lawn mower
with Patrick Dempsey.

820
00:47:28,951 --> 00:47:32,746
I want Jake from Sixteen Candles
waiting outside the church for me.

821
00:47:32,914 --> 00:47:35,665
I want Judd Nelson
thrusting his fist into the air...

822
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:37,292
...because he knows he got me.

823
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,420
Just once, I want my life
to be like an '80s movie.

824
00:47:41,005 --> 00:47:43,798
Preferably one with a really awesome
musical number...

825
00:47:43,966 --> 00:47:46,009
...for no apparent reason.

826
00:47:46,552 --> 00:47:51,097
But, no. No.
John Hughes did not direct my life.

827
00:47:51,265 --> 00:47:54,059
So instead of all that...

828
00:47:54,226 --> 00:47:57,437
...I get to save 15 cents...

829
00:47:57,605 --> 00:48:00,440
...on a bottle of Juniper Breeze
Antibacterial Gel.

830
00:48:00,608 --> 00:48:04,903
So if you're still with me,
and I'm hoping that most of you are...

831
00:48:05,071 --> 00:48:07,822
...this brings us to part four.

832
00:48:09,325 --> 00:48:12,661
How I, Olive Penderghast,
went from assumed trollop...

833
00:48:12,828 --> 00:48:14,496
...to an actual home-wrecker.

834
00:48:16,832 --> 00:48:20,669
- You wanted to see me?
- I did. Why don't you come in here?

835
00:48:28,177 --> 00:48:29,219
What's going on?

836
00:48:30,012 --> 00:48:32,681
- I'm accessorizing.
- Really?

837
00:48:32,848 --> 00:48:36,393
I think you're taking your reading
assignment a little bit too seriously.

838
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,938
Well, I was really hoping
to get an A. Get it?

839
00:48:42,984 --> 00:48:44,359
I'm hearing some rumors.

840
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:47,737
Well, those are true. I am considering
becoming an existentialist.

841
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:50,490
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Jeez.

842
00:48:50,658 --> 00:48:54,953
When did teachers become
privy to idle adolescent gossip?

843
00:48:55,121 --> 00:49:00,959
That would be when everyone
is putting everything up on Facebook.

844
00:49:01,127 --> 00:49:03,545
I don't know what
your generation's fascination is...

845
00:49:03,713 --> 00:49:06,089
...with documenting
your every thought...

846
00:49:06,257 --> 00:49:09,467
...but I can assure you
they're not all diamonds.

847
00:49:09,635 --> 00:49:12,053
"Roman is having an okay day...

848
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:16,391
...and bought a Coke Zero
at the gas station.

849
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,976
Raise the roof."

850
00:49:18,144 --> 00:49:19,394
Who gives a rat's ass?

851
00:49:19,562 --> 00:49:21,896
He got a Coke Zero again?

852
00:49:22,064 --> 00:49:24,232
That Roman. Incorrigible.

853
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,111
Listen, whatever this little act is about,
I just... I'm curious.

854
00:49:28,279 --> 00:49:31,197
I really think you should consider
giving me extra credit...

855
00:49:31,365 --> 00:49:32,657
...for going the extra mile.

856
00:49:32,825 --> 00:49:35,827
I'm really attempting to understand
this puritanical ostracism...

857
00:49:35,995 --> 00:49:39,039
...Hawthorne wrote about.
- You are one of the few that read it.

858
00:49:39,206 --> 00:49:41,875
If I read one more paper
from one of your classmates...

859
00:49:42,043 --> 00:49:46,671
...who talks about how hot she is in
the bathtub, her fake British accent...

860
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:50,884
...or, is she still married to
Ashton Kutcher, I'm gonna kill myself.

861
00:49:51,052 --> 00:49:53,720
Why don't people just watch
the original movie like I did?

862
00:49:54,305 --> 00:49:55,722
I know you read the book.

863
00:49:56,766 --> 00:49:57,932
I did.

864
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,519
Listen, I want to apologize for
sending you to the principal's office.

865
00:50:01,687 --> 00:50:04,189
Truthfully, and I'll deny it
if you say anything...

866
00:50:04,356 --> 00:50:07,108
...I wanted to be cheering
with the rest of the students.

867
00:50:07,276 --> 00:50:09,778
I don't know what it is about Nina.

868
00:50:10,071 --> 00:50:11,696
I hate her.

869
00:50:11,864 --> 00:50:12,906
I won't tell.

870
00:50:13,074 --> 00:50:14,491
- I'll deny it if you do.
- Okay.

871
00:50:14,658 --> 00:50:16,785
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

872
00:50:16,952 --> 00:50:18,578
Stay golden.

873
00:50:18,746 --> 00:50:22,290
- Hi, Mrs. Griffith.
- Hi, you. How are you?

874
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:24,793
A is for "awesome."

875
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,503
Yeah.

876
00:50:27,129 --> 00:50:28,838
I've never seen that girl before.

877
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:30,882
That does not surprise me.

878
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:33,968
But I'm the guidance counselor.
I should know all the students.

879
00:50:34,136 --> 00:50:36,638
Especially the ones
who dress like prostitutes.

880
00:50:36,806 --> 00:50:39,516
- It's good to see you.
- Hey. How are you? Good.

881
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:43,978
No, stop. We're at school.
There are rules.

882
00:50:44,146 --> 00:50:46,481
- Windows.
- Yeah, yeah.

883
00:50:46,774 --> 00:50:48,817
Do me a favor, though.
Just talk to her.

884
00:50:48,984 --> 00:50:50,777
I think she's going through a phase.

885
00:50:50,945 --> 00:50:53,488
That's not the girl
everyone's talking about, is it?

886
00:50:53,656 --> 00:50:54,656
It is.

887
00:50:54,824 --> 00:50:57,450
Oh, okay. Oh, this'll be good.
All right.

888
00:50:57,618 --> 00:51:00,078
That snotty, Jesus-freak
office aide I have...

889
00:51:00,246 --> 00:51:02,205
...has been bitching
about her incessantly.

890
00:51:02,373 --> 00:51:06,668
They're all lies, but she could use
somebody to talk to anyway.

891
00:51:06,836 --> 00:51:09,420
All right. Hey, what are you doing
for dinner tonight?

892
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:11,131
- You won't be there?
- Sorry.

893
00:51:11,298 --> 00:51:14,342
I have an after-school session.
Kid brought a knife to school.

894
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:15,802
Well, be careful, all right?

895
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:18,429
It was a butter knife.
But you know what they say.

896
00:51:18,597 --> 00:51:20,557
You know, it's a gateway knife, so...

897
00:51:20,724 --> 00:51:22,225
- All right, bye.
- Yeah. Bye.

898
00:51:22,393 --> 00:51:25,145
I'm thinking about another gateway.
It's a...

899
00:51:27,982 --> 00:51:29,023
Making spaghetti.

900
00:51:29,191 --> 00:51:31,109
- That's great.
- With meat.

901
00:51:31,277 --> 00:51:32,610
Enjoy eating your meat.

902
00:51:32,778 --> 00:51:35,488
- And balls.
- Enjoy eating your balls.

903
00:51:45,374 --> 00:51:46,749
Sharpening your pencils?

904
00:51:48,252 --> 00:51:49,669
Getting them nice and sharp?

905
00:51:50,337 --> 00:51:54,632
Sharpening them up? Look at you.
Look at you. So sharp.

906
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,093
Sharpening those pencils.
Sharp, sharp, sharp.

907
00:51:57,553 --> 00:52:00,388
- God, that's sharp. I...
- Hey, Olive. You ready to come in?

908
00:52:03,392 --> 00:52:04,434
Good job.

909
00:52:04,602 --> 00:52:07,187
Well, the reason I called you in
was just so we could...

910
00:52:07,354 --> 00:52:10,231
...sort of, you know, just chat
about what's going on.

911
00:52:10,399 --> 00:52:13,026
You know, there is concern
from a few faculty members.

912
00:52:13,194 --> 00:52:14,694
Your husband.

913
00:52:14,862 --> 00:52:17,363
Olive, you're attempting
to make a statement.

914
00:52:17,531 --> 00:52:20,742
I'm just a little confused
as to what exactly that is.

915
00:52:21,368 --> 00:52:22,410
Am I in trouble?

916
00:52:22,578 --> 00:52:25,038
Because, pursuant
to the student code of conduct...

917
00:52:25,206 --> 00:52:27,874
...my hemline has never been
higher than my fingertips.

918
00:52:28,042 --> 00:52:29,375
No, you're not in trouble.

919
00:52:29,543 --> 00:52:31,085
I wanted to make sure you knew...

920
00:52:31,253 --> 00:52:33,630
...if there's something
that you wanna talk about...

921
00:52:33,797 --> 00:52:35,590
...you know, you can trust me.

922
00:52:35,758 --> 00:52:39,719
If I open up to you, do you promise
this stays in confidence?

923
00:52:40,763 --> 00:52:43,139
Yeah. I'm... See?
I'm the guidance counselor.

924
00:52:43,307 --> 00:52:44,682
That's what I do.

925
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,101
I mean, I have a reputation to uphold.

926
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:48,436
Don't you, though?

927
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,943
All right, listen, don't tell anyone
I'm doing this, please.

928
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,236
Here you go.

929
00:52:56,403 --> 00:52:58,279
- Here you go.
- I really don't need those.

930
00:52:58,447 --> 00:53:01,824
Oh, you really do. Here you go.

931
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:03,576
Here you go. Okay?

932
00:53:03,744 --> 00:53:07,497
I just don't want this thing you're
going through to define your life.

933
00:53:07,665 --> 00:53:09,374
Olive, do what you gotta do. Okay?

934
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:14,045
Let your freak flag fly. Just make sure
you have an exit strategy.

935
00:53:14,797 --> 00:53:18,174
Listen, Mrs. Griffith, I really...
I don't need these.

936
00:53:18,342 --> 00:53:20,760
The pill is not 100 percent effective.

937
00:53:20,928 --> 00:53:22,720
Ask some of your friends' parents.

938
00:53:23,764 --> 00:53:25,473
Thank you for coming in.

939
00:53:28,811 --> 00:53:32,063
Can you just send in the next person?
Thank you.

940
00:53:35,693 --> 00:53:37,318
You're up, hoss.

941
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:40,405
Okay. Go. It's all right.

942
00:53:42,658 --> 00:53:44,951
Everything's gonna be okay.

943
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:54,961
Don't you think it's a little strange
that your boyfriend is 22 years old...

944
00:53:55,129 --> 00:53:58,256
...and still in high school?
- Not that it's any of your business...

945
00:53:58,424 --> 00:53:59,799
...but he is here by choice.

946
00:53:59,967 --> 00:54:03,928
It's his choice he's a fourth-year senior
that can't pass any test he takes?

947
00:54:04,096 --> 00:54:06,431
His choice. His? His?

948
00:54:06,598 --> 00:54:07,640
Capital H?

949
00:54:07,808 --> 00:54:11,311
If God wanted him to graduate, God
would've given him the right answers.

950
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:17,233
I'm sorry.
You gotta be shitting me, woman.

951
00:54:17,693 --> 00:54:20,153
Okay. So why was he blubbering
like a baby?

952
00:54:21,238 --> 00:54:24,824
- Is he struggling with his sexuality?
- No, you insensitive rhymes-with-witch.

953
00:54:24,992 --> 00:54:28,119
His parents are
going through a divorce.

954
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,333
Okay.

955
00:54:40,132 --> 00:54:44,886
You know,
sometimes our boyfriend's parents...

956
00:54:45,054 --> 00:54:46,512
...they get divorced, you know?

957
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,641
And it's important to remember
it's not your fault.

958
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:51,851
So I gotta go.

959
00:54:53,228 --> 00:54:57,774
But they go to our church.
What will people say?

960
00:55:02,071 --> 00:55:06,407
How long do these embraces usually
last? Because I gotta go, but I...

961
00:55:06,575 --> 00:55:09,243
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes, I'm gonna be okay.

962
00:55:09,411 --> 00:55:11,120
Mrs. Griffith is amazing...

963
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:15,041
...and she's gonna help Micah,
and everything's gonna be okay.

964
00:55:16,168 --> 00:55:19,879
See? All right, that's the spirit.
Everything's gonna be okay.

965
00:55:20,047 --> 00:55:21,714
Okay.

966
00:55:26,136 --> 00:55:29,055
Wait. Why are you even
being so nice to me?

967
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:33,059
I did it.

968
00:55:34,103 --> 00:55:35,186
I got through to you.

969
00:55:38,273 --> 00:55:41,192
I'm so sorry about everything I said.
I am so, so sorry.

970
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,571
I mean, I really want us to be friends.
Can we please be friends?

971
00:55:46,407 --> 00:55:47,532
Absolutely.

972
00:55:50,702 --> 00:55:53,955
And for a day,
we were actually really good friends.

973
00:55:54,123 --> 00:55:57,041
I was kind of starting to think
things were gonna turn around.

974
00:55:57,209 --> 00:55:59,001
Olive!

975
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:01,587
- Friend.
- Hey, friend.

976
00:56:01,755 --> 00:56:03,464
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you more.

977
00:56:03,632 --> 00:56:06,801
She texted me in first period.

978
00:56:14,184 --> 00:56:16,894
By second period,
we apparently had private jokes.

979
00:56:17,062 --> 00:56:19,272
Olive. Olive.

980
00:56:22,943 --> 00:56:25,194
Tragedy struck in Wood Shop.

981
00:56:25,362 --> 00:56:27,488
It wasn't because
someone sawed off a thumb...

982
00:56:27,656 --> 00:56:29,157
...which has happened.

983
00:56:29,324 --> 00:56:32,201
Micah is in the hospital.
He is in so much pain.

984
00:56:32,369 --> 00:56:35,496
The nurse didn't know
what was wrong.

985
00:56:36,165 --> 00:56:38,166
There, there.

986
00:56:45,299 --> 00:56:47,550
It hurts so bad, Mommy.

987
00:56:47,718 --> 00:56:50,303
Well, it's just what I thought.
Chlamydia.

988
00:56:50,596 --> 00:56:51,929
No.

989
00:56:52,097 --> 00:56:55,683
Who have you been screwing?
Tell me.

990
00:56:55,851 --> 00:56:59,854
Tell me now
or I will kill you right here.

991
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:03,357
Olive. Olive Penderghast!

992
00:57:06,653 --> 00:57:09,280
Olive. Olive Penderghast.

993
00:57:09,448 --> 00:57:11,782
I have to call you back.
Okay. Bye-bye.

994
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,160
Goddamn it.

995
00:57:16,497 --> 00:57:18,623
Chlamydia?!

996
00:57:20,876 --> 00:57:22,835
That bitch!

997
00:57:25,047 --> 00:57:26,631
- Olive?
- Hey.

998
00:57:28,717 --> 00:57:32,512
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Goddamn it.

999
00:57:34,598 --> 00:57:35,723
I panicked.

1000
00:57:35,891 --> 00:57:38,809
I said I got it
from Olive Penderghast.

1001
00:57:38,977 --> 00:57:42,104
I know, but what was
I supposed to say?

1002
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:44,941
You know, and then my mom
tells Marianne's mom.

1003
00:57:45,108 --> 00:57:47,777
I did. I tried to blame it
on their divorce...

1004
00:57:47,945 --> 00:57:51,030
...but my mom is not buying it.

1005
00:57:51,573 --> 00:57:53,908
That's it. I have to tell them.

1006
00:57:54,076 --> 00:57:58,079
No, I do not care that you
gave me chlamydia. I don't!

1007
00:57:58,288 --> 00:58:02,792
I love you and I want to be with you,
and nobody can stop us.

1008
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,837
Not my mother, not Marianne,
and not even the school board...

1009
00:58:07,005 --> 00:58:09,340
...or the president of the Americas!

1010
00:58:10,259 --> 00:58:13,928
Oh, God.

1011
00:58:18,934 --> 00:58:21,519
What? What do you want?
What do you want?

1012
00:58:21,687 --> 00:58:23,271
Just go.

1013
00:58:26,525 --> 00:58:28,568
Perfect. Just perfect.

1014
00:58:29,444 --> 00:58:32,363
I'm sorry, I just...
I was looking for Marianne.

1015
00:58:32,531 --> 00:58:34,490
Did she say anything
about being mad at me?

1016
00:58:34,658 --> 00:58:36,450
She just smacked
the bejesus out of me.

1017
00:58:36,618 --> 00:58:39,495
No, that's my fault.
I'm so sorry, Olive. I'm sorry.

1018
00:58:39,663 --> 00:58:43,541
But I messed up, okay?
I just goddamn shit...

1019
00:58:43,709 --> 00:58:48,212
...goddamn messed up
really goddamn shit bad.

1020
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,298
Goddamn. Shit, goddamn.

1021
00:58:50,465 --> 00:58:54,594
Okay. Don't get me wrong
because I love it...

1022
00:58:54,761 --> 00:58:58,472
...but I don't think you're supposed to
use that language in front of a student.

1023
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,642
You know what else you're not
supposed to do, is sleep with them.

1024
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:04,061
But that didn't stop me. Goddamn shit.

1025
00:59:04,813 --> 00:59:07,565
Wait. You... Oh, my God.

1026
00:59:07,733 --> 00:59:11,152
But I'm not... I'm not judging
you or anything, but, oh, my God.

1027
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,239
I... Wait, what does that
have to do with me?

1028
00:59:15,407 --> 00:59:17,491
You should know
that my marriage is not great.

1029
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:19,327
We haven't slept together
in months.

1030
00:59:19,494 --> 00:59:20,536
In months, all right?

1031
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:24,749
Finally, this great-looking guy comes
in and he's nice to me, you know?

1032
00:59:24,916 --> 00:59:26,125
And he's not a minor.

1033
00:59:26,293 --> 00:59:30,504
This is legal. It's legal
because he's been here forever, okay?

1034
00:59:30,672 --> 00:59:33,466
He's not the sharpest
Christian in the Bible, all right?

1035
00:59:33,634 --> 00:59:36,844
And then he finds out
that he has chlamydia.

1036
00:59:37,012 --> 00:59:39,972
And so then he's telling
everybody that it was you.

1037
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,849
He didn't want me
to lose my job...

1038
00:59:42,017 --> 00:59:45,436
...and he doesn't wanna get in trouble
either, so he said it's you.

1039
00:59:45,604 --> 00:59:46,812
I'm sorry.

1040
00:59:48,023 --> 00:59:50,983
But I'Il... I'm gonna fix it, Olive.
Okay? I'll tell everyone.

1041
00:59:51,151 --> 00:59:56,030
I'm gonna tell everyone that it's me.
Okay? I'll just... I'll lose my job.

1042
00:59:56,531 --> 00:59:59,867
And, you know, whatever else I lose,
and then that's okay.

1043
01:00:03,538 --> 01:00:06,624
Maybe it was becoming a habit
of mine to help the downtrodden...

1044
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:08,751
...or maybe I just couldn't stand
to see...

1045
01:00:08,919 --> 01:00:10,836
...my favorite teacher's
marriage crumble.

1046
01:00:11,004 --> 01:00:13,214
Either way, I decided to help.

1047
01:00:13,715 --> 01:00:15,883
I could have chlamydia.

1048
01:00:17,427 --> 01:00:21,514
I mean, I could have easily given it
to Micah.

1049
01:00:21,682 --> 01:00:23,557
I mean, who knows?

1050
01:00:23,725 --> 01:00:26,644
Women oftentimes
don't show symptoms.

1051
01:00:26,812 --> 01:00:29,146
And the whole world knows
I've been whoring around.

1052
01:00:29,314 --> 01:00:30,856
No, you haven't. No, you haven't.

1053
01:00:31,024 --> 01:00:36,362
Because a real whore can't admit it
to herself, much less others. Trust me.

1054
01:00:39,324 --> 01:00:40,658
Call Micah.

1055
01:00:40,826 --> 01:00:44,203
Tell him he is an ass and
he owes me so big for this, but also...

1056
01:00:44,371 --> 01:00:47,206
...tell him I confessed
to giving him chlamydia.

1057
01:00:54,756 --> 01:00:57,258
Getting a lot of hugs today.

1058
01:00:57,884 --> 01:01:00,386
- You're going to hell, Olive!
- Get out of here!

1059
01:01:02,973 --> 01:01:05,266
I guess I shouldn't be too shocked
these people...

1060
01:01:05,434 --> 01:01:07,184
...wanted my diseased ass
out of there.

1061
01:01:07,352 --> 01:01:08,394
Save yourself, Olive.

1062
01:01:08,562 --> 01:01:11,397
The funny thing is, the whole time
this all was going down...

1063
01:01:11,565 --> 01:01:14,608
...I couldn't help but think
I could've come up with better signs.

1064
01:01:14,776 --> 01:01:16,610
Although you gotta love
the Quiznos guy.

1065
01:01:16,778 --> 01:01:19,947
That's the one thing
that trumps religion: Capitalism.

1066
01:01:20,115 --> 01:01:21,532
Why are you doing this?

1067
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,826
I'm trying to make this school
a better place.

1068
01:01:23,994 --> 01:01:26,287
Start a petition to get rid
of the lead paint.

1069
01:01:26,455 --> 01:01:27,788
New Honey Chicken at Quiznos.

1070
01:01:27,956 --> 01:01:30,207
- Not now, Quiznos.
- You're a slut.

1071
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:31,542
You're going down, Olive.

1072
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:35,045
If this is because I'm more popular
than you, then I think what you're...

1073
01:01:35,213 --> 01:01:37,715
Let's not mistake popularity
for infamy.

1074
01:01:37,883 --> 01:01:40,760
- You don't wanna burn, do you?
- I'll be praying for you.

1075
01:01:45,807 --> 01:01:47,516
Sorry.

1076
01:01:48,143 --> 01:01:51,645
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm awesome. I'm awesome.

1077
01:01:51,813 --> 01:01:53,314
Screw all these people, Olive.

1078
01:01:53,482 --> 01:01:55,649
Haven't you heard?

1079
01:01:55,817 --> 01:01:57,985
I already did.

1080
01:01:58,153 --> 01:02:01,155
- You're going to hell, Olive!
- What you're doing is wrong.

1081
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:03,491
You're going to hell!

1082
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:10,498
So they got Rhiannon.

1083
01:02:10,665 --> 01:02:13,918
Never underestimate the power
of extremists like Marianne.

1084
01:02:14,085 --> 01:02:17,838
They sense any weakness,
they pounce like jungle cats.

1085
01:02:18,006 --> 01:02:20,758
And the whack pack
just gets bigger and bigger.

1086
01:02:20,926 --> 01:02:23,010
But at least they have a pack.

1087
01:02:23,178 --> 01:02:27,056
I was used to being by myself,
but I had never felt more alone.

1088
01:02:27,224 --> 01:02:30,684
I thought I should look into what they
were running around thumping about.

1089
01:02:30,852 --> 01:02:33,145
- Do you have a religion section?
- It's over there.

1090
01:02:33,313 --> 01:02:35,314
- Can I help you with something?
- The Bible.

1091
01:02:35,482 --> 01:02:38,442
That's in bestsellers,
right next to Twilight.

1092
01:02:40,195 --> 01:02:42,404
I didn't have time
to read the whole thing...

1093
01:02:42,572 --> 01:02:44,114
...because it's, like, 600 pages.

1094
01:02:44,282 --> 01:02:45,783
Single-spaced.

1095
01:02:45,951 --> 01:02:48,536
And as every war
that's ever been fought can tell you...

1096
01:02:48,703 --> 01:02:50,704
...there are many ways
you can interpret it.

1097
01:02:50,872 --> 01:02:53,833
Except the Civil War.
That was pure racism.

1098
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,334
So I went to find an expert.

1099
01:02:55,877 --> 01:02:59,880
But really, I just kind of
wanted someone to talk to.

1100
01:03:01,216 --> 01:03:04,885
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1101
01:03:05,387 --> 01:03:07,304
I think that's how you
start these things.

1102
01:03:07,472 --> 01:03:09,723
I'm just going off
what I've seen in movies.

1103
01:03:09,891 --> 01:03:11,934
Where do I even start?

1104
01:03:13,144 --> 01:03:16,355
I've been pretending to be...

1105
01:03:16,523 --> 01:03:18,399
What is the Catholic way
of phrasing this?

1106
01:03:18,567 --> 01:03:20,401
A harlot?

1107
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:25,239
A harlot. It's not that
I've actually been doing...

1108
01:03:25,407 --> 01:03:29,076
...the things that people have
been saying I've been doing...

1109
01:03:29,244 --> 01:03:31,370
...but then again,
I'm not denying them either.

1110
01:03:31,538 --> 01:03:34,957
So I was just wondering,
is that wrong?

1111
01:03:35,584 --> 01:03:40,087
It's just that a lot of people
have been asking me to do things...

1112
01:03:40,255 --> 01:03:46,427
...and I thought it was okay
because it wasn't real, you know?

1113
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:50,347
It was make-believe.

1114
01:03:50,515 --> 01:03:52,933
And no one was getting hurt...

1115
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:59,815
...but a lot of people hate me now.

1116
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:05,821
I kind of hate me too.

1117
01:04:11,786 --> 01:04:13,996
I might be wrong...

1118
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:16,790
...but aren't you
supposed to say something?

1119
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:19,001
Tell me to say 10 Hail Marys,
pay a fine...

1120
01:04:19,169 --> 01:04:21,670
...advance token to nearest railroad?
Hello?

1121
01:04:23,965 --> 01:04:25,466
Should've seen that one coming.

1122
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:35,768
Luckily, I live in a town
with many different places of worship.

1123
01:04:35,936 --> 01:04:38,479
So I went to find one
with a real live human being.

1124
01:04:38,897 --> 01:04:39,939
Can I help you?

1125
01:04:40,106 --> 01:04:42,733
Yeah, I was just wondering
if there's a minister around.

1126
01:04:43,401 --> 01:04:45,361
Is it not a minister?

1127
01:04:45,528 --> 01:04:47,571
A Reverend? A wizard?

1128
01:04:47,739 --> 01:04:49,615
It's a pastor, and he's here.

1129
01:04:51,242 --> 01:04:52,660
How can I help you today?

1130
01:04:52,827 --> 01:04:56,163
I was wondering what your church's
stance on lying and adultery was.

1131
01:04:56,331 --> 01:04:57,331
It's not a good thing.

1132
01:04:57,499 --> 01:05:01,835
Oh, I agree, wholeheartedly.
But, then... Now, tell me this.

1133
01:05:02,003 --> 01:05:03,420
Assuming there is a hell...

1134
01:05:03,588 --> 01:05:06,715
Oh, the Christian Church recognizes
the existence of hell.

1135
01:05:06,883 --> 01:05:09,176
Okay, so we'll just say
there's a "hell."

1136
01:05:09,344 --> 01:05:11,470
There is. Just so we're clear.

1137
01:05:11,638 --> 01:05:15,140
- Okay. So for argument's sake...
- No, there's no argument. It's there.

1138
01:05:15,308 --> 01:05:18,894
Right below our feet,
right above the Orient. It's there.

1139
01:05:21,147 --> 01:05:24,817
Then what would be worse,
lying or adultery?

1140
01:05:24,985 --> 01:05:27,695
Or is lying about adultery
just like double whammy? Sorry.

1141
01:05:27,862 --> 01:05:29,363
Come on.

1142
01:05:32,283 --> 01:05:34,201
I'm sorry,
what did you say your name was?

1143
01:05:34,911 --> 01:05:38,372
I didn't. I... You know what?
I'm just gonna...

1144
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:40,874
I'm just gonna go check out
Judaism because...

1145
01:05:41,042 --> 01:05:43,043
- God. Two frames, really?
- Sorry.

1146
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:45,337
The Jews and I have a lot in common.

1147
01:05:45,505 --> 01:05:48,257
- Just fashion-wise and stuff.
- Off you go.

1148
01:05:48,425 --> 01:05:51,468
Yes, I had unwittingly sought advice
from the father...

1149
01:05:51,636 --> 01:05:53,721
...of the leader of my lynch mob.

1150
01:05:53,888 --> 01:05:59,018
What other complete and total idiot
can say that's happened to them?

1151
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:05,315
Okay, I've narrowed it down
to The Other Boleyn Girl...

1152
01:06:05,483 --> 01:06:08,152
...or The Bucket List. Huge hit.

1153
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:11,238
Why can't we watch a movie for kids?
You always get to pick.

1154
01:06:11,406 --> 01:06:15,075
Because the Family Member
of the Week gets to pick the movie.

1155
01:06:15,243 --> 01:06:17,828
Yeah, but you get Family Member
of the Week every week.

1156
01:06:17,996 --> 01:06:19,496
And there's a reason for that.

1157
01:06:19,664 --> 01:06:22,332
Yeah. You pick
Family Member of the Week.

1158
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,001
Are you accusing me of nepotism?

1159
01:06:24,169 --> 01:06:27,713
Okay, it's The Bucket List.
This is it. This is the greatest decision.

1160
01:06:27,881 --> 01:06:31,008
I'm so happy with this decision.
That's what it's going to be.

1161
01:06:31,176 --> 01:06:34,136
All right, now, honey, after we watch
The Bucket List...

1162
01:06:34,304 --> 01:06:38,849
...remember to cross "Watch
The Bucket List" off our bucket list.

1163
01:06:39,017 --> 01:06:40,059
Guys.

1164
01:06:40,226 --> 01:06:45,355
I want you to know that if you hear
I have chlamydia, that is totally false.

1165
01:06:45,523 --> 01:06:48,025
Olive, do we need
to have the talk again?

1166
01:06:48,193 --> 01:06:50,569
No. It's just a thing
that's going around.

1167
01:06:50,737 --> 01:06:53,614
You know, nothing you're saying
is making me feel any better.

1168
01:06:53,782 --> 01:06:56,450
Not to mention how you've been
dressing the last few days.

1169
01:06:56,618 --> 01:06:58,494
No judgment,
but you look like a stripper.

1170
01:06:58,661 --> 01:07:01,121
- Mom.
- A high-end stripper.

1171
01:07:01,289 --> 01:07:02,915
For governors or athletes.

1172
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:04,416
But stripper, nonetheless.

1173
01:07:04,584 --> 01:07:07,252
Oh, my God.
I'm just trying to mix it up a little.

1174
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,213
And I have no STDs, I promise you.

1175
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:11,840
Oh, that's great.
Daughter of the Year.

1176
01:07:12,008 --> 01:07:13,801
If you hear anything
to the contrary...

1177
01:07:13,968 --> 01:07:16,178
...come up with some funny retort
and walk away.

1178
01:07:16,346 --> 01:07:19,139
Honey, you're kind of
starting to worry us a little.

1179
01:07:19,307 --> 01:07:21,308
Should we be kind of
worried a little?

1180
01:07:21,476 --> 01:07:23,310
I don't think so.

1181
01:07:23,478 --> 01:07:26,438
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1182
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:29,483
Yeah. I got it all under control.

1183
01:07:30,693 --> 01:07:31,735
- Okay.
- Okay.

1184
01:07:31,903 --> 01:07:34,071
Then let's Bucket List this bitch.

1185
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:36,073
The Bucket List, The Bucket List.

1186
01:07:36,241 --> 01:07:38,617
To say this whole thing
had taken over my life...

1187
01:07:38,785 --> 01:07:41,245
...would be
a colossal understatement.

1188
01:07:41,454 --> 01:07:44,665
I actually reread The Scarlet Letter
to see how Hester dealt with it.

1189
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:49,670
And it turns out she bore
her punishment in humble silence...

1190
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:53,006
...which are two concepts
I am not comfortable with.

1191
01:07:53,174 --> 01:07:55,384
With all the mythical play
I was getting...

1192
01:07:55,552 --> 01:07:58,554
...I still actually hadn't been
asked out on a real date.

1193
01:07:58,721 --> 01:08:01,807
People were jumping up and down
to say they'd slept with me...

1194
01:08:01,975 --> 01:08:04,434
...but no one bothered
really trying to sleep with me.

1195
01:08:04,602 --> 01:08:07,521
I was starting to think I actually did
have a gnome down there.

1196
01:08:07,689 --> 01:08:10,065
- Until finally...
- Hey, Olive.

1197
01:08:10,692 --> 01:08:12,442
Hey, Anson. What's up?

1198
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:14,736
I was wondering
if you were busy tonight.

1199
01:08:14,904 --> 01:08:17,823
Maybe wanna go out or something?

1200
01:08:18,992 --> 01:08:20,450
What did you have in mind?

1201
01:08:20,618 --> 01:08:23,328
I was thinking about getting
a hot-air balloon, you know...

1202
01:08:23,496 --> 01:08:25,205
...bringing along some champagne...

1203
01:08:25,373 --> 01:08:28,709
...and then possibly reading
some Sylvia Plath.

1204
01:08:28,877 --> 01:08:32,254
Or we could just go
to The Lobster Shack...

1205
01:08:32,422 --> 01:08:34,464
...because it's, you know,
a little easier.

1206
01:08:34,632 --> 01:08:37,759
- I love The Lobster Shack.
- Good.

1207
01:08:37,927 --> 01:08:39,386
Okay. It's a date, then.

1208
01:08:40,555 --> 01:08:43,140
- Okay.
- Okay.

1209
01:08:44,851 --> 01:08:47,603
So should I still bring
the Sylvia Plath or?

1210
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:49,730
No, we could stick our heads
in the oven...

1211
01:08:49,898 --> 01:08:51,982
...if we run out of things
to talk about.

1212
01:08:52,734 --> 01:08:53,734
That was...

1213
01:08:53,902 --> 01:08:55,861
- Cool. All right. Well...
- Cool.

1214
01:09:04,746 --> 01:09:06,038
You look really beautiful.

1215
01:09:06,206 --> 01:09:07,915
Thank you.

1216
01:09:10,084 --> 01:09:11,793
- You're a real gentleman.
- No.

1217
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:16,465
Just a guy having dinner with a girl.

1218
01:09:27,727 --> 01:09:31,271
Do you believe this whole thing
about lobster being an aphrodisiac?

1219
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,941
I did not know it was.

1220
01:09:34,108 --> 01:09:36,568
Medical science really
has not substantiated claims...

1221
01:09:36,736 --> 01:09:39,947
...that any particular food increases
sexual desire or performance...

1222
01:09:40,114 --> 01:09:42,950
...but guys just spend and spend
to ply women with food...

1223
01:09:43,117 --> 01:09:46,620
...they think is gonna get them lucky.
Which is funny, because, it's like...

1224
01:09:46,788 --> 01:09:49,873
...what is sexy about
slurping back oysters? Nothing.

1225
01:09:50,041 --> 01:09:53,627
Did you know some people actually
eat ground-up rhinoceros horn...

1226
01:09:53,795 --> 01:09:56,838
...because it's thought to increase
the size of the male sex organ?

1227
01:09:57,006 --> 01:09:58,966
That's not true at all.

1228
01:09:59,133 --> 01:10:01,760
Spanish fly. Spanish fly.
You've heard of this? Yes?

1229
01:10:01,928 --> 01:10:03,470
- Yes.
- Okay. That thing?

1230
01:10:03,638 --> 01:10:05,764
Pulverized blister beetle. What?

1231
01:10:05,932 --> 01:10:09,476
And it's illegal in the U.S. Because
if you eat just a little bit too much...

1232
01:10:09,644 --> 01:10:12,813
...it causes painful urination,
fever and bloody discharge.

1233
01:10:12,981 --> 01:10:14,356
- Am I talking too much?
- No.

1234
01:10:14,524 --> 01:10:17,234
You're just burning through
a lot of topics really fast.

1235
01:10:17,402 --> 01:10:20,237
Shouldn't have had coffee
three weeks ago.

1236
01:10:20,405 --> 01:10:21,446
I'm just kidding.

1237
01:10:21,614 --> 01:10:25,450
Your Maine lobster
with crab and seafood stuffing.

1238
01:10:26,828 --> 01:10:28,745
- I'm jealous.
- Thank you.

1239
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:31,790
Let's dig in. Right?

1240
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,380
I didn't know Woodchuck Todd
worked here.

1241
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:47,222
He's dressed like a lobster.

1242
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:50,309
I should start calling him
Lobster Todd.

1243
01:10:55,982 --> 01:10:57,190
Shit.

1244
01:10:57,358 --> 01:10:59,151
- Shit, shit, shit.
- What? What's wrong?

1245
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:00,819
- Rhiannon's over there.
- So?

1246
01:11:00,987 --> 01:11:03,238
She's been in love with you
since 1 st grade.

1247
01:11:03,406 --> 01:11:05,949
- She's my best friend.
- I thought you weren't speaking.

1248
01:11:06,117 --> 01:11:08,452
But that doesn't mean
she's not my best friend.

1249
01:11:08,619 --> 01:11:10,162
Or that I should be out with you.

1250
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:12,706
Rhi and I don't have
anything in common.

1251
01:11:12,874 --> 01:11:14,624
- And you and I do?
- Yeah.

1252
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:17,878
- Like what?
- Like I hate Marianne Bryant too.

1253
01:11:18,046 --> 01:11:20,881
If that's our connection,
I should date the entire school.

1254
01:11:21,049 --> 01:11:22,799
Haven't you?

1255
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:26,553
No. No, I haven't.

1256
01:11:29,932 --> 01:11:31,641
Okay, she can't see us.
Check. Check.

1257
01:11:31,809 --> 01:11:34,102
Can you just...? Excuse me? Hi.

1258
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:38,607
I just remembered
I am so allergic to shellfish.

1259
01:11:38,775 --> 01:11:41,068
I forget that my respiratory system
will collapse.

1260
01:11:41,235 --> 01:11:43,487
- I have a gift certificate. Keep the tip.
- Thanks.

1261
01:11:43,654 --> 01:11:45,197
I'm sorry, but we have to go.

1262
01:11:45,365 --> 01:11:48,116
- Go. Go. Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

1263
01:11:48,284 --> 01:11:49,868
Go, go, go.

1264
01:11:57,877 --> 01:11:59,920
I'm sorry about that.

1265
01:12:02,215 --> 01:12:04,633
I've got something for you.

1266
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:08,261
Two hundred dollars
to The Home Depot.

1267
01:12:14,852 --> 01:12:16,186
I didn't realize this was a...

1268
01:12:16,354 --> 01:12:20,107
I know it sounds kind of lame, but they
really do have some awesome stuff.

1269
01:12:20,274 --> 01:12:22,776
I bought my air compressor there.

1270
01:12:24,278 --> 01:12:26,947
So, what did we do on this date?

1271
01:12:27,115 --> 01:12:28,698
Whatever 200 bucks gets me.

1272
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:34,162
- That's not really how it works.
- It's okay.

1273
01:12:34,956 --> 01:12:36,456
Stop.

1274
01:12:36,624 --> 01:12:39,292
I'm not really having sex with people
for money.

1275
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:43,422
I'm saying I'm having sex for money,
but I'm not having sex for money.

1276
01:12:43,589 --> 01:12:45,257
It's okay. It's all right. Come on.

1277
01:12:45,425 --> 01:12:47,092
- Stop. No, no.
- What?

1278
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,510
Stop!

1279
01:12:48,678 --> 01:12:51,263
Come on, just relax. Come on, babe.
It's all right.

1280
01:12:51,431 --> 01:12:54,516
God. Asshole.

1281
01:12:58,688 --> 01:13:01,940
What are you doing? I paid you.

1282
01:13:02,859 --> 01:13:04,818
Now you didn't.

1283
01:13:06,821 --> 01:13:09,823
Come on, this is bullshit.

1284
01:13:14,162 --> 01:13:16,037
Goddamn it.

1285
01:13:17,248 --> 01:13:18,999
Hey, Olive.

1286
01:13:20,418 --> 01:13:22,294
Todd, hi.

1287
01:13:27,675 --> 01:13:31,052
- Hey, you all right?
- I just have something in my eye.

1288
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:34,598
Like a twig, you know, or a branch,
or a contact, or something.

1289
01:13:34,765 --> 01:13:39,019
- I didn't know you wore contacts.
- I don't, which is why I was tearing up.

1290
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:43,899
Olive, hey. Let me drive you home.

1291
01:13:51,949 --> 01:13:54,701
Do you wanna talk about it?

1292
01:13:58,206 --> 01:14:02,459
What's to say?
Everybody thinks I'm a whore...

1293
01:14:03,252 --> 01:14:05,837
...and for the first time,
I'm starting to believe it.

1294
01:14:06,005 --> 01:14:07,047
What?

1295
01:14:07,215 --> 01:14:10,050
Don't act like you don't know
what people are saying about me.

1296
01:14:10,218 --> 01:14:13,053
I know what people are saying.
Doesn't mean I believe them.

1297
01:14:13,221 --> 01:14:15,055
- Who told you?
- No one.

1298
01:14:15,223 --> 01:14:18,475
No one had to tell me that once upon
a time, there was a scared kid...

1299
01:14:18,643 --> 01:14:22,479
...at a party in a dark room
who was not ready for his first kiss.

1300
01:14:22,647 --> 01:14:27,108
And, you know, there was
this amazing girl who lied for him.

1301
01:14:27,276 --> 01:14:30,195
I still can't believe
you remember that.

1302
01:14:33,449 --> 01:14:36,493
You know, sometimes I pretend
you were my first real kiss.

1303
01:14:37,912 --> 01:14:39,579
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1304
01:14:41,374 --> 01:14:43,416
- Who was?
- It was Rhiannon.

1305
01:14:43,584 --> 01:14:45,293
- What?
- She must have told you.

1306
01:14:45,461 --> 01:14:49,673
Yeah, it was... I think it was, like,
a year after that or something.

1307
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,676
It sucked, by the way.
She was, like:

1308
01:14:52,843 --> 01:14:55,095
That bitch.

1309
01:14:55,263 --> 01:14:57,973
Oh, my God,
she knew how I felt about you.

1310
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:01,017
- How do you feel about me?
- And here I am feeling so bad.

1311
01:15:01,185 --> 01:15:02,394
That's just perfect.

1312
01:15:02,562 --> 01:15:04,938
Wait, hold on a second.
How do you feel about me?

1313
01:15:05,147 --> 01:15:06,856
"Felt."

1314
01:15:07,233 --> 01:15:08,608
I said "felt."

1315
01:15:10,403 --> 01:15:13,697
Because I thought I...
I thought I heard "feel."

1316
01:15:13,864 --> 01:15:15,490
- No, it was "felt."
- All right.

1317
01:15:15,658 --> 01:15:17,701
How do you know where I live?

1318
01:15:17,868 --> 01:15:19,202
We used to carpool.

1319
01:15:19,704 --> 01:15:23,039
Yeah, in 2nd grade. What, are you
like a savant for people's addresses?

1320
01:15:23,207 --> 01:15:25,292
Just for people who I think are cool.

1321
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,128
- You think I'm cool?
- I do.

1322
01:15:28,296 --> 01:15:31,590
And I think you're pretty and smart.

1323
01:15:31,882 --> 01:15:34,676
Did you form this opinion
prior to my little transformation?

1324
01:15:34,844 --> 01:15:36,511
Way prior.

1325
01:15:37,888 --> 01:15:39,723
Why didn't that rumor spread?

1326
01:15:40,182 --> 01:15:41,933
I like to keep my business to myself.

1327
01:15:42,101 --> 01:15:44,102
Notoriety, for whatever reason...

1328
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:47,147
...never seems to benefit the noted,
it's only the "notees."

1329
01:15:48,899 --> 01:15:50,483
Where were you two weeks ago?

1330
01:15:55,406 --> 01:15:56,573
Olive.

1331
01:15:57,783 --> 01:16:02,621
If I promise not to tell anyone,
could I kiss you right now?

1332
01:16:06,334 --> 01:16:08,084
No.

1333
01:16:10,129 --> 01:16:12,339
- Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
- Oh, no.

1334
01:16:12,506 --> 01:16:14,633
I just mean, not like this.

1335
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,677
I don't wanna kiss you with mascara
running down my face...

1336
01:16:17,845 --> 01:16:20,347
...and some horndog guy
just having tried...

1337
01:16:20,514 --> 01:16:23,558
...to stick his tongue
down my throat.

1338
01:16:24,685 --> 01:16:27,145
I've wanted to kiss you
since 8th grade...

1339
01:16:28,147 --> 01:16:30,482
...but I want it to be perfect.

1340
01:16:31,484 --> 01:16:34,152
And right now, my life is a mess.

1341
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:37,906
I need to get my business in order
before I drag you into it.

1342
01:16:38,074 --> 01:16:40,367
What if I told you
I wanna be dragged into it?

1343
01:16:41,327 --> 01:16:42,911
I could help, maybe.

1344
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:12,857
Why now?

1345
01:17:14,026 --> 01:17:16,027
Why are you all of a sudden
into me now?

1346
01:17:16,195 --> 01:17:17,320
I don't know.

1347
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:21,199
I haven't overanalyzed it,
like you're about to.

1348
01:17:25,705 --> 01:17:29,290
- Good night, Olive.
- Good night, Lobster Todd.

1349
01:17:31,252 --> 01:17:34,671
Now that I knew there were decent
and goodhearted people out there...

1350
01:17:34,839 --> 01:17:36,423
...the lies had to stop.

1351
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:40,093
I knew there was only one person I
could count on to set the story straight:

1352
01:17:40,261 --> 01:17:41,261
Brandon.

1353
01:17:41,429 --> 01:17:44,681
I'd helped him, and even though
it would destroy his new reputation...

1354
01:17:44,849 --> 01:17:47,392
...as a straight stud,
I knew he'd help me.

1355
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:50,186
Oh, my God. Did you hear that
Brandon ran away from home?

1356
01:17:50,354 --> 01:17:53,773
Yeah, totally. He left his parents
a note that said, "I'm gay, bitches"...

1357
01:17:53,941 --> 01:17:57,110
...and then he skipped town
with some big, hulking black guy.

1358
01:17:58,404 --> 01:17:59,904
My apologies to Mark Twain.

1359
01:18:00,072 --> 01:18:01,156
- Wait, huh?
- What?

1360
01:18:01,323 --> 01:18:03,283
- You said something.
- You said something.

1361
01:18:03,451 --> 01:18:05,326
You said something,
so I came back.

1362
01:18:05,494 --> 01:18:06,953
- You're funny. Okay.
- Call me.

1363
01:18:07,121 --> 01:18:10,290
I went to everyone I'd helped
and begged them to say it wasn't true.

1364
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:12,625
No way. I gave you money.

1365
01:18:12,793 --> 01:18:16,421
You gave me a gift card to AutoZone.
I don't even have a car.

1366
01:18:16,589 --> 01:18:18,381
I thought it'd be aspirational.

1367
01:18:18,549 --> 01:18:22,761
Evan, please do this for me, all right?
I did that for you. Do this for me.

1368
01:18:22,928 --> 01:18:25,847
I don't want people to know
I didn't go to second base with you.

1369
01:18:26,015 --> 01:18:29,017
Do you know how many girls
I've hooked up with because of that?

1370
01:18:29,185 --> 01:18:30,727
Girls are almost as dumb as boys.

1371
01:18:30,895 --> 01:18:33,605
Oh, yes, they are.

1372
01:18:37,109 --> 01:18:38,485
It gets worse.

1373
01:18:38,652 --> 01:18:40,278
"Honor your father
and your mother."

1374
01:18:40,446 --> 01:18:43,865
Due to his condition, Micah was sent
on a visit to his grandparents...

1375
01:18:44,033 --> 01:18:45,492
...in Palatka, Florida.

1376
01:18:45,659 --> 01:18:48,828
And if there's one thing worse
than chlamydia, it's Florida.

1377
01:18:48,996 --> 01:18:50,789
"... be guilty of adultery."

1378
01:18:50,956 --> 01:18:52,999
Get your hands
out of your berries, boy.

1379
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:55,168
Olive, life is full of choices.

1380
01:18:55,336 --> 01:18:58,588
I made a bad one.
But then, so did you.

1381
01:18:58,756 --> 01:19:02,091
But I see no other alternative
than to just live with the guilt.

1382
01:19:02,259 --> 01:19:05,595
My guilt stems from my indiscretion
and yours for lying.

1383
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:09,891
We made our choices.
Now, we just have to let it ride.

1384
01:19:10,059 --> 01:19:14,354
Or I could just tell everyone the truth
and get you fired and put in jail.

1385
01:19:14,522 --> 01:19:17,148
Okay, first of all, he is of age, okay?

1386
01:19:17,316 --> 01:19:19,526
It's perfectly legal
in the state of California.

1387
01:19:19,693 --> 01:19:22,278
I checked. He is 21 in eight months.

1388
01:19:22,446 --> 01:19:25,365
And secondly, let's play the Who
Would You Believe game, okay?

1389
01:19:25,533 --> 01:19:28,910
Why don't you ask yourself, if you
were an adult, who would you believe?

1390
01:19:29,078 --> 01:19:31,162
Who would you believe?
Who would you believe?

1391
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:33,498
Who would you believe? Who?

1392
01:19:38,212 --> 01:19:40,421
Thank you for coming in.

1393
01:19:43,759 --> 01:19:48,137
Yeah, Mrs. Griffith was pure evil, but
I still shouldn't have done what I did.

1394
01:19:48,305 --> 01:19:51,099
Your wife has chlamydia,
and she's sleeping with a student...

1395
01:19:51,267 --> 01:19:53,893
...and she gave it to him,
and she's trying to blame me.

1396
01:19:55,229 --> 01:19:56,771
What?

1397
01:20:00,234 --> 01:20:06,573
I'm sorry.

1398
01:20:07,366 --> 01:20:09,826
Mr. Griffith, if you ever see this...

1399
01:20:09,994 --> 01:20:15,915
...just know that I was wrong
to tell you that in that way. At all.

1400
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:18,126
I shouldn't have done it.

1401
01:20:18,586 --> 01:20:21,254
And I don't even feel bad
for lying for your wife.

1402
01:20:21,422 --> 01:20:26,926
But I hate myself for telling you
the truth. I am so sorry.

1403
01:20:27,094 --> 01:20:31,222
With my words, even though
they were true, I ended a marriage.

1404
01:20:31,432 --> 01:20:35,852
Looking back, that's the thing
I regret the most.

1405
01:20:42,318 --> 01:20:47,697
So now everyone that knows the truth
is either gone or they won't fess up.

1406
01:20:47,865 --> 01:20:52,869
And Marianne Bryant and her
disciples are demanding my head.

1407
01:20:53,037 --> 01:20:56,623
The messed-up thing is I would not put
it past Principal Gibbons to expel me.

1408
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:58,958
I had a similar situation
when I was your age.

1409
01:20:59,126 --> 01:21:00,793
What? Everyone called you a slut?

1410
01:21:00,961 --> 01:21:04,047
I had a horrible reputation and
people said awful things about me.

1411
01:21:04,548 --> 01:21:06,466
- Why?
- Because I was a slut.

1412
01:21:06,634 --> 01:21:11,054
I slept with a whole bunch of people.
A slew, a heap, a peck. Mostly guys.

1413
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:13,514
- Mom.
- Sorry, I got around.

1414
01:21:13,682 --> 01:21:16,684
Before I met Dad,
I had incredibly low self-worth.

1415
01:21:16,852 --> 01:21:20,438
Do me a favor and just stuff this down
my throat until I asphyxiate to death.

1416
01:21:20,606 --> 01:21:23,107
- It's true. It is.
- I want to die.

1417
01:21:23,275 --> 01:21:25,610
It's true.
I was quite the contortionist.

1418
01:21:25,778 --> 01:21:28,821
I could do this thing. I could go...
I mean, my leg all the way...

1419
01:21:28,989 --> 01:21:31,282
Stop. Can you stop?
Don't show me.

1420
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:34,535
- Can you not see that I'm a mess?
- No, you're not, Olive.

1421
01:21:34,703 --> 01:21:36,454
You're wonderful.

1422
01:21:36,997 --> 01:21:39,165
And you'll handle this
the same way I did.

1423
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:41,793
With an incontrovertible
sense of humor.

1424
01:21:43,087 --> 01:21:45,505
But you're much smarter than I am...

1425
01:21:45,673 --> 01:21:48,758
...so you'll come out of this
much better than I did.

1426
01:21:51,512 --> 01:21:52,679
Thank you, Mom.

1427
01:21:54,014 --> 01:21:58,518
- I could get my leg so far back.
- No, no, no. Stop it.

1428
01:21:58,686 --> 01:22:01,521
So it was time to put an end
to all this once and for all...

1429
01:22:01,689 --> 01:22:03,314
...by telling my side of the story.

1430
01:22:03,482 --> 01:22:05,608
And that's why I decided
to do this webcast.

1431
01:22:05,776 --> 01:22:08,069
So here we go.

1432
01:22:09,697 --> 01:22:11,364
Part five.

1433
01:22:11,532 --> 01:22:13,658
Not with a fizzle, but with a bang.

1434
01:22:13,826 --> 01:22:17,704
Today we had yet another
one of our ridiculous pep rallies.

1435
01:22:17,871 --> 01:22:21,040
Todd convinced the band to play
the sexiest song in their repertoire.

1436
01:22:21,208 --> 01:22:24,794
I needed to pique everyone's interest
to get them to go home and log on.

1437
01:22:24,962 --> 01:22:28,339
I had one outfit left and I figured
about 30 seconds to do it.

1438
01:22:28,507 --> 01:22:31,259
Plus I really wanted
my own awesome musical number...

1439
01:22:31,885 --> 01:22:33,928
...for no apparent reason.

1440
01:22:38,642 --> 01:22:39,892
Is that Olive?

1441
01:24:04,478 --> 01:24:06,354
This was just a free preview.

1442
01:24:06,522 --> 01:24:12,151
For the main event, log on to
www. FreeOlive. com tonight at 6 p. m.

1443
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:15,571
And I know it interferes with
the basketball game but, come on...

1444
01:24:15,739 --> 01:24:17,824
...would you rather cheer on
the Woodchucks...

1445
01:24:17,991 --> 01:24:20,201
...or watch me do one?

1446
01:24:21,703 --> 01:24:24,956
What do you think you're doing?
Get to my office right now.

1447
01:24:25,124 --> 01:24:28,751
I can't, because I have a date with the
guy I like and the rest of the school.

1448
01:24:28,919 --> 01:24:32,130
I think before you expel me,
you might wanna talk to Mrs. Griffith...

1449
01:24:32,297 --> 01:24:35,007
...because I think she might
talk you into letting me stay.

1450
01:24:35,175 --> 01:24:37,677
Go, Woodchucks!

1451
01:24:47,646 --> 01:24:50,148
And here you all are...

1452
01:24:50,315 --> 01:24:53,192
...waiting outside the bedroom door
for me to kiss Todd...

1453
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,903
...listening to me pretend
to have sex with Brandon...

1454
01:24:56,071 --> 01:24:58,281
...paying me to lie for you...

1455
01:24:58,448 --> 01:25:00,491
...and calling me
every name in the book.

1456
01:25:00,701 --> 01:25:03,452
You know, it was just like Hester
in The Scarlet Letter.

1457
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:06,122
Except that's the one thing
the movies don't tell you:

1458
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:11,502
How shitty it feels to be an outcast.
Warranted or not.

1459
01:25:20,846 --> 01:25:22,763
How did you know I love this song?

1460
01:25:22,931 --> 01:25:24,223
I guessed.

1461
01:25:24,391 --> 01:25:27,810
I see you've been watching my live
webcast. It's still going on, you know.

1462
01:25:27,978 --> 01:25:31,355
Screw them. They've had
enough of you. Figuratively speaking.

1463
01:25:31,523 --> 01:25:34,525
I borrowed my neighbor's mower.
I came right over.

1464
01:25:34,693 --> 01:25:35,735
That almost rhymed.

1465
01:25:35,903 --> 01:25:38,446
I know. I spent a minute on it.

1466
01:25:38,614 --> 01:25:40,615
I'll be right down.

1467
01:25:42,284 --> 01:25:44,076
That's Todd.

1468
01:25:44,244 --> 01:25:49,207
Not that I owe you guys any more
confessions, but I really like this guy...

1469
01:25:49,374 --> 01:25:53,628
...and I might even lose my virginity
to him.

1470
01:25:54,296 --> 01:25:56,214
I don't know when it'll happen.

1471
01:25:56,381 --> 01:25:59,425
You know, it might be five minutes
from now or tonight...

1472
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:03,512
...or six months from now
or maybe on our wedding night.

1473
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:08,559
But the really amazing thing is,
it is nobody's goddamn business.

1474
01:26:10,938 --> 01:26:12,313
Come on, where's she going?

1475
01:26:12,481 --> 01:26:14,690
I thought she was going
to take her clothes off.

1476
01:26:14,858 --> 01:26:17,401
Demi Moore took her clothes off.
This is bullshit.

1477
01:26:17,569 --> 01:26:21,030
Come on. Are you kidding me?

1478
01:26:22,991 --> 01:26:25,743
- Piss off.
- Come here, you punk.

1479
01:26:28,789 --> 01:26:30,289
Jack?

1480
01:26:58,068 --> 01:27:00,486
That's a mighty snug little shelter,
