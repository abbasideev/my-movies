[glass clinking]

18
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:36,216
Reporter: [speaking English

[suspenseful music concludes]

47
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,255
Father Fox:
Forgive me, My Lord. I can't.

48
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:55,649
Russian Bishop:
You would refuse the call?

49
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,566
This nun, Sister Yulia,
has asked for you by name.

50
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,437
Father Fox:
I have given you plenty notice.

51
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:03,918
Stayed on months longer than
I should have, at your request,

52
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:05,528
performed exorcisms
I don't believe in...

53
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:07,835
Well, this isn't an exorcism.

54
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:10,751
This is verification
of a divine event

55
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,101
- and some translating.
- Father Fox: Bishop, I'm sorry.

56
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:14,798
[in Russian]

57
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:18,410
Father Fox: [in English]
My Lord, I saved that girl

58
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:19,890
from her family, not the devil.

59
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:21,457
I was fighting mental illness.

60
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:26,549
You healed her
when nobody else could.

61
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:28,725
Do you deny that?

62
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:30,814
I did what all priests
are supposed to do.

63
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:32,686
I gave her my love
and attention.

64
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,905
I made her realize
that her life had value,

65
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:36,516
that she was a child of God.

66
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:38,735
That is when
her illness stopped.

67
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,129
Russian Bishop: Mm. Perhaps,

68
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:43,261
but Sister Yulia's case
seems to be different.

69
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:46,264
Local priests have confirmed
its authenticity.

70
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:49,267
It's time for me to move on.

71
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,966
To be a good Christian
rather than a bad priest.

72
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,229
Russian Bishop: You really
shouldn't feel so guilty

73
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:55,665
for what you have done.

74
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:58,233
Priestly celibacy
is rooted in tradition.

75
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:01,018
Not Catholic dogma.

76
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,281
If it were just an affair
and I planned to end things,

77
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:06,546
it would be different. But...
[chuckles] ...I love this woman.

78
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:10,941
And the child she's carrying
deserves a real father.

79
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,161
Mm.

80
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,427
Speaking of love,

81
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:24,172
this nun, Sister Yulia,
is pregnant with twins.

82
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,217
She claims it's immaculate.

83
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:29,307
She says her two unborn kids
talk to her,

84
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,745
and that she knows
that one of them is good

85
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,660
and one is evil.

86
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:38,665
Take a read, would you, for me?

87
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:42,146
Father Fox: [sighs]

88
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:46,586
Cardinal Russo will personally
oversee the verification.

89
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:48,805
He's an expert
in ancient languages,

90
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:49,980
just like you.

91
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:52,592
Why's the Vatican
sending a famous scholar?

92
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:53,984
I mean, someone
like Cardinal Russo

93
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,290
could be Pope someday.

94
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:59,729
It shows you how seriously
the Vatican is taking this case.

95
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:08,085
Laura: [gasps] Look.

96
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,785
- [dog barks]
- Laura: [laughing]

97
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:15,353
- Come here, Plato. Hey.
- Laura: Hi.

98
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,272
Buddy, come here.

99
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:25,189
How did it go?

100
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:27,148
Father Fox: As well as expected.

101
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,367
How you feeling?

102
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,023
Laura: A little sick
this morning, but I'll be okay.

103
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:36,505
[church bell tolling]

104
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:46,994
Schizophrenia,
abusive childhood...

105
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:50,127
immaculate conception.

106
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,913
[exhales heavily]
This woman needs help.

107
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:55,089
You should go.

108
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:56,568
You know she's not
actually possessed.

109
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,222
Laura: I know that, but...

110
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,051
isn't this being
a good Christian,

111
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:02,749
rather than a bad priest?

112
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,448
- Making fun of me?
- [laughs] I'm not.

113
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:10,017
I'm saying that even if you
have to pretend to be a priest

114
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:12,889
to help this woman,
that's Christian. No?

115
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,762
Well, technically,
I still am a priest.

116
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,504
But... I have
a different purpose now.

117
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,420
I don't want this
to take me away from you.

118
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,337
It won't take me away from you.

119
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:30,167
[pensive music playing]

120
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,170
I have to go to Estonia
for work.

121
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,520
You'll probably be back
before I am.

122
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:41,831
And when I get back,
we should talk about Canada.

123
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:46,662
I think Edmonton would be
a great place to raise a family.

124
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,883
But tell the bishop
it's the last one,

125
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:51,406
and that you mean it.

126
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:56,541
[music builds, fades]

127
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:04,027
[somber music playing]

128
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:16,692
[crows cawing]

129
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,950
[somber music continues]

130
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:22,976
[in Russian]

131
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:35,858
[door opens]

132
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:44,736
Sister Sniger: [in English]
His Eminence, Cardinal Russo.

133
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,611
Your Eminence.
It's such an honor.

134
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:52,266
[in Russian]

135
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,138
[in English]
I have read all of your work.

136
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:58,185
I can't tell you
how flattered I was

137
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,839
to be referenced so often

138
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:03,059
in your doctoral thesis
on the cuneiform alphabet.

139
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:04,800
You read my thesis?

140
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:07,324
It seems no matter
how old one gets,

141
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,196
there's always
something to learn

142
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,545
from the next generation.

143
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:14,766
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like to show you something.

144
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:40,531
Cardinal Russo:
What is it, Father?

145
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:44,100
You have doubts?

146
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,887
Father Fox:
I'm sorry, Your Eminence.

147
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:50,193
The colder it gets outside,
the more hot water we use,

148
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,891
and when hot water
passes through cold air,

149
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:53,980
you get condensation.

150
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,248
Have there been any developments
outside the initial report?

151
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:03,554
Sister Yulia refuses
to talk with anyone...

152
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:05,774
except you.

153
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,863
Father Saul: Do you have any
idea why that might be?

154
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:16,002
Ah. Father Fox, please allow me
to introduce Father Saul.

155
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:25,141
I, uh, suppose
what happened in Murmansk, or...

156
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:27,622
perhaps because there are
so few Catholics in Russia.

157
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:31,931
I see.

158
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,195
Sister Sniger: [in Russian]

159
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:55,519
[door creaks open]

160
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:08,271
[in Russian]

161
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,621
Sister Yulia: [in English]
Good afternoon, Father.

162
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:14,408
[in Russian]

163
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:19,065
[in English] You speak English.

164
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:22,677
Sister Yulia: Yes.

165
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:25,245
They didn't tell me that.

166
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:27,856
Where did you learn English?

167
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:30,815
[exhales heavily] I didn't.

168
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,298
Uh. The only reason
I'm able to speak English

169
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:37,257
is so that I can speak with you.

170
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,002
Why don't you tell me
why you became a nun?

171
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,270
For purpose. At first.

172
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,534
Then as time goes by,

173
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:57,233
you realize that you have
come here to die.

174
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:02,064
But in my case, God said, "No."

175
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,806
And that is why
he's given me children,

176
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,590
because he wants me to live.

177
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:12,683
You don't think that
these children are from God.

178
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:15,556
I think all children
are from God.

179
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:20,909
Well, I suppose
that you are right.

180
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:27,611
Why did you ask to speak to me?

181
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,918
Sister Yulia: Uh...

182
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,226
They... they tell me things.

183
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,055
Things I would have
no other way of knowing.

184
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,362
And they told me about you.

185
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,452
What did they tell you about me?

186
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,281
They told me you are
the only one

187
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:48,545
that can keep the bad thing
from happening.

188
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,375
You think something bad
is gonna happen to you?

189
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:55,074
Sister Yulia: I didn't bring you
here today, Father.

190
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:57,380
The Church didn't bring
you here.

191
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,165
God brought you here.

192
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,559
They are trying
to stop His plan.

193
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:03,734
[door creaks open]

194
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:05,997
They think they know better.

195
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:09,000
Um. We're not finish--

196
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:10,654
Old Nun: [in Russian]

197
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,352
[in English] We need your help.

198
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:13,570
Father Fox:
Hey, Sister. We're not...

199
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,272
[door creaks open]

200
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:28,455
[reporter speaking on TV]

201
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:31,458
Father Fox: [in Russian]

202
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,721
[reporter speaking on TV
continues]

203
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:58,963
Father Fox: [in English]
You wanted to see me,

204
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,400
- Your Eminence?
- Ah.

205
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,576
Father Fox. Please come in.

206
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:05,100
- Uh, help yourself to a drink.
- Father Fox: I shouldn't.

207
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:08,321
As you wish.
Do you recognize this language?

208
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,933
It's cuneiform, obviously,
but it's not Sumerian.

209
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:13,369
It's not Akkadian.

210
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:15,197
It's a syllabary
I've never seen before.

211
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,504
I believe this to be
a secretive language

212
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:20,246
used by an elite class
of Zoroastrian priests.

213
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,074
Kind of like the lost language
of the druids.

214
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,946
And this is the original text,

215
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,208
transferred from
person to person

216
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:27,905
for thousands of years.

217
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:29,951
Father Fox: What, uh, kind of
material is this written on?

218
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,474
Cardinal Russo:
There are others. Look.

219
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:33,389
All of these
are telling the same story.

220
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:36,479
Hebrew, Coptic, Arabic,
Avestan, and Akkadian.

221
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,353
"A virgin will give birth
to twin boys,

222
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,225
one good, one evil."

223
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,185
"Before the Messiah
can learn to love,

224
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,622
the Antichrist will try
and kill his brother."

225
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:50,667
"He will use the holy man... "

226
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:53,148
Both: "...the soldier,
and the father."

227
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:58,458
I don't think this word
is supposed to mean "virgin."

228
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:00,460
I think it implies
that the Messiah

229
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:03,071
will be born a virgin birth,
but that the devil

230
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,029
will have to enter her
through free will.

231
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:09,251
She'll have to choose
to have sex with a man.

232
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:10,948
Of course.

233
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,430
Why didn't I think of that?

234
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:19,696
[unsettling music playing]

235
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,849
[unsettling music fades]

236
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,899
You think this prophecy
might be real.

237
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:50,292
It's quite possible.

238
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:51,815
Sister Yulia
is carrying twin boys.

239
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:54,992
This is Zoroastrian scripture,

240
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,472
more than a thousand years
before Christ.

241
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:58,518
The others and I believe
that this prophecy

242
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,868
is as divinely inspired
as the Book of Revelation.

243
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,132
It's not Christian.

244
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:07,831
I was told you were
a bit of a doubting Thomas.

245
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:13,054
Your Eminence, from what
I've seen here today...

246
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,058
not to mention Sister Yulia's
history of mental illness,

247
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:19,713
if it were up to me, she would
already be in a hospital.

248
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:25,109
She saw things as a child.
Visions she didn't understand.

249
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:28,504
Her parents, doctors,
everyone thought

250
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:31,246
she was hallucinating
so they medicated her,

251
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:36,120
when, in fact, I believe
she saw visions from God.

252
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:43,867
[breathing shakily]

253
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:53,312
- [clock ticking]
- [door opens]

254
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,495
[breathing heavily]

255
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:05,019
[muffled scream echoes]

256
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,196
Did you hear that?

257
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,111
[muffled crying]

258
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:22,645
Thank you, Father Fox.
You've been most helpful.

259
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:24,647
You're dismissed.

260
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:31,045
Father Fox: Your Eminence.

261
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:40,054
[foreboding music plays]

262
00:22:42,273 --> 00:22:45,668
- [music fades]
- [water dripping]

[rats scampering, squeaking]

264
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:13,566
[door creaks]

265
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:16,873
[sharp, dramatic sting]

266
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:34,717
[distant thud]

267
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:47,556
[loud thud]

268
00:23:54,258 --> 00:23:57,000
[suspenseful music playing]

269
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:01,352
[loud thud]

270
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:10,231
[suspenseful music continues]

271
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:26,682
[clock ticking quickly]

272
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:39,347
- [wind whooshing]
- [music intensifies, fades]

273
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,315
[sinister music playing]

274
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:54,754
[whispers] Sister.

275
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,630
[yelling] Sister Yulia!

276
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:09,029
Sister, stop!

277
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:10,857
[music intensifies]

278
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:12,989
Father Fox: Stop!

279
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:17,777
Sister!

280
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:24,087
[sinister music continues]

281
00:25:34,228 --> 00:25:35,359
[gasps]

282
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:45,544
[panting]

[gasps sharply]

285
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,057

- [sudden dramatic sting]
- [gasps]

287
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:32,068
[breathing heavily]

288
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,712
Cardinal Russo:
[whispering] Most of humanity

289
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:08,191
will be damned to hell.

290
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:11,455
Father Saul: It will keep her
sedated while we induce labor.

291
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,067
Cardinal Russo: Labor? I thought
this was an abortion.

292
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:15,851
Father Saul: It is.

293
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:19,376
But this late in the pregnancy,
this is how it has to be done.

294
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:21,117
Cardinal Russo:
But what if you're wrong?

295
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,817
Our duty is to the Church.
To the teachings of Christ.

296
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:28,168
We cannot kill the Christ child.

297
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:29,517
We have to.

298
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:31,562
If they are born,

299
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,564
they'll bring about
the end of days.

300
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,790
The choice is our burden,
our sacrifice.

301
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:47,753
That is vox Dei's mission
on Earth, Your Eminence.

302
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,408
Cardinal Russo: God help us.

303
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:54,760
[footsteps approaching]

304
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:15,606
Killing children?

305
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:17,913
That's what you've been
sent here to do?

306
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:20,307
The time will come when
the Antichrist and the Messiah

307
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:23,092
will be born together.
But not now.

308
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:25,704
What are you talking abou...

309
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:27,357
You actually believe
this nonsense?

310
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,708
She could not possibly
have known what she knows.

311
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:31,666
- Those things.
- What things?

312
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:35,322
Cardinal Russo: Visions she saw
when she was a child.

313
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:37,063
- The prophecy says...
- Your Eminence,

314
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:38,673
you are a Cardinal of
the Church of Saint Peter.

315
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:40,719
If you do this, you will
damn yourself to hell.

316
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:42,851
I'm sorry, but vox Dei...

317
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:45,593
Vox Dei? God... God's Voice?
What does that mean?

318
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,204
We are charged
with protecting humanity.

319
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:49,684
[Sister Yulia groans softly]

320
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:54,341
Cardinal Russo:
The Antichrist will return...

321
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,737
when mankind is furthest
from God.

322
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,264
Your Eminence,
she's just a girl.

323
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:10,749
She wants these children.

324
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:28,767
[groans softly]

325
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:35,295
[whispers] What have I done?

326
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:40,213
Cardinal, where did they go?

327
00:29:57,665 --> 00:30:00,711

We have to go, now!

Buckle up before...

338
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:05,080
No, no, no, no!

339
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,449

I need your help.

Can you do me...

[train honking]

353
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:02,284
Cardinal Russo:
There we go. That's it.

354
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:04,895
Gentle. That's it.

355
00:33:06,332 --> 00:33:09,117
You don't look so good.
Is there anything I can do?

Cardinal Russo: I'm sorry.

362
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:25,003
We must have bought
the wrong ones.

375
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:16,097
She needs to breathe in and out.

It was a miracle.

Scientists have observed

437
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:15,674
extreme shifts
in global ocean tides,

438
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:17,719
likely brought on
by abnormal activity

439
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:20,026
in the Earth's core
and rotation speed.

440
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,855
These oceanic shifts
have nudged the moon off

441
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:24,465
its expected orbit.

442
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:26,989
Such a phenomenon
has been suggested in theory

443
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:28,861
but never observed in nature.

in his later years.

- Yes.

to renewables as fast as we can.

you might need.

He wasn't always this eccentric.

456
00:42:05,131 --> 00:42:07,176
He started prepping
for the end of the world.

457

This is fascinating.

461

Is this supposed to be
you and your grandfather?

visions of the end times.

Uh. The other thing.

465
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:35,378
Because my grandfather
died suddenly,

466
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,120
there are almost certainly
live traps still out there.

467

But as long as you don't go
off any trail north,

you will be fine.

put them down.

Laura: As long as they need.

495
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,601
This place is on company land
and I have no use for it.

496
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:36,342
Thank you for doing this.

we will be very happy here.

and forget the beauty
of this world

it takes to live in it.

536
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:16,143
Oh, the old man, he left a map.

537
00:50:16,317 --> 00:50:18,885
Shows where the traps are.
He left markings on the trees.

538
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:20,452
There are nets and springs.

539
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,193
The springs are
the dangerous ones.

540
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:26,458
[exhales] I feel so free.
Don't you?

541
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:30,201
I haven't felt this good
in 20 years. [chuckles]

542
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:33,682
Come. Help me find
the rest of these traps.

543
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:35,554
We're going to need to

544
00:50:36,163 --> 00:50:37,338
if we're going to have children
running around here someday.

545
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,905
[laughs]

546
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:42,126
[ominous clock ticking]

547
00:50:53,398 --> 00:50:54,486
Man: [in Russian]

548
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,053
[in Estonian]

549
00:50:58,142 --> 00:50:59,360
[in English]
I'm looking for Laura.

550
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:01,493
[in Estonian]

551
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:11,285
[in Estonian]

552
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:21,426
[intense music playing]

553
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:43,100
Sister Yulia: [in English]
How's your wound?

554
00:51:43,274 --> 00:51:44,753
Father Fox: Oh, it's fine.

555
00:51:45,014 --> 00:51:47,234
We have to make sure
that the wound isn't infected.

556
00:51:47,495 --> 00:51:48,583
Come on. Sit.

557
00:51:55,808 --> 00:51:56,765
Okay.

558
00:51:58,071 --> 00:51:59,768
This might hurt a little.

559
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:09,561
[gentle music playing]

560
00:52:11,911 --> 00:52:13,521
Sister Yulia: It's impossible.

561
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:16,611
It's completely healed.

562
00:52:29,972 --> 00:52:31,104
[breath hitches]

563
00:52:32,323 --> 00:52:33,715
Baby: [wailing]

564
00:52:35,456 --> 00:52:36,718
Sister Yulia:
They're doing this to us.

565
00:52:36,892 --> 00:52:38,198
Father Fox: [sighing]

566
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:39,504
Sister Yulia:
They want us to be together.

567
00:52:39,678 --> 00:52:41,158
[door opening]

568
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:43,943
[door closing]

569
00:52:48,991 --> 00:52:50,297
Something smells good.

570
00:52:54,301 --> 00:52:58,262
- [door opening, closing]
- [animal howling]

571
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:02,309
Cardinal Russo:
Makes perfect sense.

572
00:53:02,483 --> 00:53:06,008
Born in Russia.
Given your location by God.

573
00:53:06,357 --> 00:53:08,315
And look. Here.

574
00:53:10,012 --> 00:53:13,102
See? This is where
you gave birth on the train.

575
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:14,495
The hallowed elephant.

576
00:53:16,018 --> 00:53:18,325
I believe
this is where we are now.

577
00:53:18,847 --> 00:53:20,458
You will die as a priest...

578
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,507
but be reborn...
as a father of twins.

579
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:31,991
But this is just one of many.

580
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:35,690
This is not the prophecy,
but it's a possibility.

581
00:53:35,864 --> 00:53:38,389
It's not set in stone.
It depends what we decide.

582
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:42,262
You, Father Fox,
you, Sister Yulia...

583
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:44,656
what you decide.

584
00:53:45,787 --> 00:53:48,225
Babies: [crying]

585
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:51,532
Cardinal Russo:
They're fighting. Even now.

586
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:53,969
Neither one is good or bad,

587
00:53:54,143 --> 00:53:57,146
but one is a conduit
for the light.

588
00:53:57,495 --> 00:53:59,453
The other,
a conduit for the Beast.

589
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,762
- [gasps]
- [high-pitched ringing]

590
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:07,287
Baby: [wails]

591
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:17,341
[stairs creaking]

592
00:54:23,434 --> 00:54:25,610
[electricity crackles]

593
00:54:57,772 --> 00:54:58,817
[exhales]

594
00:55:04,736 --> 00:55:07,695
[indistinct whispering]

595
00:55:12,874 --> 00:55:14,528
[faint rustling]

596
00:55:18,837 --> 00:55:20,447
[electricity crackles]

597
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,320
[exhales]

598
00:55:32,677 --> 00:55:37,986
Katya: [singing
in foreign language]

599
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:01,749
- [suspenseful music playing]
- Katya: [continues singing]

600
00:56:25,817 --> 00:56:28,820
[continues singing, stops]

601
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:38,395
[animal howling]

602
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:40,135
[suspenseful music fades]

603
00:56:41,572 --> 00:56:44,183
[bell chiming]

604
00:56:44,357 --> 00:56:45,967
Father Fox: [preaching]
At the time he was betrayed

605
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:48,317
and entered willingly
into his passion.

606
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:50,972
He took the bread
and giving thanks,

607
00:56:51,146 --> 00:56:54,715
broke it, and gave it
to his disciples, saying,

608
00:56:54,889 --> 00:56:57,501
"Take this,
all of you in need of it,

609
00:56:57,675 --> 00:57:00,939
for this is my body
which will be given up for you."

610
00:57:05,117 --> 00:57:07,989
In a similar way,
when supper was ended,

611
00:57:08,163 --> 00:57:10,775
he took the chalice, and,
once more giving thanks,

612
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:12,951
he gave it
to his disciples, saying...

613
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,390
"Take this, all of you,
and drink from it."

614
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:20,524
"For this is the chalice
of my blood,

615
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:23,962
the blood of the new
and eternal covenant,

616
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:26,094
which will be poured out
for you and for many

617
00:57:26,268 --> 00:57:28,053
for the forgiveness of sins."

618
00:57:28,227 --> 00:57:29,924
"Do this in memory of me."

619
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:38,977
[solemn music playing]

620
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,329
[gasps softly]

621
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:10,791
[solemn music intensifies]

622
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:18,016
[moans]

623
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,760
[both breathe heavily]

624
00:58:23,978 --> 00:58:25,023
[gasps]

625
00:58:27,068 --> 00:58:28,026
[gasps]

626
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:37,035
[music swells, fades]

627
00:58:37,818 --> 00:58:40,604
[birds chirping]

628
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:49,395
Baby: [coos]

629
00:58:57,838 --> 00:58:58,926
Dreams.

630
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:02,060
It's how
they communicate with us.

631
00:59:05,933 --> 00:59:10,242
Like the men on the train...
we share the same dream.

632
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:12,810
- [pensive music playing]
- Baby: [coos]

633
00:59:12,984 --> 00:59:14,725
I think we were chosen.

634
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:20,644
Like Mary and Joseph.

635
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:24,082
Baby: [coos]

636
00:59:31,393 --> 00:59:33,831
I think
we are meant to be a family.

637
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:46,495
- [knocking]
- [pensive music concludes]

638
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:47,801
[sighs]

639
00:59:53,502 --> 00:59:55,722
- Oh, my God. What's happened?
- Laura: It's not mine.

640
00:59:55,896 --> 00:59:58,638
Some asshole at the factory
threw blood on me.

641
00:59:58,812 --> 01:00:00,292
[tense music playing]

642
01:00:03,164 --> 01:00:05,514
[hesitates] Are you...
are you sure you're okay?

643
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:06,951
Babe, I'm fine!

644
01:00:08,082 --> 01:00:09,214
[whispers] I'm fine.

645
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,914
I booked a flight for Canada...

646
01:00:15,176 --> 01:00:17,657
in the morning.
I know it's sudden, but...

647
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:20,878
sooner is better for all of us.

648
01:00:27,232 --> 01:00:29,277
- [tense music concludes]
- [flames crackling]

649
01:00:29,756 --> 01:00:31,932
[slurps, exhales]

650
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:36,633
At first, they thought it was
some kind of virus or bacteria,

651
01:00:36,894 --> 01:00:38,330
but now, they're saying
there must be something

652
01:00:38,504 --> 01:00:40,288
in the air or water,
and, of course,

653
01:00:40,462 --> 01:00:43,640
they're blaming me,
saying that I'm responsible.

654
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:46,120
Is there something wrong
with the water?

655
01:00:46,294 --> 01:00:49,341
No. Multiple tests
have all come back negative.

656
01:00:49,515 --> 01:00:51,082
I don't know what it is.

657
01:00:52,387 --> 01:00:53,867
But it's getting scary
out there.

658
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:55,608
I've never seen people
act like this.

659
01:00:58,698 --> 01:01:01,658
Sister, hi!
How are you and the babies?

660
01:01:02,441 --> 01:01:04,182
[in Russian]

661
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:08,577
[suspenseful music playing]

662
01:01:11,102 --> 01:01:12,233
[in English] Wow, he...

663
01:01:12,843 --> 01:01:14,845
These are all
my grandfather's paintings.

664
01:01:15,019 --> 01:01:16,411
Father Fox: Yes, the Cardinal.

665
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,370
There's more in the attic
if he's interested.

666
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:21,025
Um... [speaks in Russian]

667
01:01:22,853 --> 01:01:24,985
[in English]
Um, I will let him know.

668
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:26,508
Where is the Cardinal?

669
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:29,163
Must be hunting.

670
01:01:29,642 --> 01:01:31,862
[suspenseful music continues]

671
01:01:46,398 --> 01:01:49,009
- [suspenseful music fades]
- Baby: [coos]

672
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:52,970
[sighs]

673
01:01:56,669 --> 01:01:58,105
- Baby: [coos]
- Sister Yulia: This is Jacob.

674
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:00,934
Laura: Hi.

675
01:02:01,108 --> 01:02:02,544
Sister Yulia:
And this is Samuel.

676
01:02:02,849 --> 01:02:04,590
Here. You take him.

677
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,246
[hums]

678
01:02:10,683 --> 01:02:11,902
[coos]

679
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:16,602
[suspenseful music playing]

680
01:02:25,306 --> 01:02:26,264
Laura?

681
01:02:34,185 --> 01:02:35,055
Laura?

682
01:02:36,491 --> 01:02:37,405
Laura?

683
01:02:40,017 --> 01:02:42,889
[grunts softly]
They're beautiful.

684
01:02:47,024 --> 01:02:48,286
They're beautiful.

685
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:51,332
[soft music playing]

686
01:03:02,517 --> 01:03:04,302
Reporter: [on radio]
...as a mysterious outbreak

687
01:03:04,476 --> 01:03:07,609
continues to ravage Estonia,
leaving experts baffled.

688
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,568
From nausea to psychosis,

689
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:11,396
whatever's scanning
to the Baltics

690
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:13,093
is like nothing we've seen
in all of history.

691
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:16,009
Some are calling it
a freak plague, others,

692
01:03:16,183 --> 01:03:17,750
the end of the world.

693
01:03:17,968 --> 01:03:19,578
Many believe
the outbreak originated

694
01:03:19,752 --> 01:03:21,885
in the mining region of Kose.

695
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:23,974
Some theorize a
past conspiracy,

696
01:03:24,148 --> 01:03:27,020
involving the Kuusik family
going back decades...

697
01:03:27,194 --> 01:03:28,195
[continues indistinctly]

698
01:03:28,369 --> 01:03:29,762
[in Russian]

699
01:04:03,317 --> 01:04:04,884
[suspenseful music playing]

700
01:04:27,907 --> 01:04:31,911
[in English] Strange.
Katya was supposed to come.

701
01:05:01,158 --> 01:05:03,290
[suspenseful music intensifies]

702
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,411
Laura: Daniel,
I have some clothes here

703
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:39,196
I think Sister Yulia could use.

704
01:05:39,848 --> 01:05:41,459
Father Fox: Very sweet of you.

705
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:24,632
[suspenseful music continues]

706
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,934
[cell phone ringing]

707
01:07:07,936 --> 01:07:08,850
Yeah.

708
01:07:10,678 --> 01:07:11,592
[in Russian]

709
01:07:14,726 --> 01:07:17,120
[in English] Uh... okay.

710
01:07:19,296 --> 01:07:20,732
[in Russian]

711
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:22,299
Daniel!

712
01:07:24,301 --> 01:07:25,432
Daniel?

893
01:27:49,568 --> 01:27:50,830
What have I helped you do?

894
01:27:54,181 --> 01:27:56,923
[intense music playing]

895
01:28:01,885 --> 01:28:04,757
- [high-pitched ringing]
- Father Fox: [groans]

896
01:28:06,411 --> 01:28:08,674
[grunts, groans]

897
01:28:10,241 --> 01:28:11,764
[gasps]

898
01:28:18,945 --> 01:28:20,338
[high-pitched ringing continues]

899
01:28:20,512 --> 01:28:21,992
- Father Fox: [groans]
- Laura: [chuckling]

900
01:28:32,045 --> 01:28:34,787
[groans, screams]

901
01:28:38,835 --> 01:28:40,315
Laura: Imagine
what your life would be like

902
01:28:40,489 --> 01:28:42,360
- if it weren't for them.
- [gasps]

903
01:28:47,017 --> 01:28:48,888
How much better it would be.

904
01:28:52,805 --> 01:28:54,894
They took me away from you.

905
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:01,248
You're raising good for God...

906
01:29:02,641 --> 01:29:04,339
but bad for men.

907
01:29:05,905 --> 01:29:07,124
Whose side are you on?

908
01:29:09,082 --> 01:29:11,389
This battle
has not been decided.

909
01:29:14,436 --> 01:29:17,917
You can save humanity
all by yourself.

910
01:29:20,659 --> 01:29:22,922
You only have to kill
the bad one.

911
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:28,145
It's not too late for us,
my love.

912
01:29:30,408 --> 01:29:32,018
[deep voice] Kill the child.

913
01:29:34,064 --> 01:29:35,631
[normal voice]
Then, kill yourself.

914
01:29:39,069 --> 01:29:41,767
Kill the child.

915
01:29:42,899 --> 01:29:45,336
Kill the child.

916
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:49,471
Kill the child.

917
01:29:49,906 --> 01:29:50,820
Kill...

918
01:29:50,994 --> 01:29:52,865
...yourself.

919
01:29:53,518 --> 01:29:59,045
Kill the child. Kill yourself.

920
01:29:59,219 --> 01:30:01,396
- [gasps sharply]
- [intense music concludes]

921
01:30:01,918 --> 01:30:04,094
[breathes heavily]

922
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,588
[gasps sharply]

923
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:21,981
Run.

924
01:30:22,373 --> 01:30:23,505
- [banging on door]
- [dramatic music playing]

925
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:25,158
- [banging on door]
- [gasps]

926
01:30:25,942 --> 01:30:27,509
Father Fox:
Why did you lock this door?

927
01:30:27,683 --> 01:30:29,989
- [grunting]
- Sister Yulia: [screaming]

928
01:30:30,468 --> 01:30:32,209
Father Fox:
It hurts my feelings.

929
01:30:32,383 --> 01:30:36,822
[grunting]

930
01:30:36,996 --> 01:30:38,911
Hail Mary, full of grace.

931
01:30:39,651 --> 01:30:40,783
The Lord is with thee!

932
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:45,135
[grunts] Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

933
01:30:45,309 --> 01:30:46,484
[grunts]

934
01:30:47,137 --> 01:30:50,357
[grunting]

935
01:30:57,974 --> 01:30:59,410
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

936
01:31:02,282 --> 01:31:03,762
Fear no more!

937
01:31:06,635 --> 01:31:07,766
[pants]

938
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:21,867
[dramatic music concludes]

939
01:31:24,174 --> 01:31:25,828
[birds chirping]

940
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:31,964
[in Estonian]

941
01:31:42,888 --> 01:31:45,630
Sister Yulia: [in English]
Help! [pants]

942
01:31:46,457 --> 01:31:48,677
- Officer: [speaking Estonian]
- [in English] Help!

943
01:31:49,721 --> 01:31:53,551
- [intense music playing]
- Father Fox: [panting]

944
01:31:55,727 --> 01:31:58,034
Help! He's trying to kill us.

945
01:31:58,817 --> 01:32:00,950
He's trying to kill my children!

946
01:32:01,167 --> 01:32:02,778
- Then he wants to kill me!
- [wails]

947
01:32:02,952 --> 01:32:05,041
- What did you say?
- [high-pitched ringing]

948
01:32:05,215 --> 01:32:06,390
Huh?

949
01:32:06,564 --> 01:32:09,349
[high-pitched ringing continues]

950
01:32:11,874 --> 01:32:13,658
[cries]

951
01:32:13,832 --> 01:32:15,486
Father Fox: Hey, guys,
don't listen to her.

952
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:17,053
- She's just a crazy bitch!
- What's that in your hands?

953
01:32:17,227 --> 01:32:19,882
- [shouts]
- [gasping]

954
01:32:22,841 --> 01:32:24,974
Fuck! Ah!

955
01:32:25,757 --> 01:32:27,498
- [grunts]
- [screams]

956
01:32:30,762 --> 01:32:33,156
[breathes heavily, grunts]

957
01:32:45,124 --> 01:32:47,039
[grunts]

958
01:32:47,605 --> 01:32:50,260
[screams]

959
01:33:21,204 --> 01:33:22,553
[pants]

960
01:33:32,345 --> 01:33:34,260
Father Fox:
This is for your own good!

961
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:36,959
We are God's vessel on Earth!

962
01:33:37,350 --> 01:33:40,919
I'll only kill the bad one.
I know which one is which now.

963
01:33:41,093 --> 01:33:43,705
Hey, hey. I'll show you.

964
01:33:44,270 --> 01:33:47,012
Sister Yulia: We are meant
to protect the Messiah

965
01:33:47,186 --> 01:33:48,579
from his brother!

966
01:33:48,753 --> 01:33:50,102
Father Fox: The world
doesn't have to end!

967
01:33:50,276 --> 01:33:51,582
Don't condemn half of humanity,

968
01:33:51,756 --> 01:33:53,715
because you can't
sacrifice one child.

969
01:33:53,932 --> 01:33:56,326
Think of Abraham and what
he was willing to do to Isaac.

970
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:59,895
Samuel, he is using you!
Remember those dreams.

971
01:34:00,069 --> 01:34:02,549
- They were a warning.
- That child is the devil!

972
01:34:02,724 --> 01:34:05,335
- [wails]
- If the world ends now,

973
01:34:05,509 --> 01:34:07,337
most of humanity
will be damned to hell.

974
01:34:07,511 --> 01:34:09,818
You cannot save the world alone.

975
01:34:10,383 --> 01:34:13,648
It will take all of us,
all of us together to do that.

976
01:34:13,822 --> 01:34:18,957
- I alone have to.
- Fox... this isn't you.

977
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:21,743
[sobs]
You must be somewhere in there.

978
01:34:21,917 --> 01:34:23,309
- Please.
- [thunder rumbling]

979
01:34:23,483 --> 01:34:25,355
- Give me the child.
- Please.

980
01:34:26,922 --> 01:34:28,140
Give me the child.

981
01:34:29,098 --> 01:34:31,274
- Please.
- Give me the fucking child!

982
01:34:31,448 --> 01:34:33,363
God made the world like this
for a reason.

983
01:34:33,537 --> 01:34:36,409
The good and the bad.
And we must save both!

984
01:34:37,106 --> 01:34:40,500
- He didn't save Laura.
- [thunder roaring]

985
01:34:40,892 --> 01:34:43,808
- [sobs]
- What about my child?

986
01:34:44,809 --> 01:34:46,855
- He didn't save him.
- [exclaims]

987
01:34:50,467 --> 01:34:51,555
Sister Yulia: [yells]

988
01:34:58,431 --> 01:34:59,737
Fox, stop!

989
01:35:09,181 --> 01:35:10,705
I think we were chosen.

990
01:35:14,012 --> 01:35:15,448
Like Mary and Joseph.

991
01:35:19,888 --> 01:35:21,890
I think we are
meant to be a family.

992
01:35:23,935 --> 01:35:26,938
[thunder roaring]

993
01:35:27,112 --> 01:35:29,245
Sister Yulia: Fox! No!

994
01:35:36,339 --> 01:35:37,383
Fox!

995
01:35:51,397 --> 01:35:54,661
[pants, cries]

996
01:36:18,424 --> 01:36:21,123
[solemn music playing]

997
01:36:25,518 --> 01:36:27,042
[breathes shakily]

998
01:36:27,738 --> 01:36:34,397
[praying in Russian]

999
01:36:40,577 --> 01:36:42,231
[sobbing]

1000
01:36:48,585 --> 01:36:54,417
[praying in Russian, sobs]

1001
01:37:06,124 --> 01:37:07,952
[praying in Russian]

1002
01:37:09,127 --> 01:37:12,478
[sobbing,
continues praying in Russian]

1003
01:37:20,443 --> 01:37:21,792
Amen.

1004
01:37:24,447 --> 01:37:26,057
[sobs]

1005
01:37:29,495 --> 01:37:32,194
[uplifting music playing]

1006
01:37:51,648 --> 01:37:54,651
Sister Yulia:
God has chosen to become man.

1007
01:37:58,655 --> 01:38:03,965
To suffer the same desires
and temptations as all men do.

1008
01:38:07,098 --> 01:38:10,885
He too will learn
how to love true suffering.

1009
01:38:14,758 --> 01:38:16,847
It is up to us to guide him...

1010
01:38:20,111 --> 01:38:22,548
and to make sure
that he is prepared

1011
01:38:22,722 --> 01:38:24,289
to fight his brother.

1012
01:38:53,753 --> 01:38:55,799
We are not meant
to know the why.

1013
01:38:58,758 --> 01:39:00,630
Love is the only way forward.

1014
01:39:22,391 --> 01:39:25,176
[solemn music playing]

1015
01:43:26,504 --> 01:43:28,289
[music concludes]
