1
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,969
If you've got the time
and the stomach for it,

2
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,972
I've got a story for you.

3
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:16,143
A tale of magic and witches,

4
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:19,879
of quests and of monsters.

5
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,783
Of good and of evil.

6
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,087
But make no mistake.

7
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,890
This is no fairy tale.

8
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:34,362
And there are no happy endings.

9
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:52,011
The world you know is gone,

10
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:55,515
consumed by the flames
of a great war long ago

11
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:58,785
when death rained from the sky.

12
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,222
All that's left now
are the Lost Lands,

13
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:07,194
filled with twisted creatures
that dwell in the shadows.

14
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:12,532
What remains of humanity
takes refuge in a single city.

15
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,402
Long ago, a mysterious witch,

16
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:18,037
Gray Alys, emerged
from the Lost Lands.

17
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,411
This is the story of how we met

18
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:26,113
and how she saved
the both of us.

19
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,960
Stop your work!

20
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,163
Stop your work!

21
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:49,001
Let this be an example to all.

22
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,672
No one shall defy the church.

23
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,809
They say you can buy anything

24
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,078
you might desire from Gray Alys.

25
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,481
But it's better not to.

26
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,252
And still the people
seek your help.

27
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,654
They're ignorant, uneducated.

28
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:11,658
Some are poor, some
rich. All are desperate.

29
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,626
I refuse no one.

30
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,928
Do you know what the church
says about the likes of you?

31
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,798
I'm sure you're
going to tell me.

32
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,269
That you are of the devil

33
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,971
and it's our duty
to root you out.

34
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:28,140
In the name of the Overlord,

35
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,876
ruler of the City
Under The Mountain,

36
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,478
High Priest of the Faith,

37
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,946
I sentence you, Gray Alys,

38
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,083
to death by hanging.

39
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,889
Repent, woman.

40
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,350
What is happening to me?

41
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:45,117
You cannot be trusted.

42
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,286
You're a slave to the witch.

43
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,791
Hunt her down.

44
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,515
- To me.
- Yes, ma'am.

45
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,969
Show yourself, witch.

46
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,692
Do it.

47
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,994
Do it.

48
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,499
Witch!

49
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,570
I will find you.

50
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:46,339
You will burn in hell.

51
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,312
You will burn in hell, witch!

52
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,181
The witch that will not hang.

53
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,484
The witch that will not hang.

54
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:59,519
The witch that will not hang.

55
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,921
The witch that will not hang.

56
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,190
The witch that will not hang.

57
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,758
The witch that will not hang.

58
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,027
The witch that will not hang.

59
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,196
The witch that will not hang.

60
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,264
The witch that will not hang.

61
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:48,768
If a man wanted to
ambush another man,

62
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,838
this would be the perfect spot.

63
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,418
Jump him while his eyes were
still adjusting to the dark.

64
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:11,390
Maybe even bring
three, four friends.

65
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,926
Make sure the job
got done right.

66
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,217
This thing has never worked.

67
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,368
But this never fails.

68
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:02,501
Gray Alys.

69
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,503
Did you recognize my footsteps?

70
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,740
No. Your kindness.

71
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,209
This city gets worse and worse,

72
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,079
but you have always
been so generous

73
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,115
ever since I was a child.

74
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,918
Only to you.

75
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:22,288
You never ask anything of me.

76
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,623
Strange.

77
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,895
You sound no different
to when I was young,

78
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:32,098
but you must be old now like me.

79
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,433
Older.

80
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,805
Much older.

81
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,964
- I'm Jerais.
- Captain of the Overwatch.

82
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,665
Have you come on
behalf of the Overlord?

83
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,837
Or perhaps his queen?

84
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,817
What brings you to
visit one like me?

85
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:30,122
It is said that for a
price, you grant wishes.

86
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,359
What do you wish to buy?

87
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,162
Leave us.

88
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,633
I'm not sure if that is wise.

89
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:59,551
Some say you came
from the Lost Lands

90
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,121
and that you know the
things that live there.

91
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,824
Dark, unnatural things.

92
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,793
Is this what you want from me?

93
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:08,694
To tell you fairy tales?

94
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:13,632
I want from you the power to
become a beast, Gray Alys.

95
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:17,536
To be more than human.
Does that shock you?

96
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,807
I have seen too much to
be shocked so easily.

97
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:23,944
So you can sell me the
secret of shapeshifting?

98
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,514
To a wolf?

99
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:41,760
Are you certain you
want what you ask for?

100
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,729
You might not be happy
with what you receive.

101
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,434
- This is not your concern.
- I am compelled to help.

102
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,670
- But I warn all who come to me.
- I'm not all.

103
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,875
- Mm.
- Will you accept my offer?

104
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:01,047
I refuse no one.
I'll hire a hunter.

105
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:05,184
We'll find you a shapeshifter
and take its power.

106
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:07,954
Give me until the full moon

107
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,722
and I will bring
you what you desire.

108
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,994
Where will you go?

109
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,429
To the Lost Lands.

110
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,584
What is it, Jerais?

111
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,153
Do you refuse no one?

112
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,923
No one.

113
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,300
Then accept it as my payment.
I wish to buy for myself.

114
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:58,905
This timepiece has been in
my family for generations.

115
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:00,940
It's my most
valuable possession.

116
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,909
And what do you wish for?

117
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,444
I want you to fail her.

118
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,514
The Overwatch is
sworn to loyalty,

119
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,350
yet you betray your queen.

120
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,352
I am loyal.

121
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,955
I know what's good for her
better than she knows herself.

122
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,925
This power that she
seeks will destroy her.

123
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,293
I only want to help.

124
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,362
You lie, Jerais.

125
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,497
You reek of jealousy.

126
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,367
I will not argue with you.

127
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,870
If you will not sell
to me, I will leave.

128
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,741
I refuse no one.

129
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,153
You shall have what you want.

130
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:57,623
Argh!

131
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,230
Argh!

132
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,594
I'm sorry.

133
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,263
What is it you want?

134
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:38,965
Help me.

135
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,072
Shit.

136
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,506
Did you wet yourself again?

137
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,908
Can't you use the bell,

138
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,844
you old disgusting fool?

139
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,683
The mighty Overlord.

140
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,485
Hard to believe
you built all this.

141
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:02,454
And that they still fear you.

142
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:06,925
You're nothing more
than a filthy pig,

143
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:09,261
just like all men.

144
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,997
My queen?

145
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,402
All men, except for one.

146
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,949
Don't leave yet.

147
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,318
I have to.

148
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,885
Before they see me.

149
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,888
I can't stay here.

150
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,661
Hurry back. Please.

151
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,797
I will.

152
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,267
Perhaps.

153
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,276
Halt, in the name
of the Overlord.

154
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,246
What are you doing here?

155
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,415
The stronger the spirits,

156
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,885
the weaker the senses.

157
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,757
You're coming with us.

158
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,362
Stop!

159
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:27,239
That was half full.

160
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:45,557
I hear you're a hunter, that
you travel the Lost Lands.

161
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,294
I have use of such a man.

162
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,800
Came here to play
cards, not to talk.

163
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,645
All in.

164
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,000
You ready to talk now?

165
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,872
What's your name?

166
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,674
Boyce.

167
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,542
I'm looking for a guide.

168
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,478
Someone who knows
the Lost Lands.

169
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:15,881
- I'm expensive.
- I have money.

170
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,550
I know you do.
Most of it's mine.

171
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,552
Are you worth it?

172
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,989
Would you be here talking
to me if I wasn't?

173
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,895
The Lost Lands are no
place for city folk.

174
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,029
Why is that?

175
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,464
Because they're weak.

176
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,501
Do I look weak to you?

177
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:39,037
Look.

178
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,140
Outside these walls,
the laws of the city,

179
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:46,512
of man, even of nature,
they don't apply.

180
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:49,147
So whoever you
think you are here,

181
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:53,251
out there you'd
just be a hindrance.

182
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,254
Let's make a deal.

183
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,156
If I ever slow you down,

184
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,393
you have my permission
to leave me behind.

185
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,329
And I'll do the same to you.

186
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,636
Why do you want
to leave the city?

187
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:15,273
I'm looking for a man who
can turn into a beast.

188
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,943
All men are beasts.

189
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:21,213
But not all men are monsters.

190
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,719
You're looking for
a shapeshifter.

191
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,090
Yes. I need to kill it in
its lair to take its power.

192
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,226
I've heard of such a man.

193
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,730
What do you know of him?

194
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,136
They call him Sardor,
the Great Wolf.

195
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,109
Where does this man,
this Sardor, live?

196
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,614
In a place called Skull River.

197
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:56,982
Skull River.

198
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,156
That's my destination.

199
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:06,792
Not many have travelled there.

200
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:10,463
- No one's come back.
- Guide me...

201
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,700
and this can be yours.

202
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:22,542
I've heard of these.
Never seen one.

203
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,447
I'll take it.

204
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:31,517
And the coin you stole from me.

205
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:36,154
You'll receive your payment
once I get to Skull River.

206
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,829
Friends of yours?

207
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,431
Yeah, I don't have many friends.

208
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:46,499
Me neither.

209
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,034
Gun!

210
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,241
Argh!

211
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:20,533
Find them.

212
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,507
That bitch killed my snake!

213
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:44,422
No one shall defy the Church.

214
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,493
It is the Church that
protects the peace

215
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,928
of this city with its laws.

216
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:54,766
The Church that puts fear into
the hearts of the godless.

217
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,036
The Church that keeps the evils

218
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,839
of the Lost Lands at bay.

219
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,275
We are God's instruments,

220
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,413
placed on this earth to
protect you from such evils.

221
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:12,618
Hunt down the sinners, the
heretics, and the witches.

222
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:17,056
Bring them to me and
you shall be rewarded.

223
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:35,741
Gray Alys, with a man.

224
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:38,043
They left the city together.

225
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:41,146
The people lose respect for us.

226
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:44,550
"The witch that will not hang."

227
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:47,485
Gray Alys has become a
symbol of their defiance.

228
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:52,257
She left you alive on that
cross to humiliate us.

229
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:54,225
This woman needs to die.

230
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,764
There is another matter.

231
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:12,778
- What is this?
- Tell him.

232
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,987
Tell him.

233
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,493
A man and a woman
went to see her.

234
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,430
I heard their names.

235
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:35,167
It was Jerais and the queen.

236
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:41,439
If the queen has been
consorting with a heretic,

237
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,942
it would be her downfall.

238
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:46,011
Make sure the witch
makes a full confession

239
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:47,714
before she hangs.

240
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,216
No mistakes.

241
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:27,553
No good.

242
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:37,596
Never saw a man get emotional
about a snake before.

243
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,201
I'm not emotional, it just...

244
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,972
It was a damn good
snake, that's all.

245
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:52,577
Here. The pin was bent.
It should work well now.

246
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:55,948
As long as you stop beating
men to death with it.

247
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:34,920
A clever man might choose to
kill his client on the road

248
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:36,455
and take his payment early.

249
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:45,431
But no one ever accused
me of being a clever man.

250
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,189
This is Ross's place.

251
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,692
He and his sister Mara
are old friends of mine.

252
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:50,295
Are we?

253
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:54,132
Hey, Ross.

254
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,068
It's good to see you.

255
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,805
And Mara.

256
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:03,342
- Welcoming as ever.
- It's been a while.

257
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,011
You look soft.

258
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:07,979
The City has been
treating you well.

259
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,449
- As have the women, I bet.
- Mm.

260
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,424
Ooh-ooh!

261
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,761
Uh, meet my traveling
companion, Gray Alys.

262
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,264
Welcome.

263
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,434
A friend of Boyce
is a friend of ours.

264
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,075
The powers
I want from Sardor

265
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:39,210
will be strongest in his lair.

266
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:42,347
How much longer
till Skull River?

267
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:45,450
- A week, maybe longer.
- I need him as a wolf.

268
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,253
So we need to get there
before the full moon.

269
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:49,620
That won't be easy.

270
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,458
Well, if it was easy,
I wouldn't need you.

271
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:01,066
The only way would be
following the train tracks.

272
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:03,935
The tunnels cut
through the mountains.

273
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:08,340
It'd be dangerous, but we'd
save maybe a day or two.

274
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,784
Yeah.

275
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,287
You need another drink.

276
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,256
Always happy to see me.

277
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,592
It gets boring out here.

278
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:29,494
Lucky her.

279
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,900
So, who is this woman

280
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:36,635
you're traveling with?

281
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:40,339
None of your concern.

282
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:44,676
Do you like her?

283
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,514
Not the way I like you.

284
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,616
Ah.

285
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:55,120
Will it be another year
until I see you again?

286
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:59,457
Mm. If I'm still alive.

287
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:03,729
One year... a long
time in the Lost Lands.

288
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,235
You come, you go.

289
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:12,337
I don't know anything about you.

290
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:14,605
What do you want to know?

291
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,542
Do you ever get lonely?

292
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:18,844
I do.

293
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,348
Let me tell you
about loneliness.

294
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:25,317
Think of a child...

295
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,487
out there in the darkness.

296
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:31,222
Afraid.

297
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,992
His parents beaten to death...

298
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:35,661
right in front of his eyes.

299
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,565
The boy travels the wasteland,

300
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,167
hiding from the outlaws

301
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:44,835
and the raiders during the day,

302
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:48,039
and the creatures and
the ghouls at night.

303
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,210
Till one day that
boy becomes a man,

304
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:55,847
and his heart and
his mind harden.

305
00:31:57,216 --> 00:32:00,385
But still he travels
on, silently,

306
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:04,755
scared to get close to anyone
for fear of losing them.

307
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:09,061
That is loneliness.

308
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,765
And that little boy was you.

309
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,669
No. Hell, no. Of course not.

310
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,905
I've never cried
a day in my life.

311
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:23,041
You really don t know
anything about me.

312
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,462
Those are the last
friendly faces we'll see.

313
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,764
There's only the Lost
Lands ahead of us now.

314
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,477
What are you doing here?

315
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:35,513
Offering a prayer for the
Overlord's swift return.

316
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:39,417
Patriarch, the train
and a large contingent

317
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:41,286
of your enforcers
have left the city.

318
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,688
- Who authorized this?
- I did.

319
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:46,957
- Where are they going?
- To catch the witch Gray Alys.

320
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:50,495
- She is wanted for heresy.
- Your men are needed here.

321
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:52,097
There is growing
unrest in the streets.

322
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:54,199
You leave us
vulnerable, Patriarch.

323
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,302
Witchcraft is
punishable by death,

324
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:59,970
both for the witch and
all who consort with her.

325
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:03,608
I do not care about
her or what she does.

326
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:06,345
- And why is that?
- Do not question me.

327
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:11,316
- I speak for the Overlord.
- Forgive me.

328
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:16,121
But you are right, these
are dangerous times.

329
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:18,956
The Overlord's hand
is losing its grip.

330
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,692
I see defiance everywhere.

331
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:24,995
- And there are rumors.
- What rumors?

332
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,965
- I cannot.
- What rumors?

333
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:32,002
Of your infidelity.

334
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,671
Nothing but lies.

335
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:36,974
Yes. Vile words spoken
by the basest of tongues.

336
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:41,680
But even amongst the scum
and rabble, lies have power.

337
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,556
The queen is guilty of
consorting with a witch.

338
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:53,258
I see it clearly now.

339
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,493
Bring me Gray Alys
and her confession.

340
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:57,162
I will do the rest.

341
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:58,996
The Overlord is dying,

342
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,766
and with no heir,
the queen is weak.

343
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,602
Soon, there will be a
new day in the city.

344
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:09,607
And with the new
dawn, a new Overlord.

345
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:20,618
Aah! Please!

346
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,187
- God.
- No!

347
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:25,723
I told you all I know!

348
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,959
Aah! I swear!

349
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:38,636
No! No! No!

350
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,371
Stop! No!

351
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:41,606
Skull River!

352
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:43,274
That's where they're going.

353
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:44,575
Skull River!

354
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,043
That's where they're going.

355
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:47,479
Burn it.

356
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,883
Do you have a family
out here, Boyce?

357
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,785
A home?

358
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,355
The Lost Lands are
a lonely place.

359
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:34,960
The city, too.

360
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:48,874
They call it the Rift.

361
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,182
There's a place up ahead where
we can make a safe crossing.

362
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,105
Sirus!

363
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,174
Where you at, old man?

364
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,512
That's my friend's cable car.

365
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:30,315
Old Sirus will take us
over for a silver coin.

366
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:32,083
He keeps fresh horses
on the other side.

367
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,553
You're paying.

368
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:41,627
Sirus?

369
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,770
Sirus?

370
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:56,642
Wait here.

371
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,146
Boyce?

372
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:11,817
Seems Sirus had visitors.

373
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,054
So do we.

374
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,302
So you're Boyce. The Hunter.

375
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:35,506
We asked the old man if
you had already crossed.

376
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:37,442
He wasn't very helpful.

377
00:39:37,443 --> 00:39:39,677
I always liked Sirus.

378
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:42,548
Who is that with you, hunter?

379
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:49,454
None of your tricks, witch.

380
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:51,221
You can't look us in the eye.

381
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,724
Hand her over and
we'll let you live.

382
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,694
There's a bounty on her head.

383
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,533
Sorry, she hired me first.

384
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:07,038
A man of principle.
Who'd have thought?

385
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,577
Give us the witch
or you both die.

386
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:23,388
No.

387
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,492
No one shall defy the Church.

388
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:31,996
You say you're servants of
God?! What kind of God is this?!

389
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:34,699
The vengeful kind.

390
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,435
You came here looking
for a monster.

391
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,138
Now you found one.

392
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,214
Boyce...

393
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,252
Behold.

394
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,055
A resurrection.

395
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,090
No!

396
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:47,638
Boyce, we have to go.

397
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,506
- Argh!
- Let's go!

398
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:08,994
Quick!

399
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,367
Argh!

400
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:32,610
Ah!

401
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:39,917
Cut the cable.

402
00:43:39,918 --> 00:43:41,451
Cut the cable!

403
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:49,828
Cut it!

404
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,137
Argh!

405
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:21,659
We have to climb!

406
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:05,737
Come on!

407
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,025
Argh!

408
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,193
Why didn't she finish me?

409
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:06,464
She tried.

410
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:10,034
A witch, indeed.

411
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,438
How do we cross?

412
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:15,873
We have to go around.

413
00:46:15,874 --> 00:46:17,374
Then let's move.

414
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,110
They'll be headed
for the mountains.

415
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:23,248
No. Hell is where
they're headed.

416
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:42,732
You all right?

417
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,234
Drunk.

418
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:45,570
Hmm!

419
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,241
Thank you.

420
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,912
I could've died back there.

421
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:56,581
No, you couldn't.

422
00:46:58,016 --> 00:47:00,185
Not until you get
me to Skull River.

423
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:17,768
Okay. I'm ready.

424
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,793
Would you mind stitching me up?

425
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:45,030
Of course.

426
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:51,069
I think I'd like
to pass out now.

427
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:18,696
Nice work.

428
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,268
Still hurts.

429
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,904
Drink this.

430
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,525
You're thinking
about your friends?

431
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:52,297
I'm sorry.

432
00:48:57,635 --> 00:48:59,237
Ross was a good man.

433
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:02,540
Known him a long time.

434
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:07,878
Mara.

435
00:49:13,218 --> 00:49:15,386
I'm going to kill them
for what they did.

436
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,836
Why do you travel
out here, Boyce?

437
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:37,008
I love the city, the people.

438
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:41,146
A strong drink, good food.

439
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,915
Yet a part of me only
feels at home here.

440
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:48,953
Listening to the wind.

441
00:49:50,455 --> 00:49:52,590
Watching the shadows.

442
00:49:56,961 --> 00:49:59,164
See there, Gray Alys?

443
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,767
See the way the lights
shimmer and shift?

444
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,772
You can see shapes in them
if you look long enough.

445
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:11,776
Yes.

446
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:14,812
It's beautiful.

447
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:18,183
I knew you'd see.

448
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:20,951
We're alike, you and I.

449
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,788
In our blood.

450
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,991
We're two of a kind.

451
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:31,996
I could see it in your eyes.

452
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:54,184
You are pregnant.

453
00:50:59,424 --> 00:51:00,658
You may go now.

454
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:09,400
Did you hear?

455
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,570
Of course you didn't.

456
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:15,673
We have an heir.

457
00:51:19,177 --> 00:51:21,711
Not that you had
anything to do with it.

458
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:24,881
Do you want to
know who the father

459
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:26,917
of the new Overlord is?

460
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:30,388
Boyce.

461
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:32,922
That's his name.

462
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,959
A simple hunter.

463
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,264
I once was a simple girl myself.

464
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,401
Look at me now.

465
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:59,075
The train.

466
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:01,578
We'll need to take the pass
or they'll run us down.

467
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:02,812
It'll be dangerous.

468
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,748
When night falls, demons
roam these mountains.

469
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:06,983
We have no choice.

470
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,708
This is where we make a stand.

471
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,277
Help me with these.

472
00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:36,280
We need a fire all night.

473
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:39,316
Flame is the only
thing they fear.

474
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:44,221
We don't have long.

475
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:23,561
Prepare yourself.

476
00:55:09,273 --> 00:55:10,675
Here they come.

477
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:49,073
Gray Alys.

478
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:55,178
You should not have

479
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:57,881
come back here.

480
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:32,415
Leave him.

481
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:34,083
Boyce!

482
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:37,454
Help me! Boyce!

483
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:28,271
The fire from your hands,

484
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:30,974
I didn't feel it.

485
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:33,176
There was no fire.

486
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:34,879
It couldn't have hurt us.

487
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,782
But to them the illusion
was real enough.

488
00:58:38,783 --> 00:58:41,084
Why do you suffer then?

489
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:45,289
The powers I wield
come at a price.

490
00:58:48,793 --> 00:58:51,729
I heard the monster
talking to you.

491
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,566
He knew me.

492
00:58:56,567 --> 00:58:57,968
A long time ago.

493
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,470
How?

494
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:05,441
There is a great treasure
inside of this place.

495
00:59:05,442 --> 00:59:07,177
An immense power.

496
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,247
A man came to me.

497
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:15,185
He was greedy, power hungry.

498
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,822
They all are.

499
00:59:18,823 --> 00:59:22,526
But I can refuse no
one, so I helped him.

500
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:26,896
But this place is poison.

501
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,166
It turned him and his
men into what you saw.

502
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,338
He shouldn't have
asked me for help.

503
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:38,442
No one should ever
ask me for help.

504
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:46,283
I should just be left alone.

505
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,754
You're with me now.

506
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:12,108
There are tracks to the west.

507
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:14,278
They are close.

508
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,364
The Overlord is dead,

509
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:39,202
but the queen is with child!

510
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:42,606
All hail the new Overlord!

511
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,488
The Overlord is dead!

512
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:03,259
All hail the new Overlord.

513
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,394
And all hail the queen.

514
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:08,465
All hail the queen.

515
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:47,136
Hail the Overlord
and hail the queen.

516
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:48,873
Thank you, Patriarch.

517
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:52,977
Now we both have what we wanted.

518
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:58,782
You have your heir
and I have his power.

519
01:01:58,783 --> 01:02:02,486
16 years until your
child will be of age.

520
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,521
We couldn't ask
for his authority

521
01:02:05,522 --> 01:02:07,623
to be in better hands.

522
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:09,025
You are too kind.

523
01:02:09,026 --> 01:02:11,394
I wouldn't have
anything, Patriarch,

524
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:17,033
not without your wise advice
and unfailing support.

525
01:02:17,034 --> 01:02:21,137
- I hope that will never change.
- Your loyal servant.

526
01:02:21,138 --> 01:02:23,340
Always.

527
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:28,677
A dirty whore sits upon
the throne of the city.

528
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:31,848
An affront to all
that is good and pure.

529
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:33,549
Our time is running out.

530
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:36,552
Her power grows
stronger by the day.

531
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:39,989
Find me the witch.
Bring me her confession.

532
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:44,493
Then the witch and the
whore will hang together.

533
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,797
But hurry. Do you
hear me? Hurry!

534
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:24,668
Tomorrow we'll
reach Skull River.

535
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:32,409
- Will he be there?
- Sardor?

536
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:36,779
I don't know. I hope not.

537
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,747
I need to face him alone.

538
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:40,417
Then you will die.

539
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,127
One always has to die.

540
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,831
This is madness.

541
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:01,070
You should leave.

542
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:03,640
You did what I paid you to do.

543
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,842
I never should have
accepted your offer.

544
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,178
But you did.

545
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:11,114
Leave, Boyce.

546
01:04:11,115 --> 01:04:14,517
- Save yourself.
- No.

547
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:17,620
Forget this. Turn around.

548
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:19,489
I cannot.

549
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,159
Why?

550
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,062
Because I have no choice.

551
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:32,402
No one should ever
ask me for help.

552
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:37,041
Gray.

553
01:04:39,977 --> 01:04:41,178
Come back.

554
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:43,713
With me.

555
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:47,017
Don't you understand, Boyce?

556
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:49,853
I'm cursed.

557
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:54,058
No one should ever
get close to me.

558
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,694
I don't care.

559
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:19,549
The Patriarch calling
to the faithful.

560
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,989
This is the moment
we've been working for.

561
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:29,025
What we've been dreaming
of since we were small,

562
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:31,394
looking up at this place.

563
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:33,862
But he can take it
all away from us.

564
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:36,932
My Overwatch
outnumber his men now.

565
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,269
But he is still dangerous.

566
01:05:41,805 --> 01:05:43,672
Would you do anything for me?

567
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,875
Anything.

568
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:53,450
You are my good soldier.

569
01:06:02,859 --> 01:06:04,860
You're quiet.

570
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:07,231
Skull River lies up ahead.

571
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,477
They're coming.

572
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:22,779
We can't outrun 'em.

573
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:26,016
We won't have to.

574
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:56,113
- The witch!
- Yes!

575
01:07:01,118 --> 01:07:02,485
Our time is upon us.

576
01:07:02,486 --> 01:07:04,787
Make haste! Do you hear me?

577
01:07:04,788 --> 01:07:05,889
Make haste!

578
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,227
You will not escape
us this time!

579
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:14,298
There will be a new
day in the city.

580
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,070
Repent, witch!

581
01:07:31,415 --> 01:07:32,482
No!

582
01:08:25,702 --> 01:08:27,170
Without the witch,

583
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:29,238
we must take the
throne by force.

584
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:30,440
Assemble my guard.

585
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:36,646
Do you hear me?

586
01:08:40,817 --> 01:08:44,052
Brothers! Brothers, to me!

587
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:47,089
There is no use. Your
brothers are dead.

588
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:50,759
You heretic.

589
01:08:55,432 --> 01:08:56,865
In the name of the Overlord,

590
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,634
protector of the City
Under The Mountain,

591
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:04,139
I hereby sentence you,
Patriarch, to death.

592
01:09:34,271 --> 01:09:37,006
My God. How
many has he killed?

593
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:39,908
Everyone that's
come against him.

594
01:10:12,476 --> 01:10:13,977
Look at all this.

595
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:17,546
Someone lives here.

596
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:19,215
Sardor.

597
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,357
This fire hasn't
been lit in weeks.

598
01:10:28,525 --> 01:10:30,159
Tonight will be the full moon.

599
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,096
He will come then.

600
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:42,005
It's not too late to turn back.

601
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:45,041
We could leave now.

602
01:10:46,943 --> 01:10:48,511
You think he would let us?

603
01:10:48,512 --> 01:10:51,715
Do you think he's
not watching us?

604
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:58,555
You could go. I
could hold him back.

605
01:11:05,562 --> 01:11:06,796
No.

606
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:09,498
It is too late for that.

607
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:18,875
It will be a full moon tonight.

608
01:11:23,046 --> 01:11:24,881
You're still thinking
about that witch.

609
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,052
She promised me.

610
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:35,959
You don't need
what she promised.

611
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,930
You have everything now.

612
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,903
Not everything.

613
01:12:12,362 --> 01:12:14,197
Silver?

614
01:12:15,632 --> 01:12:16,833
Silver.

615
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:21,236
Your weapons will be useless.

616
01:12:21,237 --> 01:12:23,139
They've come against
him with silver.

617
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:26,642
Silver swords, silver knives,

618
01:12:26,643 --> 01:12:29,311
arrows tipped with silver.

619
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:31,179
They're all dust now,

620
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:35,051
all those brave,
silvered warriors.

621
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,963
Please, don't do this.

622
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:49,533
We have no choice.

623
01:13:22,832 --> 01:13:25,101
I think he's very
close now, Boyce.

624
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:28,336
What say you?

625
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:31,306
Not yet. There's
still time, Gray.

626
01:13:31,307 --> 01:13:34,142
I think you lie, hunter!

627
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:37,045
There was never any Sardor.

628
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:39,783
Only you.

629
01:13:40,784 --> 01:13:45,220
You knew? You knew what I was?

630
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:50,460
I cared for you.

631
01:13:51,628 --> 01:13:55,531
All this time, you
tried to deceive me.

632
01:13:55,532 --> 01:13:58,100
You thought you
could bring me here

633
01:13:58,101 --> 01:14:00,269
and kill me like the rest!

634
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:06,509
You shouldn't have ever

635
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:09,578
come here... here, Gray Alys.

636
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:13,782
I tried to warn you.

637
01:15:12,475 --> 01:15:13,476
Argh!

638
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:57,841
Calm.

639
01:17:59,776 --> 01:18:03,046
You need to rest while
the moon is still covered.

640
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:07,483
You have a gift I'd kill for.

641
01:18:09,552 --> 01:18:13,389
You change at will,
full moon or not.

642
01:18:14,457 --> 01:18:17,526
No. It was just an illusion.

643
01:18:19,562 --> 01:18:23,499
To distract you, to
leave you vulnerable.

644
01:18:26,803 --> 01:18:28,738
We're the same, Gray.

645
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:32,575
- Don't you see?
- Yes.

646
01:18:33,676 --> 01:18:35,178
Two of a kind.

647
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:46,890
You are still weak.

648
01:18:49,993 --> 01:18:51,094
Sleep.

649
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,286
Hmm?

650
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:25,560
Untie me.

651
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:29,899
I don't understand.

652
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:33,601
Why? You saved me.

653
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:36,605
You would not like
my answer, Boyce.

654
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:40,708
It's the moon.

655
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:43,946
Are you afraid of what'll
happen if I change again?

656
01:19:43,947 --> 01:19:45,680
I won't harm you, Gray Alys.

657
01:19:45,681 --> 01:19:48,451
- Not now.
- I do not fear you, Boyce.

658
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:52,054
I know you too well.

659
01:19:52,055 --> 01:19:54,290
I learned all your
weaknesses along the way.

660
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,659
I even added to them.

661
01:19:58,995 --> 01:20:00,795
What are you talking about?

662
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,465
I'm so sorry.

663
01:20:04,267 --> 01:20:06,701
But your fate was
sealed when you met me.

664
01:20:33,729 --> 01:20:35,330
You were right, Boyce.

665
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:37,265
Silver weapons were not enough.

666
01:20:37,266 --> 01:20:40,168
You poisoned me?

667
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:42,838
I had to put silver
in your blood.

668
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,574
Why didn't you just let me die?

669
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:53,950
Because dead things
have no power.

670
01:20:55,018 --> 01:20:57,220
Hey, wait, wait, wait!

671
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:01,289
You... you have
to grant my wish.

672
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:04,393
You can refuse no one.
Those are your words.

673
01:21:08,164 --> 01:21:12,401
- What do you wish for, Boyce?
- I want you.

674
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:15,337
I want us to be together.

675
01:21:15,338 --> 01:21:18,340
I want us to hunt together,
to fight together.

676
01:21:18,341 --> 01:21:21,009
To find an end to
all this loneliness?

677
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:24,446
Yes, you want it,
too, I know it.

678
01:21:24,447 --> 01:21:26,482
I refuse no one.

679
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:30,718
But there is a price to be paid.

680
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,721
Name it. Anything.

681
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:37,392
Very well.

682
01:23:58,434 --> 01:24:00,335
The witch is back!

683
01:24:00,336 --> 01:24:02,837
It's her! It's her!

684
01:24:02,838 --> 01:24:06,108
- She's back!
- She's back! The witch!

685
01:24:06,109 --> 01:24:08,110
The witch that will not hang!

686
01:24:08,111 --> 01:24:10,312
The witch that will not hang!

687
01:24:10,313 --> 01:24:12,147
The witch that will not hang!

688
01:24:12,148 --> 01:24:14,882
Get back to work!

689
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:24,626
The witch that will not hang!

690
01:24:24,627 --> 01:24:26,294
- The witch that will not hang!
- Down with the Overlord!

691
01:24:26,295 --> 01:24:28,663
Down with the Church!

692
01:24:28,664 --> 01:24:30,165
Down with the Overlord!

693
01:24:30,166 --> 01:24:32,167
Down with the Church!

694
01:24:32,168 --> 01:24:35,537
Down with the Overlord!
Down with the Church!

695
01:24:35,538 --> 01:24:37,038
Down with the Overlord!

696
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:38,340
Down with the Church!

697
01:25:09,872 --> 01:25:11,506
Take this.

698
01:25:11,507 --> 01:25:13,375
Tell the queen to cut herself,

699
01:25:13,376 --> 01:25:16,944
to drip her own blood
onto the skin and wear it.

700
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,013
Tonight will be the
end of the lunar cycle.

701
01:25:19,014 --> 01:25:22,083
She must do it before
the end of the night.

702
01:25:22,084 --> 01:25:24,186
Then the power will be hers.

703
01:25:24,187 --> 01:25:26,354
Wolf skin?

704
01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:30,692
The skin of a shapeshifter
killed in its lair.

705
01:25:30,693 --> 01:25:34,061
Well, Gray Alys, you have
done what she asked of you,

706
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:35,730
but you have failed me.

707
01:25:35,731 --> 01:25:37,932
I did not pay you for success.

708
01:25:37,933 --> 01:25:40,402
Now, give me my timepiece back.

709
01:25:40,403 --> 01:25:43,070
No, Jerais. I've earned it.

710
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:45,139
But I did not get
what I asked for.

711
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,941
But you got what you wanted.

712
01:25:46,942 --> 01:25:51,546
- And what is that?
- The queen herself.

713
01:25:51,547 --> 01:25:56,050
There was a man, the
father of her child.

714
01:25:56,051 --> 01:25:58,521
You wanted her, but knew
he stood in your way.

715
01:25:59,955 --> 01:26:01,423
I have changed that.

716
01:26:09,131 --> 01:26:10,565
Who was this man?

717
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,602
What was his name?

718
01:26:14,603 --> 01:26:16,672
His name was Boyce.

719
01:26:18,974 --> 01:26:21,643
No!

720
01:26:21,644 --> 01:26:25,112
She killed Boyce!

721
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:26,782
No, please.

722
01:26:30,152 --> 01:26:31,786
It could never have been.

723
01:26:31,787 --> 01:26:34,289
What are you talking about?

724
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:36,559
He was a beast.

725
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,094
Beast?

726
01:26:40,095 --> 01:26:41,797
What do you know of it?

727
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:46,801
He twisted you. You changed.

728
01:26:46,802 --> 01:26:49,103
You did this.

729
01:26:49,104 --> 01:26:52,540
I did what I had to
do. I protected you.

730
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:56,678
- You betrayed me.
- No, no. I...

731
01:26:56,679 --> 01:26:59,781
You had him killed.
The father of my child!

732
01:26:59,782 --> 01:27:02,384
Oh!

733
01:27:02,385 --> 01:27:04,452
- Please.
- No!

734
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:06,822
I would do anything for you.

735
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:12,928
Then die for me.

736
01:27:18,334 --> 01:27:20,168
I did this for you, Boyce.

737
01:27:21,169 --> 01:27:24,672
So we could be
together, hunt together.

738
01:27:37,553 --> 01:27:39,321
The witch that will not hang!

739
01:27:39,322 --> 01:27:41,155
The witch that will not hang!

740
01:27:41,156 --> 01:27:42,924
The witch that will not hang!

741
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:44,926
The witch that will not hang!

742
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:46,928
The witch that will not hang!

743
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:48,596
The witch that will not hang!

744
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:51,032
The witch that will not hang!

745
01:28:06,449 --> 01:28:08,150
Down with the Overlord!

746
01:30:01,497 --> 01:30:04,933
So, how'd you like my story?

747
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:08,503
I still don't know how it ends.

748
01:30:08,504 --> 01:30:11,338
Maybe with me
skinning you alive,

749
01:30:11,339 --> 01:30:13,075
just like you did to me.

750
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:19,514
I'm not sure I like that ending.

751
01:30:19,515 --> 01:30:21,716
Too bad.

752
01:30:21,717 --> 01:30:24,620
I knew you were
the queen's lover.

753
01:30:26,021 --> 01:30:27,689
- Don't leave yet.
- You know what I am.

754
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:29,557
- I can't stay here.
- You said the only woman

755
01:30:29,558 --> 01:30:32,660
you could truly love
would be someone like you.

756
01:30:32,661 --> 01:30:35,763
- You are not that.
- But what if I could be?

757
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:39,166
I want from you the power to
become a beast, Gray Alys.

758
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:43,505
- I refuse no one.
- I want you to fail her.

759
01:30:43,506 --> 01:30:46,240
- I refuse no one.
- I want you.

760
01:30:46,241 --> 01:30:48,242
I refuse no one.

761
01:30:49,545 --> 01:30:51,345
I knew that
the queen's desires

762
01:30:51,346 --> 01:30:53,380
would lead to revolution.

763
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:57,285
And that she would
never wear your skin.

764
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:00,589
I knew you would live.

765
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,258
You're lying.

766
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:08,597
Just like I know
that'll misfire.

767
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:21,743
They say you can buy
anything you might desire

768
01:31:21,744 --> 01:31:23,178
from Gray Alys...

769
01:31:26,782 --> 01:31:28,450
...but it is better not to.

770
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:33,822
And isn't this
what we wished for?
