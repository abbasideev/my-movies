1
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:19,264
You can't just say you don't know.
That's what you said on the phone.

2
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:21,516
When will you know?

3
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:24,269
I... don't know.

4
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:27,564
Do you want me to spend the night
somewhere else?

5
00:01:27,664 --> 00:01:30,025
In a hotel or something?

6
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:34,362
Do you want us to meet later on?
We can talk more calmly. Do you...

7
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,448
Do you need more time?

8
00:01:36,548 --> 00:01:39,326
What...? What do you need?

9
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:40,994
What has happened?

10
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:44,347
Bob knows that you are coming back today.

11
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:47,083
Well, I can...

12
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:50,462
I can pick him up after school
and take him...

13
00:01:50,562 --> 00:01:53,523
to the zoo or something.

14
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:12,667
Come and admire him.

15
00:02:13,752 --> 00:02:16,404
Nee-Na, nee-Na, nee-Na.

16
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:18,882
Nee-Na, nee-Na.

17
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:29,209
Maybe all couples go through this.

18
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:30,685
Yeah.

19
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:34,005
One mustn't be afraid.

20
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:35,298
No.

21
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:37,509
One must speak honestly.

22
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:39,277
Is that difficult?

23
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:42,489
Is it difficult?

24
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:50,121
I haven't been much help but
I've finished that job now... it's over.

25
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:53,483
Maybe I was asking for too much.

26
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,653
I was the one who had the right to ask.

27
00:02:56,753 --> 00:02:58,071
I know.

28
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,672
No, you don't.

29
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:03,635
Who was I doing it for, after all?

30
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,724
Were you unfaithful to me?

31
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:14,087
The truth is not really.

32
00:03:14,187 --> 00:03:16,006
Were you?

33
00:03:16,106 --> 00:03:17,090
No.

34
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,301
There's always someone else
when these things happen.

35
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:21,319
Not in this case.

36
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:24,764
All right, well...

37
00:03:24,864 --> 00:03:27,225
What's happening to us is just...

38
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:29,936
It's just natural. Feelings...

39
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:32,080
change.

40
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:36,626
But without you I wouldn't feel
anything at all.

41
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:42,632
What do you feel now?

42
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:47,178
Are you really interested?

43
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,891
No.

44
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:57,339
There you are, you see.
It's the same with me.

45
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,174
I don't even want you now.

46
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:01,968
What time did you meet him?
8.30.

47
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:03,887
Where?
In the park.

48
00:04:03,987 --> 00:04:06,431
Was he willing?
Yes, verbally.

49
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:09,142
Did you sense or detect weariness in him?

50
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:12,437
No. A correct appraisal of the realities.

51
00:04:12,537 --> 00:04:15,565
Is it making him bitter?
No. Greedy.

52
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:17,484
But you felt his power?

53
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:19,527
You mean did I feel fear?

54
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:23,615
No because that would have prevented me
answering all your questions.

55
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:26,368
How many vials did he take with him?
Two

56
00:04:26,468 --> 00:04:29,746
What procedure have you devised for
contacting him again?

57
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:31,206
It's all in my report.

58
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:35,085
I suggest it's more economical
to fill in my successor.

59
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:37,962
We don't feel there is a need
for a successor.

60
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:39,672
I've completed my job.

61
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:42,884
Brilliantly. That's why
we want to rehire you.

62
00:04:42,984 --> 00:04:44,427
It's out of the question.

63
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:46,763
And what would be the reason
for your refusal?

64
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:47,889
Family.

65
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:50,475
Couldn't we be of some help there?
No.

66
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:53,395
Wouldn't it be advisable for you
to reconsider?

67
00:04:53,495 --> 00:04:54,854
I'm unable to do that.

68
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:56,856
Would you be unable for a long time?

69
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:57,899
I hope not.

70
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:01,528
Aren't you allowing feelings to prevent
you from answering your own questions?

71
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:04,781
Exactly why I advise you
to hire my successor.

72
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:05,882
Good.

73
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:08,493
Any questions?

74
00:05:08,593 --> 00:05:09,994
No.

75
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:14,849
Does our subject still wear pink socks?

76
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:43,670
Anna?

77
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,749
<i>It's me.</i>

78
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:39,751
It's Anna?

79
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:42,061
<i>I am downtown.</i>

80
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,316
Why downtown? I've been waiting all day.

81
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,802
<i>I need some time to think.</i>

82
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:53,097
What do you mean "to think"?
Think about what?

83
00:06:53,197 --> 00:06:54,432
To think about me.

84
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:56,643
Wh... Wh... Where are you?

85
00:06:56,743 --> 00:06:58,870
When will you...?

86
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:16,364
<i>Hello?</i>
Margie, this is Mark.

87
00:08:17,657 --> 00:08:21,102
Now, I know there's no sympathy
between us and it's...

88
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:25,607
hard for me to ask you for help but...

89
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:29,360
you're her only friend.
Now, just tell me the truth.

90
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,237
She has somebody?

91
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:35,116
<i>She wished you'd say or do something.
Something to reinstall you.</i>

92
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:37,160
<i>You know, a magic wave of the wand.</i>

93
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,454
<i>You arrived sooner than expected, Mark.</i>

94
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:42,999
Yes, sure, this is all my fault.
Now, how long has this been going on?

95
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:44,250
<i>Quite long.</i>

96
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,668
Who is he?

97
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:47,962
<i>Oh, Mark! I don't...</i>

98
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:50,715
<i>Your wife keeps her own secrets.</i>

99
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:52,275
Margie...

100
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:59,015
I don't have a magic wand.
I don't intend to hang on.

101
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:03,728
But make her talk to me.
It'll be the way that she wants.

102
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:05,872
But this is not...

103
00:09:07,665 --> 00:09:08,916
proper.

104
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:12,587
Please.

105
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:30,546
Yes?

106
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:32,398
<i>We're over, Mark.</i>

107
00:09:41,783 --> 00:09:43,659
You have someone.

108
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:45,770
<i>Yes.</i>

109
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,022
For a long time?
<i>Does it matter?</i>

110
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:49,273
Yes.

111
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:50,708
<i>Yes.</i>

112
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:55,713
Do you...

113
00:09:56,798 --> 00:09:58,408
sleep with him?

114
00:09:58,508 --> 00:09:59,534
<i>Yes.</i>

115
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:01,661
Do you like it?
<i>Yes.</i>

116
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:03,496
More than with me?

117
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:04,831
<i>Yes.</i>

118
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:06,432
I see.

119
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:11,671
How do you intend to live now?

120
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:14,215
<i>We have to discuss it.</i>
Now.

121
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:15,508
<i>As you want.</i>

122
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:17,844
Half an hour at the Cafe Einstein.

123
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:20,488
<i>I'm too far for half an hour.</i>

124
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,785
Are you calling from there?

125
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:28,062
<i>Yes.</i>

126
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:29,914
Is he listening?

127
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:32,250
<i>No.</i>

128
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:35,153
But he is there.

129
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:36,504
<i>Yes.</i>

130
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:59,969
Would 800 a month for Bob be enough?

131
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,095
I suppose.

132
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:03,723
Will you move in with him or
keep the apartment?

133
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:05,850
I'll keep it if you allow me to.

134
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,327
I've decided not to see Bob.

135
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:13,416
At all?
At all.

136
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,486
How can you say that?

137
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:18,905
He's going to be fucked up
enough as it is.

138
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:22,158
I don't want to fuck him up even more
by playing Sunday Daddy.

139
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:25,203
What were you to him anyway?
Precisely.

140
00:11:25,303 --> 00:11:26,788
But...

141
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:29,665
He knows you. He's yours. He needs...

142
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:31,918
A real father full time?

143
00:11:32,018 --> 00:11:36,230
Well, I thought I could be,
coming home from the war, so to speak.

144
00:11:37,982 --> 00:11:40,259
You say it's better with him than with me.

145
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:42,612
I get bored of it.

146
00:11:45,823 --> 00:11:47,266
Tell me.

147
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:50,895
I think what you want to do to Bob is...

148
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:54,482
Inhuman? So what you're doing
must be human.

149
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:57,235
How long is it going to last?
I don't know.

150
00:11:57,335 --> 00:11:59,028
One week? Two weeks?

151
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:04,175
And how do you dispose of ideas
like honesty and loyalty?

152
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,665
If I could only believe that it happened
cleanly at first sight.

153
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:13,125
OK, if it makes things easier,

154
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:16,379
I was in his bed the first night
I met him, if you have to know.

155
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:19,815
What do you expect of me?
Look what you're doing.

156
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:24,637
No-one is good or bad

157
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:26,764
but if you want, I am the bad one

158
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:31,561
and if I knew he existed in this world,
I would have never had Bob with you.

159
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:33,062
Get out!

160
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:35,122
Get out! Get out!

161
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:25,740
Erm...
<i>Hallo?</i>

162
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,925
Mm...

163
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:30,970
<i>Hallo? Hallo?</i>

164
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:38,477
Ma, ma, ma.

165
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:02,353
How... How long have I...?

166
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:06,774
How long have I been here?

167
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,276
Three weeks, sir.

168
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:27,820
What happened? It's Daddy.

169
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,282
Mummy said she would be right back
but she never came.

170
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:34,493
Then Margie called and told me to be brave

171
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:39,265
Because she had broke her leg and
she had to have the cast put on.

172
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:46,063
You've been alone for a long time?

173
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:51,610
Look, I got a new boat.

174
00:15:57,158 --> 00:15:59,393
Did you get it from Mummy?

175
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:02,538
No. From Uncle Heinrich.

176
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:05,916
Long ago?

177
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:08,360
Yes.

178
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,820
Yesterday?

179
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,215
No. Before you were coming back
from far away.

180
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:18,496
OK, little piggy.

181
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:21,082
Come on, let's get out of this mess.

182
00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:23,475
How did you make such a mess?

183
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:05,000
This is not always like this, Mark.
Usually I'm on time.

184
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,377
I'm not interested.

185
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:09,588
I came to tell you that
I can't live without you

186
00:17:09,688 --> 00:17:11,966
and I'm ready to understand
whatever there is

187
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:14,301
but it doesn't look like
it makes much sense.

188
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,429
You can't take Bob away from me.
I'm not trying.

189
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:22,576
You can continue to visit whenever
you want, but I'm taking over here.

190
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:28,707
Anna, is there anything I can do?

191
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,069
You could just...
Yes?

192
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:34,363
I must...
Yes?

193
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,614
I must...

194
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:38,868
You must restore order.
You must leave him.

195
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:41,453
You will call him.
You will say it is over.

196
00:17:41,553 --> 00:17:44,165
Now, I don't care if you tell him
you love him

197
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:47,084
but he's not your family -
your family is here.

198
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:49,295
You must call him now.

199
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:52,047
But I can't on the phone.
I don't trust you.

200
00:17:52,147 --> 00:17:55,426
I have to tell him face to face.
I don't trust you.

201
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:57,970
On the phone.

202
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,514
Oh Jesus!

203
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:04,143
Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!

204
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:07,104
Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!

205
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:08,606
Jesus!

206
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:12,334
If you want to stay, make that call.

207
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:31,645
It's still quite warm. I don't think
you'll need a winter coat or sweater.

208
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:44,575
I can't stand to see you like this.

209
00:18:46,243 --> 00:18:49,997
It could be the way you want.
Just don't cry any more.

210
00:19:43,008 --> 00:19:45,636
I am very sleepy.

211
00:20:11,286 --> 00:20:14,665
<i>Anna is with me and she'll stay with me.</i>

212
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:29,872
He phoned me.
He said she won't be coming back.

213
00:20:29,972 --> 00:20:32,958
I have to talk to her right now.
Please give me that number.

214
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:35,002
<i>542-6261 .</i>

215
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:36,211
Where is it?

216
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:37,713
<i>I don't know, Mark.</i>

217
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:39,673
542-6261.

218
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:48,015
Hello?
<i>Yes?</i>

219
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:50,351
I want to speak to Heinrich.

220
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:53,103
<i>My son is not in town. Who is calling?</i>

221
00:20:53,203 --> 00:20:54,646
Anna's husband.

222
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:57,900
<i>Anna's not here.
I haven't seen her for weeks.</i>

223
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,794
<i>I miss her so much.</i>

224
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:04,323
<i>Hallo? Hallo?</i>

225
00:21:04,423 --> 00:21:06,008
<i>Hallo?</i>

226
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:19,062
542-6261

227
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:27,905
What happened?

228
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:33,827
Wee-wee.

229
00:21:35,454 --> 00:21:37,164
Shall I take you?

230
00:21:43,921 --> 00:21:45,072
Where's Mummy?

231
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:46,924
She went to see Margie.

232
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:50,327
Are you going too?

233
00:21:50,427 --> 00:21:52,012
I'm staying with you.

234
00:22:06,151 --> 00:22:10,364
Hello, I'm Bob's father. I'll be bringing
him to school from now on.

235
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:17,079
I'm glad. You're the father who went
far away and met the polar bears.

236
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:19,731
Hello.

237
00:22:19,831 --> 00:22:21,442
What is this? A joke?

238
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:22,985
What are you talking about?

239
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:24,820
I mean your wig.
What?

240
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,990
I'm so sorry. It's impossible.

241
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,325
Have you ever seen my wife?

242
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:33,387
Naturally. Every day of the school year.

243
00:22:46,817 --> 00:22:48,135
You're Heinrich?

244
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:49,611
Yes.

245
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:54,741
I've come for Anna.

246
00:22:58,453 --> 00:22:59,521
Anna's not here.

247
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:02,191
You want me to break down
the bloody door?

248
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,418
You don't have to. It's open.

249
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:11,533
We don't have to be brutal to each other
or even impolite.

250
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:16,163
Our situation is like a mountain lake
we are trying to swim in,

251
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:18,373
starting from different shores.

252
00:23:18,473 --> 00:23:20,751
I am not astonished you are here.

253
00:23:20,851 --> 00:23:23,837
I was thinking about you
just before you came

254
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:27,774
so now that you're here,
let's be open to each other.

255
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:32,763
You can hate me as much as you like.

256
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:36,016
But it's you who wants
to know things from me.

257
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:38,535
So please make it possible.

258
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,564
I am suffering as much as you are.

259
00:23:42,664 --> 00:23:46,568
The fact that Anna did not inform you
was harmful to everyone

260
00:23:46,668 --> 00:23:48,695
but I always accept Anna's ways,

261
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:52,507
as I think no-one has a right
to impose his will on anyone.

262
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:56,203
So that's how you've changed her so much.

263
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:59,665
Possibly, but is it changing her
or making her open to herself?

264
00:23:59,765 --> 00:24:03,252
So open she's inarticulate at night
and you have to speak for her?

265
00:24:03,352 --> 00:24:04,670
What are you talking about?

266
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,381
We spoke on the phone last night,
you and I, didn't we?

267
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:10,717
Stop it. I just arrived from Hamburg.
You weren't listening to me.

268
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:14,012
I was just trying to make her comprehend
that I love her.

269
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:17,474
I left the day you arrived to give her
the chance to decide for herself.

270
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:18,892
I allowed you your chance.

271
00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:20,227
Bullshit!

272
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:23,105
I'm not obliged to listen to you speak
in that way. It's offensive.

273
00:24:23,205 --> 00:24:25,315
How long have you been fucking me over?

274
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:26,792
A year.

275
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:32,614
All my visits home, all that time.

276
00:24:32,714 --> 00:24:33,740
Yes.

277
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,952
And this is what you mean by
accepting Anna's ways?

278
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:38,512
Precisely.

279
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:45,502
The key being the infinitive.

280
00:24:45,602 --> 00:24:47,562
To accept.

281
00:24:55,153 --> 00:24:56,888
I have been honest with you.

282
00:24:56,988 --> 00:25:00,283
Would you permit me to inquire
on a specific point?

283
00:25:01,827 --> 00:25:05,647
On your last visit home,
were you content with your wife?

284
00:25:05,747 --> 00:25:07,482
I mean sexually.

285
00:25:07,582 --> 00:25:08,984
Why?

286
00:25:09,084 --> 00:25:13,905
Because in that period we reached
a state of perfect harmony.

287
00:25:14,005 --> 00:25:15,966
Er...

288
00:25:21,513 --> 00:25:23,223
My mother.

289
00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:29,796
Is she here all the time?
Yes.

290
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:32,733
Even when you're fucking Anna?
Of course.

291
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:40,907
Agh!

292
00:26:02,262 --> 00:26:03,680
Why?

293
00:26:06,808 --> 00:26:07,934
Why?

294
00:26:17,152 --> 00:26:19,029
Agh!

295
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,827
...eating green bananas.

296
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:44,955
Where d'you think he put the skins?
Down his new pyjamas!

297
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,836
Yes. Yes!

298
00:26:50,936 --> 00:26:53,797
Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?

299
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:56,591
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full.

300
00:26:56,691 --> 00:27:00,387
One for... the master, one for the dame

301
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:04,015
and one for the little boy
that lives down the lane.

302
00:27:04,115 --> 00:27:07,519
Can I go out into the back yard?
Yes, you may.

303
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:09,454
But you take your sandwich with you.

304
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:16,820
Where were you?

305
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,156
I wrote you. I was at Margie's.

306
00:27:19,256 --> 00:27:21,241
That's not true. I spoke to her.

307
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:22,367
I was with him.

308
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:25,829
That's not true either. I saw him.
I may... stink from him.

309
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:27,289
But he's not lying.
I was...

310
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:29,082
I was with friends.
Who?

311
00:27:29,182 --> 00:27:30,751
New friends.
I'll check.

312
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:33,378
Yes, check, check, check, check, check!

313
00:27:33,478 --> 00:27:35,130
Why did you leave last night?

314
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,214
To be alone!

315
00:27:36,314 --> 00:27:38,425
But you said you went to friends.

316
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:41,511
Why are you nagging me?
Can't you just leave me in peace?

317
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:44,514
I could have perfect peace
if you never came back.

318
00:27:44,614 --> 00:27:48,602
It's Bob! I have Bob! He is my son too.

319
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:50,937
Don't try to tell me you care about him
all that much.

320
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:52,606
He didn't stop you from breaking us up.

321
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:56,026
If you really thought about him, you'd
give a thought to us, for Christ's sake.

322
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:57,694
I do! I do!

323
00:27:57,794 --> 00:28:00,363
No you don't. You think about buying him
a pair of shoes,

324
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:03,408
about making him a snack,
about telling him a bedtime story

325
00:28:03,508 --> 00:28:06,203
but if you really thought about him,
you'd think about us.

326
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:11,249
Right, right. Why are you always right?
But it's difficult, don't you understand?

327
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:16,129
It's difficult. I didn't want it to happen
but it happened and now...

328
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:17,964
Don't come any closer.

329
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,466
Anna, it's me.

330
00:28:19,566 --> 00:28:22,093
Don't you understand? You disgust me.

331
00:28:22,193 --> 00:28:25,222
I can't stand you touching me.

332
00:28:25,322 --> 00:28:27,657
You make me...

333
00:28:32,245 --> 00:28:37,025
You know, love isn't something you can
just switch from channel to channel.

334
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,861
I have your letters.
"My love, trust me," you write

335
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:42,572
and all the time you were
fucking your arse off.

336
00:28:42,672 --> 00:28:45,575
You want me to believe you're a...
A whore! Yes!

337
00:28:45,675 --> 00:28:49,412
A monster, a whore.
I fuck around with everybody.

338
00:28:49,512 --> 00:28:55,377
Whenever you turn around I fuck around
with everybody on every corner.

339
00:28:55,477 --> 00:28:57,145
You will let me go.

340
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:02,968
Please don't make me force you.

341
00:29:03,068 --> 00:29:04,719
You can't stop me.

342
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:07,656
I'll open the window and jump.

343
00:29:09,824 --> 00:29:12,102
You need him that much?

344
00:29:12,202 --> 00:29:14,454
Oh yes! Oh yes!

345
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:17,082
Fuck your needs!

346
00:29:22,671 --> 00:29:24,047
Do it again.

347
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:44,859
Agh!

348
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:16,166
You know what this is for?

349
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:17,751
The lies.

350
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:20,645
Then you'll have to add much more.

351
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:24,341
Bitch!

352
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:25,608
Bitch!

353
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:45,462
Bitch! You bitch!

354
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:56,331
What's going to happen to us?
It's up to you.

355
00:30:56,431 --> 00:30:58,166
Then stop coming.
I have to go.

356
00:30:58,266 --> 00:30:59,334
I'll follow you.

357
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:01,352
Don't even try.

358
00:31:39,682 --> 00:31:45,714
Oh, it's Aunt Margit, the angel of the
extinct hearth, limping to the rescue.

359
00:31:45,814 --> 00:31:47,966
And nothing can stop me.

360
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:53,138
Oh! I know you can't wait to run off
and make a fool of yourself

361
00:31:53,238 --> 00:31:56,141
and I'm here to help you.

362
00:31:56,241 --> 00:31:59,728
I'll look after Bob. Give me your sweater.

363
00:31:59,828 --> 00:32:01,604
Ah!

364
00:32:01,704 --> 00:32:04,249
I loathe you, Marge.

365
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:09,295
You're still full of belief, Mark.

366
00:32:15,051 --> 00:32:18,054
I love seeing you miserable.

367
00:32:20,181 --> 00:32:23,001
It's so reassuring.

368
00:32:23,101 --> 00:32:25,295
Shit, Marge.

369
00:32:25,395 --> 00:32:26,855
Yes, sir.

370
00:32:33,027 --> 00:32:36,056
Mr Zimmerman will be with you in a minute.

371
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:38,074
The second door on the right.

372
00:32:56,426 --> 00:32:57,552
Yes.

373
00:32:58,678 --> 00:32:59,888
Sir.

374
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:03,374
How can we help you? Please.

375
00:33:03,474 --> 00:33:04,851
I, er...

376
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:08,938
I would like you to follow my...

377
00:33:10,064 --> 00:33:11,633
...wife for a few days.

378
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:14,861
Of course. Wives, wives, wives, wives.

379
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,556
Are there any reasons you would like
to give us?

380
00:33:18,656 --> 00:33:23,228
You don't have to answer but often it is
enormously helpful in an investigation.

381
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:26,356
My wife doesn't live with me any more

382
00:33:26,456 --> 00:33:33,571
but she visits or at least she has been
visiting up to now my son.

383
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:35,073
I see.

384
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:37,467
I have a photo of my wife here.

385
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,332
Are there any other leads?

386
00:33:44,432 --> 00:33:45,959
Mmm.

387
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:48,336
Family?

388
00:33:48,436 --> 00:33:50,213
Does your wife have a job?

389
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:52,423
She quit about a year ago.

390
00:33:52,523 --> 00:33:53,733
Ff lends?

391
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:59,989
Her best friend is Mrs Margie Gluckmeister.
She's in the directory.

392
00:34:01,908 --> 00:34:05,270
Margie visits our place occasionally to...

393
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,372
to help out with Bob.

394
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:12,043
All right, sir. Now we must get down
to practicalities.

395
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,918
Oh! Look at this.

396
00:34:29,018 --> 00:34:31,588
Tired boy.

397
00:34:31,688 --> 00:34:34,549
Let's get you in bed.

398
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:36,634
That's it.

399
00:34:50,915 --> 00:34:53,960
Oh, look at this.

400
00:34:55,253 --> 00:34:59,257
Tired boy. Let's get you in bed.

401
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,826
That's it.

402
00:35:01,926 --> 00:35:04,220
On with the covers.

403
00:36:11,454 --> 00:36:12,747
Excuse me.

404
00:36:17,919 --> 00:36:20,254
How long is this going to last?

405
00:36:22,131 --> 00:36:23,591
Excuse me.

406
00:36:29,138 --> 00:36:31,124
I'm talking to you.

407
00:36:31,224 --> 00:36:33,017
Excuse me!

408
00:36:35,645 --> 00:36:37,880
You don't have the right
to behave this way.

409
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,300
What have I done that you hate me so much?

410
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,801
Nothing.

411
00:36:41,901 --> 00:36:43,511
I deserve this?
Get off it. No.

412
00:36:43,611 --> 00:36:44,846
Get off it.

413
00:36:44,946 --> 00:36:48,016
Told you to stop coming home.
Get off, get off, get off!

414
00:36:48,116 --> 00:36:50,393
This is disgusting.

415
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:51,911
Yes.

416
00:36:54,038 --> 00:36:56,149
Look what we've become.

417
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:58,109
Yes.

418
00:36:58,209 --> 00:37:00,461
Talk to me.

419
00:37:06,843 --> 00:37:09,095
I don't want you to be like this.

420
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:14,459
You know, when I'm away from you
I think of you as an animal,

421
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,710
or a woman possessed

422
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,838
and then I see you again and
all this disappears.

423
00:37:21,065 --> 00:37:22,967
You must try and help me.

424
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:24,344
Tell me.

425
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:25,945
Maybe it will help.

426
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,449
Are you happy?

427
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:35,563
Do you love him? Does he love you?

428
00:37:35,663 --> 00:37:37,899
Do you want to live together?

429
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:40,568
And have a family and...

430
00:37:40,668 --> 00:37:43,796
Am I in your way and Bob too?

431
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:49,218
And there's something else
you must tell me.

432
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:54,849
Why are you afraid to tell me?

433
00:37:56,726 --> 00:37:59,462
Are you afraid of me? Are you...?

434
00:37:59,562 --> 00:38:02,857
Are you afraid I'll get mad again
and beat you?

435
00:38:05,943 --> 00:38:07,862
Are you afraid I won't like you?

436
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,532
Yes.

437
00:38:19,749 --> 00:38:21,459
Anna, help me.

438
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:24,837
Help me!

439
00:38:38,184 --> 00:38:39,877
Oh my God!

440
00:38:45,107 --> 00:38:47,443
No! No! No!

441
00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:53,266
Anna, there's Bob. There's Bob, remember.

442
00:38:53,366 --> 00:38:55,476
Good Christ! Remember.

443
00:39:20,851 --> 00:39:22,837
It'll be the way you want it.

444
00:39:22,937 --> 00:39:25,606
It'll be the way you want it.

445
00:39:26,857 --> 00:39:29,151
Hold it.

446
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:34,407
You don't have to say anything
you don't want to.

447
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:53,092
You're my whole family.

448
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,920
I have to go now.

449
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,130
Would you wait for Bob?

450
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,483
I can't now.

451
00:40:53,736 --> 00:40:57,348
Maybe we can both go and
pick him up at school.

452
00:40:57,448 --> 00:40:59,075
I can't.

453
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:09,085
It doesn't hurt.

454
00:41:13,464 --> 00:41:14,965
No.

455
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:20,259
I gotten your wife's address.
It's in Kreuzberg.

456
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:22,820
Sebastianstrasse 87, 1st floor.

457
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:26,390
She seems to be alone.

458
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,934
Do you want me to check this now?

459
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:30,786
Danke.

460
00:45:38,395 --> 00:45:42,091
Sorry to bother you, miss.
I'm from the building manager's office.

461
00:45:42,191 --> 00:45:44,468
We had a complaint about
some broken windows somewhere

462
00:45:44,568 --> 00:45:46,345
and the glass falling
down on the sidewalk.

463
00:45:46,445 --> 00:45:49,557
Is that what it is?
I'm afraid I have to check your windows.

464
00:45:49,657 --> 00:45:52,059
But I can assure you they're all right.
How can you be so sure?

465
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:54,828
I just... I just saw you come in.

466
00:45:56,163 --> 00:45:57,273
It'll only take a moment.

467
00:45:57,373 --> 00:45:58,732
But I don't want you to be here.

468
00:45:58,832 --> 00:46:01,694
I quite understand, miss,
but it's me or the police.

469
00:46:01,794 --> 00:46:04,280
A lady got hurt on the sidewalk,
a Turkish woman.

470
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:08,617
You might say she shouldn't be here in the
first place but she lodged a complaint.

471
00:46:08,717 --> 00:46:11,303
So what can I do about it?

472
00:46:13,263 --> 00:46:14,473
Nothing.

473
00:46:16,392 --> 00:46:18,227
Please.

474
00:46:47,256 --> 00:46:48,616
Is it OK?

475
00:46:48,716 --> 00:46:50,426
Moment.

476
00:47:07,192 --> 00:47:08,344
So?

477
00:47:08,444 --> 00:47:10,137
Excuse me, the bathroom?

478
00:47:10,237 --> 00:47:13,140
The bathroom doesn't have a window.

479
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,475
Are you sure?

480
00:47:14,575 --> 00:47:16,769
Absolutely.

481
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:19,355
Some bathrooms have windows
this side of the house.

482
00:47:19,455 --> 00:47:21,023
Not in this one.

483
00:47:21,123 --> 00:47:24,234
I'm afraid I still have to check it
before someone else gets...

484
00:47:24,334 --> 00:47:26,195
Would you care for a glass of wine?

485
00:47:26,295 --> 00:47:27,655
Wine?
Yes.

486
00:47:27,755 --> 00:47:29,631
I'm afraid I...

487
00:47:30,966 --> 00:47:32,910
Yes, wine!

488
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:37,164
I'm afraid you...
Oh, come on. Don't be so formal.

489
00:47:37,264 --> 00:47:40,876
Miss, it doesn't make any sense.
I've got k-k-kids.

490
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:44,188
I only came for the windows.

491
00:47:45,606 --> 00:47:47,925
I'm sorry, miss, but...

492
00:47:48,025 --> 00:47:49,985
I still have to have a look.

493
00:47:56,992 --> 00:47:59,853
Oh! It broke!

494
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,462
Was ist...?

495
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:53,699
How long?

496
00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:55,909
Ah... Ages and ages.

497
00:48:56,009 --> 00:48:58,345
Much longer than I could.

498
00:49:01,807 --> 00:49:04,918
Nee-Na, nee-Na, nee-Na.

499
00:49:05,018 --> 00:49:09,214
Hello, I'm sorry to bother you so late.
May I see your wife?

500
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:11,592
No. She went out.

501
00:49:11,692 --> 00:49:13,761
Nee-Na, nee-Na, nee-Na.

502
00:49:13,861 --> 00:49:16,138
That's not entirely true. She...

503
00:49:16,238 --> 00:49:18,474
She doesn't live with us any longer.

504
00:49:18,574 --> 00:49:19,600
Oh.

505
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,976
It's about Bob.

506
00:49:21,076 --> 00:49:22,895
Ah! Bob!

507
00:49:22,995 --> 00:49:24,705
Bob is fine.

508
00:49:26,331 --> 00:49:29,835
He's just beaten the world record
in tub diving.

509
00:49:33,046 --> 00:49:35,883
Oh!

510
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:39,203
Hello, Bob.
Come on. Cut it out, Bob.

511
00:49:42,514 --> 00:49:43,540
Look, um...

512
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,501
Would you be so kind?

513
00:49:45,601 --> 00:49:48,420
He's actually been in the bath
for about an hour.

514
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,105
Yes, of course.

515
00:49:55,152 --> 00:49:57,304
I've called many times.

516
00:49:57,404 --> 00:50:02,601
I wanted to discuss with you
the redistribution of our parts

517
00:50:02,701 --> 00:50:07,272
in this fundamentally vulgar structure,
the triangle.

518
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:09,733
In other words, where is she?

519
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:13,362
I've been giving a great deal of thought
to the illogical aspects

520
00:50:13,462 --> 00:50:15,155
of your anger and your defence.

521
00:50:15,255 --> 00:50:16,657
Is Anna with you?

522
00:50:16,757 --> 00:50:18,367
And if?

523
00:50:18,467 --> 00:50:21,620
I would only ask to have a talk with her.

524
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,956
What if I said no?

525
00:50:24,056 --> 00:50:26,792
I'm sorry I used violence with you.

526
00:50:26,892 --> 00:50:31,755
Now I'd only apply my psychic process
to make her come to me.

527
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:34,133
Oh, I'm so sorry, she's not here.

528
00:50:34,233 --> 00:50:37,136
Did I tell you I had a wife
and a daughter?

529
00:50:37,236 --> 00:50:38,428
No!

530
00:50:38,528 --> 00:50:40,180
They live in Cincinnati.

531
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,640
What does that do for you?

532
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,143
They will always remain my first family.

533
00:50:44,243 --> 00:50:48,021
Anna could be the second
and you and Bob in some sense.

534
00:50:48,121 --> 00:50:49,940
Do you have a dog?

535
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,608
Would that I had.

536
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:53,402
You misuse me.

537
00:50:53,502 --> 00:50:57,781
It's stiff and blocked men like you that
lead us to the concentration camp.

538
00:50:57,881 --> 00:51:02,452
Who are the crusaders of every
blind principle, so-called ideology

539
00:51:02,552 --> 00:51:05,080
humanity invents to strangle me?

540
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,832
Why don't you like me?

541
00:51:06,932 --> 00:51:09,751
Why don't you draw in
the platitude of my love

542
00:51:09,851 --> 00:51:12,963
and pull it all over your life
like a veil?

543
00:51:13,063 --> 00:51:15,132
OK, I like you.

544
00:51:15,232 --> 00:51:19,278
And I can tell you where Anna lives.

545
00:51:21,571 --> 00:51:23,098
Lives?

546
00:51:23,198 --> 00:51:26,894
Only... I don't know the guy's name.

547
00:51:26,994 --> 00:51:29,688
It's impossible. It doesn't make sense.

548
00:51:29,788 --> 00:51:31,106
Why not?

549
00:51:31,206 --> 00:51:34,276
Because you think you've given her
the supreme pleasure?

550
00:51:34,376 --> 00:51:39,548
You with your yin-yang balls
dangling from your zen brain.

551
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:44,203
OK, maybe it does boil down to
a sexual contest, in which case...

552
00:51:44,303 --> 00:51:47,180
I'm sure you win hands down.

553
00:51:48,932 --> 00:51:51,126
- But is that all?
- Nee-Na, nee-Na.

554
00:51:51,226 --> 00:51:53,462
Nee-Na, nee-Na, nee-Na.

555
00:51:55,605 --> 00:51:58,150
I used to be afraid of you.

556
00:51:59,526 --> 00:52:01,136
But I don't think I am any more.

557
00:52:01,236 --> 00:52:04,740
There's nothing to fear except God.

558
00:52:06,658 --> 00:52:08,243
Whatever that means to you.

559
00:52:11,913 --> 00:52:13,790
For me God is a disease.

560
00:52:25,802 --> 00:52:29,873
That's why through the disease
we can reach God.

561
00:52:29,973 --> 00:52:33,293
"Tracking something," said Winnie-the-Pooh
very mysteriously.

562
00:52:33,393 --> 00:52:35,712
"Tracking what?" said Piglet,
coming closer.

563
00:52:35,812 --> 00:52:39,758
"That's just what I ask myself.
I ask myself, What?"

564
00:52:39,858 --> 00:52:41,551
"What do you think you'll answer?"

565
00:52:41,651 --> 00:52:43,737
He wants to say good night to you.

566
00:52:45,364 --> 00:52:46,823
Thank you.

567
00:52:51,203 --> 00:52:53,355
You smell clean.

568
00:52:53,455 --> 00:52:55,624
Do you like Helen?

569
00:52:57,626 --> 00:52:59,236
I think so.

570
00:52:59,336 --> 00:53:01,196
Are you not sure?

571
00:53:01,296 --> 00:53:03,198
Well, I don't know her yet.

572
00:53:03,298 --> 00:53:04,908
Do you like her?

573
00:53:05,008 --> 00:53:07,035
Yes, and who don't you like?

574
00:53:07,135 --> 00:53:10,372
Well, I don't like Heinrich

575
00:53:10,472 --> 00:53:13,500
and I don't like that sailboat.

576
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,102
Why? He's funny.

577
00:53:16,144 --> 00:53:17,729
I don't like...

578
00:53:18,939 --> 00:53:21,650
I don't like Mummy to like him
more than us.

579
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,721
Who's prettier? Mummy or Helen?

580
00:53:25,821 --> 00:53:27,931
Who do you think is prettier?

581
00:53:28,031 --> 00:53:29,433
You tell me.

582
00:53:29,533 --> 00:53:31,410
Our Mummy.

583
00:53:37,749 --> 00:53:39,418
Good night, son.

584
00:53:47,134 --> 00:53:48,927
Thank you.

585
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:53,332
Do you have anyone to help you with him?

586
00:53:53,432 --> 00:53:57,210
Oh it's... It's not a problem. I...

587
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,879
I have plenty of time.

588
00:53:58,979 --> 00:54:02,841
Bob won't say anything to me.
He keeps his words for himself.

589
00:54:02,941 --> 00:54:07,679
He knows everything, senses everything.
Children are amazing.

590
00:54:07,779 --> 00:54:09,264
Yeah.

591
00:54:09,364 --> 00:54:12,951
After lunch we have an hour's rest.

592
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:17,022
Bob very often goes to sleep.

593
00:54:17,122 --> 00:54:20,442
When he does he cries or shouts.

594
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:22,110
Does he do it at home?

595
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:23,670
No.

596
00:54:24,796 --> 00:54:25,864
Oh.

597
00:54:25,964 --> 00:54:28,116
He screams.

598
00:54:28,216 --> 00:54:31,119
It is very difficult to calm him down.

599
00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:34,498
When he wakes up he pretends
that nothing happened.

600
00:54:34,598 --> 00:54:36,558
What can I say?

601
00:54:39,936 --> 00:54:42,506
I'm at war against women.

602
00:54:42,606 --> 00:54:45,092
They... have no foresight.

603
00:54:45,192 --> 00:54:49,196
There's nothing about them that is stable,
there's nothing to trust.

604
00:54:50,697 --> 00:54:52,516
They're dangerous.

605
00:54:52,616 --> 00:54:56,645
There is nothing in common among women
except menstruation.

606
00:54:56,745 --> 00:54:58,313
Excuse me.

607
00:54:58,413 --> 00:55:03,151
I come from a place where evil seems
easier to pinpoint

608
00:55:03,251 --> 00:55:05,904
because you can see it in the flesh.

609
00:55:06,004 --> 00:55:10,992
It becomes people so you know exactly
the danger of being deformed by it.

610
00:55:11,092 --> 00:55:14,579
Which doesn't mean I admire your world.

611
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:19,434
But I find pathetic these stories of women
contaminating the universe.

612
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:22,421
I'm...

613
00:55:22,521 --> 00:55:25,215
I'm one of the contaminated.

614
00:55:25,315 --> 00:55:27,634
Because you never feel free, do you?

615
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:30,904
So sad that for you freedom
seems to mean evil.

616
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,449
And what about lack of freedom?

617
00:55:36,576 --> 00:55:38,245
It's extraordinary.

618
00:55:47,837 --> 00:55:49,464
All right.

619
00:55:50,507 --> 00:55:54,010
Together we can listen if Bob cries out.

620
00:56:18,994 --> 00:56:21,621
You don't have to make love to me.

621
00:56:27,043 --> 00:56:29,296
I'm not trying.

622
00:56:35,844 --> 00:56:37,245
What happened?

623
00:56:37,345 --> 00:56:39,706
I want Mummy! My Mummy!

624
00:56:39,806 --> 00:56:44,127
Mummy! My Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!
It's OK. It's all right.

625
00:56:44,227 --> 00:56:46,963
It's OK. It's all right.
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!

626
00:56:47,063 --> 00:56:49,925
It's all right. It's all right.
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!

627
00:56:52,736 --> 00:56:56,348
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

628
00:56:56,448 --> 00:56:59,659
It's all right. Sh!

629
00:57:10,962 --> 00:57:12,531
I'm sorry.

630
00:57:12,631 --> 00:57:14,841
It wasn't very wise of me.

631
00:57:16,843 --> 00:57:20,013
This makes you think
you've been right all along.

632
00:57:22,724 --> 00:57:24,167
Hello, Bob.

633
00:57:24,267 --> 00:57:26,811
I'm the big boss here.

634
00:57:28,229 --> 00:57:30,899
You're the little boss.

635
00:57:45,872 --> 00:57:50,402
Good morning. I phoned you at home
then I thought I might catch you here.

636
00:57:50,502 --> 00:57:54,197
I didn't tell you where
Bob goes to school.

637
00:57:54,297 --> 00:57:57,242
It wasn't difficult.
We have a minor problem here.

638
00:57:57,342 --> 00:57:58,326
Yes?

639
00:57:58,426 --> 00:58:01,955
The detective who was in charge of tracing
your wife didn't come home last night.

640
00:58:02,055 --> 00:58:03,039
So?

641
00:58:03,139 --> 00:58:06,042
He wasn't at home this morning and
he hasn't reported to the office.

642
00:58:06,142 --> 00:58:07,502
Before we start to get worried...

643
00:58:07,602 --> 00:58:10,714
When was he going to check it?
Yesterday or today?

644
00:58:10,814 --> 00:58:11,798
I don't know.

645
00:58:11,898 --> 00:58:13,383
Please don't misunderstand me.

646
00:58:13,483 --> 00:58:16,761
That detective could've gotten drunk
and spent the night with whores,

647
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:20,098
although that's not much likely.
He could have died of a heart attack

648
00:58:20,198 --> 00:58:23,310
If our detective doesn't show up
by noon I'll have to notify the police.

649
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:26,187
The police will start digging into your
problem. That's how it is.

650
00:58:26,287 --> 00:58:27,939
You and I can claim professional secrecy

651
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:30,400
but you have to give me the address
the detective gave you.

652
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,194
Sebastianstrasse 87, floor 1.

653
00:58:33,294 --> 00:58:35,614
Have you been to that address yourself
or telephoned?

654
00:58:35,714 --> 00:58:37,157
No.
Very sensible of you.

655
00:58:37,257 --> 00:58:38,992
But may I ask why not?

656
00:58:39,092 --> 00:58:42,162
I had the impression that you were
tremendously interested

657
00:58:42,262 --> 00:58:43,430
in finding your wife.

658
00:58:44,472 --> 00:58:46,124
Yes, I was.

659
00:58:46,224 --> 00:58:48,627
I suppose I still am.

660
00:58:48,727 --> 00:58:52,731
But that was out of pure, blind ambition.

661
00:58:53,982 --> 00:58:55,650
And you know something?

662
00:58:56,901 --> 00:59:00,655
I don't feel like there's anything
much ambitious left in me.

663
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:05,618
I see.

664
00:59:08,121 --> 00:59:12,275
So I don't even have to ask you
as a personal favor

665
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:15,545
not to come to the office
until I contact you.

666
00:59:16,963 --> 00:59:18,089
Why?

667
00:59:19,132 --> 00:59:23,370
Precisely because of the...
delicacy of your feelings,

668
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:26,247
you might be able to understand that...

669
00:59:26,347 --> 00:59:30,251
my interest in the case comes
from the fact that I...

670
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:32,437
live with that detective.

671
00:59:36,191 --> 00:59:37,776
I'll be calling.

672
01:00:39,963 --> 01:00:41,614
I have to talk to you.

673
01:00:41,714 --> 01:00:43,675
That's what I guessed.

674
01:00:55,144 --> 01:00:57,255
Have you ever seen this man?

675
01:00:57,355 --> 01:00:59,132
Do I have to answer you?

676
01:00:59,232 --> 01:01:02,302
Well, you have to answer
to someone eventually.

677
01:01:02,402 --> 01:01:04,220
That's too easy.

678
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:08,141
But it's you... or the police, right?

679
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:09,784
Right.

680
01:01:11,995 --> 01:01:13,454
Why?

681
01:01:21,754 --> 01:01:23,923
You're scaring me.

682
01:01:27,051 --> 01:01:29,554
Am I not scared?

683
01:01:38,521 --> 01:01:40,632
Oh yes.

684
01:01:40,732 --> 01:01:42,442
I see.

685
01:01:44,777 --> 01:01:46,971
Darkness is easeful.

686
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:49,866
And the temptation to let go...

687
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:55,288
...promises so much comfort
after the pain.

688
01:02:03,796 --> 01:02:06,007
He's in there.

689
01:03:06,859 --> 01:03:08,569
Mein Gott!

690
01:03:14,617 --> 01:03:16,911
He is very tired.

691
01:03:17,954 --> 01:03:21,457
He made love to me all night.

692
01:03:33,803 --> 01:03:35,955
Emmanuel.

693
01:03:36,055 --> 01:03:38,725
He is still unfinished, you know.

694
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:42,937
Emmanuel!

695
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:24,397
Un... deux... cou-de-pie

696
01:05:24,497 --> 01:05:27,525
Chassé, developpé

697
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:30,820
A' la deuxiéme arabesque.

698
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,239
Tighten your stomach.

699
01:05:33,339 --> 01:05:35,633
Et attitude.

700
01:05:36,968 --> 01:05:39,078
Relevé.

701
01:05:39,178 --> 01:05:42,123
Relevé!

702
01:05:42,223 --> 01:05:44,625
Ach! Knee!

703
01:05:44,725 --> 01:05:47,420
Your foot... Look at your hand.

704
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,756
Tighter stomach.

705
01:05:49,856 --> 01:05:55,178
Your back, up your leg.

706
01:05:55,278 --> 01:05:56,596
Up your knee.

707
01:05:56,696 --> 01:05:58,573
Up your knee.

708
01:05:59,782 --> 01:06:01,434
Look at your hands.

709
01:06:01,534 --> 01:06:03,686
Tighten your stomach.

710
01:06:03,786 --> 01:06:05,396
Your back.

711
01:06:05,496 --> 01:06:07,065
Your foot.

712
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:15,073
Do it. Hold it. Hold it.

713
01:06:15,173 --> 01:06:16,657
Up.

714
01:06:16,757 --> 01:06:18,576
Your knee.

715
01:06:20,887 --> 01:06:22,914
Hold it. Hold it.

716
01:06:23,014 --> 01:06:26,167
Your shoulders down.

717
01:06:26,267 --> 01:06:28,086
Hold it.

718
01:06:28,186 --> 01:06:31,255
Hold. Hold it.

719
01:06:31,355 --> 01:06:33,674
Hold it. Hold it.

720
01:06:33,774 --> 01:06:35,301
Hold it.

721
01:06:38,988 --> 01:06:41,324
More. More.

722
01:06:42,783 --> 01:06:46,395
That's very good! Very, very good.

723
01:06:46,495 --> 01:06:48,064
Very good.

724
01:06:48,164 --> 01:06:50,958
That's very good. Good girl.

725
01:07:00,218 --> 01:07:02,954
From now on she'll know
how much righteous anger

726
01:07:03,054 --> 01:07:05,206
and sheer will she's got in her to say,

727
01:07:05,306 --> 01:07:10,503
"I can do as well. I can be better.
I'm the best."

728
01:07:10,603 --> 01:07:14,132
Only in this case can she
become a success.

729
01:07:14,232 --> 01:07:17,401
Nobody took me there.

730
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,239
That's why I'm with you.

731
01:07:22,365 --> 01:07:25,243
Because you say "I" for me.

732
01:07:26,786 --> 01:07:29,247
Because you say "I" for me.

733
01:07:39,423 --> 01:07:40,867
Yes, I'm thinking about him,

734
01:07:40,967 --> 01:07:44,203
but I recognise the self who has just done
something horrible

735
01:07:44,303 --> 01:07:49,392
like the sister I've casually met
on the street. "Hello, sister."

736
01:07:50,935 --> 01:07:55,131
It's like those two sisters of
Faith and Chance.

737
01:07:55,231 --> 01:07:59,844
It's like those two sisters of
Faith and Chance.

738
01:07:59,944 --> 01:08:04,724
Well, Faith can't exclude Chance
but Chance...

739
01:08:04,824 --> 01:08:06,267
Oh sh...!

740
01:08:06,367 --> 01:08:09,729
Well, it's like those two sisters of
Faith and Chance.

741
01:08:09,829 --> 01:08:14,959
My faith can't exclude chance
but my chance can explain faith.

742
01:08:16,335 --> 01:08:18,863
My faith didn't allow me
to wait for chance

743
01:08:18,963 --> 01:08:21,949
and chance didn't give me
enough faith.

744
01:08:22,049 --> 01:08:23,201
Well...

745
01:08:23,301 --> 01:08:26,370
And then I read that private life
is a stage,

746
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:31,459
only I'm playing in many parts that are
smaller than me and yet I still play them.

747
01:08:31,559 --> 01:08:34,420
I suffer, I believe, I am...

748
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,841
But at the same time I <i>know</i> there's
a third possibility, you know,

749
01:08:38,941 --> 01:08:44,180
like cancer or madness, but cancer
and madness contort reality.

750
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:48,643
The possibility I'm talking about
pierces reality.

751
01:08:48,743 --> 01:08:52,271
Well, I'm unable to say it, maybe,

752
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:57,860
maybe it's impossible to say,
maybe I'm too stupid.

753
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,529
You're looking at me as if you...

754
01:09:00,629 --> 01:09:04,617
You're looking at me as if to tell me
that I need you to fill me up,

755
01:09:04,717 --> 01:09:06,244
as if I'm an empty space.

756
01:09:06,344 --> 01:09:10,623
Well, I love you too but what makes me
go on is to know he'll return

757
01:09:10,723 --> 01:09:15,711
and that I'll make him suffer
and I'll hurt him and I'm betraying him,

758
01:09:15,811 --> 01:09:18,314
but... this brings me small rewards.

759
01:09:19,774 --> 01:09:25,221
Yet I can't exist by myself
because I'm afraid of myself,

760
01:09:25,321 --> 01:09:28,657
because I'm the maker of my own evil.

761
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,243
Because...

762
01:09:32,328 --> 01:09:33,913
Because I'm...

763
01:09:39,126 --> 01:09:42,655
Goodness is only some kind of
reflection upon evil.

764
01:09:42,755 --> 01:09:44,340
That's the way it is.

765
01:09:46,217 --> 01:09:48,719
Ah!

766
01:10:05,861 --> 01:10:07,221
What are you doing?

767
01:10:07,321 --> 01:10:10,491
I'm sorting out his things
to take to the laundry.

768
01:10:16,622 --> 01:10:19,567
I could do it myself.

769
01:10:19,667 --> 01:10:21,569
But it's my job.

770
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:24,363
I'm very good at it.
Very kind of you, but...

771
01:10:24,463 --> 01:10:27,842
Maybe you could do it when Bob is at home.

772
01:10:44,859 --> 01:10:48,721
It's getting... so difficult for you,
isn't it?

773
01:10:48,821 --> 01:10:50,222
You're not as...

774
01:10:50,322 --> 01:10:53,517
You're not as strong or as sure of
yourself as you thought you were

775
01:10:53,617 --> 01:10:55,644
so you keep coming back.

776
01:10:55,744 --> 01:10:58,831
You must be... You must be...

777
01:10:59,915 --> 01:11:01,584
...torn apart.

778
01:11:06,714 --> 01:11:10,176
I can... I can think more clearly now.

779
01:11:12,303 --> 01:11:13,662
I guess...

780
01:11:13,762 --> 01:11:16,056
I guess when you're there...

781
01:11:17,433 --> 01:11:20,269
...you want to be home,
and when you're home...

782
01:11:21,604 --> 01:11:23,647
...you want to be there.

783
01:11:28,777 --> 01:11:31,889
If what you have there is
so strong for you.

784
01:11:31,989 --> 01:11:34,225
If it's what you never had...

785
01:11:34,325 --> 01:11:37,328
stick to it, keep it.

786
01:11:41,457 --> 01:11:44,460
It's very quiet here when you're out.

787
01:11:47,046 --> 01:11:53,285
It was very quiet when you weren't here.

788
01:11:53,385 --> 01:11:59,016
Come over here. Let's just see if we can
sit together peacefully still.

789
01:12:14,365 --> 01:12:15,724
Is it the same there?

790
01:12:15,824 --> 01:12:17,309
No!

791
01:12:17,409 --> 01:12:19,703
Can you tell me now?

792
01:12:21,747 --> 01:12:23,482
I messed everything up.

793
01:12:23,582 --> 01:12:25,192
Even Bob.

794
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:27,987
I've been a cheat, a liar,

795
01:12:28,087 --> 01:12:31,282
completely alone, wounded.

796
01:12:31,382 --> 01:12:34,910
And you think I'm immoral shit.

797
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:40,683
I think so too but not for
the same reasons.

798
01:12:50,025 --> 01:12:53,445
I feel nothing for no-one!

799
01:12:58,158 --> 01:13:02,480
It's as if the two sisters were
too exhausted to fight any more.

800
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:05,983
You know these women wrestling
in an arena of mud

801
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:08,986
with their hands locked
at each other's throats

802
01:13:09,086 --> 01:13:11,780
each waiting to see who will die first.

803
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:15,426
And both staring at me.

804
01:17:48,866 --> 01:17:52,478
What I miscarried there was Sister Faith.

805
01:17:52,578 --> 01:17:56,039
And what was left is Sister Chance.

806
01:17:57,207 --> 01:18:00,527
So I had to take care of my faith

807
01:18:00,627 --> 01:18:03,030
to protect it.

808
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:06,008
And that's what you're doing there?

809
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:08,552
Yes.

810
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,436
You look uglier.

811
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:19,797
You've hardened.

812
01:18:19,897 --> 01:18:22,524
For the first time, you look...

813
01:18:23,692 --> 01:18:25,861
...vulgar to me.

814
01:18:38,206 --> 01:18:41,318
You know, I remember when I was a kid.

815
01:18:41,418 --> 01:18:45,781
Have you ever seen a dying dog,
you know, one of those old dogs

816
01:18:45,881 --> 01:18:49,743
that comes to die under the...
under the porch of the house?

817
01:18:49,843 --> 01:18:51,662
At the last moment,

818
01:18:51,762 --> 01:18:54,723
it... yelps...

819
01:18:55,974 --> 01:18:57,709
...in terror

820
01:18:57,809 --> 01:19:01,188
as if it's seen something real.

821
01:19:05,442 --> 01:19:08,720
I want you to take off the ring
and the wristwatch I gave you

822
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:10,614
last time I came home.

823
01:19:22,918 --> 01:19:25,362
Don't forget to give him his yoghurt.

824
01:19:25,462 --> 01:19:27,047
No.

825
01:19:29,216 --> 01:19:30,676
I have to go.

826
01:19:31,927 --> 01:19:36,164
If I threw myself at your feet and yelped,
would you still walk over me?

827
01:19:36,264 --> 01:19:37,599
Yes.

828
01:19:43,939 --> 01:19:45,883
Hello, this is Anna's husband speaking.

829
01:19:45,983 --> 01:19:47,676
<i>Anna's not here.</i>

830
01:19:47,776 --> 01:19:50,429
<i>I don't have the slightest idea
what's happening to her.</i>

831
01:19:50,529 --> 01:19:52,848
Do you love your son?
<i>Sir!</i>

832
01:19:52,948 --> 01:19:54,725
Tell him that I love him too.

833
01:19:54,825 --> 01:19:58,937
I love everybody and everything.
I accept everything. I have become wise

834
01:19:59,037 --> 01:20:01,440
and profound and good.

835
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:04,568
<i>Do you want to talk to him?
We are just having coffee.</i>

836
01:20:04,668 --> 01:20:06,528
No, I don't want to talk to him. I...

837
01:20:06,628 --> 01:20:10,365
I don't want your coffee to get cold,
either, I certainly love your coffee.

838
01:20:10,465 --> 01:20:16,330
Just tell Heinrich that Anna's address is
Sebastianstrasse 87, first floor.

839
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:19,207
Five, six, seven, sky!

840
01:20:19,307 --> 01:20:21,835
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three...

841
01:20:21,935 --> 01:20:24,546
Madam teacher, my apologies
for being late.

842
01:20:24,646 --> 01:20:26,148
No, it's all right.

843
01:20:27,983 --> 01:20:30,218
Anyway, we were waiting for you.

844
01:20:30,318 --> 01:20:32,821
Thank you. And goodbye, Bob.

845
01:20:57,304 --> 01:20:58,830
What is it?

846
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:00,599
My name.

847
01:21:35,801 --> 01:21:39,162
I respected your wish to be alone,
I thought you needed the time,

848
01:21:39,262 --> 01:21:41,264
but now it's time enough.

849
01:21:42,432 --> 01:21:45,185
Besides, what are you doing here anyway?

850
01:21:46,311 --> 01:21:48,171
Don't resist me.

851
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:50,398
You know I'm stronger than you.

852
01:21:51,483 --> 01:21:54,678
I'm the only one in your life
who has rights on you

853
01:21:54,778 --> 01:21:57,155
because I don't claim any.

854
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:05,539
I brought it from India.

855
01:22:06,706 --> 01:22:10,861
You know, this is what the French poet
Michaux was writing about.

856
01:22:10,961 --> 01:22:13,255
I kept it for you.

857
01:22:14,381 --> 01:22:20,178
With this, love opens to absolutely
unknown horizons.

858
01:22:21,805 --> 01:22:24,916
Absolutely unknown.

859
01:22:25,016 --> 01:22:26,685
Anna.

860
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:32,424
We are made to swim in the center
of the stream.

861
01:22:32,524 --> 01:22:35,235
Not to wait on the dry banks.

862
01:22:37,028 --> 01:22:38,472
Yes.

863
01:22:38,572 --> 01:22:40,557
Exactly.

864
01:22:40,657 --> 01:22:42,993
I showed you the door to God...

865
01:22:44,286 --> 01:22:46,354
...and this door is always open.

866
01:22:46,454 --> 01:22:47,831
Come.

867
01:23:28,705 --> 01:23:30,023
This is a joke.

868
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:45,430
What is it?

869
01:24:09,996 --> 01:24:11,581
Anna!

870
01:24:14,876 --> 01:24:16,336
Anna!

871
01:24:19,464 --> 01:24:24,552
These must be removed.
They are beginning to smell.

872
01:24:31,476 --> 01:24:32,961
This can't be true.

873
01:24:33,061 --> 01:24:36,423
I've got to keep this place
clean and well.

874
01:24:36,523 --> 01:24:37,841
Oh my God!

875
01:24:37,941 --> 01:24:40,218
Are you going to help me?

876
01:24:40,318 --> 01:24:41,970
Heinrich.

877
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:46,491
You are no different from anyone else.

878
01:24:47,701 --> 01:24:50,353
We are all the same

879
01:24:50,453 --> 01:24:52,689
but in different words.

880
01:24:52,789 --> 01:24:55,692
With different bodies,

881
01:24:55,792 --> 01:24:58,195
different versions,

882
01:24:58,295 --> 01:25:00,530
like insects.

883
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:02,240
Meat!

884
01:25:07,345 --> 01:25:09,055
Anna!

885
01:26:24,589 --> 01:26:28,868
Calling all ambulances and fire engines
to the scene of the crash.

886
01:26:28,968 --> 01:26:31,454
And two trucks.

887
01:26:35,975 --> 01:26:37,585
Where?

888
01:26:39,396 --> 01:26:41,464
Can you answer the door, Bob?

889
01:26:41,564 --> 01:26:45,802
Now, listen, Heinrich.
Just stay where you are.

890
01:26:45,902 --> 01:26:48,346
I paid a fortune for the cab.

891
01:26:48,446 --> 01:26:50,140
At the bar at the corner.

892
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:52,225
Bleed for a while.

893
01:26:52,325 --> 01:26:54,519
I'll be there as soon as I can.

894
01:26:54,619 --> 01:26:57,897
My son took the car, an automatic one.

895
01:26:57,997 --> 01:27:01,376
Can you look after Bob till I get back?
What is it?

896
01:27:04,087 --> 01:27:07,132
It's Mummy calling me.

897
01:30:39,636 --> 01:30:42,163
No, not out here.

898
01:30:42,263 --> 01:30:44,265
Go to the toilet.

899
01:30:48,394 --> 01:30:49,879
Need a Tampax?

900
01:30:49,979 --> 01:30:52,799
How can you joke while I'm so hurt.

901
01:30:52,899 --> 01:30:55,927
There are corpses in there,
at least two bodies.

902
01:30:56,027 --> 01:30:59,305
I thought she was pulling my leg,
but no, there's blood.

903
01:30:59,405 --> 01:31:00,807
She cuts them.

904
01:31:00,907 --> 01:31:03,309
A monster, a joke, but it was alive.

905
01:31:03,409 --> 01:31:05,186
You're drunk, Heinrich.

906
01:31:05,286 --> 01:31:06,980
She cuts us to pieces, Mark.

907
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,190
Maybe she just didn't want to see you.

908
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:11,150
Don't joke. I'm not joking.

909
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:13,319
Oh yes, you're not joking,
so what do you want?

910
01:31:13,419 --> 01:31:15,530
Don't you understand?
She's killing people.

911
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:19,075
I understand she's killing people, so why
do you call me and not the police?

912
01:31:19,175 --> 01:31:21,661
She is sick, Mark, doesn't that
mean anything to you?

913
01:31:21,761 --> 01:31:23,454
There are dead bodies there!

914
01:31:23,554 --> 01:31:24,872
I don't believe you.

915
01:31:24,972 --> 01:31:27,750
Maybe you're stoned on
some shit you suck on.

916
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:30,128
Some mushroom you gobble?

917
01:31:30,228 --> 01:31:32,338
Perhaps you did it to yourself.

918
01:31:32,438 --> 01:31:36,467
Maybe you're learning how to suffer.
Now, that would be an achievement.

919
01:31:36,567 --> 01:31:39,304
I feel for people.
You talk for people.

920
01:31:39,404 --> 01:31:42,724
You take their wives.
I take what I want!

921
01:31:42,824 --> 01:31:45,435
And I'm at peace with myself.

922
01:31:45,535 --> 01:31:48,229
Nobody saw me come in. Nobody.

923
01:31:48,329 --> 01:31:51,649
I called you because we have to do
something to help her.

924
01:31:51,749 --> 01:31:52,859
Why?

925
01:31:52,959 --> 01:31:56,321
It isn't normal. It wasn't even human.
It was...

926
01:31:56,421 --> 01:31:58,323
Divine?

927
01:31:58,423 --> 01:32:02,327
Perhaps you met God a moment ago
and you didn't even realize it.

928
01:32:02,427 --> 01:32:05,413
Now, you believe in God, don't you?
Certainly.

929
01:32:05,513 --> 01:32:12,295
In that great incomprehensible God whom
you reached through fucking, or dope.

930
01:32:12,395 --> 01:32:13,713
Am I right?

931
01:32:13,813 --> 01:32:18,009
Look, Mark, that woman is crazy.
We have to do something.

932
01:32:18,109 --> 01:32:19,260
We?

933
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,721
I'm not going to do anything.

934
01:32:21,821 --> 01:32:25,433
I can't leave it this way. It's Anna.
It's murder.

935
01:32:25,533 --> 01:32:27,602
You're not a man, Mark. You're a woman.

936
01:32:27,702 --> 01:32:31,564
All right, if you don't intend to do
anything and want to keep me silent,

937
01:32:31,664 --> 01:32:34,150
you will have to pay.
You have money, I know it.

938
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:38,821
You have to get me out of here, and send
me on a long trip to restore my harmony!

939
01:32:38,921 --> 01:32:43,926
I deserve it!
If you had only seen what I saw!

940
01:33:56,791 --> 01:34:00,778
Heinrich, help me out of here, I'm sick!

941
01:34:00,878 --> 01:34:03,740
I'm the one who is wounded not you.

942
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,424
Please!

943
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:36,958
God's light avenge them,

944
01:35:37,058 --> 01:35:42,271
giving it out clean and
getting it back dirty.

945
01:38:05,873 --> 01:38:08,901
Do you believe in God?

946
01:38:09,001 --> 01:38:11,821
In God?

947
01:38:11,921 --> 01:38:14,423
It's in me.

948
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:40,599
Take me.

949
01:38:40,699 --> 01:38:43,202
Take me.

950
01:39:24,785 --> 01:39:26,729
Did Margie see it?
Yes.

951
01:39:26,829 --> 01:39:30,316
That's why you killed her.
She tried to take it away from me.

952
01:39:30,416 --> 01:39:34,737
Is this faith that helpless?
It needs to be protected.

953
01:39:34,837 --> 01:39:37,006
Like a child.
Yes.

954
01:39:38,757 --> 01:39:45,498
You know, for me, God is still under
the porch, where the dog died.

955
01:39:45,598 --> 01:39:51,045
And on the branch of the eucalyptus tree,
where I'd lie for hours,

956
01:39:51,145 --> 01:39:56,192
and watch how the clouds change
the color of the grass below.

957
01:39:57,443 --> 01:39:58,886
I need money.

958
01:39:58,986 --> 01:40:00,763
I had to leave there.

959
01:40:00,863 --> 01:40:05,309
Oh, I've cleaned all the mess.
I washed the floor, I made the bed.

960
01:40:05,409 --> 01:40:07,186
I didn't know where to go.

961
01:40:07,286 --> 01:40:08,813
It became so unsafe there.

962
01:40:08,913 --> 01:40:11,774
People can't stop trying to
take it away from me.

963
01:40:11,874 --> 01:40:13,275
OK.

964
01:40:13,375 --> 01:40:15,653
Now leave me the car.

965
01:40:15,753 --> 01:40:19,031
Take Margie's keys and go to her place
and wait there.

966
01:40:19,131 --> 01:40:21,217
Can you drive a motorbike?

967
01:40:22,551 --> 01:40:24,161
Heinrich taught me.

968
01:40:24,261 --> 01:40:25,496
It's outside.

969
01:40:25,596 --> 01:40:27,873
Now, I'll take care of Bob and everything.

970
01:40:27,973 --> 01:40:30,751
I'll go to the bank on Monday
and take the money out.

971
01:40:30,851 --> 01:40:34,880
If Bob wakes up, tell him...

972
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:36,649
I Will.

973
01:40:48,535 --> 01:40:52,231
It's only me. Go to sleep.

974
01:40:52,331 --> 01:40:54,316
I have to go.

975
01:40:54,416 --> 01:40:56,527
Please close the door.

976
01:40:56,627 --> 01:40:59,380
Because it's here with you?
Yes.

977
01:42:18,459 --> 01:42:20,694
<i>I'm sorry to disturb you, but...</i>
Yes?

978
01:42:20,794 --> 01:42:25,199
<i>You understand that it is very late,
and Heinrich hasn't called me yet.</i>

979
01:42:25,299 --> 01:42:29,161
<i>He calls me every night so I won't worry
about when he comes home.</i>

980
01:42:29,261 --> 01:42:33,165
Maybe... Maybe he just forgot your number.

981
01:42:33,265 --> 01:42:38,504
<i>No, you don't understand. Mothers always
feel it when their sons are in trouble.</i>

982
01:42:38,604 --> 01:42:40,506
Are you worried...?

983
01:42:40,606 --> 01:42:45,177
Are you worried that he's not there
having sex with my wife?

984
01:42:45,277 --> 01:42:47,054
<i>They should come here.</i>

985
01:42:47,154 --> 01:42:50,599
<i>I've put clean sheets on the bed
and they could have dinner.</i>

986
01:42:50,699 --> 01:42:53,435
Are you quite sure you know
who you are talking to?

987
01:42:53,535 --> 01:42:55,187
<i>I am.</i>

988
01:42:55,287 --> 01:42:57,523
<i>I went there.</i>
Where?

989
01:42:57,623 --> 01:42:59,858
<i>I was worried, you understand.</i>

990
01:42:59,958 --> 01:43:03,279
<i>There isn't any apartment there
under the address you gave me.</i>

991
01:43:03,379 --> 01:43:07,491
<i>There's only a smoking hole that the
police won't allow anybody to come near.</i>

992
01:43:07,591 --> 01:43:11,537
<i>So I went to a bar at the corner
to call home, to find out...</i>

993
01:43:11,637 --> 01:43:14,290
<i>if Heimlich had returned.</i>

994
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:15,874
Yes?

995
01:43:15,974 --> 01:43:18,711
<i>And Heinrich was there.</i>

996
01:43:18,811 --> 01:43:21,380
<i>Nobody could identify him.</i>

997
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,881
Yes?

998
01:43:22,981 --> 01:43:25,092
<i>I recognised his body, of course.</i>

999
01:43:25,192 --> 01:43:28,595
Did you identify him for the police?

1000
01:43:28,695 --> 01:43:33,575
<i>No, it was only Heinrich's body.
But his soul was not there.</i>

1001
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:39,815
Perhaps he and his soul had
parted company before.

1002
01:43:39,915 --> 01:43:42,192
<i>You don't know what you're talking about.</i>

1003
01:43:42,292 --> 01:43:46,071
No, you're quite right. I don't have
any idea what I'm talking about.

1004
01:43:46,171 --> 01:43:49,575
<i>He must have seemed to you better
and more beautiful than you.</i>

1005
01:43:49,675 --> 01:43:53,287
<i>When Anna met him, she immediately
worshipped his soul.</i>

1006
01:43:53,387 --> 01:43:55,622
<i>And you sent him there.</i>

1007
01:43:55,722 --> 01:43:57,875
Now, listen to me.

1008
01:43:57,975 --> 01:44:03,130
I recognise Heinrich's superiority
in every way.

1009
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:08,177
I was proud that Anna accepted him.

1010
01:44:08,277 --> 01:44:11,347
Now Anna has gone missing

1011
01:44:11,447 --> 01:44:14,058
and I'm here,

1012
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:18,312
all alone, you understand,
with our little son.

1013
01:44:18,412 --> 01:44:20,939
Now, I must find her -
maybe it's her fault.

1014
01:44:21,039 --> 01:44:26,795
I'll find her, and I'll force her to tell
me what she's done with Heinrich's soul.

1015
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:32,551
And then I'll come to you and tell you.

1016
01:45:00,287 --> 01:45:01,814
Won't you come up?

1017
01:45:01,914 --> 01:45:02,940
I'm in a rush.

1018
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,233
Is it your wife?

1019
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:05,526
Here.

1020
01:45:05,626 --> 01:45:07,945
Will you promise me something?

1021
01:45:08,045 --> 01:45:09,171
Yes.

1022
01:45:11,298 --> 01:45:12,758
Whatever it is.

1023
01:45:15,469 --> 01:45:17,137
I promise.

1024
01:47:15,172 --> 01:47:17,174
Almost.

1025
01:47:19,843 --> 01:47:21,495
Almost.

1026
01:47:21,595 --> 01:47:23,664
Almost.

1027
01:47:23,764 --> 01:47:25,390
Almost.

1028
01:47:31,146 --> 01:47:32,856
Almost.

1029
01:47:36,151 --> 01:47:38,612
Almost.
Yes.

1030
01:47:46,578 --> 01:47:48,288
Almost.

1031
01:47:50,707 --> 01:47:52,584
Almost.

1032
01:47:59,508 --> 01:48:01,551
Heinrich's dead.

1033
01:48:02,803 --> 01:48:04,037
Isn't he?

1034
01:48:04,137 --> 01:48:05,389
Yes.

1035
01:48:06,682 --> 01:48:08,392
Have you found Anna?

1036
01:48:09,601 --> 01:48:10,894
Yes.

1037
01:48:20,404 --> 01:48:23,348
You come like the angel of death.

1038
01:48:23,448 --> 01:48:25,809
The one who kills.

1039
01:48:25,909 --> 01:48:28,353
I have thought about killing her.

1040
01:48:28,453 --> 01:48:30,038
And now?

1041
01:48:31,331 --> 01:48:32,916
Now I don't know.

1042
01:48:34,751 --> 01:48:38,030
Did you see anything that
made you change your mind?

1043
01:48:38,130 --> 01:48:40,490
I don't know what I saw
but Heinrich saw it too.

1044
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:46,179
And you came to tell me that you don't
know where Heinrich's soul is.

1045
01:48:47,806 --> 01:48:49,224
Yes.

1046
01:48:50,350 --> 01:48:52,728
I can see it in your face.

1047
01:48:54,312 --> 01:48:59,343
It would be good to think that the soul
lives separately from the body.

1048
01:48:59,443 --> 01:49:03,905
That the soul lives for ever
and the body only for a time.

1049
01:49:04,948 --> 01:49:06,950
But it isn't so.

1050
01:49:09,035 --> 01:49:10,687
I don't know any more.

1051
01:49:10,787 --> 01:49:12,247
I do.

1052
01:49:17,711 --> 01:49:21,782
I have to be... on my son's side.

1053
01:49:21,882 --> 01:49:24,342
Even if he has made you unhappy.

1054
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:29,765
I know all there is to know about him.

1055
01:49:31,683 --> 01:49:33,435
That I love him.

1056
01:49:34,728 --> 01:49:36,004
Yes.

1057
01:49:36,104 --> 01:49:39,483
I was wondering which is worse.

1058
01:49:40,609 --> 01:49:42,803
Take away someone's wife,

1059
01:49:42,903 --> 01:49:45,197
hurt a child...

1060
01:49:46,782 --> 01:49:48,700
...or to kill.

1061
01:49:52,954 --> 01:49:56,541
He also had a wife and a child.

1062
01:49:57,876 --> 01:49:59,653
I used to like her.

1063
01:49:59,753 --> 01:50:02,339
I liked your Anna too.

1064
01:50:03,632 --> 01:50:05,884
I had to like both of them...

1065
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:09,621
...since they loved him.

1066
01:50:09,721 --> 01:50:12,557
The world is only what it is.

1067
01:50:24,402 --> 01:50:26,430
Murderous.

1068
01:50:26,530 --> 01:50:28,490
If we are the best of it.

1069
01:50:30,367 --> 01:50:33,203
You don't have to worry about me.

1070
01:50:36,498 --> 01:50:38,750
I don't want to be here...

1071
01:50:40,252 --> 01:50:44,089
...if Heinrich is not around any more.

1072
01:51:44,357 --> 01:51:47,135
That dog didn't die of old age.

1073
01:51:47,235 --> 01:51:50,238
What about you, Mark?

1074
01:51:54,367 --> 01:51:58,438
Our man won't confide or deal with
your successor, he wants you.

1075
01:51:58,538 --> 01:52:01,399
In fact, Mark, there is no successor.

1076
01:52:01,499 --> 01:52:03,819
We can take care of drowning dogs,

1077
01:52:03,919 --> 01:52:06,571
but please help us take care of
the drowning world.

1078
01:52:06,671 --> 01:52:09,908
Don't you think it's uneconomical
to waste yourself on dogs?

1079
01:52:10,008 --> 01:52:12,369
Even dogs you love?

1080
01:52:12,469 --> 01:52:15,388
I met a man who loved everything.

1081
01:52:16,765 --> 01:52:19,000
And he died in a flood of shit.

1082
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:21,878
We know. That's just details.

1083
01:52:21,978 --> 01:52:24,422
When I was a boy...

1084
01:52:24,522 --> 01:52:27,259
I had a dog and his name was Louis.

1085
01:52:27,359 --> 01:52:32,305
When he crawled under the porch to die,
I stayed there with him.

1086
01:52:32,405 --> 01:52:33,573
So what?

1087
01:52:36,701 --> 01:52:41,898
I wanted to see what it was
that made him crawl under there.

1088
01:52:41,998 --> 01:52:44,651
Nobody's a boy any more.

1089
01:52:44,751 --> 01:52:46,753
Must we prove it?

1090
01:53:06,314 --> 01:53:09,192
This is the address.

1091
01:53:30,255 --> 01:53:34,034
Back up, then full speed,
and crash into the police car.

1092
01:53:34,134 --> 01:53:36,386
My pleasure, sir.

1093
01:53:58,408 --> 01:54:00,936
Out of the car!

1094
01:54:01,036 --> 01:54:02,996
Out of the car!

1095
01:56:43,531 --> 01:56:44,741
Anna?

1096
01:56:46,367 --> 01:56:49,412
Run away! Go! Go!

1097
01:57:00,381 --> 01:57:03,176
How could you find me?

1098
01:57:04,219 --> 01:57:06,095
How could I not?

1099
01:57:24,322 --> 01:57:26,266
I wanted to show it to you.

1100
01:57:26,366 --> 01:57:28,785
It is finished now.

1101
01:57:36,042 --> 01:57:37,335
Oh yes.

1102
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:16,642
So hard to live with it. Eh, brother?

1103
01:59:36,329 --> 01:59:38,247
Is there a way out?

1104
01:59:41,125 --> 01:59:42,860
Will you help me?

1105
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:44,545
Yes.

1106
01:59:46,089 --> 01:59:47,924
Take it.

1107
01:59:50,843 --> 01:59:52,929
Shoot them.

1108
02:00:06,818 --> 02:00:10,154
How do you want to finish it?

1109
02:00:37,682 --> 02:00:39,350
Would you open it please?

1110
02:00:40,726 --> 02:00:42,545
Why not, Bob?

1111
02:00:42,645 --> 02:00:44,589
It could be your father.

1112
02:00:44,689 --> 02:00:46,632
Don't open.

1113
02:00:46,732 --> 02:00:48,593
Well, I want to.

1114
02:00:48,693 --> 02:00:50,345
Don't open.

1115
02:00:50,445 --> 02:00:52,221
But I want to.
Don't open.

1116
02:00:52,321 --> 02:00:53,765
Don't open.

1117
02:00:53,865 --> 02:00:55,600
Don't open.

1118
02:00:55,700 --> 02:00:57,435
Don't open.

1119
02:00:57,535 --> 02:00:59,645
Please don't open.

1120
02:00:59,745 --> 02:01:01,147
Don't open it.

1121
02:01:01,247 --> 02:01:02,732
Don't open.

1122
02:01:02,832 --> 02:01:04,359
Don't open it.

1123
02:01:04,459 --> 02:01:05,568
Don't open.

1124
02:01:05,668 --> 02:01:09,030
Don't open. Don't open.

1125
02:01:09,130 --> 02:01:11,949
Don't open. Don't open.

1126
02:01:12,049 --> 02:01:15,453
Don't open. Don't open. Don't open.

1127
02:01:15,553 --> 02:01:18,081
Don't open.

1128
02:01:18,181 --> 02:01:20,291
Don't open. Don't open. Don't open.

1129
02:01:20,391 --> 02:01:22,794
Don't open. Don't open.
