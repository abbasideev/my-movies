- Hello?

31
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:13,427
(TV chatters faintly)

32
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,402
Hello?

33
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,910
(TV chatters faintly)

34
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:32,412

44
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:54,529
- Oh, shit!
- Oh!

45
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,366
- Scared the, scared
the shit out of me.

46
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:05,372
I wasn't expecting
you till seven.

47
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,042
- Yeah. Sorry, I
didn't wanna be late.

48
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:11,311
- It's Gwen, right?

49
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,147
- Yeah. Gwen Taylor.

50
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:15,348
- Right. Teddy.

51
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,652
Teddy Miles. This is my place.

52
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:22,924
I appreciate you saving my
ass on such short notice.

53
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:24,391
- Yeah, of course.

54
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:26,928
- Yeah.

55
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:35,837
(TV chatters faintly)

56
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:43,578
- I noticed the window in
one of the rooms was open.

57
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:46,514
Cabin 18, the wind was
blowing at the door.

58
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:51,586
- Maybe you think you should
get a new quarterback. Geez.

59
00:05:55,388 --> 00:06:00,360
So you just moved
to the area, or?

60
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,462
- Mm-hmm. From Ashford.

61
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,999
It's not too far.

62
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,467
- By yourself, or you
got family around here?

63
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:10,705
- No, I'm on my own.

64
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,640
- Oh.

65
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:17,444
- You said on the phone
that this was a cash job?

66
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,380
- Yes. Straight in your pocket.

67
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,650
Yeah, I mean, hell, if
you take to the job,

68
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:26,854
then maybe we could make it
a regular thing, you know?

69
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:27,889
- Really?

70
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:30,658
Wow, that'd be great.

71
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,628
- Carmen usually works nights,

72
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:37,365
but her kid's been
getting pretty sick.

73
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,767
- Oh. Yeah, that's terrible.

74
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,568
- Yeah.

75
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,937
I would normally
work the double,

76
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:48,109
but I just have this
thing that I can't miss.

77
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:52,113
It is with a girl, so.

78
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:54,348
(head thumps)
(Gwen gasps)

79
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:56,183
- Fucking Yogi, don't
do this to me.

80
00:06:56,217 --> 00:07:00,988
Sorry, that's Yogi.
Yogi, come on.

81
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:02,089
Why would you do this today?

82
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,224
- [Gwen] Oh, here.

83
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,358
- Oh. Hey, thank you.

84
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:05,793
(both grunting)

85
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:09,130
Really gotta get this
thing fixed. Oh my.

86
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:12,033
Oh, heavy. Oh, let's see.

87
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,007
Look, I know it looks as

88
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,576
if the damn Addams family
used to live here,

89
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,078
but trust me, they,
they did not.

90
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,048
They never lived here.
This place is harmless.

91
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:30,584
It actually belonged to my
grandfolks way back when,

92
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:34,522
but we haven't quite
updated it since, so.

93
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:39,360
You know, I got, like,

94
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,662
crazy, crazy plans
for this place.

95
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:44,098
I'm talking some big-ass
plans for this place.

96
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:49,103
I'm just waiting on a
loan approval. Right?

97
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,839
And then as soon as that
comes in, I'm going to,

98
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,476
I'm gonna remodel
Miles Ahead Motel.

99
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,611
What you think?

100
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:59,513
(playful music)

101
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:01,248
- Looks good.

102
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:02,482
- Yeah, it could
be pretty sweet.

103
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,285
It's already got
five stars built in,

104
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,988
so that's covered. (laughs)

105
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:09,657
And hell, who knows?
You know, if business booms,

106
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,093
then maybe get a
franchise out of it.

107
00:08:12,126 --> 00:08:15,096
Like, that'll be, yeah. Yeah.

108
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:18,799
Let me give you the tour.

109
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,239
(ominous music)

110
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,181
And we don't get that many
guests this time of year,

111
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:35,449
truth be told.

112
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:37,651
Mostly folks just passing
through to Denning.

113
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:40,755
(swings creaking)

114
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,592
Now, we got 20 cabins.

115
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,694
All are basically identical.

116
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,533
Okay, so queen bed,

117
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:55,536
mini fridge, phone.

118
00:08:56,137 --> 00:08:57,004
You know, it's not much,

119
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:59,840
but it's a place
to rest your head.

120
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:03,744
And standard-definition
television.

121
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,483
Okay. Let's see.

122
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:13,320
Shower, toilet, all
pretty much standard.

123
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,629
(ominous music)

124
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,564
(Gwen scoffs)

125
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:27,635
So, already cleaned cabin 12,

126
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,237
but eight still
needs some doing.

127
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:32,206
- Okay, cabin eight. Got it.

128
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,276
- Right. You need me to
show you the ropes, or?

129
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,811
- I think I can handle it.

130
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:41,516
I did notice, however, that
you don't do a French fold.

131
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,751
- A French what? (laughs)

132
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,487
(gentle whimsical music)

133
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:48,689
- If we drape the banding back,

134
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,891
the finished side
will be exposed.

135
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,694
Not only will the bed
look more comfortable,

136
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,864
but the guests will feel the
softness when they climb in.

137
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,833
- Well, shit, now I want
to jump in that thing.

138
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,768
I wanna take a nap right now.

139
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:04,238
- Yeah. My mom used
to work in motels.

140
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,974
I used to help her out
after school sometimes.

141
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:14,715
- Okay, here we have
the supply room.

142
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:18,252
Oh, don't forget
to use this brick.

143
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,654
Now, the door only
opens from the outside,

144
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:22,823
and this brick will keep
you from getting locked in.

145
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:24,892
It is very, very important.

146
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,661
(Teddy groans)

147
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:36,137
Okay. So linens are kept
up here, towels down below.

148
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,974
More cleaning supplies above
the washer-dryer combo.

149
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:44,979
Fuse box right over
here. What else?

150
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:52,153
Just give me a second, okay?

151
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,955
(crickets chirping)

152
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,162
(ominous music)

153
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,207
(ominous music continues)

154
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:26,120
(ominous music continues)

155
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:39,099
(ominous music continues)

156
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:52,446
(ominous music continues)

157
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,983
Sinkhole last summer.

158
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,218
Been on the phone
with the county

159
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:59,621
for months trying to
get them to close it.

160
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:02,022
Assholes are finally
coming this weekend.

161
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:05,092
- I've never seen one before.

162
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,329
- Yeah. Sucked all the
water in the damn ground.

163
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:11,832
Luckily, nobody
was swimming in it.

164
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,802
(ominous music)

165
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:30,351
- Teddy, how come
cabin 13 is only 45.50?

166
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:33,320
That's half the price
of the other rooms.

167
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:36,056
- Oh, superstition.

168
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:37,925
- You can't be serious.

169
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,527
- It's the same reason
why flights are cheaper

170
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:40,729
on Friday the 13th,

171
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,864
or animal shelters are
overrun with black cats.

172
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,800
People are fucking stupid.
They will believe anything.

173
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,035
Have you eaten?

174
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,804
- Not yet.

175
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,474
- Well, Postmates don't
come out this far,

176
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:55,876
and the wifi is a little janky,

177
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,812
but if you're in the
mood for some killer pho.

178
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,082
- It's pho-king delicious.

179
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,818
- Yeah, it's the best
Vietnamese in town.

180
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,522
It's the only Vietnamese
in town. Yeah.

181
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:12,159
So, I do believe that is,
that's everything.

182
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:18,999
- I have to ask.

183
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,904
What kind of security
do you have here?

184
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,573
(ominous music)

185
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:26,641
- Security?

186
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:29,476
Oh, we have, I mean,

187
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:31,278
we have a monitor on the desk.

188
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,050
- Oh. I mean, protection.

189
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:41,855
This hotel is a ways out, and
I'm a woman alone at night.

190
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,124
What if I get some
asshole guest?

191
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:48,228
- Oh, just call the police.

192
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:51,165
- Yeah and wait, what, 30
minutes if they even show?

193
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,167
- Well, if you want,

194
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,803
there's a fire ax next
to the vending machine.

195
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:55,936
Nobody's gonna mess with you

196
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:56,970
if you swinging that
thing around,

197
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,339
you know what I'm saying?

198
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,608
They might call the
police on you, so.

199
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,245
Okay, Gwen.

200
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,382
Relax, okay?

201
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:11,519
I know it seems a little
spooky, but trust me,

202
00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:12,953
I haven't had any trouble here,

203
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,855
and neither has Carmen.

204
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,090
But I tell you what,

205
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:19,561
if you feel unsafe or
threatened in any way,

206
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:21,261
there's a deadbolt
in the parlor.

207
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,931
Just lock yourself
in there and then,

208
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:27,101
you know, just call me, okay?

209
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:28,402
(Gwen sighs)

210
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,573
Trust me, Gwen,
you're gonna be fine.

211
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:37,411
(rats scuttering)

212
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:43,984
- Is that rats?

213
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,320
- Hmm.

214
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:49,356
Tell me that's not rats.

215
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:52,594
- Oh, no, that's not rats.

216
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:57,732
(rats scuttering)

217
00:14:57,766 --> 00:15:00,735
Okay, that's rats. That is rats.

218
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,302
Okay, I'll tell you what.

219
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:06,373
Pho is on me, okay?

220
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:09,443
(gentle whimsical music)

221
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:12,680
You ain't gonna eat that much
pho, so I'll just take this.

222
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:18,252
Whew, it's chilly tonight.

223
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,423
Okay, Gwen, I will see
you in the morning.

224
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:23,991
7:00 A.M. okay?

225
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:29,564
And Gwen, welcome
to the night shift.

226
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,101

(knocks on door)

233
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,056
- Ms. Marsh.

234
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:35,697
Ms. Marsh?

235
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,332
(ominous music)

236
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:48,275
(ominous music continues)

237
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,979
My name is Gwen. I just
started the night shift.

238
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,748
I'm taking over for
Mr. Miles, the manager.

239
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,556
You're just staying the
one night, is that correct?

240
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:05,560
(door opening)

241
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,567
Hi. I just wanted to make
sure you were all right.

242
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,770
Do you need anything?
Fresh towels, perhaps?

243
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:18,640
- No.

244
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,241
- Okay.

245
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:26,079
Well, if you change your
mind, just give me a call.

246
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,315
I'll be in the office
most of the night.

247
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:33,186

261
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:21,228
Oh my God.

262
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:23,831
Gross.

263
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,767

264
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,770

265
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:39,681
Ew. Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

266
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:45,620
Ew.

267
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:49,924

Sorry to keep you waiting.

I don't think I'm

286

The one with the pork.

Yeah. And not too spicy, please.

- Excuse me.

340
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:53,207
This is broken. Are you okay?

341
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,776
(Gwen pants)

342
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:58,012

(ominous music)

344
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:13,727
- There's gotta be
one in here somewhere.

345
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:17,932
You have to excuse me. It's
my first night working here.

346
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:19,266
- Oh, no, that's fine.

347
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,403
You said your name
was Gwen, right?

348
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:23,437
- Mm-hmm.

349
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,838
- Well, I'm Alice.

350
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:34,448
What did you see in there?

351
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:37,017
- What?

352
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:39,887
- In the cabin. Number 13.

353
00:28:41,322 --> 00:28:46,961
- Oh. Yeah, I've barely
slept in nearly 20 hours.

354
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:49,763
I literally just moved
here and started this job,

355
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:52,900
and my mind is pretty
scattered right now.

356
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:54,735
And with this place
looking the way it does,

357
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:57,471
the taxidermy and the old pipes,

358
00:28:57,505 --> 00:28:58,739
I, um...

359
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:05,746
I thought I was hearing
things, seeing things.

360
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:10,652
- That's a shame. I do
love a good ghost story.

361
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:14,255
Listen, I hope I didn't
come off as rude earlier

362
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:15,055
when you knocked.

363
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:17,626
I was a little upset.
- Yes!

364
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:19,594
Found one.
- Oh, great. Thanks.

365
00:29:19,628 --> 00:29:21,195
- No, no, no!

366
00:29:21,862 --> 00:29:25,299
Oh, shit. It's locked.

367
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:28,035
- Wait, what? Don't you
have a key or something?

368
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:29,303
- No.

369
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:33,374
It can only open up
from the outside.

370
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:36,043
We're stuck.

371
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:41,750
- Hey! Help us!

372
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,150
Someone help us!
We're locked in here!

373
00:29:43,183 --> 00:29:44,686
Let us out!
- No one else is staying

374
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:47,354
at the motel, no
one can hear us.

375
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:48,556
- Fuck.

376
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:51,225
- Wait, do you have
your phone on you?

377
00:29:51,258 --> 00:29:53,193
- No. That's why I
needed the dryer.

378
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:56,163
It fell in the fucking sink
when I was dyeing my hair.

379
00:29:57,732 --> 00:29:59,900
What time does your
manager come back?

380
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:02,102
- 7:00 A.M.

381
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:09,810
(ominous music)

382
00:30:09,843 --> 00:30:11,812
- [Alice] Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

383
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:14,348
- [Gwen] Hey, hey,
hey! It's okay.

384
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:16,417
- No, I'm claustrophobic.

385
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:20,020
- Okay. Just, just calm down.

386
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:22,089
Just breathe.

387
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:23,157
- [Alice] No. Ah, what is that?

388
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,559
There's somebody else in here.

389
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:25,893
- [Gwen] There's nobody in here.

390
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:27,428
- [Alice] No, no, no. There's
somebody else in here.

391
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:28,395
I felt something thing.

392
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:31,398
(ominous music)

393
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:34,034
(tense music)

394
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:38,138
(Alice yelping)

395
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:42,476
- Okay, stay behind me.

396
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:47,481
(Alice screams)

397
00:30:47,515 --> 00:30:48,717
- You all order the pho?

398
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,818
- Hey, let us out of here!

399
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,785
- What?

400
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:52,186
- [Gwen] Open the fucking door.

401
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:58,292
(Alice and Gwen panting)

402
00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:01,929
- Ah, shit.

403
00:31:04,498 --> 00:31:05,834
- What?

404
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,468
- I got you the wrong order.

405
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:13,842
- Mm. What was this one?

406
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,175
Pork?

407
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:18,011
- I don't know what it
is, but it's delicious.

408
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:20,981
- Thank you, for the food.

409
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:21,982
- Are you kidding?

410
00:31:22,015 --> 00:31:23,384
Mr. Miles paid, and he owes us

411
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:24,619
after the shit we just
went through.

412
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:25,820
(Alice laughs)

413
00:31:25,854 --> 00:31:27,722
How he has managed to
keep this place open,

414
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:29,456
I will never know.

415
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,024
- Hmm.
(Gwen chuckles)

416
00:31:33,427 --> 00:31:34,461
- So why red?

417
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:38,499
- Uh...

418
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:42,302
It's my mom. She never
lets me do anything.

419
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:46,140
Dye my hair, go to parties,
watch horror movies.

420
00:31:48,676 --> 00:31:51,145
We got in this big
argument. I left.

421
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:53,648
Doesn't really know where I am.

422
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:56,216
- You ran away from home.

423
00:31:57,151 --> 00:31:58,653
- Well, I'm not going back.

424
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:02,289
- Where's home, your mom?

425
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:04,258
- Umm...

426
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:05,627
Denning.

427
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:08,495
Yeah. No, it's a shithole.

428
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:12,132
Yeah, it's so boring.

429
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:16,036
- Alice, I know you
don't want to hear this,

430
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:17,971
but your mom is just
trying to look out for you.

431
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:20,107
- Oh.
- She must be worried sick.

432
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,910
- No, no, no, no.
You don't know her.

433
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:23,310
She's a bitch.

434
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:24,978
One time, Hobie Kittredge
gave me a hickey,

435
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:27,381
and she like, grounded
me for a month.

436
00:32:27,414 --> 00:32:29,049
(Gwen scoffs)

437
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:31,285
- Yeah, my mom was the same way.

438
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:35,088
She was tough as hell
on me, super strict.

439
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:38,459
My younger sisters, they got
away with it, but not me.

440
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:42,496
But family matters.

441
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:48,903
Listen, Alice,

442
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:50,070
(ominous music)

443
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:53,608
it's dangerous to be
on the road by yourself.

444
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:55,577
The world can be a scary place.

445
00:32:56,945 --> 00:32:59,581
There are bad people out
there doing bad things.

446
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,056
Anyway, I just think
you should reconsider

447
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:11,158
what you're doing.
That's all.

448
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,630
My mom, she passed
away a while ago,

449
00:33:15,663 --> 00:33:16,997
but I still miss her.

450
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:23,538
- Yeah, think, she's probably
trying to reach me now.

451
00:33:32,547 --> 00:33:34,248
- Do you want a Coke?

452
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:36,250
(Alice chuckles)
- Fuck yeah.

453
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,492
(engine roaring)

454
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,435
(ominous music)

455
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:08,181
(ominous music continues)

456
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,362
(ominous music continues)

457
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:34,509
(ominous music continues)

458
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:36,376
(door slams)

459
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:47,555
(ominous music continues)

460
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:52,125
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus.

461
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,061
- Sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

462
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:54,261
- No, it's okay.

463
00:34:54,294 --> 00:34:58,032
Sorry, I'm just a little
spooked from the rats.

464
00:34:58,066 --> 00:34:59,534
- Oh, yeah. Here, no,
let me help you out.

465
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:00,768
- It's okay. Don't worry.
- No, it's okay.

466
00:35:00,802 --> 00:35:01,936
It's really no bother.
- It's okay. It's fine.

467
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,170
I said I got it.

468
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:07,542
I don't want you
to cut yourself.

469
00:35:12,013 --> 00:35:14,448
- Well, thank you
for dinner again.

470
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:17,685
I'm gonna go and try
this out on my phone.

471
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:20,822
See if I can get it to work.

472
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:23,190
- Yeah, good idea.

473
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:30,364
(door creaking)

474
00:35:34,669 --> 00:35:35,670
Alice.

475
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:42,877
Don't forget to lock
your door, okay?

476
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:45,980
- Yeah, always.

477
00:35:46,014 --> 00:35:48,750
(ominous music)

478
00:35:57,725 --> 00:36:01,328
(ominous music continues)

479
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:06,801
(bell dings)

480
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,642
(door thuds)

481
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,485
(ominous music)

482
00:36:27,155 --> 00:36:28,623
(head thuds)

483
00:36:28,656 --> 00:36:29,657
- Fuck.

484
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,562
Goddammit, Yogi.

485
00:36:36,097 --> 00:36:39,332
(gentle whimsical music)
(Gwen groaning)

486
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:43,303
What the fuck.

487
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:46,841
(gentle whimsical music)
(Gwen groaning)

488
00:36:50,712 --> 00:36:52,914
(Gwen breathing heavily)

489
00:36:52,947 --> 00:36:55,850
(engine roaring)

490
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:58,619
(ominous music)

491
00:37:01,354 --> 00:37:04,458
(door creaking and closing)

492
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:10,998
(ominous music continues)

493
00:37:20,474 --> 00:37:25,847
- [Birdie] Jesus Christ. Warn,
look at this dump! (laughs)

494
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,415
- Welcome to The All Tucked
Inn, how may I help you?

495
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:32,086
- Dead birds. Dead
fucking birds.

496
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,386
I told you, didn't I say so?

497
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,759
- You totally did.
(gasps) Oh my God.

498
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:41,162
- Ma'am. Ma'am, please
don't touch that.

499
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:42,997
- She can touch
whatever she wants.

500
00:37:44,665 --> 00:37:49,704
Hi. Now, we would like
your very best room.

501
00:37:49,737 --> 00:37:52,607
(bell dinging)

502
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,642
We just escaped
a gallery showing

503
00:37:54,675 --> 00:37:57,779
that was absolutely
fucking rudimentary,

504
00:37:57,812 --> 00:37:59,614
and we want to still
enjoy ourselves

505
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:01,983
so this night is
not a total waste.

506
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:03,518
- My idea, of course.

507
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:05,385
Let's stop in a seedy
motel just like they do

508
00:38:05,418 --> 00:38:06,788
in the movies!

509
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:07,855
(Warner and Birdie laugh)

510
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:10,625
- Sure. How long would
you like to stay?

511
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:14,028
- I guess, I don't know.
We'll stay for the full hour.

512
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:15,395
- You'll only need 10 minutes.

513
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:17,265
- Birdie, play nice.

514
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:19,667
(Birdie growls)
(Warner scowls)

515
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,637
- Sir, this isn't that
kind of establishment.

516
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,304
We don't rent rooms by the hour.

517
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:25,540
But if you'd like,

518
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:27,508
I could book you into
a cabin for the night.

519
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:32,513
- Oh my God. Wait, are
you fucking kidding me?

520
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,948
Don't...

521
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:37,350
Don't tell me people actually
sleep in this shithole.

522
00:38:40,453 --> 00:38:44,559
- It's a nightly charge,
sir. 91 even per room.

523
00:38:44,592 --> 00:38:46,761
- Oh my God, we have
the cash, Warn.

524
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:48,129
Just pay the girl.

525
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:50,397
- It's not about
the money, Birdie.

526
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,433
So are you really telling me

527
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:57,071
that you will not rent
us a room for an hour?

528
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,909
- I can't. It's against policy.

529
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:04,444
- My God. Shit.

530
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:11,185
How does this fucking
dump even stay open? God.

531
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:13,521
What kind of salary do they
even have you on here, huh?

532
00:39:13,554 --> 00:39:15,823
- Easy, Warn. Come on.

533
00:39:17,225 --> 00:39:19,927
- Look at her. Hey,
mm-mm, look at her.

534
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:20,962
Look at my wife.

535
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:26,334
She is a fucking goddess.

536
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:31,038
Do you think I would
ever let her sleep

537
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,507
in this disease-ridden pigsty?

538
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:37,311
Hmm? This shit
stain for a motel?

539
00:39:37,345 --> 00:39:41,481
I mean, people have
probably died here, right?

540
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:42,717
Been murdered.

541
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,489
- Like I said, it's
91 even per room.

542
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:55,730
- Fine, just say what you
want. What do you want?

543
00:39:55,763 --> 00:39:57,632
Do you want 100? There's 100.

544
00:39:57,665 --> 00:40:00,334
Fine. You know what, why
don't you just take 200.

545
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:01,903
- Like I said, it's just $91.

546
00:40:01,936 --> 00:40:03,271
- [Warner] Why don't
you take 300, right?

547
00:40:03,304 --> 00:40:06,107
350, 4, huh? 400.

548
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,375
- Sir, please stop.

549
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:11,779
- Jesus Christ! Just give
me my fucking room key.

550
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:14,548
(ominous music)

551
00:40:22,924 --> 00:40:23,925
- Room two.

552
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,995
Would you like me to
show you where it is?

553
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:29,664
(Warner groans)

554
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:31,999
- Let me guess, it's
between one and three.

555
00:40:35,236 --> 00:40:37,437
Then I think we'll
manage, won't we?

556
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:41,275
- [Birdie] Warn.
- [Warner] What, baby?

557
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:43,778
- I got glass in my Prada.

558
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:44,879
- Oh.

559
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:49,550
- Fuck. There's shards of
glass all over the floor.

560
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:50,851
- All right, come on, come
on, come on. Let's go, baby.

561
00:40:50,885 --> 00:40:53,120
Here we go. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

562
00:40:53,154 --> 00:40:54,355
(Birdie laughs)

563
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:57,658
- Sorry, I just, I need you
to sign the registration book.

564
00:40:58,726 --> 00:41:02,196
- Yeah, well, fuck you
and your stupid book.

What's wrong?

(Gwen gasping)

610
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,281
Gwen.

611
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,889
Okay. What'll it be?

612
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:58,492
Russia, Ireland, or Jamaica?

613
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,894
- Whatever's strongest.

614
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,835
Thanks.

615
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:09,069

Oh.

617
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:20,481
You saw something
again, didn't you?

618
00:46:22,016 --> 00:46:23,951
In the pool. What'd you see?

619
00:46:25,687 --> 00:46:27,421
What'd you see?

620
00:46:29,256 --> 00:46:30,257
- I...

621
00:46:32,527 --> 00:46:33,628
I--

622
00:46:33,662 --> 00:46:35,462
- You know this place
is haunted, right?

623
00:46:37,398 --> 00:46:38,399
- What?

624
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:40,568
- Yeah, it's like,

625
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:44,004
one of the most haunted
locations in the state.

626
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:48,242
It's actually like, part of
the reason why I came here.

627
00:46:49,076 --> 00:46:50,210
It's notorious, really.

628
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:51,979
I heard like, a
shit ton of stories.

629
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:55,449
I just wanted see if they
were true, you know.

630
00:46:56,785 --> 00:46:59,286
(Alice chuckles)

631
00:47:01,388 --> 00:47:03,390
(Gwen sighs)
Shit.

632
00:47:03,424 --> 00:47:05,392
- Jesus Christ.

633
00:47:07,428 --> 00:47:11,231
(Birdie and Warner laughing)

634
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,335
- [Birdie] Stop!

635
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:18,540
- [Warner] All right,
hold on. (laughs)

636
00:47:18,573 --> 00:47:19,574
Oh.

637
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:25,580
- Alice.

638
00:47:27,481 --> 00:47:28,482
- Yeah?

639
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:33,588
- Have you seen a
strange car lurking

640
00:47:33,621 --> 00:47:35,189
around the motel tonight?

641
00:47:36,725 --> 00:47:38,526
- Lurking. What do you mean?

642
00:47:43,997 --> 00:47:46,634
(somber music)

643
00:47:50,971 --> 00:47:52,339
Gwen, are you okay?

644
00:47:52,373 --> 00:47:55,075
(somber music)

645
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:02,617
- When I was your age,

646
00:48:05,854 --> 00:48:11,058
a man named Walton
Grey, a loner,

647
00:48:12,594 --> 00:48:14,128
broke into our house.

648
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:19,567
He killed my mom and my sisters,

649
00:48:20,635 --> 00:48:23,971
and he tried to kill me.

650
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:30,177
I was the only
one that survived.

651
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,211
- Jesus.

652
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,415
- They caught him,

653
00:48:34,448 --> 00:48:36,950
and they locked him
away in an institute,

654
00:48:36,984 --> 00:48:41,422
but two days ago, he escaped.

655
00:48:42,857 --> 00:48:44,057
- Are you serious?

656
00:48:47,595 --> 00:48:50,164
- I found this in my mailbox.

657
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,602
It's a necklace my mom gave me.

658
00:48:55,804 --> 00:48:59,206
It went missing the night
Walton Grey killed my family.

659
00:49:01,676 --> 00:49:04,445
I always believed
that he took it.

660
00:49:05,847 --> 00:49:07,047
- Holy shit.

661
00:49:08,716 --> 00:49:10,484
- I was so scared, Alice.

662
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:16,658
I just, I left. I ran.

663
00:49:19,727 --> 00:49:21,094
But he's followed me.

664
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:23,865
I saw him.

665
00:49:23,898 --> 00:49:26,366
- What you've seen him? Tonight?

666
00:49:27,836 --> 00:49:30,605
- Twice, outside.

667
00:49:33,842 --> 00:49:36,611
- Gwen, are you sure it was him?

668
00:49:36,644 --> 00:49:39,714
Because you said you haven't
been sleeping a lot lately.

669
00:49:39,747 --> 00:49:43,518
- I don't know. I think so.

670
00:49:46,053 --> 00:49:47,522
I don't know what
I'm seeing here.

671
00:49:47,555 --> 00:49:51,860
This place is just
so fucking strange.

672
00:49:51,893 --> 00:49:54,161
- Yeah, yeah. No shit.

673
00:49:56,396 --> 00:49:58,700
Look, I think you
should call the police.

674
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:02,604
You know, for your
own safety at least.

675
00:50:06,106 --> 00:50:09,343
- Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

676
00:50:12,379 --> 00:50:14,749
Alice, I need you to
do something for me.

677
00:50:21,288 --> 00:50:23,558
I want you to keep this
door locked, just in case,

678
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:26,293
and I want you to stay
inside, all right?

679
00:50:26,326 --> 00:50:29,096
- Yeah, of course. You got it.

680
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:31,699
Gwen?

681
00:50:33,535 --> 00:50:34,903
I, um...

682
00:50:34,936 --> 00:50:36,771
I thought about what you said,

683
00:50:36,804 --> 00:50:40,942
and I'm going home
in the morning,

684
00:50:40,975 --> 00:50:42,175
back to my mom's.

685
00:50:43,978 --> 00:50:45,513
Family matters, right?

686
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:52,887

Gwen, slow down.

717
00:54:29,003 --> 00:54:31,105
Okay. What happened?

718
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:35,109

was fucking haunted, Teddy.

- [Teddy] <i>What? Haunted?</i>

720
00:54:36,711 --> 00:54:38,746
- Don't play dumb
with me, asshole.

721
00:54:39,614 --> 00:54:40,715
I'm...

722
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:43,651
I'm seeing things.

723
00:54:43,684 --> 00:54:45,720
Ghosts, Teddy.

724
00:54:45,753 --> 00:54:47,789
- Oh God, Gwen.

725
00:54:47,822 --> 00:54:50,992
<i>Okay. Is the place a</i>
<i>little fucking old?</i>

726
00:54:51,025 --> 00:54:54,061
I'll give you that. Is
the place a little spooky?

727
00:54:54,095 --> 00:54:55,530
Sure.
- A little?

728
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:57,698
- Look Gwen, what I'm
trying to say is,

729
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:00,635
Gwen, it's not haunted, okay?

730
00:55:00,668 --> 00:55:01,636
It's just not.

731
00:55:02,435 --> 00:55:06,808
- You're telling
me, swear to God,

732
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:09,911
that you've never seen
anything at this motel.

733
00:55:09,944 --> 00:55:11,311
- No. Uh-uh.

734
00:55:11,344 --> 00:55:14,048
- Swear to God, Teddy,

735
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:16,784
you've never seen anything?

736
00:55:16,818 --> 00:55:18,385
<i>- Nothing, Gwen.</i>

737
00:55:18,418 --> 00:55:21,255
Nothing, I run a clean
ghost-free establishment.

738
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:24,292
If there were ghosts,
I would know about it.

739
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:26,459
Don't be ridiculous.

740
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:28,095
- You're lying to me.

741
00:55:28,129 --> 00:55:29,362
- I'm not lying. I swear.

742
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:30,565
<i>- You know what,</i>

743
00:55:30,598 --> 00:55:32,200
this place is a fucking
horror show, Teddy.

744
00:55:32,233 --> 00:55:33,734
I should sue your ass.

745
00:55:33,768 --> 00:55:34,569
I got...

746
00:55:34,602 --> 00:55:37,505
I got fucking
ghosts, I got rats,

747
00:55:37,538 --> 00:55:40,942
I got a weird sex couple
wearing bird masks.

748
00:55:40,975 --> 00:55:43,211
- Okay, I don't know
nothing about no bird masks.

749
00:55:43,244 --> 00:55:45,313
- I'm not coming back.
Teddy, you hear me?

750
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:46,714
This is my last goddamn shift.

751
00:55:46,747 --> 00:55:48,783
- Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, come on now.

752
00:55:48,816 --> 00:55:49,617
- I am done.

753
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:50,818
- Don't do that.
Don't do that, Gwen.

754
00:55:50,852 --> 00:55:51,719
- See your ass at seven.

755
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:53,821
<i>- Gwen, don't. Gwen, don't do--</i>

756
00:56:05,299 --> 00:56:08,202
(Gwen sighs)

757
00:56:08,236 --> 00:56:10,805
(bell dings)

758
00:56:10,838 --> 00:56:13,541
(ominous music)

759
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,453
(ominous music continues)

760
00:56:30,558 --> 00:56:32,093
- [Visitor] Hello?

761
00:56:32,126 --> 00:56:34,829
(Gwen breathes deeply)

762
00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:37,231
(door creaks and closes)

763
00:56:37,265 --> 00:56:39,399
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

764
00:56:41,802 --> 00:56:42,937
I was--

765
00:56:43,504 --> 00:56:46,507
(ominous music)

766
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:48,976
- I'd like a room.

767
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,746
(ominous music)

768
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:02,623
- How long would
you like to stay?

769
00:57:05,492 --> 00:57:10,430
- One night. Been a long drive.

770
00:57:10,463 --> 00:57:13,167
(ominous music)

771
00:57:20,508 --> 00:57:22,843
Don't I recognize
you from someplace?

772
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:28,149
- I don't think so.

773
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:34,922
- Hmm. You must have
one of those faces.

774
00:57:38,225 --> 00:57:40,227
- That's what people
keep telling me.

775
00:57:47,802 --> 00:57:49,937
It'll be 91 for the night.

776
00:57:52,406 --> 00:57:53,607
- Cheap.

777
00:57:57,511 --> 00:57:58,779
Really cheap.

778
00:58:02,216 --> 00:58:05,086
(visitor humming)

779
00:58:05,653 --> 00:58:09,223
(ominous music)

780
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:17,164
Here.

781
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:20,500
91.

782
00:58:23,637 --> 00:58:26,574
(ominous music)

783
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:36,250
- Why don't I put you in...

784
00:58:39,553 --> 00:58:41,789
(key rattles)

785
00:58:43,124 --> 00:58:44,558
Cabin 12?

786
00:58:52,933 --> 00:58:54,935
(ominous music)

787
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:57,171
- Are you gonna
show me to my room?

788
00:59:02,143 --> 00:59:03,144
- Yes, certainly.

789
00:59:08,883 --> 00:59:13,587
Actually, why don't I put you

790
00:59:13,621 --> 00:59:15,589
in cabin eight?

791
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,563
It's just been freshly turned.

792
00:59:25,499 --> 00:59:27,868
- Sure. Sounds good.

793
00:59:33,307 --> 00:59:36,043
(ominous music)

794
00:59:44,118 --> 00:59:45,586
(door creaks open)

795
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:49,223
(ominous music continues)

796
00:59:53,461 --> 00:59:55,362
(door closes)

797
00:59:58,732 --> 01:00:02,336
(ominous music continues)

798
01:00:11,479 --> 01:00:14,181
(key rattles)

799
01:00:18,886 --> 01:00:23,824
- Here we are. Queen bed.

800
01:00:23,858 --> 01:00:26,894
There's a mini fridge.

801
01:00:28,896 --> 01:00:31,132
There's a phone
on the desk there.

802
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:38,939
(door slams)

803
01:00:45,246 --> 01:00:47,114
- I didn't catch your name.

804
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:52,019
What did you say it was?

805
01:01:01,295 --> 01:01:02,296
- The towels.

806
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:06,000
I just need to make sure
you have clean towels.

807
01:01:07,569 --> 01:01:10,271
(ominous music)

808
01:01:27,288 --> 01:01:30,090
(sinister music)

809
01:01:36,897 --> 01:01:40,301
(tense sinister music)

810
01:01:42,136 --> 01:01:45,005
(visitor groaning)

811
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:47,808
- Oh, fuck.

812
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,151
Gwen, don't you know who I am?

813
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:02,089
- You're Walton Grey.

814
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,964
- My name is Raymond Bailey.

815
01:02:12,132 --> 01:02:13,167
I'm your doctor.

816
01:02:16,571 --> 01:02:17,905
- What?

817
01:02:20,441 --> 01:02:22,943
- You've been under my care

818
01:02:22,977 --> 01:02:27,481
at Ashford Psychiatric
Facility for 12 years.

819
01:02:31,085 --> 01:02:34,088
Two nights ago, you escaped.

820
01:02:34,855 --> 01:02:37,391
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

821
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:39,793
No, you're lying.

822
01:02:41,862 --> 01:02:46,267
You are Walton Grey, and
you killed my family.

823
01:02:48,836 --> 01:02:50,037
- No, Gwen.

824
01:02:51,405 --> 01:02:54,108
You, killed your family.

825
01:02:54,643 --> 01:02:57,378
(ominous music)

826
01:03:06,688 --> 01:03:09,156
(ominous music continues)

827
01:03:09,189 --> 01:03:11,492
Do you remember
what you told me?

828
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:16,397
Huh? How they mistreated you?

829
01:03:17,831 --> 01:03:19,500
How they hated you?

830
01:03:21,569 --> 01:03:23,971
You were the family stain.

831
01:03:26,574 --> 01:03:28,677
What did you do to your family?

832
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:32,846
Gwen, do you remember?

833
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:39,253
(deafening sinister music)

834
01:03:42,557 --> 01:03:43,924
- No.

835
01:03:43,957 --> 01:03:47,928
(deafening sinister music)

836
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:50,598
No, no, no, no.

837
01:03:52,299 --> 01:03:53,467
No.

838
01:03:55,637 --> 01:03:59,006
Walton Grey killed my family.

839
01:04:02,544 --> 01:04:05,379
- There is no Walton Grey.

840
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:08,415
You made him up.

841
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:13,521
His name, it's an
anagram of your name,

842
01:04:15,923 --> 01:04:17,124
Gwen Taylor.

843
01:04:19,694 --> 01:04:21,596
He's a figment of
your imagination.

844
01:04:21,629 --> 01:04:24,365
(ominous music)

845
01:04:33,775 --> 01:04:37,378
(ominous music continues)

846
01:04:41,115 --> 01:04:42,983
You need your medication, Gwen.

847
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:45,452
You're not well.

848
01:04:53,862 --> 01:04:55,396
I uh,

849
01:04:55,429 --> 01:04:56,997
I called the hospital,

850
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,633
once I knew I'd found you.

851
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:09,577
See, the necklace. The necklace.

852
01:05:10,645 --> 01:05:12,012
Remember?

853
01:05:12,045 --> 01:05:13,515
You told me that you
wore it the night

854
01:05:13,548 --> 01:05:15,082
that you killed your family.

855
01:05:16,718 --> 01:05:20,154
You told me it was the only gift
that your mother ever gave you.

856
01:05:21,155 --> 01:05:22,624
Remember you telling me that?

857
01:05:22,657 --> 01:05:25,392
(ominous music)

858
01:05:34,101 --> 01:05:37,639
(ominous music continues)

859
01:05:37,672 --> 01:05:40,340
Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen,
Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen.

860
01:05:40,374 --> 01:05:43,010
Gwen, listen to me.
Listen to me, Gwen.

861
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:46,079
I need you to hand
me those scissors.

862
01:05:47,247 --> 01:05:51,553
Please, hand me the scissors.
Hand me the scissors.

863
01:05:52,754 --> 01:05:54,889
Gwen, put--

864
01:05:54,923 --> 01:05:57,659
(ominous music)

865
01:06:07,802 --> 01:06:10,003
- Open your fucking mouth.

866
01:06:13,675 --> 01:06:15,175
- You sure this is the place?

867
01:06:16,243 --> 01:06:18,646
- The All Tucked Inn.
That's what the doc said.

868
01:06:20,147 --> 01:06:23,116
- Well, maybe you
give them a call.

869
01:06:24,218 --> 01:06:27,589
This my motel is shit.

870
01:06:29,456 --> 01:06:32,192
(ominous music)

871
01:06:35,362 --> 01:06:39,433
- That's her. What
the hell is she doing?

872
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:42,202
(ominous music)

873
01:06:49,042 --> 01:06:52,847
(ominous music continues)

874
01:06:52,881 --> 01:06:54,248
- Come on, let's go.

875

(phone rattles)

887
01:08:37,018 --> 01:08:38,118

(door knob rattling)

898
01:09:41,883 --> 01:09:43,751
- [Gwen] Alice.

899
01:09:46,087 --> 01:09:47,220
Alice?

900
01:09:47,254 --> 01:09:50,825

I've been looking all

Wh, what, what were you doing
down in the pool?

952

<i>you now, sweetie?</i>

958
01:15:37,571 --> 01:15:39,173
- I just passed through Denning,

959
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:41,809
but I'm thinking I
should probably stop soon

960
01:15:41,842 --> 01:15:45,246
because I think I'm on
seven hours straight now.

961
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:50,651
There's a motel up ahead.
It's a popular spot.

973
01:16:59,153 --> 01:17:00,287
- [Cole] Hi.

974
01:17:00,321 --> 01:17:02,356
- Admiring our pool I see.

975
01:17:02,389 --> 01:17:03,624
- [Cole] Yeah.

976
01:17:03,657 --> 01:17:05,860
- Certainly is one of our
most impressive features.

977
01:17:05,893 --> 01:17:07,394
The guests just love it.

978
01:17:07,428 --> 01:17:10,231
- I bet. It's a... it's dope.

979
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,301
- You won't believe this,

980
01:17:14,335 --> 01:17:17,905
but last year we had a giant
sinkhole at the bottom.

981
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,609
- For real?

982
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:23,410
- Sucked the water right out.

983
01:17:23,444 --> 01:17:24,678
I mean, the hole was so big,

984
01:17:24,712 --> 01:17:29,416
you could fit five people
down there. (laughs)

985
01:17:30,651 --> 01:17:32,219
- No way.

01:17:32,253 --> 01:17:35,689

988
01:17:44,533 --> 01:17:47,134

989
01:17:48,936 --> 01:17:49,937

990
01:17:51,573 --> 01:17:54,008

991
01:18:01,415 --> 01:18:02,416

992
01:18:04,586 --> 01:18:06,521
Have you traveled far?

993
01:18:06,555 --> 01:18:07,955
- No, just out of state.

994
01:18:07,988 --> 01:18:11,225
Yeah, heading down to Ashford
for college, actually.

995
01:18:11,959 --> 01:18:14,328
You ever been to Ashford?

996
01:18:17,532 --> 01:18:18,966
